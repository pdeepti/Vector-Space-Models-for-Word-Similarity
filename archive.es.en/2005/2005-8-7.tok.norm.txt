program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 07.08.2005 schröder 's ambivalent european legacy 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and europe : it was not an easy relationship german chancellor schröder 's relationship with the eu has never been a love affair .
he acted pragmatically and not exactly squeamishly .
what traces has he left in european politics ? during his presumably last intimate fireside conversation with the press at the eu summit in brussels in june , the german chancellor became truly melancholy .
during his time in office , he matured into a convinced european , schröder told the correspondents who always accused the spd politician of being emotionally aloof .
he said he always remained a realist who kept his feet firmly on the european ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe was his soft spot : helmut kohl gerhard schröder wanted clearly to set himself apart from his predecessor , helmut kohl , who always reduced europe to the question of war and peace .
schröder , on the other hand , wanted to advance german interests in europe at the least possible cost .
helmut kohl was popular in brussels and famous for having a soft european heart and a fat check-book , which helped him settle many a difference .
schröder lacked this charitable streak . turning away from blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they were partners at first : blair -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder seven years ago , schröder came to brussels saying : we are somebody again and we want to reinforce our influence .
during the 1998 election campaign , he was still stressing that europe would not win anyone prizes in germany , let alone election votes .
in the course of his chancellorship , schröder came increasingly closer to french president jacques chirac and his european position as he moved away from his initial political partner tony blair , the british prime minister . schröder and chirac together put pressure on brussels and implemented many of their ideas , such as eastern enlargement and accession perspectives for turkey .
during an eu summit , schröder even stood in for chirac during a session , they even stayed at the same hotel .
eu diplomats were joking at the time that soon one would get to see the two guys hanging out , holding hands at the grande place in brussels . the schröder-chirac duo bildunterschrift : in 2002 , schröder and chirac single-handedly sealed the now controversial agrarian deal , which made the eu enlargement with 10 more states possible .
tony blair , who was against the compromise to start with , took his revenge by letting the last summit fall through .
by that time , schröder and chirac , weakened by their own internal political problems , could not assert themselves anymore . schröder is particularly rankled by blair 's victory .
now he speaks a lot and often about the " european project " that lies close to his heart .
it 's all about saving the european social model , since europe is more than just a functioning market . schröder 's poodle ? for schröder , europe was always a projection screen for populist attacks .
it all started at the beginning of his term with a failed attempt to save the tax-free shopping in eu waters .
it continued with the attacks on eu parliamentarians and their presumably high benefits . during the election campaign in north rhine-westphalia , the european directive on services in the internal market , which was initially supported by the german government , had to be sacrificed .
spd election campaigners equated low wages and tax dumping with the eu , although the german government itself had agreed to all these regulations in the council of ministers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's man in brussels : günter verheugen schröder always relied on his man in brussels , the german eu commissioner and fellow social democrat günter verheugen , who earned the reputation of being schröder 's " poodle " among some of his colleagues in the eu capital .
but the other commissioners also worked closely with their national governments .
schröder 's attempt to turn verheugen into a " super-commissioner " with several departments in the spring of 2004 was not successful .
he trumpeted his wish all too openly and undiplomatically . continue reading about why smaller member states talked about the german steamroller and how brussels reacted to schröder 's rejection of the iraq war . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery click here for dw-world 's in-depth look on elections 2005 .

he acted pragmatically and not exactly squeamishly .
what traces has he left in european politics ? during his presumably last intimate fireside conversation with the press at the eu summit in brussels in june , the german chancellor became truly melancholy .
during his time in office , he matured into a convinced european , schröder told the correspondents who always accused the spd politician of being emotionally aloof .
he said he always remained a realist who kept his feet firmly on the european ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe was his soft spot : helmut kohl gerhard schröder wanted clearly to set himself apart from his predecessor , helmut kohl , who always reduced europe to the question of war and peace .
schröder , on the other hand , wanted to advance german interests in europe at the least possible cost .
helmut kohl was popular in brussels and famous for having a soft european heart and a fat check-book , which helped him settle many a difference .
schröder lacked this charitable streak . turning away from blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they were partners at first : blair -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder seven years ago , schröder came to brussels saying : we are somebody again and we want to reinforce our influence .
during the 1998 election campaign , he was still stressing that europe would not win anyone prizes in germany , let alone election votes .
in the course of his chancellorship , schröder came increasingly closer to french president jacques chirac and his european position as he moved away from his initial political partner tony blair , the british prime minister . schröder and chirac together put pressure on brussels and implemented many of their ideas , such as eastern enlargement and accession perspectives for turkey .
during an eu summit , schröder even stood in for chirac during a session , they even stayed at the same hotel .
eu diplomats were joking at the time that soon one would get to see the two guys hanging out , holding hands at the grande place in brussels . the schröder-chirac duo bildunterschrift : in 2002 , schröder and chirac single-handedly sealed the now controversial agrarian deal , which made the eu enlargement with 10 more states possible .
tony blair , who was against the compromise to start with , took his revenge by letting the last summit fall through .
by that time , schröder and chirac , weakened by their own internal political problems , could not assert themselves anymore . schröder is particularly rankled by blair 's victory .
now he speaks a lot and often about the " european project " that lies close to his heart .
it 's all about saving the european social model , since europe is more than just a functioning market . schröder 's poodle ? for schröder , europe was always a projection screen for populist attacks .
it all started at the beginning of his term with a failed attempt to save the tax-free shopping in eu waters .
it continued with the attacks on eu parliamentarians and their presumably high benefits . during the election campaign in north rhine-westphalia , the european directive on services in the internal market , which was initially supported by the german government , had to be sacrificed .
spd election campaigners equated low wages and tax dumping with the eu , although the german government itself had agreed to all these regulations in the council of ministers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's man in brussels : günter verheugen schröder always relied on his man in brussels , the german eu commissioner and fellow social democrat günter verheugen , who earned the reputation of being schröder 's " poodle " among some of his colleagues in the eu capital .
but the other commissioners also worked closely with their national governments .
schröder 's attempt to turn verheugen into a " super-commissioner " with several departments in the spring of 2004 was not successful .

he acted pragmatically and not exactly squeamishly .
what traces has he left in european politics ? during his presumably last intimate fireside conversation with the press at the eu summit in brussels in june , the german chancellor became truly melancholy .
during his time in office , he matured into a convinced european , schröder told the correspondents who always accused the spd politician of being emotionally aloof .
he said he always remained a realist who kept his feet firmly on the european ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe was his soft spot : helmut kohl gerhard schröder wanted clearly to set himself apart from his predecessor , helmut kohl , who always reduced europe to the question of war and peace .
schröder , on the other hand , wanted to advance german interests in europe at the least possible cost .
helmut kohl was popular in brussels and famous for having a soft european heart and a fat check-book , which helped him settle many a difference .
schröder lacked this charitable streak . turning away from blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they were partners at first : blair -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder seven years ago , schröder came to brussels saying : we are somebody again and we want to reinforce our influence .
during the 1998 election campaign , he was still stressing that europe would not win anyone prizes in germany , let alone election votes .
in the course of his chancellorship , schröder came increasingly closer to french president jacques chirac and his european position as he moved away from his initial political partner tony blair , the british prime minister . schröder and chirac together put pressure on brussels and implemented many of their ideas , such as eastern enlargement and accession perspectives for turkey .
during an eu summit , schröder even stood in for chirac during a session , they even stayed at the same hotel .
eu diplomats were joking at the time that soon one would get to see the two guys hanging out , holding hands at the grande place in brussels . the schröder-chirac duo bildunterschrift : in 2002 , schröder and chirac single-handedly sealed the now controversial agrarian deal , which made the eu enlargement with 10 more states possible .
tony blair , who was against the compromise to start with , took his revenge by letting the last summit fall through .
by that time , schröder and chirac , weakened by their own internal political problems , could not assert themselves anymore . schröder is particularly rankled by blair 's victory .
now he speaks a lot and often about the " european project " that lies close to his heart .
it 's all about saving the european social model , since europe is more than just a functioning market . schröder 's poodle ? for schröder , europe was always a projection screen for populist attacks .
it all started at the beginning of his term with a failed attempt to save the tax-free shopping in eu waters .
it continued with the attacks on eu parliamentarians and their presumably high benefits . during the election campaign in north rhine-westphalia , the european directive on services in the internal market , which was initially supported by the german government , had to be sacrificed .
spd election campaigners equated low wages and tax dumping with the eu , although the german government itself had agreed to all these regulations in the council of ministers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's man in brussels : günter verheugen schröder always relied on his man in brussels , the german eu commissioner and fellow social democrat günter verheugen , who earned the reputation of being schröder 's " poodle " among some of his colleagues in the eu capital .
but the other commissioners also worked closely with their national governments .
schröder 's attempt to turn verheugen into a " super-commissioner " with several departments in the spring of 2004 was not successful .

he acted pragmatically and not exactly squeamishly .
what traces has he left in european politics ? during his presumably last intimate fireside conversation with the press at the eu summit in brussels in june , the german chancellor became truly melancholy .
during his time in office , he matured into a convinced european , schröder told the correspondents who always accused the spd politician of being emotionally aloof .
he said he always remained a realist who kept his feet firmly on the european ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe was his soft spot : helmut kohl gerhard schröder wanted clearly to set himself apart from his predecessor , helmut kohl , who always reduced europe to the question of war and peace .
schröder , on the other hand , wanted to advance german interests in europe at the least possible cost .
helmut kohl was popular in brussels and famous for having a soft european heart and a fat check-book , which helped him settle many a difference .
schröder lacked this charitable streak . turning away from blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they were partners at first : blair -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder seven years ago , schröder came to brussels saying : we are somebody again and we want to reinforce our influence .
during the 1998 election campaign , he was still stressing that europe would not win anyone prizes in germany , let alone election votes .
in the course of his chancellorship , schröder came increasingly closer to french president jacques chirac and his european position as he moved away from his initial political partner tony blair , the british prime minister . schröder and chirac together put pressure on brussels and implemented many of their ideas , such as eastern enlargement and accession perspectives for turkey .
during an eu summit , schröder even stood in for chirac during a session , they even stayed at the same hotel .
eu diplomats were joking at the time that soon one would get to see the two guys hanging out , holding hands at the grande place in brussels . the schröder-chirac duo bildunterschrift : in 2002 , schröder and chirac single-handedly sealed the now controversial agrarian deal , which made the eu enlargement with 10 more states possible .
tony blair , who was against the compromise to start with , took his revenge by letting the last summit fall through .
by that time , schröder and chirac , weakened by their own internal political problems , could not assert themselves anymore . schröder is particularly rankled by blair 's victory .
now he speaks a lot and often about the " european project " that lies close to his heart .
it 's all about saving the european social model , since europe is more than just a functioning market . schröder 's poodle ? for schröder , europe was always a projection screen for populist attacks .
it all started at the beginning of his term with a failed attempt to save the tax-free shopping in eu waters .
it continued with the attacks on eu parliamentarians and their presumably high benefits . during the election campaign in north rhine-westphalia , the european directive on services in the internal market , which was initially supported by the german government , had to be sacrificed .

without many top insider positions , the german government opted more for hit-and-run diplomacy , trying to affect decisions with spontaneous actions when it was already too late . schröder relied all too frequently on germany 's size and the weight of its votes in the eu .
smaller eu states sometimes spoke cattily of the german steamroller .
even the german economics minister , wolfgang clement , who sent the most representatives to eu , showed little interest in the eu councils for competitiveness and economics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt the chancellor 's role in the politics surrounding the iraq conflict has been received ambivalently in europe .
those who opposed the war , such as belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , have praised schröder for standing up to the americans and helping europe gain more self-confidence in the long run .
those eu members who are more loyal to the us have argued , on the other hand , that schröder 's rigid attitude has brought the union to the brink of an abyss .
the breakup of the eu seemed possible in february / march 2003 .
the division into bush-warriors and bush-opponents is still in effect . schröder 's limited power schröder 's years in brussels will also be remembered by the watering down of the stability and growth pact .
because german finance minister hans eichel could not satisfy the public debt criteria , he and his french colleagues decided to soften the criteria themselves . in the summer of 2004 , schröder already had to endure a sensitive defeat on the european stage .
he wanted to have the verhofstadt elected president of the european commission , most likely out of gratitude for the anti-bush " chocolate coalition " during the iraq war .
but the candidate was not accepted by the majority of conservative state and government heads .
this decision was engineered in the background by angela merkel , leader of the german christian democrats , who let schröder feel her own influence on the european level . bernd riegert -lrb- tt -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery click here for dw-world 's in-depth look on elections 2005 .

16 .
it 's also a chance for them to get to know different approaches to catholicism around the globe . the motto of this world youth day is " we have come to worship him . "
it 's a quote from the gospel according to matthew and the name of the event 's official song .
organizers expect 800,000 young people to converge on the cologne region for world youth day .
but it would n't be possible without the efforts of its volunteers . at the volunteer department at world youth day headquarters in cologne , marko schmitz and his coworkers attend to some 20,000 volunteers who have come to the city to be involved in this mega event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making sure that call center volunteers understand those seeking information " we make sure that volunteers with certain qualifications get certain jobs , so that the call center gets people who speak the right languages , that we find people with a driver 's license for a bus to drive the pilgrim groups around and so on , " he said . but it 's not just about getting the right volunteers to the right place .
the department also deals with issues like health insurance , spending money and accommodation . volunteers , not helpers the young people between the ages of 16 and 30 who have come here from all over the world want to be called " volunteers " and not " helpers . "
for they are not only assisting during the ten-day event , they are also actively involved in its development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne at night marko schmitz is also a volunteer although he 's been working on organizing world youth day much longer .
he 's one of 137 so-called long-term volunteers from 42 nations who have been in cologne since last august .
they deal with registering the pilgrims , public relations or also the liturgy preparations for the pope 's masses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world youth day in toronto , 2002 " i 'm in charge of the international liturgy group , which is composed of 150 young people from around the world , " said andrew liung , who comes from china .
" it will be on the main stage for the liturgies for the masses , the opening mass , the welcoming ceremony for the holy father , the vigil and the closing mass .
so they will be the servers , the readers , the people to bring up the gifts . " cultural and religious differences of course , cultural and religious differences become evident when a lot of people from all over the world come together .
christoph wild , the head of the volunteer department , gave an example . " the volunteers requested that we start our weekly meeting with a prayer , " he said .
" for us in germany , it 's somewhat unusual to start a working session by praying .
but in new zealand , if you work in church matters , it 's normal and so we put this wish into practice . " with its staff of 230 young men and women , the world youth day headquarters could be any medium-sized company .
but there is certainly not as much discussion and exchange in a regular business as there is in this international pool .
which songs will be sung at the services , which prayers read and how is religious belief conveyed at all ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians are regular guests at church conventions " for example , it was very interesting for people to see how openly we express our beliefs here , that it is n't a problem , " schmitz said .
" my french colleague told me that in france , for example , you ca n't do that because there is a strict division of church and state .
it 's the same here , actually , but the two coexist and that has astonished our foreign volunteers . " rubbing off on german churches ? veronika dickert works in the coordination and public relations department .
she said she finds it exciting to see the various ways people from different countries express their faith .
that eastern europeans go to church more regularly .
that the chinese practice their christianity more behind closed doors or that south americans sing and dance in church .
dickert said she wishes that some of these traditions were practiced in services in her home congregation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will world youth day in cologne be as cheerful as the one in toronto in 2002 ?
" south americans are a bit more spirited : they clap , sing and dance in mass , " she said .
" but i do n't have a problem with that .
i sometimes wish that were the case here , too .
that more is done to tailor church services to young people 's needs because that 's the only way to interest them for the church .
it 's really something completely different than when a priest simply stands at his pulpit and just preaches anything . " editor 's note : deutsche welle is an official media partner of world youth day . gaby reucher -lrb- sac / win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tight security for pope 's youth gathering hundreds of thousands of young people are expected to flock to cologne in august to celebrate world youth day .

but it would n't be possible without the efforts of its volunteers . at the volunteer department at world youth day headquarters in cologne , marko schmitz and his coworkers attend to some 20,000 volunteers who have come to the city to be involved in this mega event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making sure that call center volunteers understand those seeking information " we make sure that volunteers with certain qualifications get certain jobs , so that the call center gets people who speak the right languages , that we find people with a driver 's license for a bus to drive the pilgrim groups around and so on , " he said . but it 's not just about getting the right volunteers to the right place .
the department also deals with issues like health insurance , spending money and accommodation . volunteers , not helpers the young people between the ages of 16 and 30 who have come here from all over the world want to be called " volunteers " and not " helpers . "
for they are not only assisting during the ten-day event , they are also actively involved in its development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne at night marko schmitz is also a volunteer although he 's been working on organizing world youth day much longer .
he 's one of 137 so-called long-term volunteers from 42 nations who have been in cologne since last august .
they deal with registering the pilgrims , public relations or also the liturgy preparations for the pope 's masses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world youth day in toronto , 2002 " i 'm in charge of the international liturgy group , which is composed of 150 young people from around the world , " said andrew liung , who comes from china .
" it will be on the main stage for the liturgies for the masses , the opening mass , the welcoming ceremony for the holy father , the vigil and the closing mass .
so they will be the servers , the readers , the people to bring up the gifts . " cultural and religious differences of course , cultural and religious differences become evident when a lot of people from all over the world come together .
christoph wild , the head of the volunteer department , gave an example . " the volunteers requested that we start our weekly meeting with a prayer , " he said .
" for us in germany , it 's somewhat unusual to start a working session by praying .
but in new zealand , if you work in church matters , it 's normal and so we put this wish into practice . " with its staff of 230 young men and women , the world youth day headquarters could be any medium-sized company .
but there is certainly not as much discussion and exchange in a regular business as there is in this international pool .
which songs will be sung at the services , which prayers read and how is religious belief conveyed at all ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians are regular guests at church conventions " for example , it was very interesting for people to see how openly we express our beliefs here , that it is n't a problem , " schmitz said .
" my french colleague told me that in france , for example , you ca n't do that because there is a strict division of church and state .
it 's the same here , actually , but the two coexist and that has astonished our foreign volunteers . " rubbing off on german churches ? veronika dickert works in the coordination and public relations department .
she said she finds it exciting to see the various ways people from different countries express their faith .
that eastern europeans go to church more regularly .
that the chinese practice their christianity more behind closed doors or that south americans sing and dance in church .
dickert said she wishes that some of these traditions were practiced in services in her home congregation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will world youth day in cologne be as cheerful as the one in toronto in 2002 ?
" south americans are a bit more spirited : they clap , sing and dance in mass , " she said .
" but i do n't have a problem with that .
i sometimes wish that were the case here , too .
that more is done to tailor church services to young people 's needs because that 's the only way to interest them for the church .
it 's really something completely different than when a priest simply stands at his pulpit and just preaches anything .

he acted pragmatically and not exactly squeamishly .
what traces has he left in european politics ? during his presumably last intimate fireside conversation with the press at the eu summit in brussels in june , the german chancellor became truly melancholy .
during his time in office , he matured into a convinced european , schröder told the correspondents who always accused the spd politician of being emotionally aloof .
he said he always remained a realist who kept his feet firmly on the european ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe was his soft spot : helmut kohl gerhard schröder wanted clearly to set himself apart from his predecessor , helmut kohl , who always reduced europe to the question of war and peace .
schröder , on the other hand , wanted to advance german interests in europe at the least possible cost .
helmut kohl was popular in brussels and famous for having a soft european heart and a fat check-book , which helped him settle many a difference .
schröder lacked this charitable streak . turning away from blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they were partners at first : blair -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder seven years ago , schröder came to brussels saying : we are somebody again and we want to reinforce our influence .
during the 1998 election campaign , he was still stressing that europe would not win anyone prizes in germany , let alone election votes .
in the course of his chancellorship , schröder came increasingly closer to french president jacques chirac and his european position as he moved away from his initial political partner tony blair , the british prime minister . schröder and chirac together put pressure on brussels and implemented many of their ideas , such as eastern enlargement and accession perspectives for turkey .
during an eu summit , schröder even stood in for chirac during a session , they even stayed at the same hotel .
eu diplomats were joking at the time that soon one would get to see the two guys hanging out , holding hands at the grande place in brussels . the schröder-chirac duo bildunterschrift : in 2002 , schröder and chirac single-handedly sealed the now controversial agrarian deal , which made the eu enlargement with 10 more states possible .
tony blair , who was against the compromise to start with , took his revenge by letting the last summit fall through .
by that time , schröder and chirac , weakened by their own internal political problems , could not assert themselves anymore . schröder is particularly rankled by blair 's victory .
now he speaks a lot and often about the " european project " that lies close to his heart .
it 's all about saving the european social model , since europe is more than just a functioning market . schröder 's poodle ? for schröder , europe was always a projection screen for populist attacks .
it all started at the beginning of his term with a failed attempt to save the tax-free shopping in eu waters .
it continued with the attacks on eu parliamentarians and their presumably high benefits . during the election campaign in north rhine-westphalia , the european directive on services in the internal market , which was initially supported by the german government , had to be sacrificed .
spd election campaigners equated low wages and tax dumping with the eu , although the german government itself had agreed to all these regulations in the council of ministers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's man in brussels : günter verheugen schröder always relied on his man in brussels , the german eu commissioner and fellow social democrat günter verheugen , who earned the reputation of being schröder 's " poodle " among some of his colleagues in the eu capital .
but the other commissioners also worked closely with their national governments .
schröder 's attempt to turn verheugen into a " super-commissioner " with several departments in the spring of 2004 was not successful .
he trumpeted his wish all too openly and undiplomatically . continue reading about why smaller member states talked about the german steamroller and how brussels reacted to schröder 's rejection of the iraq war . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery click here for dw-world 's in-depth look on elections 2005 .

without many top insider positions , the german government opted more for hit-and-run diplomacy , trying to affect decisions with spontaneous actions when it was already too late . schröder relied all too frequently on germany 's size and the weight of its votes in the eu .
smaller eu states sometimes spoke cattily of the german steamroller .
even the german economics minister , wolfgang clement , who sent the most representatives to eu , showed little interest in the eu councils for competitiveness and economics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt the chancellor 's role in the politics surrounding the iraq conflict has been received ambivalently in europe .
those who opposed the war , such as belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , have praised schröder for standing up to the americans and helping europe gain more self-confidence in the long run .
those eu members who are more loyal to the us have argued , on the other hand , that schröder 's rigid attitude has brought the union to the brink of an abyss .
the breakup of the eu seemed possible in february / march 2003 .
the division into bush-warriors and bush-opponents is still in effect . schröder 's limited power schröder 's years in brussels will also be remembered by the watering down of the stability and growth pact .
because german finance minister hans eichel could not satisfy the public debt criteria , he and his french colleagues decided to soften the criteria themselves . in the summer of 2004 , schröder already had to endure a sensitive defeat on the european stage .
he wanted to have the verhofstadt elected president of the european commission , most likely out of gratitude for the anti-bush " chocolate coalition " during the iraq war .
but the candidate was not accepted by the majority of conservative state and government heads .

either way , the sound that emanates from what looks a bit like a fridge is unlikely to evoke a feeling of comfort or calm in anyone listening to it the first time . yet this machine may hold the key in the search for new ways of treating people suffering from depression . the procedure is called " transcranial magnetic stimulation , " or tms .
and it could be used to treat patients who do n't respond to traditional forms of therapy , which commonly involve a combination of psycho-therapy and medication .
it is thought that patients might respond to a therapy which goes deeper into the brain to stimulate it .
tms is just such a therapy . this non-invasive method works by creating a very strong magnetic field which stimulates different regions of the brain .
brainchemistry out of balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists still do n't know exactly what is wrong in the brain of people who suffer from mental illnesses .
they suspect that some kind of chemical imbalance is involved which may result in higher activity in some parts of the brain while it may be less than normal in others .
the idea is to stimulate the latter in an attempt to redress the balance in activity levels .
a part of the brain called the limbic system is of particular interest to professor schläpfer . " it is responsible for the mediation of mood effects in the brain , " he said . " one very important region is the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex . "
in people with depression , this region is less active than in healthy individuals .
" we know that if we have effects on this region we can treat the bad effects of major depression , " schläpfer said .
for treatment a butterfly-shaped coil attached to the machine is held close to the patient 's head , where it administers the magnetic stimuli - two second-long trains of short impulses during intervals of about 30 seconds . the whole procedure lasts about half an hour .
during treatment the patients are sitting in a chair and are usually awake .
the only thing they feel is their muscles twitching , which is not painful .
some say they can feel something going on in their brain .
but thomas schläpfer ca n't yet say for sure whether the sensation is real or just a placebo effect . other therapies to stimulate the brain there are other and older methods for stimulating the brain .
one of these is electro-convulsive therapy .
it involves inducing a seizure in the brain , using an electric current . this is an accepted method in extreme cases .
but there are some negative side effects .
" it has long been known that electro-convulsive therapy has at least transient effects on the memory , " said michael wagner , a psychiatrist . tms in comparison performs much better .
" transcranial magnetic stimulation had no effect or even improved the memory , " wagner said .
however , as psychiatrists at the university of munich report , tms may have other side effects and possibly increase the risk of epileptic fits .
as yet it 's not clear exactly how long the positive effects achieved with tms last beyond treatment .
according to the scientists from the university of munich the effect subsides within only a few days or weeks after treatment is discontinued .
however , the situation improves significantly if patients are put on medication during and after tms treatment , the scientists say .
a step forward in the fight against a severe disorder that 's why tms looks like a step in the right direction .
professor schäpfner and his team at bonn have already started to improve the method .
they believe that tms could be used to even induce therapeutic seizures using tmc .
these could be more effective than the basic form of transcranial magnetic stimulation and have fewer side effects than traditional electroconvulsive therapy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schläpfer said the search for new treatments must go on .
" major depression is a very severe and potentially deadly disorder .
18 percent of the patients die , mainly through suicide , " he said .
" they are not able to experience joy anymore .
they can not work any more and lose their family , their social functions . "
tms is still very new and not yet widely used .
but already about 20 groups worldwide are engaged in research on tms and the researchers hope that the new treatment could soon help many people beat depression . christiane wolters -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berliners get the blues a new report shows that not only is depression on the rise in germany , but berliners are the most miserable of all .

to treat the condition , scientists at the university of bonn are exploring new ways to stimulate the brain . " ratatatat ... ratatatat " - the loud banging noise in professor thomas schläpfer 's laboratory at the university of bonn does not sound too different from that of a pneumatic drill or possibly a machine gun .
either way , the sound that emanates from what looks a bit like a fridge is unlikely to evoke a feeling of comfort or calm in anyone listening to it the first time . yet this machine may hold the key in the search for new ways of treating people suffering from depression . the procedure is called " transcranial magnetic stimulation , " or tms .
and it could be used to treat patients who do n't respond to traditional forms of therapy , which commonly involve a combination of psycho-therapy and medication .
it is thought that patients might respond to a therapy which goes deeper into the brain to stimulate it .
tms is just such a therapy . this non-invasive method works by creating a very strong magnetic field which stimulates different regions of the brain .
brainchemistry out of balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists still do n't know exactly what is wrong in the brain of people who suffer from mental illnesses .
they suspect that some kind of chemical imbalance is involved which may result in higher activity in some parts of the brain while it may be less than normal in others .
the idea is to stimulate the latter in an attempt to redress the balance in activity levels .
a part of the brain called the limbic system is of particular interest to professor schläpfer . " it is responsible for the mediation of mood effects in the brain , " he said . " one very important region is the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex . "
in people with depression , this region is less active than in healthy individuals .
" we know that if we have effects on this region we can treat the bad effects of major depression , " schläpfer said .
for treatment a butterfly-shaped coil attached to the machine is held close to the patient 's head , where it administers the magnetic stimuli - two second-long trains of short impulses during intervals of about 30 seconds . the whole procedure lasts about half an hour .
during treatment the patients are sitting in a chair and are usually awake .
the only thing they feel is their muscles twitching , which is not painful .
some say they can feel something going on in their brain .
but thomas schläpfer ca n't yet say for sure whether the sensation is real or just a placebo effect . other therapies to stimulate the brain there are other and older methods for stimulating the brain .
one of these is electro-convulsive therapy .
it involves inducing a seizure in the brain , using an electric current . this is an accepted method in extreme cases .
but there are some negative side effects .
" it has long been known that electro-convulsive therapy has at least transient effects on the memory , " said michael wagner , a psychiatrist . tms in comparison performs much better .
" transcranial magnetic stimulation had no effect or even improved the memory , " wagner said .
however , as psychiatrists at the university of munich report , tms may have other side effects and possibly increase the risk of epileptic fits .
as yet it 's not clear exactly how long the positive effects achieved with tms last beyond treatment .

to modern germans , the ancient roman border is now another cultural heritage site . germany can celebrate its fair share of cultural highlights but recently one of those sites has been elevated to the status reserved for those of globally recognized importance .
the german section of the border line of the roman empire , part of what is known as the " roman limes , " has been honored by the world heritage committee of unesco . the ancient section dating back to the 2nd century , which stretches for 542 kilometers from the region around koblenz in the current state of rhineland-palatinate , through hesse and baden-württemberg to regensburg in bavaria , is part of a border that stretched 5,000 kilometers -lrb- 3,100 miles -rrb- from the atlantic coast of northern britain , through europe to the black sea , and from there to the red sea and across north africa to the atlantic coast . the barrier that signaled the extent of the roman empire at its largest consists of remains of built walls , ditches , forts , fortresses , and watch towers which have survived the passage of time , war and the fall of the empire that it was built to protect . bildunterschrift : at its most splendid , the border was enforced by ramparts , walls and ditches , close to 900 watchtowers , 60 forts , and civilian settlements , which accommodated tradesmen , craftsmen and others who serviced the military . it completely separated the continent and kept the roman contingent in what is present-day germany protected from germanic barbarians . border finally breached by germanic barbarians the border was the brainchild of the emperor domitian -lrb- 81-96 a.d. -rrb- .

there are many reconstructions , information points and footpaths connected to the history of the limes along the old border , making a visit feel like a real step into the past . for those visitors who pride themselves on their personal fitness , it is possible to cycle the length of the border on the specially constructed limes cycle track which takes in sedate flat areas and demanding hills .

he acted pragmatically and not exactly squeamishly .
what traces has he left in european politics ? during his presumably last intimate fireside conversation with the press at the eu summit in brussels in june , the german chancellor became truly melancholy .
during his time in office , he matured into a convinced european , schröder told the correspondents who always accused the spd politician of being emotionally aloof .
he said he always remained a realist who kept his feet firmly on the european ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe was his soft spot : helmut kohl gerhard schröder wanted clearly to set himself apart from his predecessor , helmut kohl , who always reduced europe to the question of war and peace .
schröder , on the other hand , wanted to advance german interests in europe at the least possible cost .
helmut kohl was popular in brussels and famous for having a soft european heart and a fat check-book , which helped him settle many a difference .
schröder lacked this charitable streak . turning away from blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they were partners at first : blair -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder seven years ago , schröder came to brussels saying : we are somebody again and we want to reinforce our influence .
during the 1998 election campaign , he was still stressing that europe would not win anyone prizes in germany , let alone election votes .
in the course of his chancellorship , schröder came increasingly closer to french president jacques chirac and his european position as he moved away from his initial political partner tony blair , the british prime minister . schröder and chirac together put pressure on brussels and implemented many of their ideas , such as eastern enlargement and accession perspectives for turkey .
during an eu summit , schröder even stood in for chirac during a session , they even stayed at the same hotel .
eu diplomats were joking at the time that soon one would get to see the two guys hanging out , holding hands at the grande place in brussels . the schröder-chirac duo bildunterschrift : in 2002 , schröder and chirac single-handedly sealed the now controversial agrarian deal , which made the eu enlargement with 10 more states possible .
tony blair , who was against the compromise to start with , took his revenge by letting the last summit fall through .
by that time , schröder and chirac , weakened by their own internal political problems , could not assert themselves anymore . schröder is particularly rankled by blair 's victory .
now he speaks a lot and often about the " european project " that lies close to his heart .
it 's all about saving the european social model , since europe is more than just a functioning market . schröder 's poodle ? for schröder , europe was always a projection screen for populist attacks .
it all started at the beginning of his term with a failed attempt to save the tax-free shopping in eu waters .
it continued with the attacks on eu parliamentarians and their presumably high benefits . during the election campaign in north rhine-westphalia , the european directive on services in the internal market , which was initially supported by the german government , had to be sacrificed .
spd election campaigners equated low wages and tax dumping with the eu , although the german government itself had agreed to all these regulations in the council of ministers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's man in brussels : günter verheugen schröder always relied on his man in brussels , the german eu commissioner and fellow social democrat günter verheugen , who earned the reputation of being schröder 's " poodle " among some of his colleagues in the eu capital .
but the other commissioners also worked closely with their national governments .
schröder 's attempt to turn verheugen into a " super-commissioner " with several departments in the spring of 2004 was not successful .
he trumpeted his wish all too openly and undiplomatically . continue reading about why smaller member states talked about the german steamroller and how brussels reacted to schröder 's rejection of the iraq war . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the road to the chancellery click here for dw-world 's in-depth look on elections 2005 .

16 .
it 's also a chance for them to get to know different approaches to catholicism around the globe . the motto of this world youth day is " we have come to worship him . "
it 's a quote from the gospel according to matthew and the name of the event 's official song .
organizers expect 800,000 young people to converge on the cologne region for world youth day .
but it would n't be possible without the efforts of its volunteers . at the volunteer department at world youth day headquarters in cologne , marko schmitz and his coworkers attend to some 20,000 volunteers who have come to the city to be involved in this mega event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making sure that call center volunteers understand those seeking information " we make sure that volunteers with certain qualifications get certain jobs , so that the call center gets people who speak the right languages , that we find people with a driver 's license for a bus to drive the pilgrim groups around and so on , " he said . but it 's not just about getting the right volunteers to the right place .
the department also deals with issues like health insurance , spending money and accommodation . volunteers , not helpers the young people between the ages of 16 and 30 who have come here from all over the world want to be called " volunteers " and not " helpers . "
for they are not only assisting during the ten-day event , they are also actively involved in its development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne at night marko schmitz is also a volunteer although he 's been working on organizing world youth day much longer .
he 's one of 137 so-called long-term volunteers from 42 nations who have been in cologne since last august .
they deal with registering the pilgrims , public relations or also the liturgy preparations for the pope 's masses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world youth day in toronto , 2002 " i 'm in charge of the international liturgy group , which is composed of 150 young people from around the world , " said andrew liung , who comes from china .
" it will be on the main stage for the liturgies for the masses , the opening mass , the welcoming ceremony for the holy father , the vigil and the closing mass .
so they will be the servers , the readers , the people to bring up the gifts . " cultural and religious differences of course , cultural and religious differences become evident when a lot of people from all over the world come together .

the department also deals with issues like health insurance , spending money and accommodation . volunteers , not helpers the young people between the ages of 16 and 30 who have come here from all over the world want to be called " volunteers " and not " helpers . "
for they are not only assisting during the ten-day event , they are also actively involved in its development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne at night marko schmitz is also a volunteer although he 's been working on organizing world youth day much longer .
he 's one of 137 so-called long-term volunteers from 42 nations who have been in cologne since last august .
they deal with registering the pilgrims , public relations or also the liturgy preparations for the pope 's masses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world youth day in toronto , 2002 " i 'm in charge of the international liturgy group , which is composed of 150 young people from around the world , " said andrew liung , who comes from china .
" it will be on the main stage for the liturgies for the masses , the opening mass , the welcoming ceremony for the holy father , the vigil and the closing mass .
so they will be the servers , the readers , the people to bring up the gifts . " cultural and religious differences of course , cultural and religious differences become evident when a lot of people from all over the world come together .
christoph wild , the head of the volunteer department , gave an example . " the volunteers requested that we start our weekly meeting with a prayer , " he said .
" for us in germany , it 's somewhat unusual to start a working session by praying .
but in new zealand , if you work in church matters , it 's normal and so we put this wish into practice . " with its staff of 230 young men and women , the world youth day headquarters could be any medium-sized company .
but there is certainly not as much discussion and exchange in a regular business as there is in this international pool .
which songs will be sung at the services , which prayers read and how is religious belief conveyed at all ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians are regular guests at church conventions " for example , it was very interesting for people to see how openly we express our beliefs here , that it is n't a problem , " schmitz said .
" my french colleague told me that in france , for example , you ca n't do that because there is a strict division of church and state .
it 's the same here , actually , but the two coexist and that has astonished our foreign volunteers . " rubbing off on german churches ? veronika dickert works in the coordination and public relations department .
she said she finds it exciting to see the various ways people from different countries express their faith .
that eastern europeans go to church more regularly .
that the chinese practice their christianity more behind closed doors or that south americans sing and dance in church .
dickert said she wishes that some of these traditions were practiced in services in her home congregation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will world youth day in cologne be as cheerful as the one in toronto in 2002 ?
" south americans are a bit more spirited : they clap , sing and dance in mass , " she said .
" but i do n't have a problem with that .
i sometimes wish that were the case here , too .
that more is done to tailor church services to young people 's needs because that 's the only way to interest them for the church .
it 's really something completely different than when a priest simply stands at his pulpit and just preaches anything .

he acted pragmatically and not exactly squeamishly .
what traces has he left in european politics ? during his presumably last intimate fireside conversation with the press at the eu summit in brussels in june , the german chancellor became truly melancholy .
during his time in office , he matured into a convinced european , schröder told the correspondents who always accused the spd politician of being emotionally aloof .
he said he always remained a realist who kept his feet firmly on the european ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe was his soft spot : helmut kohl gerhard schröder wanted clearly to set himself apart from his predecessor , helmut kohl , who always reduced europe to the question of war and peace .
schröder , on the other hand , wanted to advance german interests in europe at the least possible cost .
helmut kohl was popular in brussels and famous for having a soft european heart and a fat check-book , which helped him settle many a difference .
schröder lacked this charitable streak . turning away from blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they were partners at first : blair -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder seven years ago , schröder came to brussels saying : we are somebody again and we want to reinforce our influence .
during the 1998 election campaign , he was still stressing that europe would not win anyone prizes in germany , let alone election votes .
in the course of his chancellorship , schröder came increasingly closer to french president jacques chirac and his european position as he moved away from his initial political partner tony blair , the british prime minister . schröder and chirac together put pressure on brussels and implemented many of their ideas , such as eastern enlargement and accession perspectives for turkey .
during an eu summit , schröder even stood in for chirac during a session , they even stayed at the same hotel .

tony blair , who was against the compromise to start with , took his revenge by letting the last summit fall through .
by that time , schröder and chirac , weakened by their own internal political problems , could not assert themselves anymore . schröder is particularly rankled by blair 's victory .
now he speaks a lot and often about the " european project " that lies close to his heart .
it 's all about saving the european social model , since europe is more than just a functioning market . schröder 's poodle ? for schröder , europe was always a projection screen for populist attacks .
it all started at the beginning of his term with a failed attempt to save the tax-free shopping in eu waters .
it continued with the attacks on eu parliamentarians and their presumably high benefits . during the election campaign in north rhine-westphalia , the european directive on services in the internal market , which was initially supported by the german government , had to be sacrificed .
spd election campaigners equated low wages and tax dumping with the eu , although the german government itself had agreed to all these regulations in the council of ministers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's man in brussels : günter verheugen schröder always relied on his man in brussels , the german eu commissioner and fellow social democrat günter verheugen , who earned the reputation of being schröder 's " poodle " among some of his colleagues in the eu capital .
but the other commissioners also worked closely with their national governments .

what traces has he left in european politics ? during his presumably last intimate fireside conversation with the press at the eu summit in brussels in june , the german chancellor became truly melancholy .

without many top insider positions , the german government opted more for hit-and-run diplomacy , trying to affect decisions with spontaneous actions when it was already too late . schröder relied all too frequently on germany 's size and the weight of its votes in the eu .
smaller eu states sometimes spoke cattily of the german steamroller .
even the german economics minister , wolfgang clement , who sent the most representatives to eu , showed little interest in the eu councils for competitiveness and economics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt the chancellor 's role in the politics surrounding the iraq conflict has been received ambivalently in europe .
those who opposed the war , such as belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , have praised schröder for standing up to the americans and helping europe gain more self-confidence in the long run .
those eu members who are more loyal to the us have argued , on the other hand , that schröder 's rigid attitude has brought the union to the brink of an abyss .
the breakup of the eu seemed possible in february / march 2003 .
the division into bush-warriors and bush-opponents is still in effect . schröder 's limited power schröder 's years in brussels will also be remembered by the watering down of the stability and growth pact .
because german finance minister hans eichel could not satisfy the public debt criteria , he and his french colleagues decided to soften the criteria themselves . in the summer of 2004 , schröder already had to endure a sensitive defeat on the european stage .

16 .
it 's also a chance for them to get to know different approaches to catholicism around the globe . the motto of this world youth day is " we have come to worship him . "
it 's a quote from the gospel according to matthew and the name of the event 's official song .
organizers expect 800,000 young people to converge on the cologne region for world youth day .
but it would n't be possible without the efforts of its volunteers . at the volunteer department at world youth day headquarters in cologne , marko schmitz and his coworkers attend to some 20,000 volunteers who have come to the city to be involved in this mega event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making sure that call center volunteers understand those seeking information " we make sure that volunteers with certain qualifications get certain jobs , so that the call center gets people who speak the right languages , that we find people with a driver 's license for a bus to drive the pilgrim groups around and so on , " he said . but it 's not just about getting the right volunteers to the right place .
the department also deals with issues like health insurance , spending money and accommodation . volunteers , not helpers the young people between the ages of 16 and 30 who have come here from all over the world want to be called " volunteers " and not " helpers . "
for they are not only assisting during the ten-day event , they are also actively involved in its development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne at night marko schmitz is also a volunteer although he 's been working on organizing world youth day much longer .
he 's one of 137 so-called long-term volunteers from 42 nations who have been in cologne since last august .
they deal with registering the pilgrims , public relations or also the liturgy preparations for the pope 's masses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world youth day in toronto , 2002 " i 'm in charge of the international liturgy group , which is composed of 150 young people from around the world , " said andrew liung , who comes from china .
" it will be on the main stage for the liturgies for the masses , the opening mass , the welcoming ceremony for the holy father , the vigil and the closing mass .
so they will be the servers , the readers , the people to bring up the gifts . " cultural and religious differences of course , cultural and religious differences become evident when a lot of people from all over the world come together .
christoph wild , the head of the volunteer department , gave an example . " the volunteers requested that we start our weekly meeting with a prayer , " he said .
" for us in germany , it 's somewhat unusual to start a working session by praying .
but in new zealand , if you work in church matters , it 's normal and so we put this wish into practice . " with its staff of 230 young men and women , the world youth day headquarters could be any medium-sized company .
but there is certainly not as much discussion and exchange in a regular business as there is in this international pool .
which songs will be sung at the services , which prayers read and how is religious belief conveyed at all ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians are regular guests at church conventions " for example , it was very interesting for people to see how openly we express our beliefs here , that it is n't a problem , " schmitz said .
" my french colleague told me that in france , for example , you ca n't do that because there is a strict division of church and state .
it 's the same here , actually , but the two coexist and that has astonished our foreign volunteers . " rubbing off on german churches ? veronika dickert works in the coordination and public relations department .
she said she finds it exciting to see the various ways people from different countries express their faith .
that eastern europeans go to church more regularly .
that the chinese practice their christianity more behind closed doors or that south americans sing and dance in church .
dickert said she wishes that some of these traditions were practiced in services in her home congregation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will world youth day in cologne be as cheerful as the one in toronto in 2002 ?
" south americans are a bit more spirited : they clap , sing and dance in mass , " she said .
" but i do n't have a problem with that .
i sometimes wish that were the case here , too .
that more is done to tailor church services to young people 's needs because that 's the only way to interest them for the church .
it 's really something completely different than when a priest simply stands at his pulpit and just preaches anything .

16 .
it 's also a chance for them to get to know different approaches to catholicism around the globe . the motto of this world youth day is " we have come to worship him . "
it 's a quote from the gospel according to matthew and the name of the event 's official song .
organizers expect 800,000 young people to converge on the cologne region for world youth day .
but it would n't be possible without the efforts of its volunteers . at the volunteer department at world youth day headquarters in cologne , marko schmitz and his coworkers attend to some 20,000 volunteers who have come to the city to be involved in this mega event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making sure that call center volunteers understand those seeking information " we make sure that volunteers with certain qualifications get certain jobs , so that the call center gets people who speak the right languages , that we find people with a driver 's license for a bus to drive the pilgrim groups around and so on , " he said . but it 's not just about getting the right volunteers to the right place .
the department also deals with issues like health insurance , spending money and accommodation . volunteers , not helpers the young people between the ages of 16 and 30 who have come here from all over the world want to be called " volunteers " and not " helpers . "
for they are not only assisting during the ten-day event , they are also actively involved in its development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne at night marko schmitz is also a volunteer although he 's been working on organizing world youth day much longer .
he 's one of 137 so-called long-term volunteers from 42 nations who have been in cologne since last august .
they deal with registering the pilgrims , public relations or also the liturgy preparations for the pope 's masses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world youth day in toronto , 2002 " i 'm in charge of the international liturgy group , which is composed of 150 young people from around the world , " said andrew liung , who comes from china .
" it will be on the main stage for the liturgies for the masses , the opening mass , the welcoming ceremony for the holy father , the vigil and the closing mass .
so they will be the servers , the readers , the people to bring up the gifts . " cultural and religious differences of course , cultural and religious differences become evident when a lot of people from all over the world come together .
christoph wild , the head of the volunteer department , gave an example . " the volunteers requested that we start our weekly meeting with a prayer , " he said .
" for us in germany , it 's somewhat unusual to start a working session by praying .
but in new zealand , if you work in church matters , it 's normal and so we put this wish into practice . " with its staff of 230 young men and women , the world youth day headquarters could be any medium-sized company .
but there is certainly not as much discussion and exchange in a regular business as there is in this international pool .
which songs will be sung at the services , which prayers read and how is religious belief conveyed at all ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians are regular guests at church conventions " for example , it was very interesting for people to see how openly we express our beliefs here , that it is n't a problem , " schmitz said .
" my french colleague told me that in france , for example , you ca n't do that because there is a strict division of church and state .
it 's the same here , actually , but the two coexist and that has astonished our foreign volunteers . " rubbing off on german churches ? veronika dickert works in the coordination and public relations department .
she said she finds it exciting to see the various ways people from different countries express their faith .
that eastern europeans go to church more regularly .
that the chinese practice their christianity more behind closed doors or that south americans sing and dance in church .
dickert said she wishes that some of these traditions were practiced in services in her home congregation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will world youth day in cologne be as cheerful as the one in toronto in 2002 ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.08.2005 new help against major depression ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists may have found a new solution for the blues many sufferers of depression do not respond to drugs .
to treat the condition , scientists at the university of bonn are exploring new ways to stimulate the brain . " ratatatat ... ratatatat " - the loud banging noise in professor thomas schläpfer 's laboratory at the university of bonn does not sound too different from that of a pneumatic drill or possibly a machine gun .
either way , the sound that emanates from what looks a bit like a fridge is unlikely to evoke a feeling of comfort or calm in anyone listening to it the first time . yet this machine may hold the key in the search for new ways of treating people suffering from depression . the procedure is called " transcranial magnetic stimulation , " or tms .
and it could be used to treat patients who do n't respond to traditional forms of therapy , which commonly involve a combination of psycho-therapy and medication .
it is thought that patients might respond to a therapy which goes deeper into the brain to stimulate it .
tms is just such a therapy . this non-invasive method works by creating a very strong magnetic field which stimulates different regions of the brain .
brainchemistry out of balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists still do n't know exactly what is wrong in the brain of people who suffer from mental illnesses .
they suspect that some kind of chemical imbalance is involved which may result in higher activity in some parts of the brain while it may be less than normal in others .
the idea is to stimulate the latter in an attempt to redress the balance in activity levels .
a part of the brain called the limbic system is of particular interest to professor schläpfer . " it is responsible for the mediation of mood effects in the brain , " he said . " one very important region is the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex . "
in people with depression , this region is less active than in healthy individuals .
" we know that if we have effects on this region we can treat the bad effects of major depression , " schläpfer said .
for treatment a butterfly-shaped coil attached to the machine is held close to the patient 's head , where it administers the magnetic stimuli - two second-long trains of short impulses during intervals of about 30 seconds . the whole procedure lasts about half an hour .
during treatment the patients are sitting in a chair and are usually awake .
the only thing they feel is their muscles twitching , which is not painful .
some say they can feel something going on in their brain .
but thomas schläpfer ca n't yet say for sure whether the sensation is real or just a placebo effect . other therapies to stimulate the brain there are other and older methods for stimulating the brain .
one of these is electro-convulsive therapy .
it involves inducing a seizure in the brain , using an electric current . this is an accepted method in extreme cases .
but there are some negative side effects .
" it has long been known that electro-convulsive therapy has at least transient effects on the memory , " said michael wagner , a psychiatrist . tms in comparison performs much better .
" transcranial magnetic stimulation had no effect or even improved the memory , " wagner said .
however , as psychiatrists at the university of munich report , tms may have other side effects and possibly increase the risk of epileptic fits .
as yet it 's not clear exactly how long the positive effects achieved with tms last beyond treatment .
according to the scientists from the university of munich the effect subsides within only a few days or weeks after treatment is discontinued .
however , the situation improves significantly if patients are put on medication during and after tms treatment , the scientists say .
a step forward in the fight against a severe disorder that 's why tms looks like a step in the right direction .
professor schäpfner and his team at bonn have already started to improve the method .
they believe that tms could be used to even induce therapeutic seizures using tmc .
these could be more effective than the basic form of transcranial magnetic stimulation and have fewer side effects than traditional electroconvulsive therapy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schläpfer said the search for new treatments must go on .
" major depression is a very severe and potentially deadly disorder .
18 percent of the patients die , mainly through suicide , " he said .
" they are not able to experience joy anymore .
they can not work any more and lose their family , their social functions . "
tms is still very new and not yet widely used .
but already about 20 groups worldwide are engaged in research on tms and the researchers hope that the new treatment could soon help many people beat depression . christiane wolters -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berliners get the blues a new report shows that not only is depression on the rise in germany , but berliners are the most miserable of all .

to treat the condition , scientists at the university of bonn are exploring new ways to stimulate the brain . " ratatatat ... ratatatat " - the loud banging noise in professor thomas schläpfer 's laboratory at the university of bonn does not sound too different from that of a pneumatic drill or possibly a machine gun .
either way , the sound that emanates from what looks a bit like a fridge is unlikely to evoke a feeling of comfort or calm in anyone listening to it the first time . yet this machine may hold the key in the search for new ways of treating people suffering from depression . the procedure is called " transcranial magnetic stimulation , " or tms .
and it could be used to treat patients who do n't respond to traditional forms of therapy , which commonly involve a combination of psycho-therapy and medication .
it is thought that patients might respond to a therapy which goes deeper into the brain to stimulate it .
tms is just such a therapy . this non-invasive method works by creating a very strong magnetic field which stimulates different regions of the brain .
brainchemistry out of balance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists still do n't know exactly what is wrong in the brain of people who suffer from mental illnesses .
they suspect that some kind of chemical imbalance is involved which may result in higher activity in some parts of the brain while it may be less than normal in others .
the idea is to stimulate the latter in an attempt to redress the balance in activity levels .
a part of the brain called the limbic system is of particular interest to professor schläpfer . " it is responsible for the mediation of mood effects in the brain , " he said . " one very important region is the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex . "
in people with depression , this region is less active than in healthy individuals .
" we know that if we have effects on this region we can treat the bad effects of major depression , " schläpfer said .
for treatment a butterfly-shaped coil attached to the machine is held close to the patient 's head , where it administers the magnetic stimuli - two second-long trains of short impulses during intervals of about 30 seconds . the whole procedure lasts about half an hour .
during treatment the patients are sitting in a chair and are usually awake .
the only thing they feel is their muscles twitching , which is not painful .
some say they can feel something going on in their brain .
but thomas schläpfer ca n't yet say for sure whether the sensation is real or just a placebo effect . other therapies to stimulate the brain there are other and older methods for stimulating the brain .
one of these is electro-convulsive therapy .
it involves inducing a seizure in the brain , using an electric current . this is an accepted method in extreme cases .
but there are some negative side effects .
" it has long been known that electro-convulsive therapy has at least transient effects on the memory , " said michael wagner , a psychiatrist . tms in comparison performs much better .
" transcranial magnetic stimulation had no effect or even improved the memory , " wagner said .
however , as psychiatrists at the university of munich report , tms may have other side effects and possibly increase the risk of epileptic fits .
as yet it 's not clear exactly how long the positive effects achieved with tms last beyond treatment .
according to the scientists from the university of munich the effect subsides within only a few days or weeks after treatment is discontinued .
however , the situation improves significantly if patients are put on medication during and after tms treatment , the scientists say .
a step forward in the fight against a severe disorder that 's why tms looks like a step in the right direction .
professor schäpfner and his team at bonn have already started to improve the method .
they believe that tms could be used to even induce therapeutic seizures using tmc .
these could be more effective than the basic form of transcranial magnetic stimulation and have fewer side effects than traditional electroconvulsive therapy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas schläpfer said the search for new treatments must go on .
" major depression is a very severe and potentially deadly disorder .
18 percent of the patients die , mainly through suicide , " he said .
" they are not able to experience joy anymore .
they can not work any more and lose their family , their social functions . "
tms is still very new and not yet widely used .
but already about 20 groups worldwide are engaged in research on tms and the researchers hope that the new treatment could soon help many people beat depression . christiane wolters -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berliners get the blues a new report shows that not only is depression on the rise in germany , but berliners are the most miserable of all .

to their enemies it was the manifestation of their oppression .
to modern germans , the ancient roman border is now another cultural heritage site . germany can celebrate its fair share of cultural highlights but recently one of those sites has been elevated to the status reserved for those of globally recognized importance .
the german section of the border line of the roman empire , part of what is known as the " roman limes , " has been honored by the world heritage committee of unesco . the ancient section dating back to the 2nd century , which stretches for 542 kilometers from the region around koblenz in the current state of rhineland-palatinate , through hesse and baden-württemberg to regensburg in bavaria , is part of a border that stretched 5,000 kilometers -lrb- 3,100 miles -rrb- from the atlantic coast of northern britain , through europe to the black sea , and from there to the red sea and across north africa to the atlantic coast . the barrier that signaled the extent of the roman empire at its largest consists of remains of built walls , ditches , forts , fortresses , and watch towers which have survived the passage of time , war and the fall of the empire that it was built to protect . bildunterschrift : at its most splendid , the border was enforced by ramparts , walls and ditches , close to 900 watchtowers , 60 forts , and civilian settlements , which accommodated tradesmen , craftsmen and others who serviced the military . it completely separated the continent and kept the roman contingent in what is present-day germany protected from germanic barbarians . border finally breached by germanic barbarians the border was the brainchild of the emperor domitian -lrb- 81-96 a.d. -rrb- .
it held off the encroachment of rome 's enemies until the year 260 when roman troops were finally expelled from germania by the barbarians who stormed the " devil 's embankment . "
when the vandals and burgundians crossed the rhine less than 150 years later , roman rule finally came to an end . with the honor of being placed on the world cultural heritage list comes great responsibility for the 150 towns and municipalities and the 20 administrative districts whose land the once spectacular border structure straddled . with the help of the people who live on the line of history , the german limes committee hopes to keep the remaining elements of the border in good enough order as to remain on the list .
urban encroachment onto any part of the site may render its inclusion invalid so financial help is needed to keep the limes protected . following the route of the limes from the rhine , to the main and down to the danube , visitors can see where the forts and watch-towers were stationed , the next plotted with roman precision within sight of the last . sites of roman decadence in old germania at one of the furthest ends of the limes lies the biggest roman spa in southern germany at weissenburg in bavaria and an extensive museum dedicated to the history of the border in aalen in baden-wurttemberg , which has a magnificent selection of weapons , roman art , relics and statues . bildunterschrift : at rainau-buch in baden-wuerttemberg there are also the foundations of an original roman bath in the town 's open air museum .
there are many reconstructions , information points and footpaths connected to the history of the limes along the old border , making a visit feel like a real step into the past . for those visitors who pride themselves on their personal fitness , it is possible to cycle the length of the border on the specially constructed limes cycle track which takes in sedate flat areas and demanding hills .
the route takes in the nature reserve at rhine-westerwald , crosses the taunus and odenwald regions , and winds through the altmühl valley before ending near regensburg on the danube . pia ann gram -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a cycle trip and tipple along the moselle a cycle trip along the moselle river is an ideal way to enjoy one of germany 's most beautiful regions without even having to break a sweat .

he acted pragmatically and not exactly squeamishly .
what traces has he left in european politics ? during his presumably last intimate fireside conversation with the press at the eu summit in brussels in june , the german chancellor became truly melancholy .
during his time in office , he matured into a convinced european , schröder told the correspondents who always accused the spd politician of being emotionally aloof .
he said he always remained a realist who kept his feet firmly on the european ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe was his soft spot : helmut kohl gerhard schröder wanted clearly to set himself apart from his predecessor , helmut kohl , who always reduced europe to the question of war and peace .
schröder , on the other hand , wanted to advance german interests in europe at the least possible cost .
helmut kohl was popular in brussels and famous for having a soft european heart and a fat check-book , which helped him settle many a difference .
schröder lacked this charitable streak . turning away from blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they were partners at first : blair -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder seven years ago , schröder came to brussels saying : we are somebody again and we want to reinforce our influence .
during the 1998 election campaign , he was still stressing that europe would not win anyone prizes in germany , let alone election votes .
in the course of his chancellorship , schröder came increasingly closer to french president jacques chirac and his european position as he moved away from his initial political partner tony blair , the british prime minister . schröder and chirac together put pressure on brussels and implemented many of their ideas , such as eastern enlargement and accession perspectives for turkey .
during an eu summit , schröder even stood in for chirac during a session , they even stayed at the same hotel .
eu diplomats were joking at the time that soon one would get to see the two guys hanging out , holding hands at the grande place in brussels . the schröder-chirac duo bildunterschrift : in 2002 , schröder and chirac single-handedly sealed the now controversial agrarian deal , which made the eu enlargement with 10 more states possible .
tony blair , who was against the compromise to start with , took his revenge by letting the last summit fall through .
by that time , schröder and chirac , weakened by their own internal political problems , could not assert themselves anymore . schröder is particularly rankled by blair 's victory .
now he speaks a lot and often about the " european project " that lies close to his heart .
it 's all about saving the european social model , since europe is more than just a functioning market . schröder 's poodle ? for schröder , europe was always a projection screen for populist attacks .
it all started at the beginning of his term with a failed attempt to save the tax-free shopping in eu waters .
it continued with the attacks on eu parliamentarians and their presumably high benefits . during the election campaign in north rhine-westphalia , the european directive on services in the internal market , which was initially supported by the german government , had to be sacrificed .
spd election campaigners equated low wages and tax dumping with the eu , although the german government itself had agreed to all these regulations in the council of ministers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's man in brussels : günter verheugen schröder always relied on his man in brussels , the german eu commissioner and fellow social democrat günter verheugen , who earned the reputation of being schröder 's " poodle " among some of his colleagues in the eu capital .
but the other commissioners also worked closely with their national governments .
schröder 's attempt to turn verheugen into a " super-commissioner " with several departments in the spring of 2004 was not successful .

he acted pragmatically and not exactly squeamishly .
what traces has he left in european politics ? during his presumably last intimate fireside conversation with the press at the eu summit in brussels in june , the german chancellor became truly melancholy .
during his time in office , he matured into a convinced european , schröder told the correspondents who always accused the spd politician of being emotionally aloof .
he said he always remained a realist who kept his feet firmly on the european ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe was his soft spot : helmut kohl gerhard schröder wanted clearly to set himself apart from his predecessor , helmut kohl , who always reduced europe to the question of war and peace .
schröder , on the other hand , wanted to advance german interests in europe at the least possible cost .
helmut kohl was popular in brussels and famous for having a soft european heart and a fat check-book , which helped him settle many a difference .
schröder lacked this charitable streak . turning away from blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they were partners at first : blair -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder seven years ago , schröder came to brussels saying : we are somebody again and we want to reinforce our influence .
during the 1998 election campaign , he was still stressing that europe would not win anyone prizes in germany , let alone election votes .
in the course of his chancellorship , schröder came increasingly closer to french president jacques chirac and his european position as he moved away from his initial political partner tony blair , the british prime minister . schröder and chirac together put pressure on brussels and implemented many of their ideas , such as eastern enlargement and accession perspectives for turkey .
during an eu summit , schröder even stood in for chirac during a session , they even stayed at the same hotel .
eu diplomats were joking at the time that soon one would get to see the two guys hanging out , holding hands at the grande place in brussels . the schröder-chirac duo bildunterschrift : in 2002 , schröder and chirac single-handedly sealed the now controversial agrarian deal , which made the eu enlargement with 10 more states possible .
tony blair , who was against the compromise to start with , took his revenge by letting the last summit fall through .

16 .
it 's also a chance for them to get to know different approaches to catholicism around the globe . the motto of this world youth day is " we have come to worship him . "
it 's a quote from the gospel according to matthew and the name of the event 's official song .
organizers expect 800,000 young people to converge on the cologne region for world youth day .
but it would n't be possible without the efforts of its volunteers . at the volunteer department at world youth day headquarters in cologne , marko schmitz and his coworkers attend to some 20,000 volunteers who have come to the city to be involved in this mega event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making sure that call center volunteers understand those seeking information " we make sure that volunteers with certain qualifications get certain jobs , so that the call center gets people who speak the right languages , that we find people with a driver 's license for a bus to drive the pilgrim groups around and so on , " he said . but it 's not just about getting the right volunteers to the right place .
the department also deals with issues like health insurance , spending money and accommodation . volunteers , not helpers the young people between the ages of 16 and 30 who have come here from all over the world want to be called " volunteers " and not " helpers . "
for they are not only assisting during the ten-day event , they are also actively involved in its development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne at night marko schmitz is also a volunteer although he 's been working on organizing world youth day much longer .
he 's one of 137 so-called long-term volunteers from 42 nations who have been in cologne since last august .
they deal with registering the pilgrims , public relations or also the liturgy preparations for the pope 's masses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world youth day in toronto , 2002 " i 'm in charge of the international liturgy group , which is composed of 150 young people from around the world , " said andrew liung , who comes from china .
" it will be on the main stage for the liturgies for the masses , the opening mass , the welcoming ceremony for the holy father , the vigil and the closing mass .
so they will be the servers , the readers , the people to bring up the gifts . " cultural and religious differences of course , cultural and religious differences become evident when a lot of people from all over the world come together .
christoph wild , the head of the volunteer department , gave an example . " the volunteers requested that we start our weekly meeting with a prayer , " he said .
" for us in germany , it 's somewhat unusual to start a working session by praying .
but in new zealand , if you work in church matters , it 's normal and so we put this wish into practice . " with its staff of 230 young men and women , the world youth day headquarters could be any medium-sized company .
but there is certainly not as much discussion and exchange in a regular business as there is in this international pool .
which songs will be sung at the services , which prayers read and how is religious belief conveyed at all ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians are regular guests at church conventions " for example , it was very interesting for people to see how openly we express our beliefs here , that it is n't a problem , " schmitz said .
" my french colleague told me that in france , for example , you ca n't do that because there is a strict division of church and state .
it 's the same here , actually , but the two coexist and that has astonished our foreign volunteers . " rubbing off on german churches ? veronika dickert works in the coordination and public relations department .
she said she finds it exciting to see the various ways people from different countries express their faith .
that eastern europeans go to church more regularly .
that the chinese practice their christianity more behind closed doors or that south americans sing and dance in church .
dickert said she wishes that some of these traditions were practiced in services in her home congregation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will world youth day in cologne be as cheerful as the one in toronto in 2002 ?
" south americans are a bit more spirited : they clap , sing and dance in mass , " she said .
" but i do n't have a problem with that .
i sometimes wish that were the case here , too .
that more is done to tailor church services to young people 's needs because that 's the only way to interest them for the church .
it 's really something completely different than when a priest simply stands at his pulpit and just preaches anything .

he acted pragmatically and not exactly squeamishly .
what traces has he left in european politics ? during his presumably last intimate fireside conversation with the press at the eu summit in brussels in june , the german chancellor became truly melancholy .
during his time in office , he matured into a convinced european , schröder told the correspondents who always accused the spd politician of being emotionally aloof .
he said he always remained a realist who kept his feet firmly on the european ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe was his soft spot : helmut kohl gerhard schröder wanted clearly to set himself apart from his predecessor , helmut kohl , who always reduced europe to the question of war and peace .
schröder , on the other hand , wanted to advance german interests in europe at the least possible cost .
helmut kohl was popular in brussels and famous for having a soft european heart and a fat check-book , which helped him settle many a difference .
schröder lacked this charitable streak . turning away from blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they were partners at first : blair -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder seven years ago , schröder came to brussels saying : we are somebody again and we want to reinforce our influence .
during the 1998 election campaign , he was still stressing that europe would not win anyone prizes in germany , let alone election votes .
in the course of his chancellorship , schröder came increasingly closer to french president jacques chirac and his european position as he moved away from his initial political partner tony blair , the british prime minister . schröder and chirac together put pressure on brussels and implemented many of their ideas , such as eastern enlargement and accession perspectives for turkey .
during an eu summit , schröder even stood in for chirac during a session , they even stayed at the same hotel .
eu diplomats were joking at the time that soon one would get to see the two guys hanging out , holding hands at the grande place in brussels . the schröder-chirac duo bildunterschrift : in 2002 , schröder and chirac single-handedly sealed the now controversial agrarian deal , which made the eu enlargement with 10 more states possible .
tony blair , who was against the compromise to start with , took his revenge by letting the last summit fall through .
by that time , schröder and chirac , weakened by their own internal political problems , could not assert themselves anymore . schröder is particularly rankled by blair 's victory .
now he speaks a lot and often about the " european project " that lies close to his heart .
it 's all about saving the european social model , since europe is more than just a functioning market . schröder 's poodle ? for schröder , europe was always a projection screen for populist attacks .
it all started at the beginning of his term with a failed attempt to save the tax-free shopping in eu waters .
it continued with the attacks on eu parliamentarians and their presumably high benefits . during the election campaign in north rhine-westphalia , the european directive on services in the internal market , which was initially supported by the german government , had to be sacrificed .
spd election campaigners equated low wages and tax dumping with the eu , although the german government itself had agreed to all these regulations in the council of ministers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's man in brussels : günter verheugen schröder always relied on his man in brussels , the german eu commissioner and fellow social democrat günter verheugen , who earned the reputation of being schröder 's " poodle " among some of his colleagues in the eu capital .
but the other commissioners also worked closely with their national governments .
schröder 's attempt to turn verheugen into a " super-commissioner " with several departments in the spring of 2004 was not successful .

16 .
it 's also a chance for them to get to know different approaches to catholicism around the globe . the motto of this world youth day is " we have come to worship him . "
it 's a quote from the gospel according to matthew and the name of the event 's official song .
organizers expect 800,000 young people to converge on the cologne region for world youth day .
but it would n't be possible without the efforts of its volunteers . at the volunteer department at world youth day headquarters in cologne , marko schmitz and his coworkers attend to some 20,000 volunteers who have come to the city to be involved in this mega event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making sure that call center volunteers understand those seeking information " we make sure that volunteers with certain qualifications get certain jobs , so that the call center gets people who speak the right languages , that we find people with a driver 's license for a bus to drive the pilgrim groups around and so on , " he said . but it 's not just about getting the right volunteers to the right place .
the department also deals with issues like health insurance , spending money and accommodation . volunteers , not helpers the young people between the ages of 16 and 30 who have come here from all over the world want to be called " volunteers " and not " helpers . "
for they are not only assisting during the ten-day event , they are also actively involved in its development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne at night marko schmitz is also a volunteer although he 's been working on organizing world youth day much longer .
he 's one of 137 so-called long-term volunteers from 42 nations who have been in cologne since last august .
they deal with registering the pilgrims , public relations or also the liturgy preparations for the pope 's masses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world youth day in toronto , 2002 " i 'm in charge of the international liturgy group , which is composed of 150 young people from around the world , " said andrew liung , who comes from china .
" it will be on the main stage for the liturgies for the masses , the opening mass , the welcoming ceremony for the holy father , the vigil and the closing mass .
so they will be the servers , the readers , the people to bring up the gifts . " cultural and religious differences of course , cultural and religious differences become evident when a lot of people from all over the world come together .
christoph wild , the head of the volunteer department , gave an example . " the volunteers requested that we start our weekly meeting with a prayer , " he said .
" for us in germany , it 's somewhat unusual to start a working session by praying .
but in new zealand , if you work in church matters , it 's normal and so we put this wish into practice . " with its staff of 230 young men and women , the world youth day headquarters could be any medium-sized company .
but there is certainly not as much discussion and exchange in a regular business as there is in this international pool .
which songs will be sung at the services , which prayers read and how is religious belief conveyed at all ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians are regular guests at church conventions " for example , it was very interesting for people to see how openly we express our beliefs here , that it is n't a problem , " schmitz said .
" my french colleague told me that in france , for example , you ca n't do that because there is a strict division of church and state .
it 's the same here , actually , but the two coexist and that has astonished our foreign volunteers . " rubbing off on german churches ? veronika dickert works in the coordination and public relations department .
she said she finds it exciting to see the various ways people from different countries express their faith .
that eastern europeans go to church more regularly .
that the chinese practice their christianity more behind closed doors or that south americans sing and dance in church .
dickert said she wishes that some of these traditions were practiced in services in her home congregation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will world youth day in cologne be as cheerful as the one in toronto in 2002 ?
" south americans are a bit more spirited : they clap , sing and dance in mass , " she said .
" but i do n't have a problem with that .
i sometimes wish that were the case here , too .
that more is done to tailor church services to young people 's needs because that 's the only way to interest them for the church .
it 's really something completely different than when a priest simply stands at his pulpit and just preaches anything .

he acted pragmatically and not exactly squeamishly .
what traces has he left in european politics ? during his presumably last intimate fireside conversation with the press at the eu summit in brussels in june , the german chancellor became truly melancholy .
during his time in office , he matured into a convinced european , schröder told the correspondents who always accused the spd politician of being emotionally aloof .
he said he always remained a realist who kept his feet firmly on the european ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe was his soft spot : helmut kohl gerhard schröder wanted clearly to set himself apart from his predecessor , helmut kohl , who always reduced europe to the question of war and peace .
schröder , on the other hand , wanted to advance german interests in europe at the least possible cost .
helmut kohl was popular in brussels and famous for having a soft european heart and a fat check-book , which helped him settle many a difference .
schröder lacked this charitable streak . turning away from blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they were partners at first : blair -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder seven years ago , schröder came to brussels saying : we are somebody again and we want to reinforce our influence .

in the course of his chancellorship , schröder came increasingly closer to french president jacques chirac and his european position as he moved away from his initial political partner tony blair , the british prime minister . schröder and chirac together put pressure on brussels and implemented many of their ideas , such as eastern enlargement and accession perspectives for turkey .

tony blair , who was against the compromise to start with , took his revenge by letting the last summit fall through .
by that time , schröder and chirac , weakened by their own internal political problems , could not assert themselves anymore . schröder is particularly rankled by blair 's victory .

he acted pragmatically and not exactly squeamishly .
what traces has he left in european politics ? during his presumably last intimate fireside conversation with the press at the eu summit in brussels in june , the german chancellor became truly melancholy .
during his time in office , he matured into a convinced european , schröder told the correspondents who always accused the spd politician of being emotionally aloof .
he said he always remained a realist who kept his feet firmly on the european ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe was his soft spot : helmut kohl gerhard schröder wanted clearly to set himself apart from his predecessor , helmut kohl , who always reduced europe to the question of war and peace .
schröder , on the other hand , wanted to advance german interests in europe at the least possible cost .
helmut kohl was popular in brussels and famous for having a soft european heart and a fat check-book , which helped him settle many a difference .
schröder lacked this charitable streak . turning away from blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they were partners at first : blair -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder seven years ago , schröder came to brussels saying : we are somebody again and we want to reinforce our influence .
during the 1998 election campaign , he was still stressing that europe would not win anyone prizes in germany , let alone election votes .
in the course of his chancellorship , schröder came increasingly closer to french president jacques chirac and his european position as he moved away from his initial political partner tony blair , the british prime minister . schröder and chirac together put pressure on brussels and implemented many of their ideas , such as eastern enlargement and accession perspectives for turkey .

by that time , schröder and chirac , weakened by their own internal political problems , could not assert themselves anymore . schröder is particularly rankled by blair 's victory .
now he speaks a lot and often about the " european project " that lies close to his heart .
it 's all about saving the european social model , since europe is more than just a functioning market . schröder 's poodle ? for schröder , europe was always a projection screen for populist attacks .
it all started at the beginning of his term with a failed attempt to save the tax-free shopping in eu waters .
it continued with the attacks on eu parliamentarians and their presumably high benefits . during the election campaign in north rhine-westphalia , the european directive on services in the internal market , which was initially supported by the german government , had to be sacrificed .
spd election campaigners equated low wages and tax dumping with the eu , although the german government itself had agreed to all these regulations in the council of ministers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's man in brussels : günter verheugen schröder always relied on his man in brussels , the german eu commissioner and fellow social democrat günter verheugen , who earned the reputation of being schröder 's " poodle " among some of his colleagues in the eu capital .
but the other commissioners also worked closely with their national governments .

without many top insider positions , the german government opted more for hit-and-run diplomacy , trying to affect decisions with spontaneous actions when it was already too late . schröder relied all too frequently on germany 's size and the weight of its votes in the eu .
smaller eu states sometimes spoke cattily of the german steamroller .
even the german economics minister , wolfgang clement , who sent the most representatives to eu , showed little interest in the eu councils for competitiveness and economics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt the chancellor 's role in the politics surrounding the iraq conflict has been received ambivalently in europe .
those who opposed the war , such as belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , have praised schröder for standing up to the americans and helping europe gain more self-confidence in the long run .
those eu members who are more loyal to the us have argued , on the other hand , that schröder 's rigid attitude has brought the union to the brink of an abyss .
the breakup of the eu seemed possible in february / march 2003 .
the division into bush-warriors and bush-opponents is still in effect . schröder 's limited power schröder 's years in brussels will also be remembered by the watering down of the stability and growth pact .
because german finance minister hans eichel could not satisfy the public debt criteria , he and his french colleagues decided to soften the criteria themselves . in the summer of 2004 , schröder already had to endure a sensitive defeat on the european stage .

without many top insider positions , the german government opted more for hit-and-run diplomacy , trying to affect decisions with spontaneous actions when it was already too late . schröder relied all too frequently on germany 's size and the weight of its votes in the eu .
smaller eu states sometimes spoke cattily of the german steamroller .
even the german economics minister , wolfgang clement , who sent the most representatives to eu , showed little interest in the eu councils for competitiveness and economics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt the chancellor 's role in the politics surrounding the iraq conflict has been received ambivalently in europe .
those who opposed the war , such as belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt , have praised schröder for standing up to the americans and helping europe gain more self-confidence in the long run .
those eu members who are more loyal to the us have argued , on the other hand , that schröder 's rigid attitude has brought the union to the brink of an abyss .
the breakup of the eu seemed possible in february / march 2003 .
the division into bush-warriors and bush-opponents is still in effect . schröder 's limited power schröder 's years in brussels will also be remembered by the watering down of the stability and growth pact .
because german finance minister hans eichel could not satisfy the public debt criteria , he and his french colleagues decided to soften the criteria themselves . in the summer of 2004 , schröder already had to endure a sensitive defeat on the european stage .
he wanted to have the verhofstadt elected president of the european commission , most likely out of gratitude for the anti-bush " chocolate coalition " during the iraq war .
but the candidate was not accepted by the majority of conservative state and government heads .

16 .
it 's also a chance for them to get to know different approaches to catholicism around the globe . the motto of this world youth day is " we have come to worship him . "
it 's a quote from the gospel according to matthew and the name of the event 's official song .
organizers expect 800,000 young people to converge on the cologne region for world youth day .
but it would n't be possible without the efforts of its volunteers . at the volunteer department at world youth day headquarters in cologne , marko schmitz and his coworkers attend to some 20,000 volunteers who have come to the city to be involved in this mega event . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making sure that call center volunteers understand those seeking information " we make sure that volunteers with certain qualifications get certain jobs , so that the call center gets people who speak the right languages , that we find people with a driver 's license for a bus to drive the pilgrim groups around and so on , " he said . but it 's not just about getting the right volunteers to the right place .
the department also deals with issues like health insurance , spending money and accommodation . volunteers , not helpers the young people between the ages of 16 and 30 who have come here from all over the world want to be called " volunteers " and not " helpers . "
for they are not only assisting during the ten-day event , they are also actively involved in its development . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne at night marko schmitz is also a volunteer although he 's been working on organizing world youth day much longer .
he 's one of 137 so-called long-term volunteers from 42 nations who have been in cologne since last august .
they deal with registering the pilgrims , public relations or also the liturgy preparations for the pope 's masses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world youth day in toronto , 2002 " i 'm in charge of the international liturgy group , which is composed of 150 young people from around the world , " said andrew liung , who comes from china .
" it will be on the main stage for the liturgies for the masses , the opening mass , the welcoming ceremony for the holy father , the vigil and the closing mass .
so they will be the servers , the readers , the people to bring up the gifts . " cultural and religious differences of course , cultural and religious differences become evident when a lot of people from all over the world come together .
christoph wild , the head of the volunteer department , gave an example . " the volunteers requested that we start our weekly meeting with a prayer , " he said .
" for us in germany , it 's somewhat unusual to start a working session by praying .
but in new zealand , if you work in church matters , it 's normal and so we put this wish into practice . " with its staff of 230 young men and women , the world youth day headquarters could be any medium-sized company .
but there is certainly not as much discussion and exchange in a regular business as there is in this international pool .
which songs will be sung at the services , which prayers read and how is religious belief conveyed at all ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians are regular guests at church conventions " for example , it was very interesting for people to see how openly we express our beliefs here , that it is n't a problem , " schmitz said .
" my french colleague told me that in france , for example , you ca n't do that because there is a strict division of church and state .
it 's the same here , actually , but the two coexist and that has astonished our foreign volunteers . " rubbing off on german churches ? veronika dickert works in the coordination and public relations department .
she said she finds it exciting to see the various ways people from different countries express their faith .
that eastern europeans go to church more regularly .
that the chinese practice their christianity more behind closed doors or that south americans sing and dance in church .
dickert said she wishes that some of these traditions were practiced in services in her home congregation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will world youth day in cologne be as cheerful as the one in toronto in 2002 ?
" south americans are a bit more spirited : they clap , sing and dance in mass , " she said .
" but i do n't have a problem with that .
i sometimes wish that were the case here , too .
that more is done to tailor church services to young people 's needs because that 's the only way to interest them for the church .
it 's really something completely different than when a priest simply stands at his pulpit and just preaches anything .

to their enemies it was the manifestation of their oppression .
to modern germans , the ancient roman border is now another cultural heritage site . germany can celebrate its fair share of cultural highlights but recently one of those sites has been elevated to the status reserved for those of globally recognized importance .
the german section of the border line of the roman empire , part of what is known as the " roman limes , " has been honored by the world heritage committee of unesco . the ancient section dating back to the 2nd century , which stretches for 542 kilometers from the region around koblenz in the current state of rhineland-palatinate , through hesse and baden-württemberg to regensburg in bavaria , is part of a border that stretched 5,000 kilometers -lrb- 3,100 miles -rrb- from the atlantic coast of northern britain , through europe to the black sea , and from there to the red sea and across north africa to the atlantic coast . the barrier that signaled the extent of the roman empire at its largest consists of remains of built walls , ditches , forts , fortresses , and watch towers which have survived the passage of time , war and the fall of the empire that it was built to protect . bildunterschrift : at its most splendid , the border was enforced by ramparts , walls and ditches , close to 900 watchtowers , 60 forts , and civilian settlements , which accommodated tradesmen , craftsmen and others who serviced the military . it completely separated the continent and kept the roman contingent in what is present-day germany protected from germanic barbarians . border finally breached by germanic barbarians the border was the brainchild of the emperor domitian -lrb- 81-96 a.d. -rrb- .
it held off the encroachment of rome 's enemies until the year 260 when roman troops were finally expelled from germania by the barbarians who stormed the " devil 's embankment . "

to their enemies it was the manifestation of their oppression .
to modern germans , the ancient roman border is now another cultural heritage site . germany can celebrate its fair share of cultural highlights but recently one of those sites has been elevated to the status reserved for those of globally recognized importance .
the german section of the border line of the roman empire , part of what is known as the " roman limes , " has been honored by the world heritage committee of unesco . the ancient section dating back to the 2nd century , which stretches for 542 kilometers from the region around koblenz in the current state of rhineland-palatinate , through hesse and baden-württemberg to regensburg in bavaria , is part of a border that stretched 5,000 kilometers -lrb- 3,100 miles -rrb- from the atlantic coast of northern britain , through europe to the black sea , and from there to the red sea and across north africa to the atlantic coast . the barrier that signaled the extent of the roman empire at its largest consists of remains of built walls , ditches , forts , fortresses , and watch towers which have survived the passage of time , war and the fall of the empire that it was built to protect . bildunterschrift : at its most splendid , the border was enforced by ramparts , walls and ditches , close to 900 watchtowers , 60 forts , and civilian settlements , which accommodated tradesmen , craftsmen and others who serviced the military . it completely separated the continent and kept the roman contingent in what is present-day germany protected from germanic barbarians . border finally breached by germanic barbarians the border was the brainchild of the emperor domitian -lrb- 81-96 a.d. -rrb- .
it held off the encroachment of rome 's enemies until the year 260 when roman troops were finally expelled from germania by the barbarians who stormed the " devil 's embankment . "

new licences will be needed from 24 november under the licensing act 2003 .
businesses had until midnight to apply for automatic extensions to their existing licences , and those which did not could now face delays getting them .
many small businesses may face a " gap in trading " , the department of culture , media and sport said . "
it 's been quite a burdensome process , often requiring lawyers to come on board to complete the process " british retail consortium it said the new law has been introduced to modernise the uk 's licensing laws and reduce bureaucracy .
a spokeswoman said up to a quarter of the 190,000 businesses that needed to reapply failed to do so .
" they can still apply , but they could face a gap in trading , " she said .
' blood , sweat and tears ' however , businesses which missed the deadline will be forced to begin a fresh application , rather than converting their existing licence .
the new system will allow businesses to extend licensing hours and potentially sell alcohol all day .
most pubs were believed to have applied already , but many small and late night restaurants are thought to have failed to do so .
mark hastings , as spokesman for the british beer and pub association , described the process as being one of " blood , sweat and tears " , adding that it had cost the pub trade £ 120m .
mr hastings also called for the licensing process to be simplified .

a spokesman for the british hospitality association criticised the procedure , saying : " it 's very complicated and it 's far more expensive than the old system " .
he said " the smaller end of the market " , such as " ethnic restaurants and kebab shops " had endured the most difficulties with the licensing system .

kylie minogue was diagnosed with breast cancer in may and has had surgery to remove a lump .
a study has shown that coverage of her case over two weeks caused an unprecedented increase in bookings for breast screening in australia .
simon chapman , of the university of sydney , said the number rose 40 % .
news coverage the professor of public health said he looked at the numbers of booked mammograms as part of the government 's breastscreen programmes in the 19 weeks before , the two weeks during and the six weeks after the publicity surrounding kylie 's illness .
as a result of kylie minogue 's diagnosis there was a 20-fold increase in the news coverage of breast cancer on australian tv , he said .
this coverage emphasised that young women also got breast cancer and that early detection of the disease was critical for successful treatment .
early detection is vital for prompt treatment and improving the chances of survival dr sarah rawlings , breakthrough breast cancer professor chapman also found a 101 % increase in bookings for women in the eligible age group for the breastscreen programme - 40 to 69 - who had not been screened before .
he also discovered that six weeks after the publicity , mammogram bookings remained nearly 40 % up in previously unscreened women .
writing in the medical journal of australia , professor chapman said that stories about health and medicine could lead to dramatic changes in consumer behaviour .
he said that capitalising on the interest generated by celebrity illnesses could increase news coverage of health topics to levels that would usually require huge campaign budgets .
" health advocates should develop anticipatory strategies for responding to news coverage of celebrity illness , " he said .
web hits dr sarah rawlings , head of policy at uk charity breakthrough breast cancer , said : " it 's encouraging to hear that kylie 's unfortunate diagnosis has led to more australian women realising the importance of early detection and attending screening appointments .
" breakthrough has witnessed thousands more web hits and calls since this news broke .
" in the uk , all women are entitled to screening from the age of 50 and we encourage these women to attend their appointments .
" women should also get to know how their breasts look and feel normally so they can see their gp if they notice any changes - early detection is vital for prompt treatment and improving the chances of survival . "
breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the uk , with more than 41,000 new cases each year .
about one in nine women is estimated to develop breast cancer during their lifetime .
