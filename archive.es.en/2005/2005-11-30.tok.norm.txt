" we see no reason to change this law , " the commission 's delegation in bucharest said in a statement .
a moratorium on adoptions has been in effect since 2001.the law came about after pressure from the eu , which told bucharest to end " the exportation of children " through numerous international adoptions over the past few years and to quickly institute a system for protecting minors in accordance with european norms .
romania is slated to join the european union in 2007 provided it satisfies all eu criteria .
but the european parliament 's representative to romania , pierre moscovici , has called on the eastern european country to settle " as soon as possible requests for international adoptions that were filed before the moratorium in 2001 , in consideration of the emotional suffering of adoptive parents . "
in october , some 20 foreign couples sought to take up permanent residence in romania so they could adopt children .
the couples are already foster parents who " have been entrusted with romanian children for several years .
over time , a deep affection has been established between the foreigners and the children , " theodora bertzi , head of the romanian office for adoptions , said in october .
foreign residents may adopt the majority of those on the list seeking adoptions , 11 couples , come from the united states .
the other couples come from european countries including germany , the netherlands , italy , switzerland and britain , as well as from canada and south africa .
" these couples have the possibility of adopting a romanian child , once they obtain a romanian residence permit , " bertzi said , but even this is no guarantee .
the new romanian law states that adoption is " the last recourse " in protecting children who are orphans or have been abandoned , and it gives " absolute priority " to romanian couples .
us officials have criticized the new romanian law , claiming that children remain in orphanages because there are not enough romanian parents who have the means or the desire to adopt a child .
with the aid from the eu , unicef and several international associations , romania has reduced the number of orphans in the country to less than 40,000 , as the children have been accepted by romanian families who receive financial support from the state . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de adopting a new attitude towards children the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .

it 's the second of the five architectural gems on the city 's museum island to be given a complete facelift . " this is a wonderful day for berlin , a wonderful day for germany and for the museums of the world , " were the words spoken by art-lover and new minister for transport , building and housing wolfgang tiefensee at the official reopening ceremony for the bode museum .
he made no effort to disguise his delight at the nature of his first public engagement since taking office .
the restoration project , which was completed within the 152 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- budget and in the foreseen five and a half years time frame , brings the museum island in central berlin one step closer to its former dazzling glory .
bildunterschrift : after years of reconstruction , the museum is ready again tiefensee was not the only one singing the museum 's praises during the ceremony .
klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage was positively effervescent in his description of what makes the restored building so stunning , citing " the impressive renaissance and baroque forms , original features and use of colors and materials . "
a fragmented past from its place at the northern-most tip of the museum island where it sits perched imposingly above the spree river , the bode museum looks every bit a water palace .
the original building project , inspired by wilhelm bode , then general director of the royal museums of prussia , stems from 1880 .
the neo-baroque beauty with its twin cupolas was built by royal court architect ernst-eberhard ihne and opened by prussian king william ii as the kaiser-friedrich-museum in 1904 .
much of the museum was destroyed during the second world war , and had , by the end of the 1940s been earmarked for complete demolition .
an active citizens ' movement managed to prevent its fate from being sealed in a pile of rubble , and between the beginning of the 1950s to the mid-1980s , the building , which was renamed bode museum in 1956 , underwent a patchwork restoration effort .
but it was n't until after the fall of the berlin wall that it got the full treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum was built in the late 19th century when the museum island was granted a place on the unesco list of world cultural heritage sites , the federal and state governments hatched a master plan worth billions to completely renovate the five buildings on the slim strip of land positioned in the middle of the spree river .
speaking at the official opening this week , state secretary for culture bernd neumann said it was an " essential and pleasurable task " to maintain and hand on the restored complex to the next generation .
attention to detail the complete overhaul of the 25,000-square-meter -lrb- 82,000-square-foot -rrb- building not only included fitting modern security and sanitary technology , but restoration of the detail which lent the museum its charm 100 years ago .
many décor elements which were damaged or destroyed during the war have been redone or replaced , and an ornate rococo room was completely reconstructed on the strength of an old photo from pre-war days .
in the coming months , the high , bright rooms will be filled with exhibits from the end of antiquity to the middle of the 18th century .
from sculptures to icons and ivory to works by the old masters , the museum will house pieces of art which have been hidden away for long enough .
visitors will have a chance to preview the museum over the weekend , and it will be opened permanently from summer 2006 . silke bartlick -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's world cultural heritage sites during travels through germany , many tourists focus on the cultural aspects of the country .

the situation on the world stage is such that the two sides will have to work together , and in one short visit , steinmeier has already proved that a sensible dialogue in a businesslike and friendly tone is more helpful than the nurturing of animosity . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel seeks stronger ties with us , smaller eu states german chancellor angela merkel said she aims to bolster ties with the united states and smaller eu states .

" we see no reason to change this law , " the commission 's delegation in bucharest said in a statement .
a moratorium on adoptions has been in effect since 2001.the law came about after pressure from the eu , which told bucharest to end " the exportation of children " through numerous international adoptions over the past few years and to quickly institute a system for protecting minors in accordance with european norms .
romania is slated to join the european union in 2007 provided it satisfies all eu criteria .
but the european parliament 's representative to romania , pierre moscovici , has called on the eastern european country to settle " as soon as possible requests for international adoptions that were filed before the moratorium in 2001 , in consideration of the emotional suffering of adoptive parents . "
in october , some 20 foreign couples sought to take up permanent residence in romania so they could adopt children .
the couples are already foster parents who " have been entrusted with romanian children for several years .
over time , a deep affection has been established between the foreigners and the children , " theodora bertzi , head of the romanian office for adoptions , said in october .
foreign residents may adopt the majority of those on the list seeking adoptions , 11 couples , come from the united states .
the other couples come from european countries including germany , the netherlands , italy , switzerland and britain , as well as from canada and south africa .
" these couples have the possibility of adopting a romanian child , once they obtain a romanian residence permit , " bertzi said , but even this is no guarantee .
the new romanian law states that adoption is " the last recourse " in protecting children who are orphans or have been abandoned , and it gives " absolute priority " to romanian couples .
us officials have criticized the new romanian law , claiming that children remain in orphanages because there are not enough romanian parents who have the means or the desire to adopt a child .
with the aid from the eu , unicef and several international associations , romania has reduced the number of orphans in the country to less than 40,000 , as the children have been accepted by romanian families who receive financial support from the state . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de adopting a new attitude towards children the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.11.2005 eu calls on romania to maintain moratorium on adoptions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners move to romania hoping they will get to adopt there the european commission called tuesday on romania to maintain its moratorium on international adoptions despite pressure from countries such as the united states and france to lift it . the commission , the executive arm of the european union , " reiterates its support for new romanian legislation on the rights of children and on adoption that came into effect in january this year .
" we see no reason to change this law , " the commission 's delegation in bucharest said in a statement .
a moratorium on adoptions has been in effect since 2001.the law came about after pressure from the eu , which told bucharest to end " the exportation of children " through numerous international adoptions over the past few years and to quickly institute a system for protecting minors in accordance with european norms .
romania is slated to join the european union in 2007 provided it satisfies all eu criteria .
but the european parliament 's representative to romania , pierre moscovici , has called on the eastern european country to settle " as soon as possible requests for international adoptions that were filed before the moratorium in 2001 , in consideration of the emotional suffering of adoptive parents . "
in october , some 20 foreign couples sought to take up permanent residence in romania so they could adopt children .
the couples are already foster parents who " have been entrusted with romanian children for several years .
over time , a deep affection has been established between the foreigners and the children , " theodora bertzi , head of the romanian office for adoptions , said in october .
foreign residents may adopt the majority of those on the list seeking adoptions , 11 couples , come from the united states .
the other couples come from european countries including germany , the netherlands , italy , switzerland and britain , as well as from canada and south africa .
" these couples have the possibility of adopting a romanian child , once they obtain a romanian residence permit , " bertzi said , but even this is no guarantee .
the new romanian law states that adoption is " the last recourse " in protecting children who are orphans or have been abandoned , and it gives " absolute priority " to romanian couples .
us officials have criticized the new romanian law , claiming that children remain in orphanages because there are not enough romanian parents who have the means or the desire to adopt a child .
with the aid from the eu , unicef and several international associations , romania has reduced the number of orphans in the country to less than 40,000 , as the children have been accepted by romanian families who receive financial support from the state . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de adopting a new attitude towards children the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .

" osthoff had worked on a german excavation of the 4,000-year-old isin site from the mid-1970s until the late 1980s , when un sanctions forced most foreign experts out of the country . in may 2003 , two months after the united states and britain invaded iraq , osthoff brought reporters to isin to show them how iraq 's most important sites were being destroyed by looters . " in two weeks , they have ruined all the work that was done over 15 years , " osthoff told the new york times . osthoff 's mother , in an interview with reuters television , said her daughter gave iraq and its culture her " body and soul . " " she helped show the americans what was happening to iraq 's cultural sites , " ingrid hala said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still from the video the hostage takers released shortly after midnight on tuesday , hala received news from the german foreign ministry that osthoff had been kidnapped in iraq and was being held by gunmen .
they were threatening to kill her if germany did not end its cooperation with the iraqi government . an image from a tape brought to german state broadcaster ard showed two blindfolded people sitting on the ground surrounded by three armed , masked men .
one held a rocket-propelled grenade launcher ; another read from a piece of paper . the fate of margaret hassan ? germany 's new chancellor angela merkel has vowed to everything within her power to save osthoff and her driver . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel speaking about the hostage crisis on tuesday one german official told the reuters news agency that they did not want her to end up like margaret hassan , a british aid worker who was kidnapped and killed last year by militants in iraq . like osthoff , hassan spoke arabic , had spent decades in iraq and had devoted her life to the country .
hassan had also criticised both the pre-war un sanctions and the invasion . osthoff witnessed iraqis suffering during and after the war , which prompted her to turn to relief work .
a converted muslim , she began working as volunteer in iraqi hospitals . but like many foreigners in iraq , where bomb attacks and kidnappings are commonplace , osthoff lived in fear for her life and often travelled with armed guards . germany 's neue osnabrücker zeitung daily said in a press release that osthoff told the paper in october she had been threatened by people close to the leader of al qaeda in iraq , abu musab al-zarqawi , who has claimed responsibility for the murder of numerous hostages in iraq . islam experts say the lives of osthoff and her driver are very much in danger . henner fürtig of the german orient institute in hamburg called the danger level " acute . "
sonja hegasy of the berlin-based modern orient center shares that view , adding however that the chances of a peaceful resolution to the crisis is greater than it would be if osthoff were a national of a country that directly supported the us in the iraq war . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel urges kidnappers to release german detained in iraq new german chancellor angela merkel said that her government was doing everything in its power to secure the release of a german archeologist believed kidnapped in iraq and urged her captors to let her go .

" the biggest surprise of my lifetime is freedom , " she said , saying she had never expected to see the other side of the berlin wall before she retired . " let us dare to have more freedom , " she said , including more opportunities for germans to pursue their hopes for prosperity .
" who would have thought that the highest governmental office would be given to a woman this year already ? "
merkel said . turning to economic issues , merkel told parliament that her left-right government would return the country to its status as an economic powerhouse .
" we want to create the conditions for germany to be among the top three in europe in 10 years " in terms of economic growth , she said in the keenly awaited address . merkel took office last week in a coalition with her conservative christian democrats and her predecessor gerhard schröder 's social democrats with a mandate to slash the 11-percent unemployment rate , jumpstart the moribund economy and tame the spiraling public deficit .
she wasted no time in painting a picture of a country on the ropes , but one more than capable of fighting back . merkel urges germany to take its foot off the brakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany may be on the ropes , merkel says , but it can fight back " our growth has n't picked up in years .
our debt has risen to alarming levels .
the new -lrb- eastern -rrb- states stopped catching up years ago , " merkel said .
but she said her coalition government had a unique opportunity to solve these problems if it worked together .
" a government of action will have to take some blows .
but we will show one thing : we have major potential in our country .
germany is full of opportunities - inside and outside . " " one thing is clear : we all bear responsibility for the fact that we are not using our opportunities to the full .
let us release the brakes on growth ...
let us show what is possible , " she said . " we want to get the labor market in shape , we want to make our schools and universities world-class , we want to bring the deficit under control and repair our health , pension and nursing systems , " she said to applause . germany to work with eu within limits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel told parliament that germany would not carry the eu burden merkel also pledged that her government would try to find a compromise with the european union over its 2007-2013 budget .
but she warned that germany would not accept too great a burden , adding that she would press for a " lasting solution which is in the pan-european interest " at the crucial eu summit in december . " germany is prepared to contribute to a sensible compromise , " she said but added that germany 's " frightening " debt levels meant the economy would not be able to tolerate new budget obligations .
the last eu summit in june ended in stalemate and recriminations over a proposed 1.06 percent budget spending cap . merkel also used the address to reiterate her stance on the kidnapping of susanne osthoff , the german national taken captive a few days ago in iraq .
the chancellor told the assembly that germany would not bow to the captors .
" we will not be blackmailed , " merkel said .
" we can not fail in our fight against terrorism . " hostage stance reiterated , terrorism condemned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german archeologist susanne osthoff was abducted in iraq this week merkel added that her government " was aiming all its efforts at protecting the lives of susanne osthoff and her driver " and reiterated that she " strongly " condemned the hostage-taking , saying that the government " will do all it can to bring them to safety as soon as possible . " the chancellor told parliament that international terrorism was the biggest challenge facing the international community : " it is directed at everything that is important to us , at the core of our civilization .
it is directed against our entire value system ; against freedom , tolerance and the respect of human dignity , democracy and the rule of law . " " one thing is clear : this government , this parliament will not let itself be pressured . " merkel speaks of open dialogue with islam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel encouraged dialogue but condemned honor killings and forced marriage during her speech , merkel also addressed the topic of islam and pledged an " open and honest " dialogue with the islamic world .
" dialogue with islam carries great significance … we have to learn to understand each other , " she said .
" we will do this in an open and honest way .
we will not brush aside differences , but name them clearly . " while attempting to open the way for communication , merkel denounced forced marriages and so-called honor killings .
" i say this explicitly , as chancellor and also as a woman , that forced marriages or honor killings - both , by the way , awful words - have nothing , completely nothing , to do with honor and also no place at all in our society , " she said .
" we can not tolerate them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.11.2005 berlin reveals cultural gem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors can soon get a sneak preview of the fruits of hard labor after years of painstaking restoration , berlin 's bode museum is gearing up to reopen its doors to visitors .
it 's the second of the five architectural gems on the city 's museum island to be given a complete facelift . " this is a wonderful day for berlin , a wonderful day for germany and for the museums of the world , " were the words spoken by art-lover and new minister for transport , building and housing wolfgang tiefensee at the official reopening ceremony for the bode museum .
he made no effort to disguise his delight at the nature of his first public engagement since taking office .
the restoration project , which was completed within the 152 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- budget and in the foreseen five and a half years time frame , brings the museum island in central berlin one step closer to its former dazzling glory .
bildunterschrift : after years of reconstruction , the museum is ready again tiefensee was not the only one singing the museum 's praises during the ceremony .
klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage was positively effervescent in his description of what makes the restored building so stunning , citing " the impressive renaissance and baroque forms , original features and use of colors and materials . "
a fragmented past from its place at the northern-most tip of the museum island where it sits perched imposingly above the spree river , the bode museum looks every bit a water palace .
the original building project , inspired by wilhelm bode , then general director of the royal museums of prussia , stems from 1880 .
the neo-baroque beauty with its twin cupolas was built by royal court architect ernst-eberhard ihne and opened by prussian king william ii as the kaiser-friedrich-museum in 1904 .
much of the museum was destroyed during the second world war , and had , by the end of the 1940s been earmarked for complete demolition .
an active citizens ' movement managed to prevent its fate from being sealed in a pile of rubble , and between the beginning of the 1950s to the mid-1980s , the building , which was renamed bode museum in 1956 , underwent a patchwork restoration effort .
but it was n't until after the fall of the berlin wall that it got the full treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum was built in the late 19th century when the museum island was granted a place on the unesco list of world cultural heritage sites , the federal and state governments hatched a master plan worth billions to completely renovate the five buildings on the slim strip of land positioned in the middle of the spree river .
speaking at the official opening this week , state secretary for culture bernd neumann said it was an " essential and pleasurable task " to maintain and hand on the restored complex to the next generation .
attention to detail the complete overhaul of the 25,000-square-meter -lrb- 82,000-square-foot -rrb- building not only included fitting modern security and sanitary technology , but restoration of the detail which lent the museum its charm 100 years ago .
many décor elements which were damaged or destroyed during the war have been redone or replaced , and an ornate rococo room was completely reconstructed on the strength of an old photo from pre-war days .
in the coming months , the high , bright rooms will be filled with exhibits from the end of antiquity to the middle of the 18th century .
from sculptures to icons and ivory to works by the old masters , the museum will house pieces of art which have been hidden away for long enough .
visitors will have a chance to preview the museum over the weekend , and it will be opened permanently from summer 2006 . silke bartlick -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's world cultural heritage sites during travels through germany , many tourists focus on the cultural aspects of the country .

a robber in cologne almost bungled a simple hold-up when his attempted armed robbery got off to a very inauspicious start .
the man entered a newsagent in the city and made demands to the cashier , 24-year-old michaela sobor .
but the robber had bound his face so tightly with a scarf that his agitated commands were unintelligible .
victim had no idea what was being said after a number of confused seconds where victim and perpetrator stared vacantly at each other , sobor had to ask the robber to repeat himself , which he did but to yet still no avail .
" i did n't realize it was a robbery , i just thought he had wrapped himself up warm because of the cold weather , " the cashier said .
the robber 's frustration obviously boiled over at this point and he abandoned his demands and forced his way behind the counter , brandishing his gun for the first time since the farcical hold-up began .
it was only then did sobor realize that she was being robbed .
the man was able to make off with over almost 1,500 euros in cash .
police are now asking for witnesses to come forward to help in their investigation . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mommy 's boy thief nabbed calling home a german security guard who made off with a substantial sum destined for a bank was eventually caught following a 10-day manhunt by interpol agents - after calling home to his mom from a croatian beach resort .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.11.2005 berlin reveals cultural gem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors can soon get a sneak preview of the fruits of hard labor after years of painstaking restoration , berlin 's bode museum is gearing up to reopen its doors to visitors .
it 's the second of the five architectural gems on the city 's museum island to be given a complete facelift . " this is a wonderful day for berlin , a wonderful day for germany and for the museums of the world , " were the words spoken by art-lover and new minister for transport , building and housing wolfgang tiefensee at the official reopening ceremony for the bode museum .
he made no effort to disguise his delight at the nature of his first public engagement since taking office .
the restoration project , which was completed within the 152 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- budget and in the foreseen five and a half years time frame , brings the museum island in central berlin one step closer to its former dazzling glory .
bildunterschrift : after years of reconstruction , the museum is ready again tiefensee was not the only one singing the museum 's praises during the ceremony .
klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage was positively effervescent in his description of what makes the restored building so stunning , citing " the impressive renaissance and baroque forms , original features and use of colors and materials . "
a fragmented past from its place at the northern-most tip of the museum island where it sits perched imposingly above the spree river , the bode museum looks every bit a water palace .
the original building project , inspired by wilhelm bode , then general director of the royal museums of prussia , stems from 1880 .
the neo-baroque beauty with its twin cupolas was built by royal court architect ernst-eberhard ihne and opened by prussian king william ii as the kaiser-friedrich-museum in 1904 .
much of the museum was destroyed during the second world war , and had , by the end of the 1940s been earmarked for complete demolition .
an active citizens ' movement managed to prevent its fate from being sealed in a pile of rubble , and between the beginning of the 1950s to the mid-1980s , the building , which was renamed bode museum in 1956 , underwent a patchwork restoration effort .
but it was n't until after the fall of the berlin wall that it got the full treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum was built in the late 19th century when the museum island was granted a place on the unesco list of world cultural heritage sites , the federal and state governments hatched a master plan worth billions to completely renovate the five buildings on the slim strip of land positioned in the middle of the spree river .
speaking at the official opening this week , state secretary for culture bernd neumann said it was an " essential and pleasurable task " to maintain and hand on the restored complex to the next generation .
attention to detail the complete overhaul of the 25,000-square-meter -lrb- 82,000-square-foot -rrb- building not only included fitting modern security and sanitary technology , but restoration of the detail which lent the museum its charm 100 years ago .
many décor elements which were damaged or destroyed during the war have been redone or replaced , and an ornate rococo room was completely reconstructed on the strength of an old photo from pre-war days .
in the coming months , the high , bright rooms will be filled with exhibits from the end of antiquity to the middle of the 18th century .
from sculptures to icons and ivory to works by the old masters , the museum will house pieces of art which have been hidden away for long enough .
visitors will have a chance to preview the museum over the weekend , and it will be opened permanently from summer 2006 . silke bartlick -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's world cultural heritage sites during travels through germany , many tourists focus on the cultural aspects of the country .

much of the museum was destroyed during the second world war , and had , by the end of the 1940s been earmarked for complete demolition .

it 's the second of the five architectural gems on the city 's museum island to be given a complete facelift . " this is a wonderful day for berlin , a wonderful day for germany and for the museums of the world , " were the words spoken by art-lover and new minister for transport , building and housing wolfgang tiefensee at the official reopening ceremony for the bode museum .
he made no effort to disguise his delight at the nature of his first public engagement since taking office .
the restoration project , which was completed within the 152 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- budget and in the foreseen five and a half years time frame , brings the museum island in central berlin one step closer to its former dazzling glory .
bildunterschrift : after years of reconstruction , the museum is ready again tiefensee was not the only one singing the museum 's praises during the ceremony .
klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage was positively effervescent in his description of what makes the restored building so stunning , citing " the impressive renaissance and baroque forms , original features and use of colors and materials . "
a fragmented past from its place at the northern-most tip of the museum island where it sits perched imposingly above the spree river , the bode museum looks every bit a water palace .

" we see no reason to change this law , " the commission 's delegation in bucharest said in a statement .
a moratorium on adoptions has been in effect since 2001.the law came about after pressure from the eu , which told bucharest to end " the exportation of children " through numerous international adoptions over the past few years and to quickly institute a system for protecting minors in accordance with european norms .
romania is slated to join the european union in 2007 provided it satisfies all eu criteria .
but the european parliament 's representative to romania , pierre moscovici , has called on the eastern european country to settle " as soon as possible requests for international adoptions that were filed before the moratorium in 2001 , in consideration of the emotional suffering of adoptive parents . "
in october , some 20 foreign couples sought to take up permanent residence in romania so they could adopt children .
the couples are already foster parents who " have been entrusted with romanian children for several years .
over time , a deep affection has been established between the foreigners and the children , " theodora bertzi , head of the romanian office for adoptions , said in october .
foreign residents may adopt the majority of those on the list seeking adoptions , 11 couples , come from the united states .
the other couples come from european countries including germany , the netherlands , italy , switzerland and britain , as well as from canada and south africa .
" these couples have the possibility of adopting a romanian child , once they obtain a romanian residence permit , " bertzi said , but even this is no guarantee .
the new romanian law states that adoption is " the last recourse " in protecting children who are orphans or have been abandoned , and it gives " absolute priority " to romanian couples .
us officials have criticized the new romanian law , claiming that children remain in orphanages because there are not enough romanian parents who have the means or the desire to adopt a child .
with the aid from the eu , unicef and several international associations , romania has reduced the number of orphans in the country to less than 40,000 , as the children have been accepted by romanian families who receive financial support from the state . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de adopting a new attitude towards children the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.11.2005 berlin reveals cultural gem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors can soon get a sneak preview of the fruits of hard labor after years of painstaking restoration , berlin 's bode museum is gearing up to reopen its doors to visitors .
it 's the second of the five architectural gems on the city 's museum island to be given a complete facelift . " this is a wonderful day for berlin , a wonderful day for germany and for the museums of the world , " were the words spoken by art-lover and new minister for transport , building and housing wolfgang tiefensee at the official reopening ceremony for the bode museum .
he made no effort to disguise his delight at the nature of his first public engagement since taking office .
the restoration project , which was completed within the 152 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- budget and in the foreseen five and a half years time frame , brings the museum island in central berlin one step closer to its former dazzling glory .
bildunterschrift : after years of reconstruction , the museum is ready again tiefensee was not the only one singing the museum 's praises during the ceremony .
klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage was positively effervescent in his description of what makes the restored building so stunning , citing " the impressive renaissance and baroque forms , original features and use of colors and materials . "
a fragmented past from its place at the northern-most tip of the museum island where it sits perched imposingly above the spree river , the bode museum looks every bit a water palace .
the original building project , inspired by wilhelm bode , then general director of the royal museums of prussia , stems from 1880 .
the neo-baroque beauty with its twin cupolas was built by royal court architect ernst-eberhard ihne and opened by prussian king william ii as the kaiser-friedrich-museum in 1904 .
much of the museum was destroyed during the second world war , and had , by the end of the 1940s been earmarked for complete demolition .
an active citizens ' movement managed to prevent its fate from being sealed in a pile of rubble , and between the beginning of the 1950s to the mid-1980s , the building , which was renamed bode museum in 1956 , underwent a patchwork restoration effort .
but it was n't until after the fall of the berlin wall that it got the full treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum was built in the late 19th century when the museum island was granted a place on the unesco list of world cultural heritage sites , the federal and state governments hatched a master plan worth billions to completely renovate the five buildings on the slim strip of land positioned in the middle of the spree river .
speaking at the official opening this week , state secretary for culture bernd neumann said it was an " essential and pleasurable task " to maintain and hand on the restored complex to the next generation .
attention to detail the complete overhaul of the 25,000-square-meter -lrb- 82,000-square-foot -rrb- building not only included fitting modern security and sanitary technology , but restoration of the detail which lent the museum its charm 100 years ago .
many décor elements which were damaged or destroyed during the war have been redone or replaced , and an ornate rococo room was completely reconstructed on the strength of an old photo from pre-war days .
in the coming months , the high , bright rooms will be filled with exhibits from the end of antiquity to the middle of the 18th century .
from sculptures to icons and ivory to works by the old masters , the museum will house pieces of art which have been hidden away for long enough .
visitors will have a chance to preview the museum over the weekend , and it will be opened permanently from summer 2006 . silke bartlick -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's world cultural heritage sites during travels through germany , many tourists focus on the cultural aspects of the country .

" osthoff had worked on a german excavation of the 4,000-year-old isin site from the mid-1970s until the late 1980s , when un sanctions forced most foreign experts out of the country . in may 2003 , two months after the united states and britain invaded iraq , osthoff brought reporters to isin to show them how iraq 's most important sites were being destroyed by looters . " in two weeks , they have ruined all the work that was done over 15 years , " osthoff told the new york times . osthoff 's mother , in an interview with reuters television , said her daughter gave iraq and its culture her " body and soul . " " she helped show the americans what was happening to iraq 's cultural sites , " ingrid hala said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still from the video the hostage takers released shortly after midnight on tuesday , hala received news from the german foreign ministry that osthoff had been kidnapped in iraq and was being held by gunmen .
they were threatening to kill her if germany did not end its cooperation with the iraqi government . an image from a tape brought to german state broadcaster ard showed two blindfolded people sitting on the ground surrounded by three armed , masked men .
one held a rocket-propelled grenade launcher ; another read from a piece of paper . the fate of margaret hassan ? germany 's new chancellor angela merkel has vowed to everything within her power to save osthoff and her driver . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel speaking about the hostage crisis on tuesday one german official told the reuters news agency that they did not want her to end up like margaret hassan , a british aid worker who was kidnapped and killed last year by militants in iraq . like osthoff , hassan spoke arabic , had spent decades in iraq and had devoted her life to the country .
hassan had also criticised both the pre-war un sanctions and the invasion . osthoff witnessed iraqis suffering during and after the war , which prompted her to turn to relief work .
a converted muslim , she began working as volunteer in iraqi hospitals . but like many foreigners in iraq , where bomb attacks and kidnappings are commonplace , osthoff lived in fear for her life and often travelled with armed guards . germany 's neue osnabrücker zeitung daily said in a press release that osthoff told the paper in october she had been threatened by people close to the leader of al qaeda in iraq , abu musab al-zarqawi , who has claimed responsibility for the murder of numerous hostages in iraq . islam experts say the lives of osthoff and her driver are very much in danger . henner fürtig of the german orient institute in hamburg called the danger level " acute . "
sonja hegasy of the berlin-based modern orient center shares that view , adding however that the chances of a peaceful resolution to the crisis is greater than it would be if osthoff were a national of a country that directly supported the us in the iraq war . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel urges kidnappers to release german detained in iraq new german chancellor angela merkel said that her government was doing everything in its power to secure the release of a german archeologist believed kidnapped in iraq and urged her captors to let her go .

it 's the second of the five architectural gems on the city 's museum island to be given a complete facelift . " this is a wonderful day for berlin , a wonderful day for germany and for the museums of the world , " were the words spoken by art-lover and new minister for transport , building and housing wolfgang tiefensee at the official reopening ceremony for the bode museum .
he made no effort to disguise his delight at the nature of his first public engagement since taking office .
the restoration project , which was completed within the 152 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- budget and in the foreseen five and a half years time frame , brings the museum island in central berlin one step closer to its former dazzling glory .
bildunterschrift : after years of reconstruction , the museum is ready again tiefensee was not the only one singing the museum 's praises during the ceremony .
klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage was positively effervescent in his description of what makes the restored building so stunning , citing " the impressive renaissance and baroque forms , original features and use of colors and materials . "
a fragmented past from its place at the northern-most tip of the museum island where it sits perched imposingly above the spree river , the bode museum looks every bit a water palace .
the original building project , inspired by wilhelm bode , then general director of the royal museums of prussia , stems from 1880 .
the neo-baroque beauty with its twin cupolas was built by royal court architect ernst-eberhard ihne and opened by prussian king william ii as the kaiser-friedrich-museum in 1904 .
much of the museum was destroyed during the second world war , and had , by the end of the 1940s been earmarked for complete demolition .
an active citizens ' movement managed to prevent its fate from being sealed in a pile of rubble , and between the beginning of the 1950s to the mid-1980s , the building , which was renamed bode museum in 1956 , underwent a patchwork restoration effort .
but it was n't until after the fall of the berlin wall that it got the full treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum was built in the late 19th century when the museum island was granted a place on the unesco list of world cultural heritage sites , the federal and state governments hatched a master plan worth billions to completely renovate the five buildings on the slim strip of land positioned in the middle of the spree river .
speaking at the official opening this week , state secretary for culture bernd neumann said it was an " essential and pleasurable task " to maintain and hand on the restored complex to the next generation .
attention to detail the complete overhaul of the 25,000-square-meter -lrb- 82,000-square-foot -rrb- building not only included fitting modern security and sanitary technology , but restoration of the detail which lent the museum its charm 100 years ago .
many décor elements which were damaged or destroyed during the war have been redone or replaced , and an ornate rococo room was completely reconstructed on the strength of an old photo from pre-war days .
in the coming months , the high , bright rooms will be filled with exhibits from the end of antiquity to the middle of the 18th century .
from sculptures to icons and ivory to works by the old masters , the museum will house pieces of art which have been hidden away for long enough .
visitors will have a chance to preview the museum over the weekend , and it will be opened permanently from summer 2006 . silke bartlick -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's world cultural heritage sites during travels through germany , many tourists focus on the cultural aspects of the country .

a robber in cologne almost bungled a simple hold-up when his attempted armed robbery got off to a very inauspicious start .
the man entered a newsagent in the city and made demands to the cashier , 24-year-old michaela sobor .
but the robber had bound his face so tightly with a scarf that his agitated commands were unintelligible .
victim had no idea what was being said after a number of confused seconds where victim and perpetrator stared vacantly at each other , sobor had to ask the robber to repeat himself , which he did but to yet still no avail .

" the biggest surprise of my lifetime is freedom , " she said , saying she had never expected to see the other side of the berlin wall before she retired . " let us dare to have more freedom , " she said , including more opportunities for germans to pursue their hopes for prosperity .
" who would have thought that the highest governmental office would be given to a woman this year already ? "
merkel said . turning to economic issues , merkel told parliament that her left-right government would return the country to its status as an economic powerhouse .
" we want to create the conditions for germany to be among the top three in europe in 10 years " in terms of economic growth , she said in the keenly awaited address . merkel took office last week in a coalition with her conservative christian democrats and her predecessor gerhard schröder 's social democrats with a mandate to slash the 11-percent unemployment rate , jumpstart the moribund economy and tame the spiraling public deficit .
she wasted no time in painting a picture of a country on the ropes , but one more than capable of fighting back . merkel urges germany to take its foot off the brakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany may be on the ropes , merkel says , but it can fight back " our growth has n't picked up in years .
our debt has risen to alarming levels .
the new -lrb- eastern -rrb- states stopped catching up years ago , " merkel said .
but she said her coalition government had a unique opportunity to solve these problems if it worked together .
" a government of action will have to take some blows .
but we will show one thing : we have major potential in our country .
germany is full of opportunities - inside and outside . " " one thing is clear : we all bear responsibility for the fact that we are not using our opportunities to the full .
let us release the brakes on growth ...
let us show what is possible , " she said . " we want to get the labor market in shape , we want to make our schools and universities world-class , we want to bring the deficit under control and repair our health , pension and nursing systems , " she said to applause . germany to work with eu within limits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel told parliament that germany would not carry the eu burden merkel also pledged that her government would try to find a compromise with the european union over its 2007-2013 budget .
but she warned that germany would not accept too great a burden , adding that she would press for a " lasting solution which is in the pan-european interest " at the crucial eu summit in december . " germany is prepared to contribute to a sensible compromise , " she said but added that germany 's " frightening " debt levels meant the economy would not be able to tolerate new budget obligations .
the last eu summit in june ended in stalemate and recriminations over a proposed 1.06 percent budget spending cap . merkel also used the address to reiterate her stance on the kidnapping of susanne osthoff , the german national taken captive a few days ago in iraq .
the chancellor told the assembly that germany would not bow to the captors .
" we will not be blackmailed , " merkel said .
" we can not fail in our fight against terrorism . " hostage stance reiterated , terrorism condemned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german archeologist susanne osthoff was abducted in iraq this week merkel added that her government " was aiming all its efforts at protecting the lives of susanne osthoff and her driver " and reiterated that she " strongly " condemned the hostage-taking , saying that the government " will do all it can to bring them to safety as soon as possible . " the chancellor told parliament that international terrorism was the biggest challenge facing the international community : " it is directed at everything that is important to us , at the core of our civilization .
it is directed against our entire value system ; against freedom , tolerance and the respect of human dignity , democracy and the rule of law . " " one thing is clear : this government , this parliament will not let itself be pressured . " merkel speaks of open dialogue with islam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel encouraged dialogue but condemned honor killings and forced marriage during her speech , merkel also addressed the topic of islam and pledged an " open and honest " dialogue with the islamic world .
" dialogue with islam carries great significance … we have to learn to understand each other , " she said .
" we will do this in an open and honest way .
we will not brush aside differences , but name them clearly . " while attempting to open the way for communication , merkel denounced forced marriages and so-called honor killings .
" i say this explicitly , as chancellor and also as a woman , that forced marriages or honor killings - both , by the way , awful words - have nothing , completely nothing , to do with honor and also no place at all in our society , " she said .
" we can not tolerate them . " but merkel stressed that in general " germany is a tolerant and cosmopolitan country " and pledged to defend the rights of all minority groups . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel urges kidnappers to release german detained in iraq new german chancellor angela merkel said that her government was doing everything in its power to secure the release of a german archeologist believed kidnapped in iraq and urged her captors to let her go .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : a new thaw ahead for german-american relations the rocky german-american landscape germany 's image in us improved , study shows germany 's jung promises improved relations with washington merkel critical of us terror tactics ahead of washington visit germany -pipe- 30.11.2005 opinion : germany 's steinmeier makes his mark in washington großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier paves the way for new , improved german-us relations foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's first us visit was overshadowed by reports of torture linked to cia flights in europe .
dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says us-german relations are strong enough to cope . steinmeier 's first day in washington as the fresh face of germany was not the debut he might have wished for .
news of the kidnapped german archaeologist in iraq meant he spent much of the day locked in telephone conferences with a diplomatic crisis management team back in berlin .
in addition , the germans found themselves relying on the us for logistical support in the very place where berlin had refused to back washington in its hour of need . and that was not all .
the day was accompanied by continuing allegations of secret cia prisoner transports through europe with stopovers at german airports .
but even against this harsh backdrop steinmeier was able to master the situation with professionalism and diplomatic calm .
the americans , whose knowledge and contacts in iraq could be of live-saving importance , immediately agreed to help with intelligence on the kidnapping .
taking europe more seriously that was just the first sign of a change in relations between the two countries .
steinmeier and his us counterpart condoleezza rice proved in the way they addressed the allegations against the cia that berlin and washington are now back on a strong footing .
as the foreign minister candidly raised the issue , rice assured him and the eu of swift clarification .
exactly what she will say remains to be seen , but what is clear is that not so very long ago , washington would have been unlikely to tolerate germany poking its nose in where it was not welcome .
but now the white house seems to again take european worries over human rights issues and international treaties seriously . bush under mounting pressure the show of good will on both sides is not merely a coincidence .
increasing pressure from the american public to withdraw us troops from iraq is forcing president george bush 's government out of its bubble .
washington needs nato in order to relieve the burden on its iraq activities , and germany knows there is no need to change tack on its own refusal to send troops to iraq .
supporting the training of iraqi troops is an important task if the iraqis are to be maneuvered into a position from which they can control their own troops . whether frank-walter steinmeier will follow the path of skepticism towards the us so well-worn by gerhard schröder or adopt the softer line touted by angela merkel is an idle question .
the situation on the world stage is such that the two sides will have to work together , and in one short visit , steinmeier has already proved that a sensible dialogue in a businesslike and friendly tone is more helpful than the nurturing of animosity . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel seeks stronger ties with us , smaller eu states german chancellor angela merkel said she aims to bolster ties with the united states and smaller eu states .
the statements come as her foreign minister begins a trip to the us .

a robber in cologne almost bungled a simple hold-up when his attempted armed robbery got off to a very inauspicious start .
the man entered a newsagent in the city and made demands to the cashier , 24-year-old michaela sobor .
but the robber had bound his face so tightly with a scarf that his agitated commands were unintelligible .
victim had no idea what was being said after a number of confused seconds where victim and perpetrator stared vacantly at each other , sobor had to ask the robber to repeat himself , which he did but to yet still no avail .
" i did n't realize it was a robbery , i just thought he had wrapped himself up warm because of the cold weather , " the cashier said .
the robber 's frustration obviously boiled over at this point and he abandoned his demands and forced his way behind the counter , brandishing his gun for the first time since the farcical hold-up began .
it was only then did sobor realize that she was being robbed .
the man was able to make off with over almost 1,500 euros in cash .
police are now asking for witnesses to come forward to help in their investigation . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mommy 's boy thief nabbed calling home a german security guard who made off with a substantial sum destined for a bank was eventually caught following a 10-day manhunt by interpol agents - after calling home to his mom from a croatian beach resort .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.11.2005 berlin reveals cultural gem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors can soon get a sneak preview of the fruits of hard labor after years of painstaking restoration , berlin 's bode museum is gearing up to reopen its doors to visitors .
it 's the second of the five architectural gems on the city 's museum island to be given a complete facelift . " this is a wonderful day for berlin , a wonderful day for germany and for the museums of the world , " were the words spoken by art-lover and new minister for transport , building and housing wolfgang tiefensee at the official reopening ceremony for the bode museum .
he made no effort to disguise his delight at the nature of his first public engagement since taking office .
the restoration project , which was completed within the 152 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- budget and in the foreseen five and a half years time frame , brings the museum island in central berlin one step closer to its former dazzling glory .
bildunterschrift : after years of reconstruction , the museum is ready again tiefensee was not the only one singing the museum 's praises during the ceremony .
klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage was positively effervescent in his description of what makes the restored building so stunning , citing " the impressive renaissance and baroque forms , original features and use of colors and materials . "
a fragmented past from its place at the northern-most tip of the museum island where it sits perched imposingly above the spree river , the bode museum looks every bit a water palace .
the original building project , inspired by wilhelm bode , then general director of the royal museums of prussia , stems from 1880 .
the neo-baroque beauty with its twin cupolas was built by royal court architect ernst-eberhard ihne and opened by prussian king william ii as the kaiser-friedrich-museum in 1904 .
much of the museum was destroyed during the second world war , and had , by the end of the 1940s been earmarked for complete demolition .
an active citizens ' movement managed to prevent its fate from being sealed in a pile of rubble , and between the beginning of the 1950s to the mid-1980s , the building , which was renamed bode museum in 1956 , underwent a patchwork restoration effort .
but it was n't until after the fall of the berlin wall that it got the full treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum was built in the late 19th century when the museum island was granted a place on the unesco list of world cultural heritage sites , the federal and state governments hatched a master plan worth billions to completely renovate the five buildings on the slim strip of land positioned in the middle of the spree river .
speaking at the official opening this week , state secretary for culture bernd neumann said it was an " essential and pleasurable task " to maintain and hand on the restored complex to the next generation .
attention to detail the complete overhaul of the 25,000-square-meter -lrb- 82,000-square-foot -rrb- building not only included fitting modern security and sanitary technology , but restoration of the detail which lent the museum its charm 100 years ago .
many décor elements which were damaged or destroyed during the war have been redone or replaced , and an ornate rococo room was completely reconstructed on the strength of an old photo from pre-war days .
in the coming months , the high , bright rooms will be filled with exhibits from the end of antiquity to the middle of the 18th century .
from sculptures to icons and ivory to works by the old masters , the museum will house pieces of art which have been hidden away for long enough .
visitors will have a chance to preview the museum over the weekend , and it will be opened permanently from summer 2006 . silke bartlick -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's world cultural heritage sites during travels through germany , many tourists focus on the cultural aspects of the country .

" the biggest surprise of my lifetime is freedom , " she said , saying she had never expected to see the other side of the berlin wall before she retired . " let us dare to have more freedom , " she said , including more opportunities for germans to pursue their hopes for prosperity .
" who would have thought that the highest governmental office would be given to a woman this year already ? "
merkel said . turning to economic issues , merkel told parliament that her left-right government would return the country to its status as an economic powerhouse .
" we want to create the conditions for germany to be among the top three in europe in 10 years " in terms of economic growth , she said in the keenly awaited address . merkel took office last week in a coalition with her conservative christian democrats and her predecessor gerhard schröder 's social democrats with a mandate to slash the 11-percent unemployment rate , jumpstart the moribund economy and tame the spiraling public deficit .
she wasted no time in painting a picture of a country on the ropes , but one more than capable of fighting back . merkel urges germany to take its foot off the brakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany may be on the ropes , merkel says , but it can fight back " our growth has n't picked up in years .
our debt has risen to alarming levels .
the new -lrb- eastern -rrb- states stopped catching up years ago , " merkel said .
but she said her coalition government had a unique opportunity to solve these problems if it worked together .
" a government of action will have to take some blows .
but we will show one thing : we have major potential in our country .
germany is full of opportunities - inside and outside . " " one thing is clear : we all bear responsibility for the fact that we are not using our opportunities to the full .
let us release the brakes on growth ...
let us show what is possible , " she said . " we want to get the labor market in shape , we want to make our schools and universities world-class , we want to bring the deficit under control and repair our health , pension and nursing systems , " she said to applause . germany to work with eu within limits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel told parliament that germany would not carry the eu burden merkel also pledged that her government would try to find a compromise with the european union over its 2007-2013 budget .
but she warned that germany would not accept too great a burden , adding that she would press for a " lasting solution which is in the pan-european interest " at the crucial eu summit in december . " germany is prepared to contribute to a sensible compromise , " she said but added that germany 's " frightening " debt levels meant the economy would not be able to tolerate new budget obligations .
the last eu summit in june ended in stalemate and recriminations over a proposed 1.06 percent budget spending cap . merkel also used the address to reiterate her stance on the kidnapping of susanne osthoff , the german national taken captive a few days ago in iraq .
the chancellor told the assembly that germany would not bow to the captors .
" we will not be blackmailed , " merkel said .
" we can not fail in our fight against terrorism . " hostage stance reiterated , terrorism condemned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german archeologist susanne osthoff was abducted in iraq this week merkel added that her government " was aiming all its efforts at protecting the lives of susanne osthoff and her driver " and reiterated that she " strongly " condemned the hostage-taking , saying that the government " will do all it can to bring them to safety as soon as possible . " the chancellor told parliament that international terrorism was the biggest challenge facing the international community : " it is directed at everything that is important to us , at the core of our civilization .
it is directed against our entire value system ; against freedom , tolerance and the respect of human dignity , democracy and the rule of law . " " one thing is clear : this government , this parliament will not let itself be pressured . " merkel speaks of open dialogue with islam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel encouraged dialogue but condemned honor killings and forced marriage during her speech , merkel also addressed the topic of islam and pledged an " open and honest " dialogue with the islamic world .
" dialogue with islam carries great significance … we have to learn to understand each other , " she said .
" we will do this in an open and honest way .
we will not brush aside differences , but name them clearly . " while attempting to open the way for communication , merkel denounced forced marriages and so-called honor killings .
" i say this explicitly , as chancellor and also as a woman , that forced marriages or honor killings - both , by the way , awful words - have nothing , completely nothing , to do with honor and also no place at all in our society , " she said .
" we can not tolerate them . " but merkel stressed that in general " germany is a tolerant and cosmopolitan country " and pledged to defend the rights of all minority groups . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel urges kidnappers to release german detained in iraq new german chancellor angela merkel said that her government was doing everything in its power to secure the release of a german archeologist believed kidnapped in iraq and urged her captors to let her go .

it 's the second of the five architectural gems on the city 's museum island to be given a complete facelift . " this is a wonderful day for berlin , a wonderful day for germany and for the museums of the world , " were the words spoken by art-lover and new minister for transport , building and housing wolfgang tiefensee at the official reopening ceremony for the bode museum .
he made no effort to disguise his delight at the nature of his first public engagement since taking office .
the restoration project , which was completed within the 152 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- budget and in the foreseen five and a half years time frame , brings the museum island in central berlin one step closer to its former dazzling glory .
bildunterschrift : after years of reconstruction , the museum is ready again tiefensee was not the only one singing the museum 's praises during the ceremony .
klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage was positively effervescent in his description of what makes the restored building so stunning , citing " the impressive renaissance and baroque forms , original features and use of colors and materials . "
a fragmented past from its place at the northern-most tip of the museum island where it sits perched imposingly above the spree river , the bode museum looks every bit a water palace .
the original building project , inspired by wilhelm bode , then general director of the royal museums of prussia , stems from 1880 .
the neo-baroque beauty with its twin cupolas was built by royal court architect ernst-eberhard ihne and opened by prussian king william ii as the kaiser-friedrich-museum in 1904 .
much of the museum was destroyed during the second world war , and had , by the end of the 1940s been earmarked for complete demolition .
an active citizens ' movement managed to prevent its fate from being sealed in a pile of rubble , and between the beginning of the 1950s to the mid-1980s , the building , which was renamed bode museum in 1956 , underwent a patchwork restoration effort .
but it was n't until after the fall of the berlin wall that it got the full treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum was built in the late 19th century when the museum island was granted a place on the unesco list of world cultural heritage sites , the federal and state governments hatched a master plan worth billions to completely renovate the five buildings on the slim strip of land positioned in the middle of the spree river .
speaking at the official opening this week , state secretary for culture bernd neumann said it was an " essential and pleasurable task " to maintain and hand on the restored complex to the next generation .

many décor elements which were damaged or destroyed during the war have been redone or replaced , and an ornate rococo room was completely reconstructed on the strength of an old photo from pre-war days .
in the coming months , the high , bright rooms will be filled with exhibits from the end of antiquity to the middle of the 18th century .
from sculptures to icons and ivory to works by the old masters , the museum will house pieces of art which have been hidden away for long enough .

it 's the second of the five architectural gems on the city 's museum island to be given a complete facelift . " this is a wonderful day for berlin , a wonderful day for germany and for the museums of the world , " were the words spoken by art-lover and new minister for transport , building and housing wolfgang tiefensee at the official reopening ceremony for the bode museum .
he made no effort to disguise his delight at the nature of his first public engagement since taking office .
the restoration project , which was completed within the 152 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- budget and in the foreseen five and a half years time frame , brings the museum island in central berlin one step closer to its former dazzling glory .
bildunterschrift : after years of reconstruction , the museum is ready again tiefensee was not the only one singing the museum 's praises during the ceremony .
klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage was positively effervescent in his description of what makes the restored building so stunning , citing " the impressive renaissance and baroque forms , original features and use of colors and materials . "
a fragmented past from its place at the northern-most tip of the museum island where it sits perched imposingly above the spree river , the bode museum looks every bit a water palace .
the original building project , inspired by wilhelm bode , then general director of the royal museums of prussia , stems from 1880 .
the neo-baroque beauty with its twin cupolas was built by royal court architect ernst-eberhard ihne and opened by prussian king william ii as the kaiser-friedrich-museum in 1904 .
much of the museum was destroyed during the second world war , and had , by the end of the 1940s been earmarked for complete demolition .
an active citizens ' movement managed to prevent its fate from being sealed in a pile of rubble , and between the beginning of the 1950s to the mid-1980s , the building , which was renamed bode museum in 1956 , underwent a patchwork restoration effort .
but it was n't until after the fall of the berlin wall that it got the full treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum was built in the late 19th century when the museum island was granted a place on the unesco list of world cultural heritage sites , the federal and state governments hatched a master plan worth billions to completely renovate the five buildings on the slim strip of land positioned in the middle of the spree river .
speaking at the official opening this week , state secretary for culture bernd neumann said it was an " essential and pleasurable task " to maintain and hand on the restored complex to the next generation .
attention to detail the complete overhaul of the 25,000-square-meter -lrb- 82,000-square-foot -rrb- building not only included fitting modern security and sanitary technology , but restoration of the detail which lent the museum its charm 100 years ago .
many décor elements which were damaged or destroyed during the war have been redone or replaced , and an ornate rococo room was completely reconstructed on the strength of an old photo from pre-war days .
in the coming months , the high , bright rooms will be filled with exhibits from the end of antiquity to the middle of the 18th century .
from sculptures to icons and ivory to works by the old masters , the museum will house pieces of art which have been hidden away for long enough .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.11.2005 berlin reveals cultural gem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors can soon get a sneak preview of the fruits of hard labor after years of painstaking restoration , berlin 's bode museum is gearing up to reopen its doors to visitors .
it 's the second of the five architectural gems on the city 's museum island to be given a complete facelift . " this is a wonderful day for berlin , a wonderful day for germany and for the museums of the world , " were the words spoken by art-lover and new minister for transport , building and housing wolfgang tiefensee at the official reopening ceremony for the bode museum .
he made no effort to disguise his delight at the nature of his first public engagement since taking office .
the restoration project , which was completed within the 152 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- budget and in the foreseen five and a half years time frame , brings the museum island in central berlin one step closer to its former dazzling glory .
bildunterschrift : after years of reconstruction , the museum is ready again tiefensee was not the only one singing the museum 's praises during the ceremony .
klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage was positively effervescent in his description of what makes the restored building so stunning , citing " the impressive renaissance and baroque forms , original features and use of colors and materials . "
a fragmented past from its place at the northern-most tip of the museum island where it sits perched imposingly above the spree river , the bode museum looks every bit a water palace .
the original building project , inspired by wilhelm bode , then general director of the royal museums of prussia , stems from 1880 .
the neo-baroque beauty with its twin cupolas was built by royal court architect ernst-eberhard ihne and opened by prussian king william ii as the kaiser-friedrich-museum in 1904 .
much of the museum was destroyed during the second world war , and had , by the end of the 1940s been earmarked for complete demolition .
an active citizens ' movement managed to prevent its fate from being sealed in a pile of rubble , and between the beginning of the 1950s to the mid-1980s , the building , which was renamed bode museum in 1956 , underwent a patchwork restoration effort .
but it was n't until after the fall of the berlin wall that it got the full treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum was built in the late 19th century when the museum island was granted a place on the unesco list of world cultural heritage sites , the federal and state governments hatched a master plan worth billions to completely renovate the five buildings on the slim strip of land positioned in the middle of the spree river .
speaking at the official opening this week , state secretary for culture bernd neumann said it was an " essential and pleasurable task " to maintain and hand on the restored complex to the next generation .
attention to detail the complete overhaul of the 25,000-square-meter -lrb- 82,000-square-foot -rrb- building not only included fitting modern security and sanitary technology , but restoration of the detail which lent the museum its charm 100 years ago .
many décor elements which were damaged or destroyed during the war have been redone or replaced , and an ornate rococo room was completely reconstructed on the strength of an old photo from pre-war days .
in the coming months , the high , bright rooms will be filled with exhibits from the end of antiquity to the middle of the 18th century .
from sculptures to icons and ivory to works by the old masters , the museum will house pieces of art which have been hidden away for long enough .
visitors will have a chance to preview the museum over the weekend , and it will be opened permanently from summer 2006 . silke bartlick -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's world cultural heritage sites during travels through germany , many tourists focus on the cultural aspects of the country .

" we see no reason to change this law , " the commission 's delegation in bucharest said in a statement .
a moratorium on adoptions has been in effect since 2001.the law came about after pressure from the eu , which told bucharest to end " the exportation of children " through numerous international adoptions over the past few years and to quickly institute a system for protecting minors in accordance with european norms .
romania is slated to join the european union in 2007 provided it satisfies all eu criteria .
but the european parliament 's representative to romania , pierre moscovici , has called on the eastern european country to settle " as soon as possible requests for international adoptions that were filed before the moratorium in 2001 , in consideration of the emotional suffering of adoptive parents . "
in october , some 20 foreign couples sought to take up permanent residence in romania so they could adopt children .
the couples are already foster parents who " have been entrusted with romanian children for several years .
over time , a deep affection has been established between the foreigners and the children , " theodora bertzi , head of the romanian office for adoptions , said in october .
foreign residents may adopt the majority of those on the list seeking adoptions , 11 couples , come from the united states .
the other couples come from european countries including germany , the netherlands , italy , switzerland and britain , as well as from canada and south africa .
" these couples have the possibility of adopting a romanian child , once they obtain a romanian residence permit , " bertzi said , but even this is no guarantee .
the new romanian law states that adoption is " the last recourse " in protecting children who are orphans or have been abandoned , and it gives " absolute priority " to romanian couples .
us officials have criticized the new romanian law , claiming that children remain in orphanages because there are not enough romanian parents who have the means or the desire to adopt a child .
with the aid from the eu , unicef and several international associations , romania has reduced the number of orphans in the country to less than 40,000 , as the children have been accepted by romanian families who receive financial support from the state . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de adopting a new attitude towards children the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .

the new romanian law states that adoption is " the last recourse " in protecting children who are orphans or have been abandoned , and it gives " absolute priority " to romanian couples .
us officials have criticized the new romanian law , claiming that children remain in orphanages because there are not enough romanian parents who have the means or the desire to adopt a child .

" we see no reason to change this law , " the commission 's delegation in bucharest said in a statement .
a moratorium on adoptions has been in effect since 2001.the law came about after pressure from the eu , which told bucharest to end " the exportation of children " through numerous international adoptions over the past few years and to quickly institute a system for protecting minors in accordance with european norms .
romania is slated to join the european union in 2007 provided it satisfies all eu criteria .
but the european parliament 's representative to romania , pierre moscovici , has called on the eastern european country to settle " as soon as possible requests for international adoptions that were filed before the moratorium in 2001 , in consideration of the emotional suffering of adoptive parents . "
in october , some 20 foreign couples sought to take up permanent residence in romania so they could adopt children .
the couples are already foster parents who " have been entrusted with romanian children for several years .
over time , a deep affection has been established between the foreigners and the children , " theodora bertzi , head of the romanian office for adoptions , said in october .
foreign residents may adopt the majority of those on the list seeking adoptions , 11 couples , come from the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : a new thaw ahead for german-american relations the rocky german-american landscape germany 's image in us improved , study shows germany 's jung promises improved relations with washington merkel critical of us terror tactics ahead of washington visit germany -pipe- 30.11.2005 opinion : germany 's steinmeier makes his mark in washington großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier paves the way for new , improved german-us relations foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's first us visit was overshadowed by reports of torture linked to cia flights in europe .
dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says us-german relations are strong enough to cope . steinmeier 's first day in washington as the fresh face of germany was not the debut he might have wished for .
news of the kidnapped german archaeologist in iraq meant he spent much of the day locked in telephone conferences with a diplomatic crisis management team back in berlin .
in addition , the germans found themselves relying on the us for logistical support in the very place where berlin had refused to back washington in its hour of need . and that was not all .
the day was accompanied by continuing allegations of secret cia prisoner transports through europe with stopovers at german airports .
but even against this harsh backdrop steinmeier was able to master the situation with professionalism and diplomatic calm .
the americans , whose knowledge and contacts in iraq could be of live-saving importance , immediately agreed to help with intelligence on the kidnapping .
taking europe more seriously that was just the first sign of a change in relations between the two countries .
steinmeier and his us counterpart condoleezza rice proved in the way they addressed the allegations against the cia that berlin and washington are now back on a strong footing .
as the foreign minister candidly raised the issue , rice assured him and the eu of swift clarification .
exactly what she will say remains to be seen , but what is clear is that not so very long ago , washington would have been unlikely to tolerate germany poking its nose in where it was not welcome .
but now the white house seems to again take european worries over human rights issues and international treaties seriously . bush under mounting pressure the show of good will on both sides is not merely a coincidence .
increasing pressure from the american public to withdraw us troops from iraq is forcing president george bush 's government out of its bubble .
washington needs nato in order to relieve the burden on its iraq activities , and germany knows there is no need to change tack on its own refusal to send troops to iraq .
supporting the training of iraqi troops is an important task if the iraqis are to be maneuvered into a position from which they can control their own troops . whether frank-walter steinmeier will follow the path of skepticism towards the us so well-worn by gerhard schröder or adopt the softer line touted by angela merkel is an idle question .
the situation on the world stage is such that the two sides will have to work together , and in one short visit , steinmeier has already proved that a sensible dialogue in a businesslike and friendly tone is more helpful than the nurturing of animosity . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel seeks stronger ties with us , smaller eu states german chancellor angela merkel said she aims to bolster ties with the united states and smaller eu states .
the statements come as her foreign minister begins a trip to the us .

it 's the second of the five architectural gems on the city 's museum island to be given a complete facelift . " this is a wonderful day for berlin , a wonderful day for germany and for the museums of the world , " were the words spoken by art-lover and new minister for transport , building and housing wolfgang tiefensee at the official reopening ceremony for the bode museum .
he made no effort to disguise his delight at the nature of his first public engagement since taking office .
the restoration project , which was completed within the 152 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- budget and in the foreseen five and a half years time frame , brings the museum island in central berlin one step closer to its former dazzling glory .
bildunterschrift : after years of reconstruction , the museum is ready again tiefensee was not the only one singing the museum 's praises during the ceremony .
klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage was positively effervescent in his description of what makes the restored building so stunning , citing " the impressive renaissance and baroque forms , original features and use of colors and materials . "
a fragmented past from its place at the northern-most tip of the museum island where it sits perched imposingly above the spree river , the bode museum looks every bit a water palace .
the original building project , inspired by wilhelm bode , then general director of the royal museums of prussia , stems from 1880 .
the neo-baroque beauty with its twin cupolas was built by royal court architect ernst-eberhard ihne and opened by prussian king william ii as the kaiser-friedrich-museum in 1904 .
much of the museum was destroyed during the second world war , and had , by the end of the 1940s been earmarked for complete demolition .
an active citizens ' movement managed to prevent its fate from being sealed in a pile of rubble , and between the beginning of the 1950s to the mid-1980s , the building , which was renamed bode museum in 1956 , underwent a patchwork restoration effort .
but it was n't until after the fall of the berlin wall that it got the full treatment .

many décor elements which were damaged or destroyed during the war have been redone or replaced , and an ornate rococo room was completely reconstructed on the strength of an old photo from pre-war days .
in the coming months , the high , bright rooms will be filled with exhibits from the end of antiquity to the middle of the 18th century .
from sculptures to icons and ivory to works by the old masters , the museum will house pieces of art which have been hidden away for long enough .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.11.2005 berlin reveals cultural gem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors can soon get a sneak preview of the fruits of hard labor after years of painstaking restoration , berlin 's bode museum is gearing up to reopen its doors to visitors .
it 's the second of the five architectural gems on the city 's museum island to be given a complete facelift . " this is a wonderful day for berlin , a wonderful day for germany and for the museums of the world , " were the words spoken by art-lover and new minister for transport , building and housing wolfgang tiefensee at the official reopening ceremony for the bode museum .
he made no effort to disguise his delight at the nature of his first public engagement since taking office .
the restoration project , which was completed within the 152 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- budget and in the foreseen five and a half years time frame , brings the museum island in central berlin one step closer to its former dazzling glory .
bildunterschrift : after years of reconstruction , the museum is ready again tiefensee was not the only one singing the museum 's praises during the ceremony .
klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage was positively effervescent in his description of what makes the restored building so stunning , citing " the impressive renaissance and baroque forms , original features and use of colors and materials . "
a fragmented past from its place at the northern-most tip of the museum island where it sits perched imposingly above the spree river , the bode museum looks every bit a water palace .
the original building project , inspired by wilhelm bode , then general director of the royal museums of prussia , stems from 1880 .
the neo-baroque beauty with its twin cupolas was built by royal court architect ernst-eberhard ihne and opened by prussian king william ii as the kaiser-friedrich-museum in 1904 .
much of the museum was destroyed during the second world war , and had , by the end of the 1940s been earmarked for complete demolition .
an active citizens ' movement managed to prevent its fate from being sealed in a pile of rubble , and between the beginning of the 1950s to the mid-1980s , the building , which was renamed bode museum in 1956 , underwent a patchwork restoration effort .
but it was n't until after the fall of the berlin wall that it got the full treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum was built in the late 19th century when the museum island was granted a place on the unesco list of world cultural heritage sites , the federal and state governments hatched a master plan worth billions to completely renovate the five buildings on the slim strip of land positioned in the middle of the spree river .
speaking at the official opening this week , state secretary for culture bernd neumann said it was an " essential and pleasurable task " to maintain and hand on the restored complex to the next generation .
attention to detail the complete overhaul of the 25,000-square-meter -lrb- 82,000-square-foot -rrb- building not only included fitting modern security and sanitary technology , but restoration of the detail which lent the museum its charm 100 years ago .
many décor elements which were damaged or destroyed during the war have been redone or replaced , and an ornate rococo room was completely reconstructed on the strength of an old photo from pre-war days .
in the coming months , the high , bright rooms will be filled with exhibits from the end of antiquity to the middle of the 18th century .
from sculptures to icons and ivory to works by the old masters , the museum will house pieces of art which have been hidden away for long enough .
visitors will have a chance to preview the museum over the weekend , and it will be opened permanently from summer 2006 . silke bartlick -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's world cultural heritage sites during travels through germany , many tourists focus on the cultural aspects of the country .

a robber in cologne almost bungled a simple hold-up when his attempted armed robbery got off to a very inauspicious start .

" osthoff had worked on a german excavation of the 4,000-year-old isin site from the mid-1970s until the late 1980s , when un sanctions forced most foreign experts out of the country . in may 2003 , two months after the united states and britain invaded iraq , osthoff brought reporters to isin to show them how iraq 's most important sites were being destroyed by looters . " in two weeks , they have ruined all the work that was done over 15 years , " osthoff told the new york times . osthoff 's mother , in an interview with reuters television , said her daughter gave iraq and its culture her " body and soul . " " she helped show the americans what was happening to iraq 's cultural sites , " ingrid hala said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still from the video the hostage takers released shortly after midnight on tuesday , hala received news from the german foreign ministry that osthoff had been kidnapped in iraq and was being held by gunmen .
they were threatening to kill her if germany did not end its cooperation with the iraqi government . an image from a tape brought to german state broadcaster ard showed two blindfolded people sitting on the ground surrounded by three armed , masked men .
one held a rocket-propelled grenade launcher ; another read from a piece of paper . the fate of margaret hassan ? germany 's new chancellor angela merkel has vowed to everything within her power to save osthoff and her driver . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel speaking about the hostage crisis on tuesday one german official told the reuters news agency that they did not want her to end up like margaret hassan , a british aid worker who was kidnapped and killed last year by militants in iraq . like osthoff , hassan spoke arabic , had spent decades in iraq and had devoted her life to the country .
hassan had also criticised both the pre-war un sanctions and the invasion . osthoff witnessed iraqis suffering during and after the war , which prompted her to turn to relief work .
a converted muslim , she began working as volunteer in iraqi hospitals . but like many foreigners in iraq , where bomb attacks and kidnappings are commonplace , osthoff lived in fear for her life and often travelled with armed guards . germany 's neue osnabrücker zeitung daily said in a press release that osthoff told the paper in october she had been threatened by people close to the leader of al qaeda in iraq , abu musab al-zarqawi , who has claimed responsibility for the murder of numerous hostages in iraq . islam experts say the lives of osthoff and her driver are very much in danger . henner fürtig of the german orient institute in hamburg called the danger level " acute . "
sonja hegasy of the berlin-based modern orient center shares that view , adding however that the chances of a peaceful resolution to the crisis is greater than it would be if osthoff were a national of a country that directly supported the us in the iraq war . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel urges kidnappers to release german detained in iraq new german chancellor angela merkel said that her government was doing everything in its power to secure the release of a german archeologist believed kidnapped in iraq and urged her captors to let her go .

a robber in cologne almost bungled a simple hold-up when his attempted armed robbery got off to a very inauspicious start .

victim had no idea what was being said after a number of confused seconds where victim and perpetrator stared vacantly at each other , sobor had to ask the robber to repeat himself , which he did but to yet still no avail .
" i did n't realize it was a robbery , i just thought he had wrapped himself up warm because of the cold weather , " the cashier said .
the robber 's frustration obviously boiled over at this point and he abandoned his demands and forced his way behind the counter , brandishing his gun for the first time since the farcical hold-up began .

" the biggest surprise of my lifetime is freedom , " she said , saying she had never expected to see the other side of the berlin wall before she retired . " let us dare to have more freedom , " she said , including more opportunities for germans to pursue their hopes for prosperity .
" who would have thought that the highest governmental office would be given to a woman this year already ? "
merkel said . turning to economic issues , merkel told parliament that her left-right government would return the country to its status as an economic powerhouse .

" osthoff had worked on a german excavation of the 4,000-year-old isin site from the mid-1970s until the late 1980s , when un sanctions forced most foreign experts out of the country . in may 2003 , two months after the united states and britain invaded iraq , osthoff brought reporters to isin to show them how iraq 's most important sites were being destroyed by looters . " in two weeks , they have ruined all the work that was done over 15 years , " osthoff told the new york times . osthoff 's mother , in an interview with reuters television , said her daughter gave iraq and its culture her " body and soul . " " she helped show the americans what was happening to iraq 's cultural sites , " ingrid hala said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still from the video the hostage takers released shortly after midnight on tuesday , hala received news from the german foreign ministry that osthoff had been kidnapped in iraq and was being held by gunmen .
they were threatening to kill her if germany did not end its cooperation with the iraqi government . an image from a tape brought to german state broadcaster ard showed two blindfolded people sitting on the ground surrounded by three armed , masked men .
one held a rocket-propelled grenade launcher ; another read from a piece of paper . the fate of margaret hassan ? germany 's new chancellor angela merkel has vowed to everything within her power to save osthoff and her driver . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel speaking about the hostage crisis on tuesday one german official told the reuters news agency that they did not want her to end up like margaret hassan , a british aid worker who was kidnapped and killed last year by militants in iraq . like osthoff , hassan spoke arabic , had spent decades in iraq and had devoted her life to the country .
hassan had also criticised both the pre-war un sanctions and the invasion . osthoff witnessed iraqis suffering during and after the war , which prompted her to turn to relief work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.11.2005 eu calls on romania to maintain moratorium on adoptions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreigners move to romania hoping they will get to adopt there the european commission called tuesday on romania to maintain its moratorium on international adoptions despite pressure from countries such as the united states and france to lift it . the commission , the executive arm of the european union , " reiterates its support for new romanian legislation on the rights of children and on adoption that came into effect in january this year .
" we see no reason to change this law , " the commission 's delegation in bucharest said in a statement .
a moratorium on adoptions has been in effect since 2001.the law came about after pressure from the eu , which told bucharest to end " the exportation of children " through numerous international adoptions over the past few years and to quickly institute a system for protecting minors in accordance with european norms .
romania is slated to join the european union in 2007 provided it satisfies all eu criteria .
but the european parliament 's representative to romania , pierre moscovici , has called on the eastern european country to settle " as soon as possible requests for international adoptions that were filed before the moratorium in 2001 , in consideration of the emotional suffering of adoptive parents . "
in october , some 20 foreign couples sought to take up permanent residence in romania so they could adopt children .
the couples are already foster parents who " have been entrusted with romanian children for several years .
over time , a deep affection has been established between the foreigners and the children , " theodora bertzi , head of the romanian office for adoptions , said in october .
foreign residents may adopt the majority of those on the list seeking adoptions , 11 couples , come from the united states .
the other couples come from european countries including germany , the netherlands , italy , switzerland and britain , as well as from canada and south africa .
" these couples have the possibility of adopting a romanian child , once they obtain a romanian residence permit , " bertzi said , but even this is no guarantee .
the new romanian law states that adoption is " the last recourse " in protecting children who are orphans or have been abandoned , and it gives " absolute priority " to romanian couples .
us officials have criticized the new romanian law , claiming that children remain in orphanages because there are not enough romanian parents who have the means or the desire to adopt a child .
with the aid from the eu , unicef and several international associations , romania has reduced the number of orphans in the country to less than 40,000 , as the children have been accepted by romanian families who receive financial support from the state . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de adopting a new attitude towards children the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .

a robber in cologne almost bungled a simple hold-up when his attempted armed robbery got off to a very inauspicious start .
the man entered a newsagent in the city and made demands to the cashier , 24-year-old michaela sobor .
but the robber had bound his face so tightly with a scarf that his agitated commands were unintelligible .
victim had no idea what was being said after a number of confused seconds where victim and perpetrator stared vacantly at each other , sobor had to ask the robber to repeat himself , which he did but to yet still no avail .
" i did n't realize it was a robbery , i just thought he had wrapped himself up warm because of the cold weather , " the cashier said .
the robber 's frustration obviously boiled over at this point and he abandoned his demands and forced his way behind the counter , brandishing his gun for the first time since the farcical hold-up began .
it was only then did sobor realize that she was being robbed .
the man was able to make off with over almost 1,500 euros in cash .
police are now asking for witnesses to come forward to help in their investigation . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mommy 's boy thief nabbed calling home a german security guard who made off with a substantial sum destined for a bank was eventually caught following a 10-day manhunt by interpol agents - after calling home to his mom from a croatian beach resort .

" we see no reason to change this law , " the commission 's delegation in bucharest said in a statement .
a moratorium on adoptions has been in effect since 2001.the law came about after pressure from the eu , which told bucharest to end " the exportation of children " through numerous international adoptions over the past few years and to quickly institute a system for protecting minors in accordance with european norms .
romania is slated to join the european union in 2007 provided it satisfies all eu criteria .

foreign residents may adopt the majority of those on the list seeking adoptions , 11 couples , come from the united states .

" these couples have the possibility of adopting a romanian child , once they obtain a romanian residence permit , " bertzi said , but even this is no guarantee .
the new romanian law states that adoption is " the last recourse " in protecting children who are orphans or have been abandoned , and it gives " absolute priority " to romanian couples .
us officials have criticized the new romanian law , claiming that children remain in orphanages because there are not enough romanian parents who have the means or the desire to adopt a child .

" osthoff had worked on a german excavation of the 4,000-year-old isin site from the mid-1970s until the late 1980s , when un sanctions forced most foreign experts out of the country . in may 2003 , two months after the united states and britain invaded iraq , osthoff brought reporters to isin to show them how iraq 's most important sites were being destroyed by looters . " in two weeks , they have ruined all the work that was done over 15 years , " osthoff told the new york times . osthoff 's mother , in an interview with reuters television , said her daughter gave iraq and its culture her " body and soul .

hassan had also criticised both the pre-war un sanctions and the invasion . osthoff witnessed iraqis suffering during and after the war , which prompted her to turn to relief work .
a converted muslim , she began working as volunteer in iraqi hospitals . but like many foreigners in iraq , where bomb attacks and kidnappings are commonplace , osthoff lived in fear for her life and often travelled with armed guards . germany 's neue osnabrücker zeitung daily said in a press release that osthoff told the paper in october she had been threatened by people close to the leader of al qaeda in iraq , abu musab al-zarqawi , who has claimed responsibility for the murder of numerous hostages in iraq . islam experts say the lives of osthoff and her driver are very much in danger . henner fürtig of the german orient institute in hamburg called the danger level " acute .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : a new thaw ahead for german-american relations the rocky german-american landscape germany 's image in us improved , study shows germany 's jung promises improved relations with washington merkel critical of us terror tactics ahead of washington visit germany -pipe- 30.11.2005 opinion : germany 's steinmeier makes his mark in washington großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier paves the way for new , improved german-us relations foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's first us visit was overshadowed by reports of torture linked to cia flights in europe .
dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says us-german relations are strong enough to cope . steinmeier 's first day in washington as the fresh face of germany was not the debut he might have wished for .
news of the kidnapped german archaeologist in iraq meant he spent much of the day locked in telephone conferences with a diplomatic crisis management team back in berlin .
in addition , the germans found themselves relying on the us for logistical support in the very place where berlin had refused to back washington in its hour of need . and that was not all .
the day was accompanied by continuing allegations of secret cia prisoner transports through europe with stopovers at german airports .
but even against this harsh backdrop steinmeier was able to master the situation with professionalism and diplomatic calm .
the americans , whose knowledge and contacts in iraq could be of live-saving importance , immediately agreed to help with intelligence on the kidnapping .
taking europe more seriously that was just the first sign of a change in relations between the two countries .
steinmeier and his us counterpart condoleezza rice proved in the way they addressed the allegations against the cia that berlin and washington are now back on a strong footing .
as the foreign minister candidly raised the issue , rice assured him and the eu of swift clarification .
exactly what she will say remains to be seen , but what is clear is that not so very long ago , washington would have been unlikely to tolerate germany poking its nose in where it was not welcome .
but now the white house seems to again take european worries over human rights issues and international treaties seriously . bush under mounting pressure the show of good will on both sides is not merely a coincidence .
increasing pressure from the american public to withdraw us troops from iraq is forcing president george bush 's government out of its bubble .
washington needs nato in order to relieve the burden on its iraq activities , and germany knows there is no need to change tack on its own refusal to send troops to iraq .
supporting the training of iraqi troops is an important task if the iraqis are to be maneuvered into a position from which they can control their own troops . whether frank-walter steinmeier will follow the path of skepticism towards the us so well-worn by gerhard schröder or adopt the softer line touted by angela merkel is an idle question .
the situation on the world stage is such that the two sides will have to work together , and in one short visit , steinmeier has already proved that a sensible dialogue in a businesslike and friendly tone is more helpful than the nurturing of animosity . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel seeks stronger ties with us , smaller eu states german chancellor angela merkel said she aims to bolster ties with the united states and smaller eu states .

dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says us-german relations are strong enough to cope . steinmeier 's first day in washington as the fresh face of germany was not the debut he might have wished for .
news of the kidnapped german archaeologist in iraq meant he spent much of the day locked in telephone conferences with a diplomatic crisis management team back in berlin .
in addition , the germans found themselves relying on the us for logistical support in the very place where berlin had refused to back washington in its hour of need . and that was not all .
the day was accompanied by continuing allegations of secret cia prisoner transports through europe with stopovers at german airports .
but even against this harsh backdrop steinmeier was able to master the situation with professionalism and diplomatic calm .
the americans , whose knowledge and contacts in iraq could be of live-saving importance , immediately agreed to help with intelligence on the kidnapping .
taking europe more seriously that was just the first sign of a change in relations between the two countries .
steinmeier and his us counterpart condoleezza rice proved in the way they addressed the allegations against the cia that berlin and washington are now back on a strong footing .
as the foreign minister candidly raised the issue , rice assured him and the eu of swift clarification .
exactly what she will say remains to be seen , but what is clear is that not so very long ago , washington would have been unlikely to tolerate germany poking its nose in where it was not welcome .
but now the white house seems to again take european worries over human rights issues and international treaties seriously . bush under mounting pressure the show of good will on both sides is not merely a coincidence .
increasing pressure from the american public to withdraw us troops from iraq is forcing president george bush 's government out of its bubble .
washington needs nato in order to relieve the burden on its iraq activities , and germany knows there is no need to change tack on its own refusal to send troops to iraq .
supporting the training of iraqi troops is an important task if the iraqis are to be maneuvered into a position from which they can control their own troops . whether frank-walter steinmeier will follow the path of skepticism towards the us so well-worn by gerhard schröder or adopt the softer line touted by angela merkel is an idle question .
the situation on the world stage is such that the two sides will have to work together , and in one short visit , steinmeier has already proved that a sensible dialogue in a businesslike and friendly tone is more helpful than the nurturing of animosity . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel seeks stronger ties with us , smaller eu states german chancellor angela merkel said she aims to bolster ties with the united states and smaller eu states .

dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says us-german relations are strong enough to cope . steinmeier 's first day in washington as the fresh face of germany was not the debut he might have wished for .
news of the kidnapped german archaeologist in iraq meant he spent much of the day locked in telephone conferences with a diplomatic crisis management team back in berlin .
in addition , the germans found themselves relying on the us for logistical support in the very place where berlin had refused to back washington in its hour of need . and that was not all .
the day was accompanied by continuing allegations of secret cia prisoner transports through europe with stopovers at german airports .
but even against this harsh backdrop steinmeier was able to master the situation with professionalism and diplomatic calm .
the americans , whose knowledge and contacts in iraq could be of live-saving importance , immediately agreed to help with intelligence on the kidnapping .
taking europe more seriously that was just the first sign of a change in relations between the two countries .
steinmeier and his us counterpart condoleezza rice proved in the way they addressed the allegations against the cia that berlin and washington are now back on a strong footing .
as the foreign minister candidly raised the issue , rice assured him and the eu of swift clarification .
exactly what she will say remains to be seen , but what is clear is that not so very long ago , washington would have been unlikely to tolerate germany poking its nose in where it was not welcome .
but now the white house seems to again take european worries over human rights issues and international treaties seriously . bush under mounting pressure the show of good will on both sides is not merely a coincidence .
increasing pressure from the american public to withdraw us troops from iraq is forcing president george bush 's government out of its bubble .
washington needs nato in order to relieve the burden on its iraq activities , and germany knows there is no need to change tack on its own refusal to send troops to iraq .
supporting the training of iraqi troops is an important task if the iraqis are to be maneuvered into a position from which they can control their own troops . whether frank-walter steinmeier will follow the path of skepticism towards the us so well-worn by gerhard schröder or adopt the softer line touted by angela merkel is an idle question .
the situation on the world stage is such that the two sides will have to work together , and in one short visit , steinmeier has already proved that a sensible dialogue in a businesslike and friendly tone is more helpful than the nurturing of animosity . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel seeks stronger ties with us , smaller eu states german chancellor angela merkel said she aims to bolster ties with the united states and smaller eu states .

" osthoff had worked on a german excavation of the 4,000-year-old isin site from the mid-1970s until the late 1980s , when un sanctions forced most foreign experts out of the country . in may 2003 , two months after the united states and britain invaded iraq , osthoff brought reporters to isin to show them how iraq 's most important sites were being destroyed by looters . " in two weeks , they have ruined all the work that was done over 15 years , " osthoff told the new york times . osthoff 's mother , in an interview with reuters television , said her daughter gave iraq and its culture her " body and soul . " " she helped show the americans what was happening to iraq 's cultural sites , " ingrid hala said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still from the video the hostage takers released shortly after midnight on tuesday , hala received news from the german foreign ministry that osthoff had been kidnapped in iraq and was being held by gunmen .

hassan had also criticised both the pre-war un sanctions and the invasion . osthoff witnessed iraqis suffering during and after the war , which prompted her to turn to relief work .
a converted muslim , she began working as volunteer in iraqi hospitals . but like many foreigners in iraq , where bomb attacks and kidnappings are commonplace , osthoff lived in fear for her life and often travelled with armed guards . germany 's neue osnabrücker zeitung daily said in a press release that osthoff told the paper in october she had been threatened by people close to the leader of al qaeda in iraq , abu musab al-zarqawi , who has claimed responsibility for the murder of numerous hostages in iraq . islam experts say the lives of osthoff and her driver are very much in danger . henner fürtig of the german orient institute in hamburg called the danger level " acute .

sonja hegasy of the berlin-based modern orient center shares that view , adding however that the chances of a peaceful resolution to the crisis is greater than it would be if osthoff were a national of a country that directly supported the us in the iraq war . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel urges kidnappers to release german detained in iraq new german chancellor angela merkel said that her government was doing everything in its power to secure the release of a german archeologist believed kidnapped in iraq and urged her captors to let her go .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.11.2005 berlin reveals cultural gem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors can soon get a sneak preview of the fruits of hard labor after years of painstaking restoration , berlin 's bode museum is gearing up to reopen its doors to visitors .
it 's the second of the five architectural gems on the city 's museum island to be given a complete facelift . " this is a wonderful day for berlin , a wonderful day for germany and for the museums of the world , " were the words spoken by art-lover and new minister for transport , building and housing wolfgang tiefensee at the official reopening ceremony for the bode museum .
he made no effort to disguise his delight at the nature of his first public engagement since taking office .
the restoration project , which was completed within the 152 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- budget and in the foreseen five and a half years time frame , brings the museum island in central berlin one step closer to its former dazzling glory .
bildunterschrift : after years of reconstruction , the museum is ready again tiefensee was not the only one singing the museum 's praises during the ceremony .
klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage was positively effervescent in his description of what makes the restored building so stunning , citing " the impressive renaissance and baroque forms , original features and use of colors and materials . "
a fragmented past from its place at the northern-most tip of the museum island where it sits perched imposingly above the spree river , the bode museum looks every bit a water palace .
the original building project , inspired by wilhelm bode , then general director of the royal museums of prussia , stems from 1880 .
the neo-baroque beauty with its twin cupolas was built by royal court architect ernst-eberhard ihne and opened by prussian king william ii as the kaiser-friedrich-museum in 1904 .
much of the museum was destroyed during the second world war , and had , by the end of the 1940s been earmarked for complete demolition .
an active citizens ' movement managed to prevent its fate from being sealed in a pile of rubble , and between the beginning of the 1950s to the mid-1980s , the building , which was renamed bode museum in 1956 , underwent a patchwork restoration effort .
but it was n't until after the fall of the berlin wall that it got the full treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum was built in the late 19th century when the museum island was granted a place on the unesco list of world cultural heritage sites , the federal and state governments hatched a master plan worth billions to completely renovate the five buildings on the slim strip of land positioned in the middle of the spree river .
speaking at the official opening this week , state secretary for culture bernd neumann said it was an " essential and pleasurable task " to maintain and hand on the restored complex to the next generation .
attention to detail the complete overhaul of the 25,000-square-meter -lrb- 82,000-square-foot -rrb- building not only included fitting modern security and sanitary technology , but restoration of the detail which lent the museum its charm 100 years ago .
many décor elements which were damaged or destroyed during the war have been redone or replaced , and an ornate rococo room was completely reconstructed on the strength of an old photo from pre-war days .
in the coming months , the high , bright rooms will be filled with exhibits from the end of antiquity to the middle of the 18th century .
from sculptures to icons and ivory to works by the old masters , the museum will house pieces of art which have been hidden away for long enough .
visitors will have a chance to preview the museum over the weekend , and it will be opened permanently from summer 2006 . silke bartlick -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's world cultural heritage sites during travels through germany , many tourists focus on the cultural aspects of the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.11.2005 berlin reveals cultural gem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors can soon get a sneak preview of the fruits of hard labor after years of painstaking restoration , berlin 's bode museum is gearing up to reopen its doors to visitors .
it 's the second of the five architectural gems on the city 's museum island to be given a complete facelift . " this is a wonderful day for berlin , a wonderful day for germany and for the museums of the world , " were the words spoken by art-lover and new minister for transport , building and housing wolfgang tiefensee at the official reopening ceremony for the bode museum .
he made no effort to disguise his delight at the nature of his first public engagement since taking office .
the restoration project , which was completed within the 152 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- budget and in the foreseen five and a half years time frame , brings the museum island in central berlin one step closer to its former dazzling glory .
bildunterschrift : after years of reconstruction , the museum is ready again tiefensee was not the only one singing the museum 's praises during the ceremony .
klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage was positively effervescent in his description of what makes the restored building so stunning , citing " the impressive renaissance and baroque forms , original features and use of colors and materials . "
a fragmented past from its place at the northern-most tip of the museum island where it sits perched imposingly above the spree river , the bode museum looks every bit a water palace .
the original building project , inspired by wilhelm bode , then general director of the royal museums of prussia , stems from 1880 .
the neo-baroque beauty with its twin cupolas was built by royal court architect ernst-eberhard ihne and opened by prussian king william ii as the kaiser-friedrich-museum in 1904 .
much of the museum was destroyed during the second world war , and had , by the end of the 1940s been earmarked for complete demolition .
an active citizens ' movement managed to prevent its fate from being sealed in a pile of rubble , and between the beginning of the 1950s to the mid-1980s , the building , which was renamed bode museum in 1956 , underwent a patchwork restoration effort .
but it was n't until after the fall of the berlin wall that it got the full treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum was built in the late 19th century when the museum island was granted a place on the unesco list of world cultural heritage sites , the federal and state governments hatched a master plan worth billions to completely renovate the five buildings on the slim strip of land positioned in the middle of the spree river .
speaking at the official opening this week , state secretary for culture bernd neumann said it was an " essential and pleasurable task " to maintain and hand on the restored complex to the next generation .
attention to detail the complete overhaul of the 25,000-square-meter -lrb- 82,000-square-foot -rrb- building not only included fitting modern security and sanitary technology , but restoration of the detail which lent the museum its charm 100 years ago .
many décor elements which were damaged or destroyed during the war have been redone or replaced , and an ornate rococo room was completely reconstructed on the strength of an old photo from pre-war days .
in the coming months , the high , bright rooms will be filled with exhibits from the end of antiquity to the middle of the 18th century .
from sculptures to icons and ivory to works by the old masters , the museum will house pieces of art which have been hidden away for long enough .
visitors will have a chance to preview the museum over the weekend , and it will be opened permanently from summer 2006 . silke bartlick -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's world cultural heritage sites during travels through germany , many tourists focus on the cultural aspects of the country .

it 's the second of the five architectural gems on the city 's museum island to be given a complete facelift . " this is a wonderful day for berlin , a wonderful day for germany and for the museums of the world , " were the words spoken by art-lover and new minister for transport , building and housing wolfgang tiefensee at the official reopening ceremony for the bode museum .
he made no effort to disguise his delight at the nature of his first public engagement since taking office .
the restoration project , which was completed within the 152 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- budget and in the foreseen five and a half years time frame , brings the museum island in central berlin one step closer to its former dazzling glory .
bildunterschrift : after years of reconstruction , the museum is ready again tiefensee was not the only one singing the museum 's praises during the ceremony .
klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage was positively effervescent in his description of what makes the restored building so stunning , citing " the impressive renaissance and baroque forms , original features and use of colors and materials . "
a fragmented past from its place at the northern-most tip of the museum island where it sits perched imposingly above the spree river , the bode museum looks every bit a water palace .
the original building project , inspired by wilhelm bode , then general director of the royal museums of prussia , stems from 1880 .
the neo-baroque beauty with its twin cupolas was built by royal court architect ernst-eberhard ihne and opened by prussian king william ii as the kaiser-friedrich-museum in 1904 .
much of the museum was destroyed during the second world war , and had , by the end of the 1940s been earmarked for complete demolition .
an active citizens ' movement managed to prevent its fate from being sealed in a pile of rubble , and between the beginning of the 1950s to the mid-1980s , the building , which was renamed bode museum in 1956 , underwent a patchwork restoration effort .
but it was n't until after the fall of the berlin wall that it got the full treatment .

speaking at the official opening this week , state secretary for culture bernd neumann said it was an " essential and pleasurable task " to maintain and hand on the restored complex to the next generation .

many décor elements which were damaged or destroyed during the war have been redone or replaced , and an ornate rococo room was completely reconstructed on the strength of an old photo from pre-war days .
in the coming months , the high , bright rooms will be filled with exhibits from the end of antiquity to the middle of the 18th century .
from sculptures to icons and ivory to works by the old masters , the museum will house pieces of art which have been hidden away for long enough .

" osthoff had worked on a german excavation of the 4,000-year-old isin site from the mid-1970s until the late 1980s , when un sanctions forced most foreign experts out of the country . in may 2003 , two months after the united states and britain invaded iraq , osthoff brought reporters to isin to show them how iraq 's most important sites were being destroyed by looters .

" we see no reason to change this law , " the commission 's delegation in bucharest said in a statement .
a moratorium on adoptions has been in effect since 2001.the law came about after pressure from the eu , which told bucharest to end " the exportation of children " through numerous international adoptions over the past few years and to quickly institute a system for protecting minors in accordance with european norms .
romania is slated to join the european union in 2007 provided it satisfies all eu criteria .
but the european parliament 's representative to romania , pierre moscovici , has called on the eastern european country to settle " as soon as possible requests for international adoptions that were filed before the moratorium in 2001 , in consideration of the emotional suffering of adoptive parents . "
in october , some 20 foreign couples sought to take up permanent residence in romania so they could adopt children .
the couples are already foster parents who " have been entrusted with romanian children for several years .
over time , a deep affection has been established between the foreigners and the children , " theodora bertzi , head of the romanian office for adoptions , said in october .
foreign residents may adopt the majority of those on the list seeking adoptions , 11 couples , come from the united states .
the other couples come from european countries including germany , the netherlands , italy , switzerland and britain , as well as from canada and south africa .
" these couples have the possibility of adopting a romanian child , once they obtain a romanian residence permit , " bertzi said , but even this is no guarantee .
the new romanian law states that adoption is " the last recourse " in protecting children who are orphans or have been abandoned , and it gives " absolute priority " to romanian couples .
us officials have criticized the new romanian law , claiming that children remain in orphanages because there are not enough romanian parents who have the means or the desire to adopt a child .
with the aid from the eu , unicef and several international associations , romania has reduced the number of orphans in the country to less than 40,000 , as the children have been accepted by romanian families who receive financial support from the state . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de adopting a new attitude towards children the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .

" we see no reason to change this law , " the commission 's delegation in bucharest said in a statement .
a moratorium on adoptions has been in effect since 2001.the law came about after pressure from the eu , which told bucharest to end " the exportation of children " through numerous international adoptions over the past few years and to quickly institute a system for protecting minors in accordance with european norms .
romania is slated to join the european union in 2007 provided it satisfies all eu criteria .
but the european parliament 's representative to romania , pierre moscovici , has called on the eastern european country to settle " as soon as possible requests for international adoptions that were filed before the moratorium in 2001 , in consideration of the emotional suffering of adoptive parents . "
in october , some 20 foreign couples sought to take up permanent residence in romania so they could adopt children .
the couples are already foster parents who " have been entrusted with romanian children for several years .
over time , a deep affection has been established between the foreigners and the children , " theodora bertzi , head of the romanian office for adoptions , said in october .
foreign residents may adopt the majority of those on the list seeking adoptions , 11 couples , come from the united states .
the other couples come from european countries including germany , the netherlands , italy , switzerland and britain , as well as from canada and south africa .
" these couples have the possibility of adopting a romanian child , once they obtain a romanian residence permit , " bertzi said , but even this is no guarantee .
the new romanian law states that adoption is " the last recourse " in protecting children who are orphans or have been abandoned , and it gives " absolute priority " to romanian couples .
us officials have criticized the new romanian law , claiming that children remain in orphanages because there are not enough romanian parents who have the means or the desire to adopt a child .
with the aid from the eu , unicef and several international associations , romania has reduced the number of orphans in the country to less than 40,000 , as the children have been accepted by romanian families who receive financial support from the state . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de adopting a new attitude towards children the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : a new thaw ahead for german-american relations the rocky german-american landscape germany 's image in us improved , study shows germany 's jung promises improved relations with washington merkel critical of us terror tactics ahead of washington visit germany -pipe- 30.11.2005 opinion : germany 's steinmeier makes his mark in washington großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier paves the way for new , improved german-us relations foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's first us visit was overshadowed by reports of torture linked to cia flights in europe .
dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says us-german relations are strong enough to cope . steinmeier 's first day in washington as the fresh face of germany was not the debut he might have wished for .
news of the kidnapped german archaeologist in iraq meant he spent much of the day locked in telephone conferences with a diplomatic crisis management team back in berlin .
in addition , the germans found themselves relying on the us for logistical support in the very place where berlin had refused to back washington in its hour of need . and that was not all .
the day was accompanied by continuing allegations of secret cia prisoner transports through europe with stopovers at german airports .
but even against this harsh backdrop steinmeier was able to master the situation with professionalism and diplomatic calm .
the americans , whose knowledge and contacts in iraq could be of live-saving importance , immediately agreed to help with intelligence on the kidnapping .
taking europe more seriously that was just the first sign of a change in relations between the two countries .
steinmeier and his us counterpart condoleezza rice proved in the way they addressed the allegations against the cia that berlin and washington are now back on a strong footing .
as the foreign minister candidly raised the issue , rice assured him and the eu of swift clarification .
exactly what she will say remains to be seen , but what is clear is that not so very long ago , washington would have been unlikely to tolerate germany poking its nose in where it was not welcome .
but now the white house seems to again take european worries over human rights issues and international treaties seriously . bush under mounting pressure the show of good will on both sides is not merely a coincidence .
increasing pressure from the american public to withdraw us troops from iraq is forcing president george bush 's government out of its bubble .
washington needs nato in order to relieve the burden on its iraq activities , and germany knows there is no need to change tack on its own refusal to send troops to iraq .
supporting the training of iraqi troops is an important task if the iraqis are to be maneuvered into a position from which they can control their own troops . whether frank-walter steinmeier will follow the path of skepticism towards the us so well-worn by gerhard schröder or adopt the softer line touted by angela merkel is an idle question .
the situation on the world stage is such that the two sides will have to work together , and in one short visit , steinmeier has already proved that a sensible dialogue in a businesslike and friendly tone is more helpful than the nurturing of animosity . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel seeks stronger ties with us , smaller eu states german chancellor angela merkel said she aims to bolster ties with the united states and smaller eu states .

" we see no reason to change this law , " the commission 's delegation in bucharest said in a statement .
a moratorium on adoptions has been in effect since 2001.the law came about after pressure from the eu , which told bucharest to end " the exportation of children " through numerous international adoptions over the past few years and to quickly institute a system for protecting minors in accordance with european norms .
romania is slated to join the european union in 2007 provided it satisfies all eu criteria .
but the european parliament 's representative to romania , pierre moscovici , has called on the eastern european country to settle " as soon as possible requests for international adoptions that were filed before the moratorium in 2001 , in consideration of the emotional suffering of adoptive parents . "
in october , some 20 foreign couples sought to take up permanent residence in romania so they could adopt children .
the couples are already foster parents who " have been entrusted with romanian children for several years .
over time , a deep affection has been established between the foreigners and the children , " theodora bertzi , head of the romanian office for adoptions , said in october .
foreign residents may adopt the majority of those on the list seeking adoptions , 11 couples , come from the united states .
the other couples come from european countries including germany , the netherlands , italy , switzerland and britain , as well as from canada and south africa .
" these couples have the possibility of adopting a romanian child , once they obtain a romanian residence permit , " bertzi said , but even this is no guarantee .
the new romanian law states that adoption is " the last recourse " in protecting children who are orphans or have been abandoned , and it gives " absolute priority " to romanian couples .
us officials have criticized the new romanian law , claiming that children remain in orphanages because there are not enough romanian parents who have the means or the desire to adopt a child .
with the aid from the eu , unicef and several international associations , romania has reduced the number of orphans in the country to less than 40,000 , as the children have been accepted by romanian families who receive financial support from the state . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de adopting a new attitude towards children the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 30.11.2005 berlin reveals cultural gem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : visitors can soon get a sneak preview of the fruits of hard labor after years of painstaking restoration , berlin 's bode museum is gearing up to reopen its doors to visitors .
it 's the second of the five architectural gems on the city 's museum island to be given a complete facelift . " this is a wonderful day for berlin , a wonderful day for germany and for the museums of the world , " were the words spoken by art-lover and new minister for transport , building and housing wolfgang tiefensee at the official reopening ceremony for the bode museum .
he made no effort to disguise his delight at the nature of his first public engagement since taking office .
the restoration project , which was completed within the 152 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- budget and in the foreseen five and a half years time frame , brings the museum island in central berlin one step closer to its former dazzling glory .
bildunterschrift : after years of reconstruction , the museum is ready again tiefensee was not the only one singing the museum 's praises during the ceremony .
klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage was positively effervescent in his description of what makes the restored building so stunning , citing " the impressive renaissance and baroque forms , original features and use of colors and materials . "
a fragmented past from its place at the northern-most tip of the museum island where it sits perched imposingly above the spree river , the bode museum looks every bit a water palace .
the original building project , inspired by wilhelm bode , then general director of the royal museums of prussia , stems from 1880 .
the neo-baroque beauty with its twin cupolas was built by royal court architect ernst-eberhard ihne and opened by prussian king william ii as the kaiser-friedrich-museum in 1904 .
much of the museum was destroyed during the second world war , and had , by the end of the 1940s been earmarked for complete demolition .
an active citizens ' movement managed to prevent its fate from being sealed in a pile of rubble , and between the beginning of the 1950s to the mid-1980s , the building , which was renamed bode museum in 1956 , underwent a patchwork restoration effort .
but it was n't until after the fall of the berlin wall that it got the full treatment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the museum was built in the late 19th century when the museum island was granted a place on the unesco list of world cultural heritage sites , the federal and state governments hatched a master plan worth billions to completely renovate the five buildings on the slim strip of land positioned in the middle of the spree river .
speaking at the official opening this week , state secretary for culture bernd neumann said it was an " essential and pleasurable task " to maintain and hand on the restored complex to the next generation .
attention to detail the complete overhaul of the 25,000-square-meter -lrb- 82,000-square-foot -rrb- building not only included fitting modern security and sanitary technology , but restoration of the detail which lent the museum its charm 100 years ago .
many décor elements which were damaged or destroyed during the war have been redone or replaced , and an ornate rococo room was completely reconstructed on the strength of an old photo from pre-war days .
in the coming months , the high , bright rooms will be filled with exhibits from the end of antiquity to the middle of the 18th century .
from sculptures to icons and ivory to works by the old masters , the museum will house pieces of art which have been hidden away for long enough .
visitors will have a chance to preview the museum over the weekend , and it will be opened permanently from summer 2006 . silke bartlick -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's world cultural heritage sites during travels through germany , many tourists focus on the cultural aspects of the country .

it 's the second of the five architectural gems on the city 's museum island to be given a complete facelift . " this is a wonderful day for berlin , a wonderful day for germany and for the museums of the world , " were the words spoken by art-lover and new minister for transport , building and housing wolfgang tiefensee at the official reopening ceremony for the bode museum .
he made no effort to disguise his delight at the nature of his first public engagement since taking office .
the restoration project , which was completed within the 152 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- budget and in the foreseen five and a half years time frame , brings the museum island in central berlin one step closer to its former dazzling glory .
bildunterschrift : after years of reconstruction , the museum is ready again tiefensee was not the only one singing the museum 's praises during the ceremony .
klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage was positively effervescent in his description of what makes the restored building so stunning , citing " the impressive renaissance and baroque forms , original features and use of colors and materials . "
a fragmented past from its place at the northern-most tip of the museum island where it sits perched imposingly above the spree river , the bode museum looks every bit a water palace .
the original building project , inspired by wilhelm bode , then general director of the royal museums of prussia , stems from 1880 .
the neo-baroque beauty with its twin cupolas was built by royal court architect ernst-eberhard ihne and opened by prussian king william ii as the kaiser-friedrich-museum in 1904 .
much of the museum was destroyed during the second world war , and had , by the end of the 1940s been earmarked for complete demolition .
an active citizens ' movement managed to prevent its fate from being sealed in a pile of rubble , and between the beginning of the 1950s to the mid-1980s , the building , which was renamed bode museum in 1956 , underwent a patchwork restoration effort .
but it was n't until after the fall of the berlin wall that it got the full treatment .

speaking at the official opening this week , state secretary for culture bernd neumann said it was an " essential and pleasurable task " to maintain and hand on the restored complex to the next generation .

many décor elements which were damaged or destroyed during the war have been redone or replaced , and an ornate rococo room was completely reconstructed on the strength of an old photo from pre-war days .
in the coming months , the high , bright rooms will be filled with exhibits from the end of antiquity to the middle of the 18th century .
from sculptures to icons and ivory to works by the old masters , the museum will house pieces of art which have been hidden away for long enough .

it 's the second of the five architectural gems on the city 's museum island to be given a complete facelift . " this is a wonderful day for berlin , a wonderful day for germany and for the museums of the world , " were the words spoken by art-lover and new minister for transport , building and housing wolfgang tiefensee at the official reopening ceremony for the bode museum .
he made no effort to disguise his delight at the nature of his first public engagement since taking office .
the restoration project , which was completed within the 152 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- budget and in the foreseen five and a half years time frame , brings the museum island in central berlin one step closer to its former dazzling glory .
bildunterschrift : after years of reconstruction , the museum is ready again tiefensee was not the only one singing the museum 's praises during the ceremony .
klaus-dieter lehmann , head of the foundation of prussian cultural heritage was positively effervescent in his description of what makes the restored building so stunning , citing " the impressive renaissance and baroque forms , original features and use of colors and materials . "
a fragmented past from its place at the northern-most tip of the museum island where it sits perched imposingly above the spree river , the bode museum looks every bit a water palace .
the original building project , inspired by wilhelm bode , then general director of the royal museums of prussia , stems from 1880 .
the neo-baroque beauty with its twin cupolas was built by royal court architect ernst-eberhard ihne and opened by prussian king william ii as the kaiser-friedrich-museum in 1904 .
much of the museum was destroyed during the second world war , and had , by the end of the 1940s been earmarked for complete demolition .

" we see no reason to change this law , " the commission 's delegation in bucharest said in a statement .
a moratorium on adoptions has been in effect since 2001.the law came about after pressure from the eu , which told bucharest to end " the exportation of children " through numerous international adoptions over the past few years and to quickly institute a system for protecting minors in accordance with european norms .
romania is slated to join the european union in 2007 provided it satisfies all eu criteria .
but the european parliament 's representative to romania , pierre moscovici , has called on the eastern european country to settle " as soon as possible requests for international adoptions that were filed before the moratorium in 2001 , in consideration of the emotional suffering of adoptive parents . "
in october , some 20 foreign couples sought to take up permanent residence in romania so they could adopt children .
the couples are already foster parents who " have been entrusted with romanian children for several years .
over time , a deep affection has been established between the foreigners and the children , " theodora bertzi , head of the romanian office for adoptions , said in october .
foreign residents may adopt the majority of those on the list seeking adoptions , 11 couples , come from the united states .
the other couples come from european countries including germany , the netherlands , italy , switzerland and britain , as well as from canada and south africa .
" these couples have the possibility of adopting a romanian child , once they obtain a romanian residence permit , " bertzi said , but even this is no guarantee .
the new romanian law states that adoption is " the last recourse " in protecting children who are orphans or have been abandoned , and it gives " absolute priority " to romanian couples .
us officials have criticized the new romanian law , claiming that children remain in orphanages because there are not enough romanian parents who have the means or the desire to adopt a child .
with the aid from the eu , unicef and several international associations , romania has reduced the number of orphans in the country to less than 40,000 , as the children have been accepted by romanian families who receive financial support from the state . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de adopting a new attitude towards children the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .

dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says us-german relations are strong enough to cope . steinmeier 's first day in washington as the fresh face of germany was not the debut he might have wished for .
news of the kidnapped german archaeologist in iraq meant he spent much of the day locked in telephone conferences with a diplomatic crisis management team back in berlin .
in addition , the germans found themselves relying on the us for logistical support in the very place where berlin had refused to back washington in its hour of need . and that was not all .
the day was accompanied by continuing allegations of secret cia prisoner transports through europe with stopovers at german airports .
but even against this harsh backdrop steinmeier was able to master the situation with professionalism and diplomatic calm .
the americans , whose knowledge and contacts in iraq could be of live-saving importance , immediately agreed to help with intelligence on the kidnapping .
taking europe more seriously that was just the first sign of a change in relations between the two countries .
steinmeier and his us counterpart condoleezza rice proved in the way they addressed the allegations against the cia that berlin and washington are now back on a strong footing .
as the foreign minister candidly raised the issue , rice assured him and the eu of swift clarification .
exactly what she will say remains to be seen , but what is clear is that not so very long ago , washington would have been unlikely to tolerate germany poking its nose in where it was not welcome .
but now the white house seems to again take european worries over human rights issues and international treaties seriously . bush under mounting pressure the show of good will on both sides is not merely a coincidence .
increasing pressure from the american public to withdraw us troops from iraq is forcing president george bush 's government out of its bubble .
washington needs nato in order to relieve the burden on its iraq activities , and germany knows there is no need to change tack on its own refusal to send troops to iraq .
supporting the training of iraqi troops is an important task if the iraqis are to be maneuvered into a position from which they can control their own troops . whether frank-walter steinmeier will follow the path of skepticism towards the us so well-worn by gerhard schröder or adopt the softer line touted by angela merkel is an idle question .

" osthoff had worked on a german excavation of the 4,000-year-old isin site from the mid-1970s until the late 1980s , when un sanctions forced most foreign experts out of the country . in may 2003 , two months after the united states and britain invaded iraq , osthoff brought reporters to isin to show them how iraq 's most important sites were being destroyed by looters . " in two weeks , they have ruined all the work that was done over 15 years , " osthoff told the new york times . osthoff 's mother , in an interview with reuters television , said her daughter gave iraq and its culture her " body and soul .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : a new thaw ahead for german-american relations the rocky german-american landscape germany 's image in us improved , study shows germany 's jung promises improved relations with washington merkel critical of us terror tactics ahead of washington visit germany -pipe- 30.11.2005 opinion : germany 's steinmeier makes his mark in washington großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier paves the way for new , improved german-us relations foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier 's first us visit was overshadowed by reports of torture linked to cia flights in europe .
dw 's daniel scheschkewitz says us-german relations are strong enough to cope . steinmeier 's first day in washington as the fresh face of germany was not the debut he might have wished for .
news of the kidnapped german archaeologist in iraq meant he spent much of the day locked in telephone conferences with a diplomatic crisis management team back in berlin .
in addition , the germans found themselves relying on the us for logistical support in the very place where berlin had refused to back washington in its hour of need . and that was not all .
the day was accompanied by continuing allegations of secret cia prisoner transports through europe with stopovers at german airports .
but even against this harsh backdrop steinmeier was able to master the situation with professionalism and diplomatic calm .
the americans , whose knowledge and contacts in iraq could be of live-saving importance , immediately agreed to help with intelligence on the kidnapping .
taking europe more seriously that was just the first sign of a change in relations between the two countries .
steinmeier and his us counterpart condoleezza rice proved in the way they addressed the allegations against the cia that berlin and washington are now back on a strong footing .
as the foreign minister candidly raised the issue , rice assured him and the eu of swift clarification .
exactly what she will say remains to be seen , but what is clear is that not so very long ago , washington would have been unlikely to tolerate germany poking its nose in where it was not welcome .
but now the white house seems to again take european worries over human rights issues and international treaties seriously . bush under mounting pressure the show of good will on both sides is not merely a coincidence .
increasing pressure from the american public to withdraw us troops from iraq is forcing president george bush 's government out of its bubble .
washington needs nato in order to relieve the burden on its iraq activities , and germany knows there is no need to change tack on its own refusal to send troops to iraq .
supporting the training of iraqi troops is an important task if the iraqis are to be maneuvered into a position from which they can control their own troops . whether frank-walter steinmeier will follow the path of skepticism towards the us so well-worn by gerhard schröder or adopt the softer line touted by angela merkel is an idle question .
the situation on the world stage is such that the two sides will have to work together , and in one short visit , steinmeier has already proved that a sensible dialogue in a businesslike and friendly tone is more helpful than the nurturing of animosity . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel seeks stronger ties with us , smaller eu states german chancellor angela merkel said she aims to bolster ties with the united states and smaller eu states .
the statements come as her foreign minister begins a trip to the us .

" we see no reason to change this law , " the commission 's delegation in bucharest said in a statement .
a moratorium on adoptions has been in effect since 2001.the law came about after pressure from the eu , which told bucharest to end " the exportation of children " through numerous international adoptions over the past few years and to quickly institute a system for protecting minors in accordance with european norms .
romania is slated to join the european union in 2007 provided it satisfies all eu criteria .
but the european parliament 's representative to romania , pierre moscovici , has called on the eastern european country to settle " as soon as possible requests for international adoptions that were filed before the moratorium in 2001 , in consideration of the emotional suffering of adoptive parents . "
in october , some 20 foreign couples sought to take up permanent residence in romania so they could adopt children .
the couples are already foster parents who " have been entrusted with romanian children for several years .
over time , a deep affection has been established between the foreigners and the children , " theodora bertzi , head of the romanian office for adoptions , said in october .
foreign residents may adopt the majority of those on the list seeking adoptions , 11 couples , come from the united states .
the other couples come from european countries including germany , the netherlands , italy , switzerland and britain , as well as from canada and south africa .
" these couples have the possibility of adopting a romanian child , once they obtain a romanian residence permit , " bertzi said , but even this is no guarantee .
the new romanian law states that adoption is " the last recourse " in protecting children who are orphans or have been abandoned , and it gives " absolute priority " to romanian couples .
us officials have criticized the new romanian law , claiming that children remain in orphanages because there are not enough romanian parents who have the means or the desire to adopt a child .
with the aid from the eu , unicef and several international associations , romania has reduced the number of orphans in the country to less than 40,000 , as the children have been accepted by romanian families who receive financial support from the state . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de adopting a new attitude towards children the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .

" we see no reason to change this law , " the commission 's delegation in bucharest said in a statement .
a moratorium on adoptions has been in effect since 2001.the law came about after pressure from the eu , which told bucharest to end " the exportation of children " through numerous international adoptions over the past few years and to quickly institute a system for protecting minors in accordance with european norms .
romania is slated to join the european union in 2007 provided it satisfies all eu criteria .
but the european parliament 's representative to romania , pierre moscovici , has called on the eastern european country to settle " as soon as possible requests for international adoptions that were filed before the moratorium in 2001 , in consideration of the emotional suffering of adoptive parents . "
in october , some 20 foreign couples sought to take up permanent residence in romania so they could adopt children .
the couples are already foster parents who " have been entrusted with romanian children for several years .
over time , a deep affection has been established between the foreigners and the children , " theodora bertzi , head of the romanian office for adoptions , said in october .
foreign residents may adopt the majority of those on the list seeking adoptions , 11 couples , come from the united states .
the other couples come from european countries including germany , the netherlands , italy , switzerland and britain , as well as from canada and south africa .
" these couples have the possibility of adopting a romanian child , once they obtain a romanian residence permit , " bertzi said , but even this is no guarantee .
the new romanian law states that adoption is " the last recourse " in protecting children who are orphans or have been abandoned , and it gives " absolute priority " to romanian couples .
us officials have criticized the new romanian law , claiming that children remain in orphanages because there are not enough romanian parents who have the means or the desire to adopt a child .
with the aid from the eu , unicef and several international associations , romania has reduced the number of orphans in the country to less than 40,000 , as the children have been accepted by romanian families who receive financial support from the state . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de adopting a new attitude towards children the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .

" osthoff had worked on a german excavation of the 4,000-year-old isin site from the mid-1970s until the late 1980s , when un sanctions forced most foreign experts out of the country . in may 2003 , two months after the united states and britain invaded iraq , osthoff brought reporters to isin to show them how iraq 's most important sites were being destroyed by looters . " in two weeks , they have ruined all the work that was done over 15 years , " osthoff told the new york times . osthoff 's mother , in an interview with reuters television , said her daughter gave iraq and its culture her " body and soul . " " she helped show the americans what was happening to iraq 's cultural sites , " ingrid hala said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still from the video the hostage takers released shortly after midnight on tuesday , hala received news from the german foreign ministry that osthoff had been kidnapped in iraq and was being held by gunmen .
they were threatening to kill her if germany did not end its cooperation with the iraqi government . an image from a tape brought to german state broadcaster ard showed two blindfolded people sitting on the ground surrounded by three armed , masked men .
one held a rocket-propelled grenade launcher ; another read from a piece of paper . the fate of margaret hassan ? germany 's new chancellor angela merkel has vowed to everything within her power to save osthoff and her driver . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel speaking about the hostage crisis on tuesday one german official told the reuters news agency that they did not want her to end up like margaret hassan , a british aid worker who was kidnapped and killed last year by militants in iraq . like osthoff , hassan spoke arabic , had spent decades in iraq and had devoted her life to the country .
hassan had also criticised both the pre-war un sanctions and the invasion . osthoff witnessed iraqis suffering during and after the war , which prompted her to turn to relief work .
a converted muslim , she began working as volunteer in iraqi hospitals . but like many foreigners in iraq , where bomb attacks and kidnappings are commonplace , osthoff lived in fear for her life and often travelled with armed guards . germany 's neue osnabrücker zeitung daily said in a press release that osthoff told the paper in october she had been threatened by people close to the leader of al qaeda in iraq , abu musab al-zarqawi , who has claimed responsibility for the murder of numerous hostages in iraq . islam experts say the lives of osthoff and her driver are very much in danger . henner fürtig of the german orient institute in hamburg called the danger level " acute . "
sonja hegasy of the berlin-based modern orient center shares that view , adding however that the chances of a peaceful resolution to the crisis is greater than it would be if osthoff were a national of a country that directly supported the us in the iraq war . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel urges kidnappers to release german detained in iraq new german chancellor angela merkel said that her government was doing everything in its power to secure the release of a german archeologist believed kidnapped in iraq and urged her captors to let her go .

" we see no reason to change this law , " the commission 's delegation in bucharest said in a statement .
a moratorium on adoptions has been in effect since 2001.the law came about after pressure from the eu , which told bucharest to end " the exportation of children " through numerous international adoptions over the past few years and to quickly institute a system for protecting minors in accordance with european norms .
romania is slated to join the european union in 2007 provided it satisfies all eu criteria .
but the european parliament 's representative to romania , pierre moscovici , has called on the eastern european country to settle " as soon as possible requests for international adoptions that were filed before the moratorium in 2001 , in consideration of the emotional suffering of adoptive parents . "
in october , some 20 foreign couples sought to take up permanent residence in romania so they could adopt children .
the couples are already foster parents who " have been entrusted with romanian children for several years .
over time , a deep affection has been established between the foreigners and the children , " theodora bertzi , head of the romanian office for adoptions , said in october .
foreign residents may adopt the majority of those on the list seeking adoptions , 11 couples , come from the united states .
the other couples come from european countries including germany , the netherlands , italy , switzerland and britain , as well as from canada and south africa .
" these couples have the possibility of adopting a romanian child , once they obtain a romanian residence permit , " bertzi said , but even this is no guarantee .
the new romanian law states that adoption is " the last recourse " in protecting children who are orphans or have been abandoned , and it gives " absolute priority " to romanian couples .
us officials have criticized the new romanian law , claiming that children remain in orphanages because there are not enough romanian parents who have the means or the desire to adopt a child .
with the aid from the eu , unicef and several international associations , romania has reduced the number of orphans in the country to less than 40,000 , as the children have been accepted by romanian families who receive financial support from the state . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de adopting a new attitude towards children the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .

it 's the second of the five architectural gems on the city 's museum island to be given a complete facelift . " this is a wonderful day for berlin , a wonderful day for germany and for the museums of the world , " were the words spoken by art-lover and new minister for transport , building and housing wolfgang tiefensee at the official reopening ceremony for the bode museum .
he made no effort to disguise his delight at the nature of his first public engagement since taking office .
the restoration project , which was completed within the 152 million euros -lrb- $ 178 million -rrb- budget and in the foreseen five and a half years time frame , brings the museum island in central berlin one step closer to its former dazzling glory .

a fragmented past from its place at the northern-most tip of the museum island where it sits perched imposingly above the spree river , the bode museum looks every bit a water palace .

noh omar 's remarks come just days after a video emerged of an ethnic chinese woman being forced to perform naked squats in a malaysian police station .
china has protested about the alleged treatment of its citizens .
far from containing this crisis some politicians and police officers seem determined to make it worse .
if foreigners think that malaysia police are brutal , please go back to their own countries and not to stay here noh omar video puts police in dock first malaysia 's deputy police chief said it was standard procedure for suspects to be forced to strip and squat repeatedly while holding their ears .
chinese anger now the minister in day-to-day charge of the police has hit out at complainants from overseas .
" if foreigners think that malaysia police are brutal , please go back to their own countries and not to stay here , " noh omar told reporters in parliament .
on monday he told lawmakers that he believed police had followed the rules , seemingly putting him at odds with prime minister abdullah badawi , who had announced a full independent inquiry .
the video prompted widespread outrage in malaysia and the government has distanced itself from mr noh 's remarks .
but this is becoming increasingly difficult for mr abdullah who is sometimes characterised as too nice for the job .
calls for the deputy police chief and now the deputy internal security minister to be sacked have so far gone unheeded .
on tuesday the chinese government stepped in and asked for abusive police officers to be punished , and for its citizens in malaysia to be properly protected .
several chinese women have complained of being humiliated and robbed by malaysian police officers , and the video footage has lent weight to their stories .

investors have been inspired by signs of recovery in the economy , and a rally in us tech stocks has also helped .
recent data shows industrial output up , improving production and household spending , and more people seeking work .
the nikkei briefly rose as high as 15,013.24 , before it slipped back to 14,872 at the end of trading .
market ' breather ' japan 's economy has bounced back this year as a pick-up in consumer spending and capital investment has made up for a slowdown in exports , particularly to china .
this week the paris-based organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- upgraded japan 's economic outlook , saying its domestic demand is recovering , along with corporate profits and employment .
hiroichi nishi , general manager of equity marketing at nikko cordial securities , said the market was supported by hopes the nikkei could rise further on optimism about continued economic recovery .
" the nikkei took a breather after breaking above 15,000 , but it did n't fall as much because there is a strong sense in the market that the nikkei will rise further , " he said .
the last time the market was at such a level was in december 2000 .
foreign demand the oecd expects japan 's economy to grow at 2.4 % this year and 2 % in 2006 , up from previous forecasts for 1.5 % growth in 2005 and 1.7 % next year .
industrial production rose 0.6 % in october from a month earlier .
analysts are optimistic about the outlook for output , after a period in which companies seemed to have been selling off stock rather than boosting production .
and there are signs that foreign demand is picking up after a slowdown , as is the domestic appetite for consumer spending , as wages and job prospects improve .
a separate government report showed that spending in households with a wage-earner rose by 1.3 % in october from a year earlier .
government figures show japan 's economy expanded at a faster-than-expected 0.4 % in the third quarter , boosted by strong domestic demand .
japanese consumer prices failed to fall for the first time in five months in october , fanning optimism that the long period of deflation is set to end .
