german justice authorities reportedly will not take legal action against us defense secretary donald rumsfeld over the abu ghraib prisoner abuse scandal in iraq .
but prosecutors have yet to decide . german court officials have rejected claims in the daily newspaper tagesspiegel friday that german federal prosecutor kay nehm would not seek to try rumsfeld because no germans were victims of the us troop offences at the notorious prison near baghdad . " we have yet to decide whether or not to pursue the charge , " said a federal court spokesman thursday . but the paper reported that under current law , nehm could only take action if germans were suspected of committing crimes or of being the victims of crimes . on november 30 , an international legal team filed a criminal complaint in berlin against rumsfeld and other senior us officials over the abuses . the german factor the new york-based center for constitutional rights -lrb- ccr -rrb- and berlin 's republican lawyers ' association said they and four iraqi citizens mistreated by us soldiers were seeking a probe by german prosecutors of us policy-makers . they said they had chosen germany because of its code of crimes against international law , introduced in 2002 , which grants german courts universal jurisdiction in cases involving war crimes or crimes against humanity . the ccr said that the four iraqis it was representing had been victims of mistreatment including electric shock , severe beatings , sleep and food deprivation and sexual abuse while in us custody . " frivolous lawsuits " rumsfeld was scheduled to take part in an international security conference in the southern city of munich next month , but pulled out due to prior commitments amid speculation he was snubbing germany over the possible legal action . in december , the pentagon expressed concern over the criminal complaint and warned that " frivolous lawsuits " could affect broader us-german relations . according to human rights watch , two investigations have shown that rumsfeld 's policies on interrogation had contributed to torture and abuse in both iraq and afghanistan .

the judges described the procedure , which typically involves cutting off the clitoris and other parts of genitalia in pre-pubescent and teenage girls , as a " cruel , grave form of abuse that is impossible to justify " and a clear violation of the welfare rights of the child . child protection versus cultural tradition the case involved a gambian-born woman who married a german man in gambia in 2000 and brought her daughter from a previous relationship to germany .
the girl was to be sent back to the woman 's extended family in gambia in 2003 so that her mother could pursue a training course in nursing for the elderly . however , days before the girl 's departure , relatives of the german husband alerted child welfare authorities that the daughter could be threatened with genital mutilation . the mother , who underwent female circumcision herself at the age of 13 , had defended the ritual as a cultural tradition . dresden-based social worker matthias hirche , who is working on the case pointed out on thursday that the federal administrative court had categorically rejected the mother 's stance .

the judges said the fact that the girl 's grandmother had been unable to spare her own daughter from the inhuman procedure raised worries that the grandmother , under the influence of the extended family , would be unable to prevent it from happening to her granddaughter . judges in karlsruhe also made it clear on thursday that the lower court in the eastern city of dresden which issued the original ruling , and the local child welfare office must now act to ensure the child is not taken out of the country where she might be threatened with excision . the court added that the girl could be taken from her mother and put in foster care again if necessary to protect her . state authorities have also withheld her passport .
" we have to ensure that the girl does n't get sent to africa or to france or britain , where genital mutilation is secretly practiced , " said hirche .

dirie is a strong advocate of the issue , which is especially problematic in africa .
the court found that between 80 and 90 percent of woman and girls in gambia undergo excision , known in some countries as female circumcision . an estimated 130 million women have been subjected to female circumcision and 2 million undergo the procedure each year , according to officials at a conference on female circumcision held in november 2003 in sweden . excision impairs a woman 's ability to enjoy sexual relations , and is traditionally seen as controlling female sexuality and improving a girl 's marriage prospects . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de female circumcision threatens girls in germany female circumsion is n't just a problem in african countries .

the judges said the fact that the girl 's grandmother had been unable to spare her own daughter from the inhuman procedure raised worries that the grandmother , under the influence of the extended family , would be unable to prevent it from happening to her granddaughter . judges in karlsruhe also made it clear on thursday that the lower court in the eastern city of dresden which issued the original ruling , and the local child welfare office must now act to ensure the child is not taken out of the country where she might be threatened with excision . the court added that the girl could be taken from her mother and put in foster care again if necessary to protect her . state authorities have also withheld her passport .
" we have to ensure that the girl does n't get sent to africa or to france or britain , where genital mutilation is secretly practiced , " said hirche .
" but to monitor that will still be tough , " he added . rampant practice genital mutilation is practiced in some 28 african countries , despite laws that outlaw it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top-model waris dirie waits at a unicef press conference on human right for girls in berlin , nov .

the judges described the procedure , which typically involves cutting off the clitoris and other parts of genitalia in pre-pubescent and teenage girls , as a " cruel , grave form of abuse that is impossible to justify " and a clear violation of the welfare rights of the child . child protection versus cultural tradition the case involved a gambian-born woman who married a german man in gambia in 2000 and brought her daughter from a previous relationship to germany .
the girl was to be sent back to the woman 's extended family in gambia in 2003 so that her mother could pursue a training course in nursing for the elderly . however , days before the girl 's departure , relatives of the german husband alerted child welfare authorities that the daughter could be threatened with genital mutilation . the mother , who underwent female circumcision herself at the age of 13 , had defended the ritual as a cultural tradition . dresden-based social worker matthias hirche , who is working on the case pointed out on thursday that the federal administrative court had categorically rejected the mother 's stance .

her mother is now divorced from her german husband . the court in karlsruhe ruled that the girl would most likely be faced with genital mutilation if she was sent to her mother 's family in gambia .
the judges said the fact that the girl 's grandmother had been unable to spare her own daughter from the inhuman procedure raised worries that the grandmother , under the influence of the extended family , would be unable to prevent it from happening to her granddaughter . judges in karlsruhe also made it clear on thursday that the lower court in the eastern city of dresden which issued the original ruling , and the local child welfare office must now act to ensure the child is not taken out of the country where she might be threatened with excision . the court added that the girl could be taken from her mother and put in foster care again if necessary to protect her . state authorities have also withheld her passport .

the judges described the procedure , which typically involves cutting off the clitoris and other parts of genitalia in pre-pubescent and teenage girls , as a " cruel , grave form of abuse that is impossible to justify " and a clear violation of the welfare rights of the child . child protection versus cultural tradition the case involved a gambian-born woman who married a german man in gambia in 2000 and brought her daughter from a previous relationship to germany .
the girl was to be sent back to the woman 's extended family in gambia in 2003 so that her mother could pursue a training course in nursing for the elderly . however , days before the girl 's departure , relatives of the german husband alerted child welfare authorities that the daughter could be threatened with genital mutilation . the mother , who underwent female circumcision herself at the age of 13 , had defended the ritual as a cultural tradition . dresden-based social worker matthias hirche , who is working on the case pointed out on thursday that the federal administrative court had categorically rejected the mother 's stance .

her mother is now divorced from her german husband . the court in karlsruhe ruled that the girl would most likely be faced with genital mutilation if she was sent to her mother 's family in gambia .
the judges said the fact that the girl 's grandmother had been unable to spare her own daughter from the inhuman procedure raised worries that the grandmother , under the influence of the extended family , would be unable to prevent it from happening to her granddaughter . judges in karlsruhe also made it clear on thursday that the lower court in the eastern city of dresden which issued the original ruling , and the local child welfare office must now act to ensure the child is not taken out of the country where she might be threatened with excision . the court added that the girl could be taken from her mother and put in foster care again if necessary to protect her . state authorities have also withheld her passport .
" we have to ensure that the girl does n't get sent to africa or to france or britain , where genital mutilation is secretly practiced , " said hirche .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.01.2005 frankfurt fears lse takeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london 's financial district the city already dwarfs frankfurt as deutsche börse presses ahead with plans to buy the london stock exchange , concern is growing in germany that frankfurt could lose out to the city as a financial center in the event of a deal . when deutsche börse chief werner seifert unveiled the latest details of the german stock market 's plans to buy the venerable lse on thursday , he insisted that a tie-up was not about national egos . " it 's not about frankfurt versus london .
both sides will benefit , " seifert repeated a number of times during a news conference . and on paper at least , things look as if they would remain very much the same both on the thames and on the river main in frankfurt .
both exchanges would continue to be overseen by the regulatory authorities of their corresponding countries and trading would continue to be carried out in the euro in frankfurt and sterling in london . london would have equal say in the running of the company , with deutsche börse promising that seven of the 14 shareholder representatives on the supervisory board would have " close ties to the city of london " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt skyline at the same time , deutsche börse promised to retain its global headquarters in frankfurt -lrb- photo -rrb- .
and asked where he would have his main office , seifert insisted it would be frankfurt , even if he immediately added : " i 'm always travelling anyway . " " reverse takeover " but despite such promises , the term " reverse takeover " quickly did the rounds , with concerns that while the deutsche börse would be footing the bill , it would be london that would finally be in command . deutsche börse offered to base the combined cash equities , derivatives and clearing businesses in london , and lse chief clara furse would be offered the job of being in charge of cash equities .
and since the reputation of the city is more powerful than frankfurt anyway , many of the big banks are now considered likely to move to london . " let 's not kid ourselves .
a shift would represent a noticeable weakening of germany and frankfurt as a financial centre , " said the head of deka bank , axel weber . and erlangen university professor and stock market expert wolfgang gerke remarked that following the spectacular failure of the ambitious " ix " merger between deutsche börse and the lse in 2000 , " the germans are bending over backwards " this time round to woo london . " from a german point of view , there 's reason to be nervous , " gerke said . redundancies and re-location ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chairman of the board of german stock exchange -lrb- deutsche börse ag -rrb- werner g. seifert seifert promised on thursday that there were would be no job cuts in london if the merger went ahead .
but he did not repeat an earlier pledge that there would be no compulsory redundancies in frankfurt and no german employees would be forced to move to london against their will . " the issue was clearly not important enough for him to repeat this time round , " the mass-circulation daily bild complained in its friday edition . herbert walter , an official of the giant services sector labor union verdi and a member of deutsche börse 's supervisory board , said he believed seifert would honor his pledge for no compulsory redundancies . " but the issue more about frankfurt as a financial center rather than just deutsche börse as a company , " walter said .
" it is to be feared that all the big banks and consultancy firms will move to london .
frankfurt would lose out in know-how and in importance . " the trend to london winfried hartmann , head of the investment fund frankfurt-trust , noted that frankfurt had already lost out to london in the area of investment banking in recent years .
and that trend would continue in the event of a merger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new london stock exchange , -lrb- lse -rrb- , building in paternoster square , london , friday , december 17 , 2004 .

27 marked the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz death camp .
dw-world readers comment on what needs to be done to keep the memory alive . perhaps one of the best ways to keep the memory of the holocaust alive is to remember the story of anne frank .
your piece -lrb- " anne frank : the face of the holocaust " -rrb- was beautifully poetic in its simplicity and its honesty .
the story of anne frank will , i trust , be remembered for as long as we have hearts to love and sorrows to grieve .
thanks again for the article . - laurence hicks i think that those of us who live in the united states should pay more attention to what happened in nazi germany .
we have people in this country who believe that george bush was sent to us by god and for that reason can do no wrong .
this is the same way many germans thought of adolf hitler during world war ii . - lee davis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky is lit over the collapsed crematorium in the former nazi concentration camp of auschwitz-birkenau on jan .
27 , 2005 during the commemoration for the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the concentration camp i think that the discussion of the holocaust is very limited because of non-jewish people being so fearful of being accused of anti-semitism .
truly , the holocuast is a lesson about anti-semitism in a closed view but in an open mind it is really a lesson about racism and ultra-nationalism .
constantly linking the holocaust to anti-semitism undermines the abilities of all people to point out and deal with injustices of race and ultra-nationalism .
it is a voice that needs a balance .
it is important not to confuse critics of israel 's political policies and government , with anti-semites .
in many cases , the harshness of israeli policy , and the injustices caused by it , are ignored because of this .
rational people can not hold israel accountable for its actions .
the result is that supporters of the israeli policy in the middle-east simply have a louder voice that leaves many others , those affected by racism and similar injustices , crying in the dark .
who can speak up for the millions upon millions of genocide and racism victims in the current world ?
we have a collective responsibility to take care of all people and protect their human rights .
we should never use the injustices of the past as an excuse to isolate and empower ourselves in a manner that allows us to seek revenge and perpetrate similar acts against other groups of people .
reflect as one people , not as jews , germans , palestinians , blacks , whites , asians , hutus , tutsis and so on .
holocaust aniversary and reflection offers a valuable voice on the world stage .
give others respect for their struggles and losses of the past as well .
please use the voice to demonstrate the need for compassion and justice for all people in the world . - chris battochio , canada the holocaust is not relevant as long as the killing fields of palestine , afghanistan and iraq exist .
when the us and its allies and the israeli forces cease their onslaught of the innocent men , women and children of afghanistan , iraq and palestine , then someone can say that they have heeeded the lessons of the nazi holocaust .
otherwise nothing has changed . - kenneth t. tellis , canada no i do n't think enough is being done to remember the holocaust or its survivors .
the main fault lies with the school systems , because most people have entrusted the schools to teach our children what is important .
when i was going to school , i learned nothing of the world wars nor the holocaust .
most of the history we studied involved memorizing meaningles dates , battles and names .
there was no " human connection . "
it has only been through homeschooling my own child that i have developed any understanding of , interest in or compassion for the plight of the persecuted jews in that ugly part of history .
there are still survivors , and children and grandchildren of survivors .
many of them yearn to share their history .
the jews are a proud lot with a long history , and those that wish to share it with the world should be encouraged to teach our children well . - hellen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler bows in front of a memorial for the victims of the auschwitz death camp the tragedy of auschwitz should be a lesson for all peoples , not only for europeans .
unfortunately in anti-semitic , totalitarian countries , where knowledge of the horrors of the holocaust is needed the most , auschwitz can only be a lesson if it is allowed to be " a lesson " in schools .
as an american teacher teaching in an egyptian english-speaking school , i witnessed one of the grossest atrocities of my teaching career .
the school had disected the american-published highschool history textbooks so that all the pages referring to the holocaust were removed and their page numbers blackened out in the index .
in the middle east , teaching the holocaust is not allowed , as they feel it validates the creation of israel .
having lived in the region for many years , i can tell you this is the norm in schools here , not a gross unique case .
the responsibility to teach the lessons of auschwitz lies not only on the shoulders of the europeans but on the shoulders of all those priviledged enough to come from countries where the unedited version of history is made public knowledge . - monique slave labor compensation the amount that is being given as compensation for germany 's forced slave labor is not enough . . . the health issues arising with age due to immense negligent health and welfare inflicted , the emotional scars that have been set deep into the soul , and the precious loss of life 's years seem to have little value with the way the compensation has awarded .
my mother receives less than $ 40 -lrb- € 30.6 -rrb- a month , and my dad is still awaiting some sort of payment - although both have physical paper proof of their confinement and labor abuse .
the media gives more words than there is strength to recognize the humans that have suffered and now must wait for menial restitution . - mary jane kymer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : " we must never forget " newspapers across europe on friday urged the world never to forget the horrors perpetrated by the nazis at auschwitz where ceremonies marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the death camp took place thursday .

27 marked the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz death camp .
dw-world readers comment on what needs to be done to keep the memory alive . perhaps one of the best ways to keep the memory of the holocaust alive is to remember the story of anne frank .
your piece -lrb- " anne frank : the face of the holocaust " -rrb- was beautifully poetic in its simplicity and its honesty .
the story of anne frank will , i trust , be remembered for as long as we have hearts to love and sorrows to grieve .
thanks again for the article . - laurence hicks i think that those of us who live in the united states should pay more attention to what happened in nazi germany .
we have people in this country who believe that george bush was sent to us by god and for that reason can do no wrong .
this is the same way many germans thought of adolf hitler during world war ii . - lee davis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky is lit over the collapsed crematorium in the former nazi concentration camp of auschwitz-birkenau on jan .
27 , 2005 during the commemoration for the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the concentration camp i think that the discussion of the holocaust is very limited because of non-jewish people being so fearful of being accused of anti-semitism .
truly , the holocuast is a lesson about anti-semitism in a closed view but in an open mind it is really a lesson about racism and ultra-nationalism .
constantly linking the holocaust to anti-semitism undermines the abilities of all people to point out and deal with injustices of race and ultra-nationalism .
it is a voice that needs a balance .
it is important not to confuse critics of israel 's political policies and government , with anti-semites .
in many cases , the harshness of israeli policy , and the injustices caused by it , are ignored because of this .
rational people can not hold israel accountable for its actions .
the result is that supporters of the israeli policy in the middle-east simply have a louder voice that leaves many others , those affected by racism and similar injustices , crying in the dark .
who can speak up for the millions upon millions of genocide and racism victims in the current world ?
we have a collective responsibility to take care of all people and protect their human rights .
we should never use the injustices of the past as an excuse to isolate and empower ourselves in a manner that allows us to seek revenge and perpetrate similar acts against other groups of people .
reflect as one people , not as jews , germans , palestinians , blacks , whites , asians , hutus , tutsis and so on .
holocaust aniversary and reflection offers a valuable voice on the world stage .
give others respect for their struggles and losses of the past as well .
please use the voice to demonstrate the need for compassion and justice for all people in the world . - chris battochio , canada the holocaust is not relevant as long as the killing fields of palestine , afghanistan and iraq exist .
when the us and its allies and the israeli forces cease their onslaught of the innocent men , women and children of afghanistan , iraq and palestine , then someone can say that they have heeeded the lessons of the nazi holocaust .
otherwise nothing has changed . - kenneth t. tellis , canada no i do n't think enough is being done to remember the holocaust or its survivors .
the main fault lies with the school systems , because most people have entrusted the schools to teach our children what is important .
when i was going to school , i learned nothing of the world wars nor the holocaust .
most of the history we studied involved memorizing meaningles dates , battles and names .
there was no " human connection . "
it has only been through homeschooling my own child that i have developed any understanding of , interest in or compassion for the plight of the persecuted jews in that ugly part of history .
there are still survivors , and children and grandchildren of survivors .
many of them yearn to share their history .
the jews are a proud lot with a long history , and those that wish to share it with the world should be encouraged to teach our children well . - hellen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler bows in front of a memorial for the victims of the auschwitz death camp the tragedy of auschwitz should be a lesson for all peoples , not only for europeans .
unfortunately in anti-semitic , totalitarian countries , where knowledge of the horrors of the holocaust is needed the most , auschwitz can only be a lesson if it is allowed to be " a lesson " in schools .
as an american teacher teaching in an egyptian english-speaking school , i witnessed one of the grossest atrocities of my teaching career .
the school had disected the american-published highschool history textbooks so that all the pages referring to the holocaust were removed and their page numbers blackened out in the index .
in the middle east , teaching the holocaust is not allowed , as they feel it validates the creation of israel .
having lived in the region for many years , i can tell you this is the norm in schools here , not a gross unique case .
the responsibility to teach the lessons of auschwitz lies not only on the shoulders of the europeans but on the shoulders of all those priviledged enough to come from countries where the unedited version of history is made public knowledge . - monique slave labor compensation the amount that is being given as compensation for germany 's forced slave labor is not enough . . . the health issues arising with age due to immense negligent health and welfare inflicted , the emotional scars that have been set deep into the soul , and the precious loss of life 's years seem to have little value with the way the compensation has awarded .
my mother receives less than $ 40 -lrb- € 30.6 -rrb- a month , and my dad is still awaiting some sort of payment - although both have physical paper proof of their confinement and labor abuse .
the media gives more words than there is strength to recognize the humans that have suffered and now must wait for menial restitution . - mary jane kymer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : " we must never forget " newspapers across europe on friday urged the world never to forget the horrors perpetrated by the nazis at auschwitz where ceremonies marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the death camp took place thursday .

but a court ruling this week clearing the way for german tuition fees could change that . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe on wednesday struck down a law that had made university tuition fees illegal , arguing it violated the right of the country 's federal states to set education policy . besides revolutionizing higher education for germans , the impending fees could radically alter the makeup of foreigners studying at the country 's universities as they look for less-expensive alternatives . “ since there are no tuition fees here i thought i ’ d come and give it a shot , ” said kim dong-young , a 29-year-old korean studying product design at the university of applied sciences in potsdam , near berlin .
like for so many overseas students , germany 's attraction for kim was a combination of quality instruction and affordability . " obviously the standard of education was important to me , but so was the cost , " he said . while states run by social democratic governments said on thursday they will resist charging college students , conservative-led states want to quickly implement a system of fees . strapped for cash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are chronically underfunded and overfilled . proponents of charging tuition argue germany 's cash-strapped universities need the extra revenue to halt their decline into mediocrity .
but those against fees fear poorer students will find it harder to study with the added costs .
that problem could be especially acute for foreign students from the developing world . germany ’ s tuition-free universities have long been attractive to those students unable to afford more prestigious yet more expensive institutions in the united states or britain .
whether foreigners will still be willing to learn german to study at universities that are often considered at best average internationally is unclear . but some german academic officials remain confident foreign students will still come if the tuition fees are used to improve the quality of education on offer . " we do n't want to earn anything from foreign students , but rather we hope to finance better service that has to be offered to compete internationally : language courses , alumni parties , more student housing for our guests , " christian bode , head of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , told der spiegel newsmagazine . bildunterschrift : better education , better students ? fees could also have the unintended effect of increasing the quality of students from abroad that come to germany .
dismal graduation rates for foreigners have prompted criticism that the country is failing to properly select and prepare prospective overseas students . according to a recent study by a non-profit education organization , only a quarter of all foreign students manage to graduate from german university .
those lucky enough to get a degree normally take an average of eight years to do so .
countless more fail to enroll , unable to pass university entry exams . bode from the daad said he expected the best-qualified students would be ensured access to german universities through scholarships and educational grants .
still , there are sure to be those that fall through the cracks if the fees come . hussein berjavi , a 22-year-old from lebanon currently taking preparatory classes in berlin in a bid to study engineering , said he did n't qualify for financial aid elsewhere , so he likely would n't in germany . " america , england , i could never afford to study in those places , " he said .

" we are most decisively in favor of the fact that iran completely gives up military use of nuclear power , forever if at all possible , " schröder told global political and business leaders at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland . " but we are just as convinced that has to be achieved through diplomatic and political means , " he added . against military action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's main bushehr nuclear power plant , is located southwest of the capital tehran .
schröder 's comments came amid reports that the european union had hardened its stance over iran 's controversial nuclear plans , by urging tehran to completely dismantle its nuclear fuel program in order to guarantee that it does not seek atomic weapons . iran has denied that crucial negotiations with britain , france and germany for a long-term solution to the issue were deadlocked . but schröder reiterated his rejection of the use of force , a week after us president george w. bush said he could not rule out military action if iran could not be persuaded to abandon its nuclear energy program .
washington suspects iran is trying to build nuclear weapons . " this is a hotbed region , the last thing we need is a military conflict in that region , " schröder said .

according to a report on a closed-door meeting in geneva this month , representatives of britain , france and germany told iran that " nothing short of full cessation and dismantling of iran 's fuel cycle efforts would give the eu big three the objective guarantees they need that iran 's nuclear program is peaceful . " senior iranian government officials were also attending the forum 's annual meeting in davos this week . iran suspended nuclear enrichment , the key process that makes fuel for nuclear reactors but also the explosive core of atomic bombs , under a deal clinched in november by the three eu states . afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu sticks to diplomacy in iran the european union is playing down the threat of a us strike against iran , saying that a diplomatic solution to tehran ’ s nuclear ambitions will be found .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.01.2005 tuition fees likely to deter foreigners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students are protesting against the planned fees foreign university students have long been attracted to germany as an inexpensive alternative to pricier america and britain .
but a court ruling this week clearing the way for german tuition fees could change that . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe on wednesday struck down a law that had made university tuition fees illegal , arguing it violated the right of the country 's federal states to set education policy . besides revolutionizing higher education for germans , the impending fees could radically alter the makeup of foreigners studying at the country 's universities as they look for less-expensive alternatives . “ since there are no tuition fees here i thought i ’ d come and give it a shot , ” said kim dong-young , a 29-year-old korean studying product design at the university of applied sciences in potsdam , near berlin .
like for so many overseas students , germany 's attraction for kim was a combination of quality instruction and affordability . " obviously the standard of education was important to me , but so was the cost , " he said . while states run by social democratic governments said on thursday they will resist charging college students , conservative-led states want to quickly implement a system of fees . strapped for cash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are chronically underfunded and overfilled . proponents of charging tuition argue germany 's cash-strapped universities need the extra revenue to halt their decline into mediocrity .
but those against fees fear poorer students will find it harder to study with the added costs .
that problem could be especially acute for foreign students from the developing world . germany ’ s tuition-free universities have long been attractive to those students unable to afford more prestigious yet more expensive institutions in the united states or britain .
whether foreigners will still be willing to learn german to study at universities that are often considered at best average internationally is unclear . but some german academic officials remain confident foreign students will still come if the tuition fees are used to improve the quality of education on offer . " we do n't want to earn anything from foreign students , but rather we hope to finance better service that has to be offered to compete internationally : language courses , alumni parties , more student housing for our guests , " christian bode , head of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , told der spiegel newsmagazine . bildunterschrift : better education , better students ? fees could also have the unintended effect of increasing the quality of students from abroad that come to germany .
dismal graduation rates for foreigners have prompted criticism that the country is failing to properly select and prepare prospective overseas students . according to a recent study by a non-profit education organization , only a quarter of all foreign students manage to graduate from german university .
those lucky enough to get a degree normally take an average of eight years to do so .
countless more fail to enroll , unable to pass university entry exams . bode from the daad said he expected the best-qualified students would be ensured access to german universities through scholarships and educational grants .
still , there are sure to be those that fall through the cracks if the fees come . hussein berjavi , a 22-year-old from lebanon currently taking preparatory classes in berlin in a bid to study engineering , said he did n't qualify for financial aid elsewhere , so he likely would n't in germany . " america , england , i could never afford to study in those places , " he said .
" things are a lot cheaper here .

they 're planning to match their words with votes , and officials expect at least 26,000 to cast a ballot in germany . puffing on cigarette after cigarette , iraqi journalist omar fadhil taps away at a keyboard , chatting online from his berlin office to his radio correspondents in baghdad . for the past month , fadhil , who lives in baghdad , has been heading the staff of " election monitor iraq , " a program broadcast from berlin via the internet to iraq , where it appears on local radio stations once a day , five days a week .
sponsored by a german foundation , with support from the german foreign office , election monitor iraq is designed to give iraqis something they do n't get much of : trustworthy news about the country 's first democratic election in more than 50 years . " we want to explain to people why it 's important , why they should go to vote , " said fadhil , who came up to berlin from baghdad to coordinate the team during the elections . whether iraq is ready for sunday 's vote has been the subject of sharp debate in recent months .
violent attacks , like the chain of car bombings across the country on wednesday that killed at least five , are the norm and jordanian jihadist abu musab al-zarqawi has promised chaos on election day . amimals better off than humans fadhil , who will stay in germany another 20 days said that , while many people are too scared to go out and vote , just as many will head out because they see no other alternative . " i want to have security , " he said .
" at the moment , we ca n't go out after 7 p.m.
if a dog is hungry he just has to go outside and eat .
animals are better off than humans at the moment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : registration topped 26,000 iraqis in germany , and 280,000 worldwide the 27-year-old will vote in germany , along with an estimated 26,000 other iraqis this weekend in polling places in mannheim , munich , cologne and berlin .
in all , iraqis in 14 countries , from the us , to the netherlands to australia will vote from friday to sunday , according to the international organization for migration , which is coordinating the overseas vote .
iom officials say they have registered more than 280,000 registered voters . " there certainly seems to be a great enthusiasm to take part , " said jana kristic , an iom organizer in germany . " we need to start some time " on wednesday , german-iraqi election workers gathered for a last minute election organization workshop in berlin .
though the class mostly dwelt on technical details , the importance of the moment was n't lost on the iraqis taking part . " i 've dreamed the whole time that there would be elections in iraq , and now here i am , helping it along , " said zainab hassin , 34 , who fled to cologne from baghdad in 1994 . hassin 's family in baghdad has stayed healthy and intact despite the chaos and danger in her homeland .
the chaotic security situation is perhaps one of the most important reasons to hold elections , she said . " we need this now , " she said .
" we need to start some time . " democracy needs to win growing pains are part of any young democracy , said baker schwani , 37 , a kurd who fled iraq in 1996 .
from the time he was in seventh grade , in 1980 , to the time he graduated university in 1991 , schwani said he knew only war and dictatorship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polling places will be under tight security over the voting weekend " democracy is n't not something we can just buy , we need to fight for it , " said schwani , who will be among the election workers handling an estimated 10,000 iraqi voters in cologne over the weekend . in the end , he said , it is n't even important who wins .
if a large percentage of the population turns out to vote , it could be a sign that the democracy , however fragile , is beginning to take root .
and at the moment , that 's enough for him , he said . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany thwarts attack on iraqi leader german police have arrested four men suspected of planning an attack on iraqi prime minister ayad allawi , who was in berlin on friday .

the girl was to be sent back to the woman 's extended family in gambia in 2003 so that her mother could pursue a training course in nursing for the elderly . however , days before the girl 's departure , relatives of the german husband alerted child welfare authorities that the daughter could be threatened with genital mutilation . the mother , who underwent female circumcision herself at the age of 13 , had defended the ritual as a cultural tradition . dresden-based social worker matthias hirche , who is working on the case pointed out on thursday that the federal administrative court had categorically rejected the mother 's stance .

the judges said the fact that the girl 's grandmother had been unable to spare her own daughter from the inhuman procedure raised worries that the grandmother , under the influence of the extended family , would be unable to prevent it from happening to her granddaughter . judges in karlsruhe also made it clear on thursday that the lower court in the eastern city of dresden which issued the original ruling , and the local child welfare office must now act to ensure the child is not taken out of the country where she might be threatened with excision . the court added that the girl could be taken from her mother and put in foster care again if necessary to protect her . state authorities have also withheld her passport .
" we have to ensure that the girl does n't get sent to africa or to france or britain , where genital mutilation is secretly practiced , " said hirche .

" the survivors have attempted to recount the unimaginable , " the paris-based paper wrote .
" who will utter the unspeakable when the last of us has gone ? " it asked .
" the countries bear responsibility that schools carry on in keeping alive the memory , " it wrote and warned , " also , every individual has to take care that the memory does n't fade . " italian daily corriere della sera also underlined the importance of remembering the holocaust .
" one needs to go back there always and look at the rail tracks , the barbed wire , the gas chambers and the barracks , " the milan-based paper wrote .
" and one must take their kids there and advise them to bring their kids and never stop explaining about the unexplainable and the unending horror of this abyss . " in britain , most newspapers filled their front pages with coverage of the poignant anniversary ceremony , many splashing pictures of an elderly auschwitz survivor fighting back tears as he re-entered the camp . " the world remembers " was the banner headline in the guardian above a lengthy account of the ceremony attended by various heads of state and government .
the tone of editorial comment provided by some papers was made clear by eadlines such as " never again , " in the times , and the daily mail 's " we must never forget " . " auschwitz should never be forgotten , " the times said in an editorial , condemning attempts to " relativize " the holocaust 's horrors by other groups comparing their plight to that of the jews .

" almost every aspect of life in germany is still burdened by the awful legacy , " the paper wrote listing the country 's reluctance to deploy troops abroad , pacifism , environmental commitments , and opposition to stem-cell research , language taboos and consensus-seeking politics as some of the examples .
the paper said germans had largely succeeded in coming to terms with the past .
" one must applaud the germans , " it wrote .
" the country knows that it bears a greater responsibility when it comes to democracy and political extremism . " german newspapers too dwelt on the country 's special responsibility . weekly die zeit identified " only one rule " for anyone trying to come to terms with auschwitz : " when you are not disturbed in the depths of your soul every time you hear about it ... then there is something wrong . " conservative berlin-based paper die welt exhorted readers to mark the anniversary with " sorrow and humility " .
while " no exoneration can be sought in the past or the future , " said the daily , the german people could show their dignity by " standing up for human rights wherever they are violated , for the rule of law and for freedom , wherever they are repressed " .
the paper also suggested that europe is seeking to create a common identity by remembering the mass murder of jews . " auschwitz put the world to shame , " read the front-page headline in polish daily zycie warszawy .
" the free world stood idle , " headlined the centre-left gazeta wyborcza , which devoted its entire front page and four inside pages to the ceremonies on thursday to mark the camp 's liberation on january 27 , 1945 , by the soviet red army . spanish daily el pais decried the failure to learn the lessons of the holocaust .

they 're planning to match their words with votes , and officials expect at least 26,000 to cast a ballot in germany . puffing on cigarette after cigarette , iraqi journalist omar fadhil taps away at a keyboard , chatting online from his berlin office to his radio correspondents in baghdad . for the past month , fadhil , who lives in baghdad , has been heading the staff of " election monitor iraq , " a program broadcast from berlin via the internet to iraq , where it appears on local radio stations once a day , five days a week .
sponsored by a german foundation , with support from the german foreign office , election monitor iraq is designed to give iraqis something they do n't get much of : trustworthy news about the country 's first democratic election in more than 50 years . " we want to explain to people why it 's important , why they should go to vote , " said fadhil , who came up to berlin from baghdad to coordinate the team during the elections . whether iraq is ready for sunday 's vote has been the subject of sharp debate in recent months .
violent attacks , like the chain of car bombings across the country on wednesday that killed at least five , are the norm and jordanian jihadist abu musab al-zarqawi has promised chaos on election day . amimals better off than humans fadhil , who will stay in germany another 20 days said that , while many people are too scared to go out and vote , just as many will head out because they see no other alternative . " i want to have security , " he said .
" at the moment , we ca n't go out after 7 p.m.
if a dog is hungry he just has to go outside and eat .
animals are better off than humans at the moment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : registration topped 26,000 iraqis in germany , and 280,000 worldwide the 27-year-old will vote in germany , along with an estimated 26,000 other iraqis this weekend in polling places in mannheim , munich , cologne and berlin .
in all , iraqis in 14 countries , from the us , to the netherlands to australia will vote from friday to sunday , according to the international organization for migration , which is coordinating the overseas vote .
iom officials say they have registered more than 280,000 registered voters . " there certainly seems to be a great enthusiasm to take part , " said jana kristic , an iom organizer in germany . " we need to start some time " on wednesday , german-iraqi election workers gathered for a last minute election organization workshop in berlin .
though the class mostly dwelt on technical details , the importance of the moment was n't lost on the iraqis taking part . " i 've dreamed the whole time that there would be elections in iraq , and now here i am , helping it along , " said zainab hassin , 34 , who fled to cologne from baghdad in 1994 . hassin 's family in baghdad has stayed healthy and intact despite the chaos and danger in her homeland .
the chaotic security situation is perhaps one of the most important reasons to hold elections , she said . " we need this now , " she said .
" we need to start some time . " democracy needs to win growing pains are part of any young democracy , said baker schwani , 37 , a kurd who fled iraq in 1996 .
from the time he was in seventh grade , in 1980 , to the time he graduated university in 1991 , schwani said he knew only war and dictatorship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polling places will be under tight security over the voting weekend " democracy is n't not something we can just buy , we need to fight for it , " said schwani , who will be among the election workers handling an estimated 10,000 iraqi voters in cologne over the weekend . in the end , he said , it is n't even important who wins .
if a large percentage of the population turns out to vote , it could be a sign that the democracy , however fragile , is beginning to take root .
and at the moment , that 's enough for him , he said . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany thwarts attack on iraqi leader german police have arrested four men suspected of planning an attack on iraqi prime minister ayad allawi , who was in berlin on friday .

unfortunately , the city also featured in one of the murkiest chapters in his career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. architect philip johnson his " philip johnson house " at checkpoint charlie on the upmarket friedrichstrasse was built in 1994 .
and perhaps somewhatt ironically , the architect famously responsible for the politically charged holocaust memorial in berlin is a philip johnson protégé .
peter eisenman might be no stranger to scandal himself , but he 's never been reviled as philip johnson -lrb- photo -rrb- was when he expressed admiration for hitler in the 1930s .
after years cultivating a determinedly controversial image as an architect , it was only in his old age that johnson spoke openly about private matters such as his homosexuality and his past as a hitler disciple , explaining that he 'd become " fascinated with power " during his time in berlin in the 1930s .
" i have no excuse -lrb- for -rrb- such utter , unbelievable stupidity . ...
i do n't know how you expiate guilt , " he once said .
overwhelming the negatives for many critics , the nazi association dogged him throughout his career , but it was largely forgotten by the mainstream and did little damage to his career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eisenman his work went a long way to canceling out his questionable politics , and in the 1980s and 1990s , he championed the careers of both peter eisenman -lrb- photo -rrb- and frank gehry , two pre-eminent us architects and both jewish .
in the post-war years , he was also happy to work with jewish clients , even designing a nuclear reactor in israel , completed in 1960 .
many saw his choice of commissions as a deliberate attempt to distance himself from the earlier charges of anti-semitism .
" we forgave , but we did n't forget , " gehry was quoted wednesday .
" he was so powerful a force for the good in our profession that it overwhelmed all negatives . "
" the hitler mystique " born into a wealthy family in 1906 , johnson had an elitist , aristocratic take on the world and experiemnted with a number of architectural different styles during his career . he first made his name curating an exhibition on the international style in 1932 at what was then the brand-new museum of modern art in new york , in 1953 creating its renowned sculpture garden .
his initial fascination with the international style was spawned in germany , which he first visited in 1928 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi party leader adolf hitler is standing in an open cabriolet as he acknowledges an sa parade in honor of his birthday , in front of the german chancellory in berlin , april 20 , 1938 .
standing beside the car is sa chief viktor lutze .
-lrb- ap photo -rrb- in 1932 , he attended a rally in potsdam and saw hitler speak .
transfixed by what he called hitler 's " mystique , " he fast succumbed to a romantic , nietzsche-esque image of fascism , and began working as german correspondent for the right-wing us magazine social justice .
back in the us , he founded a set up a short-lived political party based on the national socialists .
american colleagues even suspected him of spying for the third reich .

mädchen .
the judges described the procedure , which typically involves cutting off the clitoris and other parts of genitalia in pre-pubescent and teenage girls , as a " cruel , grave form of abuse that is impossible to justify " and a clear violation of the welfare rights of the child . child protection versus cultural tradition the case involved a gambian-born woman who married a german man in gambia in 2000 and brought her daughter from a previous relationship to germany .
the girl was to be sent back to the woman 's extended family in gambia in 2003 so that her mother could pursue a training course in nursing for the elderly . however , days before the girl 's departure , relatives of the german husband alerted child welfare authorities that the daughter could be threatened with genital mutilation . the mother , who underwent female circumcision herself at the age of 13 , had defended the ritual as a cultural tradition . dresden-based social worker matthias hirche , who is working on the case pointed out on thursday that the federal administrative court had categorically rejected the mother 's stance .
" the court has awarded more importance to the protection of the child than parents ' rights or culture and tradition , " he said . no travel abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's demonstration in somalia against female circumcision .
the girl who was placed in foster care immediately following an emergency ruling by local child welfare authorities once the matter came to light , is now back with her mother .
her mother is now divorced from her german husband . the court in karlsruhe ruled that the girl would most likely be faced with genital mutilation if she was sent to her mother 's family in gambia .
the judges said the fact that the girl 's grandmother had been unable to spare her own daughter from the inhuman procedure raised worries that the grandmother , under the influence of the extended family , would be unable to prevent it from happening to her granddaughter . judges in karlsruhe also made it clear on thursday that the lower court in the eastern city of dresden which issued the original ruling , and the local child welfare office must now act to ensure the child is not taken out of the country where she might be threatened with excision . the court added that the girl could be taken from her mother and put in foster care again if necessary to protect her . state authorities have also withheld her passport .
" we have to ensure that the girl does n't get sent to africa or to france or britain , where genital mutilation is secretly practiced , " said hirche .
" but to monitor that will still be tough , " he added . rampant practice genital mutilation is practiced in some 28 african countries , despite laws that outlaw it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top-model waris dirie waits at a unicef press conference on human right for girls in berlin , nov .
7 , 2002 , while the press watches a video on female circumcision .
dirie is a strong advocate of the issue , which is especially problematic in africa .

" the survivors have attempted to recount the unimaginable , " the paris-based paper wrote .
" who will utter the unspeakable when the last of us has gone ? " it asked .
" the countries bear responsibility that schools carry on in keeping alive the memory , " it wrote and warned , " also , every individual has to take care that the memory does n't fade . " italian daily corriere della sera also underlined the importance of remembering the holocaust .
" one needs to go back there always and look at the rail tracks , the barbed wire , the gas chambers and the barracks , " the milan-based paper wrote .
" and one must take their kids there and advise them to bring their kids and never stop explaining about the unexplainable and the unending horror of this abyss . " in britain , most newspapers filled their front pages with coverage of the poignant anniversary ceremony , many splashing pictures of an elderly auschwitz survivor fighting back tears as he re-entered the camp . " the world remembers " was the banner headline in the guardian above a lengthy account of the ceremony attended by various heads of state and government .
the tone of editorial comment provided by some papers was made clear by eadlines such as " never again , " in the times , and the daily mail 's " we must never forget " . " auschwitz should never be forgotten , " the times said in an editorial , condemning attempts to " relativize " the holocaust 's horrors by other groups comparing their plight to that of the jews .
" britons , like all europeans , must share the legacy of such evil .
the watchword must remain : never again , " it said . the paper also focused on germany 's guilt-riddled legacy .
" almost every aspect of life in germany is still burdened by the awful legacy , " the paper wrote listing the country 's reluctance to deploy troops abroad , pacifism , environmental commitments , and opposition to stem-cell research , language taboos and consensus-seeking politics as some of the examples .
the paper said germans had largely succeeded in coming to terms with the past .
" one must applaud the germans , " it wrote .
" the country knows that it bears a greater responsibility when it comes to democracy and political extremism . " german newspapers too dwelt on the country 's special responsibility . weekly die zeit identified " only one rule " for anyone trying to come to terms with auschwitz : " when you are not disturbed in the depths of your soul every time you hear about it ... then there is something wrong . " conservative berlin-based paper die welt exhorted readers to mark the anniversary with " sorrow and humility " .
while " no exoneration can be sought in the past or the future , " said the daily , the german people could show their dignity by " standing up for human rights wherever they are violated , for the rule of law and for freedom , wherever they are repressed " .
the paper also suggested that europe is seeking to create a common identity by remembering the mass murder of jews . " auschwitz put the world to shame , " read the front-page headline in polish daily zycie warszawy .
" the free world stood idle , " headlined the centre-left gazeta wyborcza , which devoted its entire front page and four inside pages to the ceremonies on thursday to mark the camp 's liberation on january 27 , 1945 , by the soviet red army . spanish daily el pais decried the failure to learn the lessons of the holocaust .

" one needs to go back there always and look at the rail tracks , the barbed wire , the gas chambers and the barracks , " the milan-based paper wrote .
" and one must take their kids there and advise them to bring their kids and never stop explaining about the unexplainable and the unending horror of this abyss . " in britain , most newspapers filled their front pages with coverage of the poignant anniversary ceremony , many splashing pictures of an elderly auschwitz survivor fighting back tears as he re-entered the camp . " the world remembers " was the banner headline in the guardian above a lengthy account of the ceremony attended by various heads of state and government .
the tone of editorial comment provided by some papers was made clear by eadlines such as " never again , " in the times , and the daily mail 's " we must never forget " . " auschwitz should never be forgotten , " the times said in an editorial , condemning attempts to " relativize " the holocaust 's horrors by other groups comparing their plight to that of the jews .
" britons , like all europeans , must share the legacy of such evil .
the watchword must remain : never again , " it said . the paper also focused on germany 's guilt-riddled legacy .
" almost every aspect of life in germany is still burdened by the awful legacy , " the paper wrote listing the country 's reluctance to deploy troops abroad , pacifism , environmental commitments , and opposition to stem-cell research , language taboos and consensus-seeking politics as some of the examples .
the paper said germans had largely succeeded in coming to terms with the past .
" one must applaud the germans , " it wrote .
" the country knows that it bears a greater responsibility when it comes to democracy and political extremism . " german newspapers too dwelt on the country 's special responsibility . weekly die zeit identified " only one rule " for anyone trying to come to terms with auschwitz : " when you are not disturbed in the depths of your soul every time you hear about it ... then there is something wrong . " conservative berlin-based paper die welt exhorted readers to mark the anniversary with " sorrow and humility " .
while " no exoneration can be sought in the past or the future , " said the daily , the german people could show their dignity by " standing up for human rights wherever they are violated , for the rule of law and for freedom , wherever they are repressed " .
the paper also suggested that europe is seeking to create a common identity by remembering the mass murder of jews . " auschwitz put the world to shame , " read the front-page headline in polish daily zycie warszawy .
" the free world stood idle , " headlined the centre-left gazeta wyborcza , which devoted its entire front page and four inside pages to the ceremonies on thursday to mark the camp 's liberation on january 27 , 1945 , by the soviet red army . spanish daily el pais decried the failure to learn the lessons of the holocaust .
" contrary to the new dawn promised after the second world war , mass genocide has been committed time and time again , " it wrote . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering germany 's darkest place commemorative events marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz continued throughout thursday as world leaders spoke of an evil that must never be allowed to surface again .

mädchen .
the judges described the procedure , which typically involves cutting off the clitoris and other parts of genitalia in pre-pubescent and teenage girls , as a " cruel , grave form of abuse that is impossible to justify " and a clear violation of the welfare rights of the child . child protection versus cultural tradition the case involved a gambian-born woman who married a german man in gambia in 2000 and brought her daughter from a previous relationship to germany .
the girl was to be sent back to the woman 's extended family in gambia in 2003 so that her mother could pursue a training course in nursing for the elderly . however , days before the girl 's departure , relatives of the german husband alerted child welfare authorities that the daughter could be threatened with genital mutilation . the mother , who underwent female circumcision herself at the age of 13 , had defended the ritual as a cultural tradition . dresden-based social worker matthias hirche , who is working on the case pointed out on thursday that the federal administrative court had categorically rejected the mother 's stance .
" the court has awarded more importance to the protection of the child than parents ' rights or culture and tradition , " he said . no travel abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's demonstration in somalia against female circumcision .
the girl who was placed in foster care immediately following an emergency ruling by local child welfare authorities once the matter came to light , is now back with her mother .
her mother is now divorced from her german husband . the court in karlsruhe ruled that the girl would most likely be faced with genital mutilation if she was sent to her mother 's family in gambia .
the judges said the fact that the girl 's grandmother had been unable to spare her own daughter from the inhuman procedure raised worries that the grandmother , under the influence of the extended family , would be unable to prevent it from happening to her granddaughter . judges in karlsruhe also made it clear on thursday that the lower court in the eastern city of dresden which issued the original ruling , and the local child welfare office must now act to ensure the child is not taken out of the country where she might be threatened with excision . the court added that the girl could be taken from her mother and put in foster care again if necessary to protect her . state authorities have also withheld her passport .
" we have to ensure that the girl does n't get sent to africa or to france or britain , where genital mutilation is secretly practiced , " said hirche .
" but to monitor that will still be tough , " he added . rampant practice genital mutilation is practiced in some 28 african countries , despite laws that outlaw it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top-model waris dirie waits at a unicef press conference on human right for girls in berlin , nov .

dirie is a strong advocate of the issue , which is especially problematic in africa .
the court found that between 80 and 90 percent of woman and girls in gambia undergo excision , known in some countries as female circumcision . an estimated 130 million women have been subjected to female circumcision and 2 million undergo the procedure each year , according to officials at a conference on female circumcision held in november 2003 in sweden . excision impairs a woman 's ability to enjoy sexual relations , and is traditionally seen as controlling female sexuality and improving a girl 's marriage prospects . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de female circumcision threatens girls in germany female circumsion is n't just a problem in african countries .

27 marked the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz death camp .
dw-world readers comment on what needs to be done to keep the memory alive . perhaps one of the best ways to keep the memory of the holocaust alive is to remember the story of anne frank .
your piece -lrb- " anne frank : the face of the holocaust " -rrb- was beautifully poetic in its simplicity and its honesty .
the story of anne frank will , i trust , be remembered for as long as we have hearts to love and sorrows to grieve .
thanks again for the article . - laurence hicks i think that those of us who live in the united states should pay more attention to what happened in nazi germany .
we have people in this country who believe that george bush was sent to us by god and for that reason can do no wrong .
this is the same way many germans thought of adolf hitler during world war ii . - lee davis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky is lit over the collapsed crematorium in the former nazi concentration camp of auschwitz-birkenau on jan .
27 , 2005 during the commemoration for the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the concentration camp i think that the discussion of the holocaust is very limited because of non-jewish people being so fearful of being accused of anti-semitism .
truly , the holocuast is a lesson about anti-semitism in a closed view but in an open mind it is really a lesson about racism and ultra-nationalism .
constantly linking the holocaust to anti-semitism undermines the abilities of all people to point out and deal with injustices of race and ultra-nationalism .
it is a voice that needs a balance .
it is important not to confuse critics of israel 's political policies and government , with anti-semites .
in many cases , the harshness of israeli policy , and the injustices caused by it , are ignored because of this .
rational people can not hold israel accountable for its actions .
the result is that supporters of the israeli policy in the middle-east simply have a louder voice that leaves many others , those affected by racism and similar injustices , crying in the dark .
who can speak up for the millions upon millions of genocide and racism victims in the current world ?
we have a collective responsibility to take care of all people and protect their human rights .
we should never use the injustices of the past as an excuse to isolate and empower ourselves in a manner that allows us to seek revenge and perpetrate similar acts against other groups of people .
reflect as one people , not as jews , germans , palestinians , blacks , whites , asians , hutus , tutsis and so on .
holocaust aniversary and reflection offers a valuable voice on the world stage .
give others respect for their struggles and losses of the past as well .
please use the voice to demonstrate the need for compassion and justice for all people in the world . - chris battochio , canada the holocaust is not relevant as long as the killing fields of palestine , afghanistan and iraq exist .
when the us and its allies and the israeli forces cease their onslaught of the innocent men , women and children of afghanistan , iraq and palestine , then someone can say that they have heeeded the lessons of the nazi holocaust .
otherwise nothing has changed . - kenneth t. tellis , canada no i do n't think enough is being done to remember the holocaust or its survivors .
the main fault lies with the school systems , because most people have entrusted the schools to teach our children what is important .
when i was going to school , i learned nothing of the world wars nor the holocaust .
most of the history we studied involved memorizing meaningles dates , battles and names .
there was no " human connection . "
it has only been through homeschooling my own child that i have developed any understanding of , interest in or compassion for the plight of the persecuted jews in that ugly part of history .
there are still survivors , and children and grandchildren of survivors .
many of them yearn to share their history .
the jews are a proud lot with a long history , and those that wish to share it with the world should be encouraged to teach our children well . - hellen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler bows in front of a memorial for the victims of the auschwitz death camp the tragedy of auschwitz should be a lesson for all peoples , not only for europeans .
unfortunately in anti-semitic , totalitarian countries , where knowledge of the horrors of the holocaust is needed the most , auschwitz can only be a lesson if it is allowed to be " a lesson " in schools .
as an american teacher teaching in an egyptian english-speaking school , i witnessed one of the grossest atrocities of my teaching career .
the school had disected the american-published highschool history textbooks so that all the pages referring to the holocaust were removed and their page numbers blackened out in the index .
in the middle east , teaching the holocaust is not allowed , as they feel it validates the creation of israel .
having lived in the region for many years , i can tell you this is the norm in schools here , not a gross unique case .
the responsibility to teach the lessons of auschwitz lies not only on the shoulders of the europeans but on the shoulders of all those priviledged enough to come from countries where the unedited version of history is made public knowledge . - monique slave labor compensation the amount that is being given as compensation for germany 's forced slave labor is not enough . . . the health issues arising with age due to immense negligent health and welfare inflicted , the emotional scars that have been set deep into the soul , and the precious loss of life 's years seem to have little value with the way the compensation has awarded .
my mother receives less than $ 40 -lrb- € 30.6 -rrb- a month , and my dad is still awaiting some sort of payment - although both have physical paper proof of their confinement and labor abuse .
the media gives more words than there is strength to recognize the humans that have suffered and now must wait for menial restitution . - mary jane kymer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : " we must never forget " newspapers across europe on friday urged the world never to forget the horrors perpetrated by the nazis at auschwitz where ceremonies marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the death camp took place thursday .

dw-world readers comment on what needs to be done to keep the memory alive . perhaps one of the best ways to keep the memory of the holocaust alive is to remember the story of anne frank .
your piece -lrb- " anne frank : the face of the holocaust " -rrb- was beautifully poetic in its simplicity and its honesty .
the story of anne frank will , i trust , be remembered for as long as we have hearts to love and sorrows to grieve .
thanks again for the article . - laurence hicks i think that those of us who live in the united states should pay more attention to what happened in nazi germany .

27 , 2005 during the commemoration for the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the concentration camp i think that the discussion of the holocaust is very limited because of non-jewish people being so fearful of being accused of anti-semitism .
truly , the holocuast is a lesson about anti-semitism in a closed view but in an open mind it is really a lesson about racism and ultra-nationalism .
constantly linking the holocaust to anti-semitism undermines the abilities of all people to point out and deal with injustices of race and ultra-nationalism .
it is a voice that needs a balance .
it is important not to confuse critics of israel 's political policies and government , with anti-semites .
in many cases , the harshness of israeli policy , and the injustices caused by it , are ignored because of this .
rational people can not hold israel accountable for its actions .
the result is that supporters of the israeli policy in the middle-east simply have a louder voice that leaves many others , those affected by racism and similar injustices , crying in the dark .
who can speak up for the millions upon millions of genocide and racism victims in the current world ?
we have a collective responsibility to take care of all people and protect their human rights .
we should never use the injustices of the past as an excuse to isolate and empower ourselves in a manner that allows us to seek revenge and perpetrate similar acts against other groups of people .
reflect as one people , not as jews , germans , palestinians , blacks , whites , asians , hutus , tutsis and so on .
holocaust aniversary and reflection offers a valuable voice on the world stage .

when the us and its allies and the israeli forces cease their onslaught of the innocent men , women and children of afghanistan , iraq and palestine , then someone can say that they have heeeded the lessons of the nazi holocaust .
otherwise nothing has changed . - kenneth t. tellis , canada no i do n't think enough is being done to remember the holocaust or its survivors .
the main fault lies with the school systems , because most people have entrusted the schools to teach our children what is important .

they 're planning to match their words with votes , and officials expect at least 26,000 to cast a ballot in germany . puffing on cigarette after cigarette , iraqi journalist omar fadhil taps away at a keyboard , chatting online from his berlin office to his radio correspondents in baghdad . for the past month , fadhil , who lives in baghdad , has been heading the staff of " election monitor iraq , " a program broadcast from berlin via the internet to iraq , where it appears on local radio stations once a day , five days a week .
sponsored by a german foundation , with support from the german foreign office , election monitor iraq is designed to give iraqis something they do n't get much of : trustworthy news about the country 's first democratic election in more than 50 years . " we want to explain to people why it 's important , why they should go to vote , " said fadhil , who came up to berlin from baghdad to coordinate the team during the elections . whether iraq is ready for sunday 's vote has been the subject of sharp debate in recent months .
violent attacks , like the chain of car bombings across the country on wednesday that killed at least five , are the norm and jordanian jihadist abu musab al-zarqawi has promised chaos on election day . amimals better off than humans fadhil , who will stay in germany another 20 days said that , while many people are too scared to go out and vote , just as many will head out because they see no other alternative . " i want to have security , " he said .
" at the moment , we ca n't go out after 7 p.m.
if a dog is hungry he just has to go outside and eat .
animals are better off than humans at the moment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : registration topped 26,000 iraqis in germany , and 280,000 worldwide the 27-year-old will vote in germany , along with an estimated 26,000 other iraqis this weekend in polling places in mannheim , munich , cologne and berlin .
in all , iraqis in 14 countries , from the us , to the netherlands to australia will vote from friday to sunday , according to the international organization for migration , which is coordinating the overseas vote .
iom officials say they have registered more than 280,000 registered voters . " there certainly seems to be a great enthusiasm to take part , " said jana kristic , an iom organizer in germany . " we need to start some time " on wednesday , german-iraqi election workers gathered for a last minute election organization workshop in berlin .
though the class mostly dwelt on technical details , the importance of the moment was n't lost on the iraqis taking part . " i 've dreamed the whole time that there would be elections in iraq , and now here i am , helping it along , " said zainab hassin , 34 , who fled to cologne from baghdad in 1994 . hassin 's family in baghdad has stayed healthy and intact despite the chaos and danger in her homeland .
the chaotic security situation is perhaps one of the most important reasons to hold elections , she said . " we need this now , " she said .
" we need to start some time . " democracy needs to win growing pains are part of any young democracy , said baker schwani , 37 , a kurd who fled iraq in 1996 .
from the time he was in seventh grade , in 1980 , to the time he graduated university in 1991 , schwani said he knew only war and dictatorship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polling places will be under tight security over the voting weekend " democracy is n't not something we can just buy , we need to fight for it , " said schwani , who will be among the election workers handling an estimated 10,000 iraqi voters in cologne over the weekend . in the end , he said , it is n't even important who wins .
if a large percentage of the population turns out to vote , it could be a sign that the democracy , however fragile , is beginning to take root .
and at the moment , that 's enough for him , he said . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany thwarts attack on iraqi leader german police have arrested four men suspected of planning an attack on iraqi prime minister ayad allawi , who was in berlin on friday .

the school had disected the american-published highschool history textbooks so that all the pages referring to the holocaust were removed and their page numbers blackened out in the index .
in the middle east , teaching the holocaust is not allowed , as they feel it validates the creation of israel .
having lived in the region for many years , i can tell you this is the norm in schools here , not a gross unique case .
the responsibility to teach the lessons of auschwitz lies not only on the shoulders of the europeans but on the shoulders of all those priviledged enough to come from countries where the unedited version of history is made public knowledge . - monique slave labor compensation the amount that is being given as compensation for germany 's forced slave labor is not enough . . . the health issues arising with age due to immense negligent health and welfare inflicted , the emotional scars that have been set deep into the soul , and the precious loss of life 's years seem to have little value with the way the compensation has awarded .
my mother receives less than $ 40 -lrb- € 30.6 -rrb- a month , and my dad is still awaiting some sort of payment - although both have physical paper proof of their confinement and labor abuse .
the media gives more words than there is strength to recognize the humans that have suffered and now must wait for menial restitution . - mary jane kymer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : " we must never forget " newspapers across europe on friday urged the world never to forget the horrors perpetrated by the nazis at auschwitz where ceremonies marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the death camp took place thursday .

28 , 2005 -rrb- germany 's difficult economic inheritance around 1.7 million people who the germans worked as forced labor during world war ii are still alive , and since summer 2001 each of them may receive up to € 7,600 -lrb- $ 9,900 -rrb- in compensation .

27 marked the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz death camp .
dw-world readers comment on what needs to be done to keep the memory alive . perhaps one of the best ways to keep the memory of the holocaust alive is to remember the story of anne frank .
your piece -lrb- " anne frank : the face of the holocaust " -rrb- was beautifully poetic in its simplicity and its honesty .
the story of anne frank will , i trust , be remembered for as long as we have hearts to love and sorrows to grieve .
thanks again for the article . - laurence hicks i think that those of us who live in the united states should pay more attention to what happened in nazi germany .
we have people in this country who believe that george bush was sent to us by god and for that reason can do no wrong .
this is the same way many germans thought of adolf hitler during world war ii . - lee davis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky is lit over the collapsed crematorium in the former nazi concentration camp of auschwitz-birkenau on jan .
27 , 2005 during the commemoration for the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the concentration camp i think that the discussion of the holocaust is very limited because of non-jewish people being so fearful of being accused of anti-semitism .
truly , the holocuast is a lesson about anti-semitism in a closed view but in an open mind it is really a lesson about racism and ultra-nationalism .
constantly linking the holocaust to anti-semitism undermines the abilities of all people to point out and deal with injustices of race and ultra-nationalism .
it is a voice that needs a balance .
it is important not to confuse critics of israel 's political policies and government , with anti-semites .
in many cases , the harshness of israeli policy , and the injustices caused by it , are ignored because of this .
rational people can not hold israel accountable for its actions .
the result is that supporters of the israeli policy in the middle-east simply have a louder voice that leaves many others , those affected by racism and similar injustices , crying in the dark .
who can speak up for the millions upon millions of genocide and racism victims in the current world ?
we have a collective responsibility to take care of all people and protect their human rights .
we should never use the injustices of the past as an excuse to isolate and empower ourselves in a manner that allows us to seek revenge and perpetrate similar acts against other groups of people .
reflect as one people , not as jews , germans , palestinians , blacks , whites , asians , hutus , tutsis and so on .
holocaust aniversary and reflection offers a valuable voice on the world stage .
give others respect for their struggles and losses of the past as well .
please use the voice to demonstrate the need for compassion and justice for all people in the world . - chris battochio , canada the holocaust is not relevant as long as the killing fields of palestine , afghanistan and iraq exist .
when the us and its allies and the israeli forces cease their onslaught of the innocent men , women and children of afghanistan , iraq and palestine , then someone can say that they have heeeded the lessons of the nazi holocaust .
otherwise nothing has changed . - kenneth t. tellis , canada no i do n't think enough is being done to remember the holocaust or its survivors .
the main fault lies with the school systems , because most people have entrusted the schools to teach our children what is important .
when i was going to school , i learned nothing of the world wars nor the holocaust .
most of the history we studied involved memorizing meaningles dates , battles and names .
there was no " human connection . "
it has only been through homeschooling my own child that i have developed any understanding of , interest in or compassion for the plight of the persecuted jews in that ugly part of history .
there are still survivors , and children and grandchildren of survivors .
many of them yearn to share their history .
the jews are a proud lot with a long history , and those that wish to share it with the world should be encouraged to teach our children well . - hellen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler bows in front of a memorial for the victims of the auschwitz death camp the tragedy of auschwitz should be a lesson for all peoples , not only for europeans .
unfortunately in anti-semitic , totalitarian countries , where knowledge of the horrors of the holocaust is needed the most , auschwitz can only be a lesson if it is allowed to be " a lesson " in schools .
as an american teacher teaching in an egyptian english-speaking school , i witnessed one of the grossest atrocities of my teaching career .
the school had disected the american-published highschool history textbooks so that all the pages referring to the holocaust were removed and their page numbers blackened out in the index .
in the middle east , teaching the holocaust is not allowed , as they feel it validates the creation of israel .
having lived in the region for many years , i can tell you this is the norm in schools here , not a gross unique case .
the responsibility to teach the lessons of auschwitz lies not only on the shoulders of the europeans but on the shoulders of all those priviledged enough to come from countries where the unedited version of history is made public knowledge . - monique slave labor compensation the amount that is being given as compensation for germany 's forced slave labor is not enough . . . the health issues arising with age due to immense negligent health and welfare inflicted , the emotional scars that have been set deep into the soul , and the precious loss of life 's years seem to have little value with the way the compensation has awarded .
my mother receives less than $ 40 -lrb- € 30.6 -rrb- a month , and my dad is still awaiting some sort of payment - although both have physical paper proof of their confinement and labor abuse .
the media gives more words than there is strength to recognize the humans that have suffered and now must wait for menial restitution . - mary jane kymer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : " we must never forget " newspapers across europe on friday urged the world never to forget the horrors perpetrated by the nazis at auschwitz where ceremonies marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the death camp took place thursday .
-lrb- jan .
28 , 2005 -rrb- germany 's difficult economic inheritance around 1.7 million people who the germans worked as forced labor during world war ii are still alive , and since summer 2001 each of them may receive up to € 7,600 -lrb- $ 9,900 -rrb- in compensation .

but a court ruling this week clearing the way for german tuition fees could change that . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe on wednesday struck down a law that had made university tuition fees illegal , arguing it violated the right of the country 's federal states to set education policy . besides revolutionizing higher education for germans , the impending fees could radically alter the makeup of foreigners studying at the country 's universities as they look for less-expensive alternatives . “ since there are no tuition fees here i thought i ’ d come and give it a shot , ” said kim dong-young , a 29-year-old korean studying product design at the university of applied sciences in potsdam , near berlin .
like for so many overseas students , germany 's attraction for kim was a combination of quality instruction and affordability . " obviously the standard of education was important to me , but so was the cost , " he said . while states run by social democratic governments said on thursday they will resist charging college students , conservative-led states want to quickly implement a system of fees . strapped for cash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are chronically underfunded and overfilled . proponents of charging tuition argue germany 's cash-strapped universities need the extra revenue to halt their decline into mediocrity .
but those against fees fear poorer students will find it harder to study with the added costs .
that problem could be especially acute for foreign students from the developing world . germany ’ s tuition-free universities have long been attractive to those students unable to afford more prestigious yet more expensive institutions in the united states or britain .
whether foreigners will still be willing to learn german to study at universities that are often considered at best average internationally is unclear . but some german academic officials remain confident foreign students will still come if the tuition fees are used to improve the quality of education on offer . " we do n't want to earn anything from foreign students , but rather we hope to finance better service that has to be offered to compete internationally : language courses , alumni parties , more student housing for our guests , " christian bode , head of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , told der spiegel newsmagazine . bildunterschrift : better education , better students ? fees could also have the unintended effect of increasing the quality of students from abroad that come to germany .
dismal graduation rates for foreigners have prompted criticism that the country is failing to properly select and prepare prospective overseas students . according to a recent study by a non-profit education organization , only a quarter of all foreign students manage to graduate from german university .
those lucky enough to get a degree normally take an average of eight years to do so .
countless more fail to enroll , unable to pass university entry exams . bode from the daad said he expected the best-qualified students would be ensured access to german universities through scholarships and educational grants .
still , there are sure to be those that fall through the cracks if the fees come . hussein berjavi , a 22-year-old from lebanon currently taking preparatory classes in berlin in a bid to study engineering , said he did n't qualify for financial aid elsewhere , so he likely would n't in germany . " america , england , i could never afford to study in those places , " he said .

they 're planning to match their words with votes , and officials expect at least 26,000 to cast a ballot in germany . puffing on cigarette after cigarette , iraqi journalist omar fadhil taps away at a keyboard , chatting online from his berlin office to his radio correspondents in baghdad . for the past month , fadhil , who lives in baghdad , has been heading the staff of " election monitor iraq , " a program broadcast from berlin via the internet to iraq , where it appears on local radio stations once a day , five days a week .
sponsored by a german foundation , with support from the german foreign office , election monitor iraq is designed to give iraqis something they do n't get much of : trustworthy news about the country 's first democratic election in more than 50 years . " we want to explain to people why it 's important , why they should go to vote , " said fadhil , who came up to berlin from baghdad to coordinate the team during the elections . whether iraq is ready for sunday 's vote has been the subject of sharp debate in recent months .
violent attacks , like the chain of car bombings across the country on wednesday that killed at least five , are the norm and jordanian jihadist abu musab al-zarqawi has promised chaos on election day . amimals better off than humans fadhil , who will stay in germany another 20 days said that , while many people are too scared to go out and vote , just as many will head out because they see no other alternative . " i want to have security , " he said .
" at the moment , we ca n't go out after 7 p.m.
if a dog is hungry he just has to go outside and eat .
animals are better off than humans at the moment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : registration topped 26,000 iraqis in germany , and 280,000 worldwide the 27-year-old will vote in germany , along with an estimated 26,000 other iraqis this weekend in polling places in mannheim , munich , cologne and berlin .
in all , iraqis in 14 countries , from the us , to the netherlands to australia will vote from friday to sunday , according to the international organization for migration , which is coordinating the overseas vote .
iom officials say they have registered more than 280,000 registered voters . " there certainly seems to be a great enthusiasm to take part , " said jana kristic , an iom organizer in germany . " we need to start some time " on wednesday , german-iraqi election workers gathered for a last minute election organization workshop in berlin .
though the class mostly dwelt on technical details , the importance of the moment was n't lost on the iraqis taking part . " i 've dreamed the whole time that there would be elections in iraq , and now here i am , helping it along , " said zainab hassin , 34 , who fled to cologne from baghdad in 1994 . hassin 's family in baghdad has stayed healthy and intact despite the chaos and danger in her homeland .
the chaotic security situation is perhaps one of the most important reasons to hold elections , she said . " we need this now , " she said .
" we need to start some time . " democracy needs to win growing pains are part of any young democracy , said baker schwani , 37 , a kurd who fled iraq in 1996 .
from the time he was in seventh grade , in 1980 , to the time he graduated university in 1991 , schwani said he knew only war and dictatorship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polling places will be under tight security over the voting weekend " democracy is n't not something we can just buy , we need to fight for it , " said schwani , who will be among the election workers handling an estimated 10,000 iraqi voters in cologne over the weekend . in the end , he said , it is n't even important who wins .
if a large percentage of the population turns out to vote , it could be a sign that the democracy , however fragile , is beginning to take root .

a spokesman said defense minister peter struck decided to remove the name of werner mölders from the sites after a television news program revealed last year that the pilot had belonged to nazi germany 's infamous condor legion , which served with spanish dictator francisco franco 's forces in the raid .
barracks in the northern town of visselhoevede and the fighter squadron 74 in the southern town of neuburg an der donau will now bear new names , which have not yet been chosen .
the lower house of parliament voted in 1998 to no longer allow military sites to carry the names of condor legion soldiers .
the defense ministry spokesman said struck had spoken with officials from the german air force and a relative of mölder before making the decision .
the pilot , who was not personally involved in the guernica raid , died in a crash in 1941 in poland at the age of 28 .
the 1937 bombardment , which pablo picasso captured in a celebrated painting , killed hundreds of civilians .

barracks in the northern town of visselhoevede and the fighter squadron 74 in the southern town of neuburg an der donau will now bear new names , which have not yet been chosen .
the lower house of parliament voted in 1998 to no longer allow military sites to carry the names of condor legion soldiers .
the defense ministry spokesman said struck had spoken with officials from the german air force and a relative of mölder before making the decision .
the pilot , who was not personally involved in the guernica raid , died in a crash in 1941 in poland at the age of 28 .
the 1937 bombardment , which pablo picasso captured in a celebrated painting , killed hundreds of civilians .
franco 's forces took the city two days after the atrocity . dw-world.de berlin commemorates auschwitz liberation chancellor schröder warned germans to be vigilant in the fight against anti-semitism on tuesday and expressed his shame as berlin marked the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.01.2005 frankfurt fears lse takeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london 's financial district the city already dwarfs frankfurt as deutsche börse presses ahead with plans to buy the london stock exchange , concern is growing in germany that frankfurt could lose out to the city as a financial center in the event of a deal . when deutsche börse chief werner seifert unveiled the latest details of the german stock market 's plans to buy the venerable lse on thursday , he insisted that a tie-up was not about national egos . " it 's not about frankfurt versus london .
both sides will benefit , " seifert repeated a number of times during a news conference . and on paper at least , things look as if they would remain very much the same both on the thames and on the river main in frankfurt .
both exchanges would continue to be overseen by the regulatory authorities of their corresponding countries and trading would continue to be carried out in the euro in frankfurt and sterling in london . london would have equal say in the running of the company , with deutsche börse promising that seven of the 14 shareholder representatives on the supervisory board would have " close ties to the city of london " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt skyline at the same time , deutsche börse promised to retain its global headquarters in frankfurt -lrb- photo -rrb- .
and asked where he would have his main office , seifert insisted it would be frankfurt , even if he immediately added : " i 'm always travelling anyway . " " reverse takeover " but despite such promises , the term " reverse takeover " quickly did the rounds , with concerns that while the deutsche börse would be footing the bill , it would be london that would finally be in command . deutsche börse offered to base the combined cash equities , derivatives and clearing businesses in london , and lse chief clara furse would be offered the job of being in charge of cash equities .
and since the reputation of the city is more powerful than frankfurt anyway , many of the big banks are now considered likely to move to london . " let 's not kid ourselves .
a shift would represent a noticeable weakening of germany and frankfurt as a financial centre , " said the head of deka bank , axel weber . and erlangen university professor and stock market expert wolfgang gerke remarked that following the spectacular failure of the ambitious " ix " merger between deutsche börse and the lse in 2000 , " the germans are bending over backwards " this time round to woo london . " from a german point of view , there 's reason to be nervous , " gerke said . redundancies and re-location ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chairman of the board of german stock exchange -lrb- deutsche börse ag -rrb- werner g. seifert seifert promised on thursday that there were would be no job cuts in london if the merger went ahead .
but he did not repeat an earlier pledge that there would be no compulsory redundancies in frankfurt and no german employees would be forced to move to london against their will . " the issue was clearly not important enough for him to repeat this time round , " the mass-circulation daily bild complained in its friday edition . herbert walter , an official of the giant services sector labor union verdi and a member of deutsche börse 's supervisory board , said he believed seifert would honor his pledge for no compulsory redundancies . " but the issue more about frankfurt as a financial center rather than just deutsche börse as a company , " walter said .
" it is to be feared that all the big banks and consultancy firms will move to london .
frankfurt would lose out in know-how and in importance . " the trend to london winfried hartmann , head of the investment fund frankfurt-trust , noted that frankfurt had already lost out to london in the area of investment banking in recent years .
and that trend would continue in the event of a merger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new london stock exchange , -lrb- lse -rrb- , building in paternoster square , london , friday , december 17 , 2004 .

if rival bidder euronext were to win , " that would also be bad for frankfurt , " he commented . other observers agreed .
the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote in its leader column friday that the lse -lrb- photo -rrb- " is not just a trophy , it 's the kingmaker among european stock markets .

but a court ruling this week clearing the way for german tuition fees could change that . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe on wednesday struck down a law that had made university tuition fees illegal , arguing it violated the right of the country 's federal states to set education policy . besides revolutionizing higher education for germans , the impending fees could radically alter the makeup of foreigners studying at the country 's universities as they look for less-expensive alternatives . “ since there are no tuition fees here i thought i ’ d come and give it a shot , ” said kim dong-young , a 29-year-old korean studying product design at the university of applied sciences in potsdam , near berlin .
like for so many overseas students , germany 's attraction for kim was a combination of quality instruction and affordability . " obviously the standard of education was important to me , but so was the cost , " he said . while states run by social democratic governments said on thursday they will resist charging college students , conservative-led states want to quickly implement a system of fees . strapped for cash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are chronically underfunded and overfilled . proponents of charging tuition argue germany 's cash-strapped universities need the extra revenue to halt their decline into mediocrity .
but those against fees fear poorer students will find it harder to study with the added costs .
that problem could be especially acute for foreign students from the developing world . germany ’ s tuition-free universities have long been attractive to those students unable to afford more prestigious yet more expensive institutions in the united states or britain .
whether foreigners will still be willing to learn german to study at universities that are often considered at best average internationally is unclear . but some german academic officials remain confident foreign students will still come if the tuition fees are used to improve the quality of education on offer .

dismal graduation rates for foreigners have prompted criticism that the country is failing to properly select and prepare prospective overseas students . according to a recent study by a non-profit education organization , only a quarter of all foreign students manage to graduate from german university .
those lucky enough to get a degree normally take an average of eight years to do so .
countless more fail to enroll , unable to pass university entry exams . bode from the daad said he expected the best-qualified students would be ensured access to german universities through scholarships and educational grants .
still , there are sure to be those that fall through the cracks if the fees come . hussein berjavi , a 22-year-old from lebanon currently taking preparatory classes in berlin in a bid to study engineering , said he did n't qualify for financial aid elsewhere , so he likely would n't in germany .

but a court ruling this week clearing the way for german tuition fees could change that . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe on wednesday struck down a law that had made university tuition fees illegal , arguing it violated the right of the country 's federal states to set education policy . besides revolutionizing higher education for germans , the impending fees could radically alter the makeup of foreigners studying at the country 's universities as they look for less-expensive alternatives . “ since there are no tuition fees here i thought i ’ d come and give it a shot , ” said kim dong-young , a 29-year-old korean studying product design at the university of applied sciences in potsdam , near berlin .
like for so many overseas students , germany 's attraction for kim was a combination of quality instruction and affordability . " obviously the standard of education was important to me , but so was the cost , " he said . while states run by social democratic governments said on thursday they will resist charging college students , conservative-led states want to quickly implement a system of fees . strapped for cash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are chronically underfunded and overfilled . proponents of charging tuition argue germany 's cash-strapped universities need the extra revenue to halt their decline into mediocrity .
but those against fees fear poorer students will find it harder to study with the added costs .
that problem could be especially acute for foreign students from the developing world . germany ’ s tuition-free universities have long been attractive to those students unable to afford more prestigious yet more expensive institutions in the united states or britain .
whether foreigners will still be willing to learn german to study at universities that are often considered at best average internationally is unclear . but some german academic officials remain confident foreign students will still come if the tuition fees are used to improve the quality of education on offer . " we do n't want to earn anything from foreign students , but rather we hope to finance better service that has to be offered to compete internationally : language courses , alumni parties , more student housing for our guests , " christian bode , head of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , told der spiegel newsmagazine . bildunterschrift : better education , better students ? fees could also have the unintended effect of increasing the quality of students from abroad that come to germany .
dismal graduation rates for foreigners have prompted criticism that the country is failing to properly select and prepare prospective overseas students . according to a recent study by a non-profit education organization , only a quarter of all foreign students manage to graduate from german university .
those lucky enough to get a degree normally take an average of eight years to do so .
countless more fail to enroll , unable to pass university entry exams . bode from the daad said he expected the best-qualified students would be ensured access to german universities through scholarships and educational grants .
still , there are sure to be those that fall through the cracks if the fees come . hussein berjavi , a 22-year-old from lebanon currently taking preparatory classes in berlin in a bid to study engineering , said he did n't qualify for financial aid elsewhere , so he likely would n't in germany .

german justice authorities reportedly will not take legal action against us defense secretary donald rumsfeld over the abu ghraib prisoner abuse scandal in iraq .
but prosecutors have yet to decide . german court officials have rejected claims in the daily newspaper tagesspiegel friday that german federal prosecutor kay nehm would not seek to try rumsfeld because no germans were victims of the us troop offences at the notorious prison near baghdad . " we have yet to decide whether or not to pursue the charge , " said a federal court spokesman thursday . but the paper reported that under current law , nehm could only take action if germans were suspected of committing crimes or of being the victims of crimes . on november 30 , an international legal team filed a criminal complaint in berlin against rumsfeld and other senior us officials over the abuses . the german factor the new york-based center for constitutional rights -lrb- ccr -rrb- and berlin 's republican lawyers ' association said they and four iraqi citizens mistreated by us soldiers were seeking a probe by german prosecutors of us policy-makers . they said they had chosen germany because of its code of crimes against international law , introduced in 2002 , which grants german courts universal jurisdiction in cases involving war crimes or crimes against humanity . the ccr said that the four iraqis it was representing had been victims of mistreatment including electric shock , severe beatings , sleep and food deprivation and sexual abuse while in us custody . " frivolous lawsuits " rumsfeld was scheduled to take part in an international security conference in the southern city of munich next month , but pulled out due to prior commitments amid speculation he was snubbing germany over the possible legal action . in december , the pentagon expressed concern over the criminal complaint and warned that " frivolous lawsuits " could affect broader us-german relations . according to human rights watch , two investigations have shown that rumsfeld 's policies on interrogation had contributed to torture and abuse in both iraq and afghanistan .

unfortunately , the city also featured in one of the murkiest chapters in his career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. architect philip johnson his " philip johnson house " at checkpoint charlie on the upmarket friedrichstrasse was built in 1994 .
and perhaps somewhatt ironically , the architect famously responsible for the politically charged holocaust memorial in berlin is a philip johnson protégé .
peter eisenman might be no stranger to scandal himself , but he 's never been reviled as philip johnson -lrb- photo -rrb- was when he expressed admiration for hitler in the 1930s .
after years cultivating a determinedly controversial image as an architect , it was only in his old age that johnson spoke openly about private matters such as his homosexuality and his past as a hitler disciple , explaining that he 'd become " fascinated with power " during his time in berlin in the 1930s .
" i have no excuse -lrb- for -rrb- such utter , unbelievable stupidity . ...
i do n't know how you expiate guilt , " he once said .
overwhelming the negatives for many critics , the nazi association dogged him throughout his career , but it was largely forgotten by the mainstream and did little damage to his career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eisenman his work went a long way to canceling out his questionable politics , and in the 1980s and 1990s , he championed the careers of both peter eisenman -lrb- photo -rrb- and frank gehry , two pre-eminent us architects and both jewish .
in the post-war years , he was also happy to work with jewish clients , even designing a nuclear reactor in israel , completed in 1960 .
many saw his choice of commissions as a deliberate attempt to distance himself from the earlier charges of anti-semitism .
" we forgave , but we did n't forget , " gehry was quoted wednesday .
" he was so powerful a force for the good in our profession that it overwhelmed all negatives . "
" the hitler mystique " born into a wealthy family in 1906 , johnson had an elitist , aristocratic take on the world and experiemnted with a number of architectural different styles during his career . he first made his name curating an exhibition on the international style in 1932 at what was then the brand-new museum of modern art in new york , in 1953 creating its renowned sculpture garden .
his initial fascination with the international style was spawned in germany , which he first visited in 1928 .

standing beside the car is sa chief viktor lutze .
-lrb- ap photo -rrb- in 1932 , he attended a rally in potsdam and saw hitler speak .
transfixed by what he called hitler 's " mystique , " he fast succumbed to a romantic , nietzsche-esque image of fascism , and began working as german correspondent for the right-wing us magazine social justice .
back in the us , he founded a set up a short-lived political party based on the national socialists .
american colleagues even suspected him of spying for the third reich .

" the survivors have attempted to recount the unimaginable , " the paris-based paper wrote .
" who will utter the unspeakable when the last of us has gone ? " it asked .
" the countries bear responsibility that schools carry on in keeping alive the memory , " it wrote and warned , " also , every individual has to take care that the memory does n't fade . " italian daily corriere della sera also underlined the importance of remembering the holocaust .
" one needs to go back there always and look at the rail tracks , the barbed wire , the gas chambers and the barracks , " the milan-based paper wrote .
" and one must take their kids there and advise them to bring their kids and never stop explaining about the unexplainable and the unending horror of this abyss . " in britain , most newspapers filled their front pages with coverage of the poignant anniversary ceremony , many splashing pictures of an elderly auschwitz survivor fighting back tears as he re-entered the camp . " the world remembers " was the banner headline in the guardian above a lengthy account of the ceremony attended by various heads of state and government .
the tone of editorial comment provided by some papers was made clear by eadlines such as " never again , " in the times , and the daily mail 's " we must never forget " . " auschwitz should never be forgotten , " the times said in an editorial , condemning attempts to " relativize " the holocaust 's horrors by other groups comparing their plight to that of the jews .

the watchword must remain : never again , " it said . the paper also focused on germany 's guilt-riddled legacy .
" almost every aspect of life in germany is still burdened by the awful legacy , " the paper wrote listing the country 's reluctance to deploy troops abroad , pacifism , environmental commitments , and opposition to stem-cell research , language taboos and consensus-seeking politics as some of the examples .
the paper said germans had largely succeeded in coming to terms with the past .

" conservative berlin-based paper die welt exhorted readers to mark the anniversary with " sorrow and humility " .
while " no exoneration can be sought in the past or the future , " said the daily , the german people could show their dignity by " standing up for human rights wherever they are violated , for the rule of law and for freedom , wherever they are repressed " .
the paper also suggested that europe is seeking to create a common identity by remembering the mass murder of jews . " auschwitz put the world to shame , " read the front-page headline in polish daily zycie warszawy .
" the free world stood idle , " headlined the centre-left gazeta wyborcza , which devoted its entire front page and four inside pages to the ceremonies on thursday to mark the camp 's liberation on january 27 , 1945 , by the soviet red army . spanish daily el pais decried the failure to learn the lessons of the holocaust .

" the survivors have attempted to recount the unimaginable , " the paris-based paper wrote .
" who will utter the unspeakable when the last of us has gone ? " it asked .
" the countries bear responsibility that schools carry on in keeping alive the memory , " it wrote and warned , " also , every individual has to take care that the memory does n't fade . " italian daily corriere della sera also underlined the importance of remembering the holocaust .
" one needs to go back there always and look at the rail tracks , the barbed wire , the gas chambers and the barracks , " the milan-based paper wrote .
" and one must take their kids there and advise them to bring their kids and never stop explaining about the unexplainable and the unending horror of this abyss . " in britain , most newspapers filled their front pages with coverage of the poignant anniversary ceremony , many splashing pictures of an elderly auschwitz survivor fighting back tears as he re-entered the camp . " the world remembers " was the banner headline in the guardian above a lengthy account of the ceremony attended by various heads of state and government .
the tone of editorial comment provided by some papers was made clear by eadlines such as " never again , " in the times , and the daily mail 's " we must never forget " . " auschwitz should never be forgotten , " the times said in an editorial , condemning attempts to " relativize " the holocaust 's horrors by other groups comparing their plight to that of the jews .
" britons , like all europeans , must share the legacy of such evil .
the watchword must remain : never again , " it said . the paper also focused on germany 's guilt-riddled legacy .
" almost every aspect of life in germany is still burdened by the awful legacy , " the paper wrote listing the country 's reluctance to deploy troops abroad , pacifism , environmental commitments , and opposition to stem-cell research , language taboos and consensus-seeking politics as some of the examples .
the paper said germans had largely succeeded in coming to terms with the past .
" one must applaud the germans , " it wrote .
" the country knows that it bears a greater responsibility when it comes to democracy and political extremism . " german newspapers too dwelt on the country 's special responsibility . weekly die zeit identified " only one rule " for anyone trying to come to terms with auschwitz : " when you are not disturbed in the depths of your soul every time you hear about it ... then there is something wrong . " conservative berlin-based paper die welt exhorted readers to mark the anniversary with " sorrow and humility " .
while " no exoneration can be sought in the past or the future , " said the daily , the german people could show their dignity by " standing up for human rights wherever they are violated , for the rule of law and for freedom , wherever they are repressed " .
the paper also suggested that europe is seeking to create a common identity by remembering the mass murder of jews . " auschwitz put the world to shame , " read the front-page headline in polish daily zycie warszawy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.01.2005 the architect who flirted with fascism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the philip johnson house in downtown berlin philip johnson , who died this week at the age of 98 , might be acknowledged as one of the most influential architects of the 20th century , but he never quite lived down his reputation as a nazi sympathizer . the man often described as the elder statesman of us architecture always had a special place in his heart for the german capital , and his influence is evident to any visitor in central berlin .
unfortunately , the city also featured in one of the murkiest chapters in his career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. architect philip johnson his " philip johnson house " at checkpoint charlie on the upmarket friedrichstrasse was built in 1994 .
and perhaps somewhatt ironically , the architect famously responsible for the politically charged holocaust memorial in berlin is a philip johnson protégé .
peter eisenman might be no stranger to scandal himself , but he 's never been reviled as philip johnson -lrb- photo -rrb- was when he expressed admiration for hitler in the 1930s .
after years cultivating a determinedly controversial image as an architect , it was only in his old age that johnson spoke openly about private matters such as his homosexuality and his past as a hitler disciple , explaining that he 'd become " fascinated with power " during his time in berlin in the 1930s .
" i have no excuse -lrb- for -rrb- such utter , unbelievable stupidity . ...
i do n't know how you expiate guilt , " he once said .
overwhelming the negatives for many critics , the nazi association dogged him throughout his career , but it was largely forgotten by the mainstream and did little damage to his career .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter eisenman his work went a long way to canceling out his questionable politics , and in the 1980s and 1990s , he championed the careers of both peter eisenman -lrb- photo -rrb- and frank gehry , two pre-eminent us architects and both jewish .
in the post-war years , he was also happy to work with jewish clients , even designing a nuclear reactor in israel , completed in 1960 .
many saw his choice of commissions as a deliberate attempt to distance himself from the earlier charges of anti-semitism .
" we forgave , but we did n't forget , " gehry was quoted wednesday .
" he was so powerful a force for the good in our profession that it overwhelmed all negatives . "
" the hitler mystique " born into a wealthy family in 1906 , johnson had an elitist , aristocratic take on the world and experiemnted with a number of architectural different styles during his career . he first made his name curating an exhibition on the international style in 1932 at what was then the brand-new museum of modern art in new york , in 1953 creating its renowned sculpture garden .
his initial fascination with the international style was spawned in germany , which he first visited in 1928 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nazi party leader adolf hitler is standing in an open cabriolet as he acknowledges an sa parade in honor of his birthday , in front of the german chancellory in berlin , april 20 , 1938 .
standing beside the car is sa chief viktor lutze .
-lrb- ap photo -rrb- in 1932 , he attended a rally in potsdam and saw hitler speak .
transfixed by what he called hitler 's " mystique , " he fast succumbed to a romantic , nietzsche-esque image of fascism , and began working as german correspondent for the right-wing us magazine social justice .
back in the us , he founded a set up a short-lived political party based on the national socialists .
american colleagues even suspected him of spying for the third reich .
" i lost my mind , " he said in later years about his misalliance with fascism . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de building a new reputation abroad despite their strong architectural tradition , very few germans get to build important projects abroad .

the girl was to be sent back to the woman 's extended family in gambia in 2003 so that her mother could pursue a training course in nursing for the elderly . however , days before the girl 's departure , relatives of the german husband alerted child welfare authorities that the daughter could be threatened with genital mutilation . the mother , who underwent female circumcision herself at the age of 13 , had defended the ritual as a cultural tradition . dresden-based social worker matthias hirche , who is working on the case pointed out on thursday that the federal administrative court had categorically rejected the mother 's stance .

the judges described the procedure , which typically involves cutting off the clitoris and other parts of genitalia in pre-pubescent and teenage girls , as a " cruel , grave form of abuse that is impossible to justify " and a clear violation of the welfare rights of the child . child protection versus cultural tradition the case involved a gambian-born woman who married a german man in gambia in 2000 and brought her daughter from a previous relationship to germany .
the girl was to be sent back to the woman 's extended family in gambia in 2003 so that her mother could pursue a training course in nursing for the elderly . however , days before the girl 's departure , relatives of the german husband alerted child welfare authorities that the daughter could be threatened with genital mutilation . the mother , who underwent female circumcision herself at the age of 13 , had defended the ritual as a cultural tradition . dresden-based social worker matthias hirche , who is working on the case pointed out on thursday that the federal administrative court had categorically rejected the mother 's stance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.01.2005 tuition fees likely to deter foreigners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students are protesting against the planned fees foreign university students have long been attracted to germany as an inexpensive alternative to pricier america and britain .
but a court ruling this week clearing the way for german tuition fees could change that . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe on wednesday struck down a law that had made university tuition fees illegal , arguing it violated the right of the country 's federal states to set education policy . besides revolutionizing higher education for germans , the impending fees could radically alter the makeup of foreigners studying at the country 's universities as they look for less-expensive alternatives . “ since there are no tuition fees here i thought i ’ d come and give it a shot , ” said kim dong-young , a 29-year-old korean studying product design at the university of applied sciences in potsdam , near berlin .
like for so many overseas students , germany 's attraction for kim was a combination of quality instruction and affordability . " obviously the standard of education was important to me , but so was the cost , " he said . while states run by social democratic governments said on thursday they will resist charging college students , conservative-led states want to quickly implement a system of fees . strapped for cash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are chronically underfunded and overfilled . proponents of charging tuition argue germany 's cash-strapped universities need the extra revenue to halt their decline into mediocrity .
but those against fees fear poorer students will find it harder to study with the added costs .
that problem could be especially acute for foreign students from the developing world . germany ’ s tuition-free universities have long been attractive to those students unable to afford more prestigious yet more expensive institutions in the united states or britain .
whether foreigners will still be willing to learn german to study at universities that are often considered at best average internationally is unclear . but some german academic officials remain confident foreign students will still come if the tuition fees are used to improve the quality of education on offer . " we do n't want to earn anything from foreign students , but rather we hope to finance better service that has to be offered to compete internationally : language courses , alumni parties , more student housing for our guests , " christian bode , head of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , told der spiegel newsmagazine . bildunterschrift : better education , better students ? fees could also have the unintended effect of increasing the quality of students from abroad that come to germany .
dismal graduation rates for foreigners have prompted criticism that the country is failing to properly select and prepare prospective overseas students . according to a recent study by a non-profit education organization , only a quarter of all foreign students manage to graduate from german university .
those lucky enough to get a degree normally take an average of eight years to do so .
countless more fail to enroll , unable to pass university entry exams . bode from the daad said he expected the best-qualified students would be ensured access to german universities through scholarships and educational grants .
still , there are sure to be those that fall through the cracks if the fees come . hussein berjavi , a 22-year-old from lebanon currently taking preparatory classes in berlin in a bid to study engineering , said he did n't qualify for financial aid elsewhere , so he likely would n't in germany . " america , england , i could never afford to study in those places , " he said .
" things are a lot cheaper here .

your piece -lrb- " anne frank : the face of the holocaust " -rrb- was beautifully poetic in its simplicity and its honesty .

thanks again for the article . - laurence hicks i think that those of us who live in the united states should pay more attention to what happened in nazi germany .

27 , 2005 during the commemoration for the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the concentration camp i think that the discussion of the holocaust is very limited because of non-jewish people being so fearful of being accused of anti-semitism .
truly , the holocuast is a lesson about anti-semitism in a closed view but in an open mind it is really a lesson about racism and ultra-nationalism .
constantly linking the holocaust to anti-semitism undermines the abilities of all people to point out and deal with injustices of race and ultra-nationalism .
it is a voice that needs a balance .
it is important not to confuse critics of israel 's political policies and government , with anti-semites .
in many cases , the harshness of israeli policy , and the injustices caused by it , are ignored because of this .
rational people can not hold israel accountable for its actions .
the result is that supporters of the israeli policy in the middle-east simply have a louder voice that leaves many others , those affected by racism and similar injustices , crying in the dark .
who can speak up for the millions upon millions of genocide and racism victims in the current world ?
we have a collective responsibility to take care of all people and protect their human rights .
we should never use the injustices of the past as an excuse to isolate and empower ourselves in a manner that allows us to seek revenge and perpetrate similar acts against other groups of people .
reflect as one people , not as jews , germans , palestinians , blacks , whites , asians , hutus , tutsis and so on .
holocaust aniversary and reflection offers a valuable voice on the world stage .
give others respect for their struggles and losses of the past as well .
please use the voice to demonstrate the need for compassion and justice for all people in the world . - chris battochio , canada the holocaust is not relevant as long as the killing fields of palestine , afghanistan and iraq exist .
when the us and its allies and the israeli forces cease their onslaught of the innocent men , women and children of afghanistan , iraq and palestine , then someone can say that they have heeeded the lessons of the nazi holocaust .
otherwise nothing has changed . - kenneth t. tellis , canada no i do n't think enough is being done to remember the holocaust or its survivors .
the main fault lies with the school systems , because most people have entrusted the schools to teach our children what is important .
when i was going to school , i learned nothing of the world wars nor the holocaust .
most of the history we studied involved memorizing meaningles dates , battles and names .
there was no " human connection . "
it has only been through homeschooling my own child that i have developed any understanding of , interest in or compassion for the plight of the persecuted jews in that ugly part of history .
there are still survivors , and children and grandchildren of survivors .
many of them yearn to share their history .
the jews are a proud lot with a long history , and those that wish to share it with the world should be encouraged to teach our children well . - hellen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler bows in front of a memorial for the victims of the auschwitz death camp the tragedy of auschwitz should be a lesson for all peoples , not only for europeans .
unfortunately in anti-semitic , totalitarian countries , where knowledge of the horrors of the holocaust is needed the most , auschwitz can only be a lesson if it is allowed to be " a lesson " in schools .
as an american teacher teaching in an egyptian english-speaking school , i witnessed one of the grossest atrocities of my teaching career .
the school had disected the american-published highschool history textbooks so that all the pages referring to the holocaust were removed and their page numbers blackened out in the index .
in the middle east , teaching the holocaust is not allowed , as they feel it validates the creation of israel .
having lived in the region for many years , i can tell you this is the norm in schools here , not a gross unique case .
the responsibility to teach the lessons of auschwitz lies not only on the shoulders of the europeans but on the shoulders of all those priviledged enough to come from countries where the unedited version of history is made public knowledge . - monique slave labor compensation the amount that is being given as compensation for germany 's forced slave labor is not enough . . . the health issues arising with age due to immense negligent health and welfare inflicted , the emotional scars that have been set deep into the soul , and the precious loss of life 's years seem to have little value with the way the compensation has awarded .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.01.2005 frankfurt fears lse takeover großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london 's financial district the city already dwarfs frankfurt as deutsche börse presses ahead with plans to buy the london stock exchange , concern is growing in germany that frankfurt could lose out to the city as a financial center in the event of a deal . when deutsche börse chief werner seifert unveiled the latest details of the german stock market 's plans to buy the venerable lse on thursday , he insisted that a tie-up was not about national egos . " it 's not about frankfurt versus london .
both sides will benefit , " seifert repeated a number of times during a news conference . and on paper at least , things look as if they would remain very much the same both on the thames and on the river main in frankfurt .
both exchanges would continue to be overseen by the regulatory authorities of their corresponding countries and trading would continue to be carried out in the euro in frankfurt and sterling in london . london would have equal say in the running of the company , with deutsche börse promising that seven of the 14 shareholder representatives on the supervisory board would have " close ties to the city of london " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt skyline at the same time , deutsche börse promised to retain its global headquarters in frankfurt -lrb- photo -rrb- .
and asked where he would have his main office , seifert insisted it would be frankfurt , even if he immediately added : " i 'm always travelling anyway . " " reverse takeover " but despite such promises , the term " reverse takeover " quickly did the rounds , with concerns that while the deutsche börse would be footing the bill , it would be london that would finally be in command . deutsche börse offered to base the combined cash equities , derivatives and clearing businesses in london , and lse chief clara furse would be offered the job of being in charge of cash equities .
and since the reputation of the city is more powerful than frankfurt anyway , many of the big banks are now considered likely to move to london . " let 's not kid ourselves .
a shift would represent a noticeable weakening of germany and frankfurt as a financial centre , " said the head of deka bank , axel weber . and erlangen university professor and stock market expert wolfgang gerke remarked that following the spectacular failure of the ambitious " ix " merger between deutsche börse and the lse in 2000 , " the germans are bending over backwards " this time round to woo london . " from a german point of view , there 's reason to be nervous , " gerke said . redundancies and re-location ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chairman of the board of german stock exchange -lrb- deutsche börse ag -rrb- werner g. seifert seifert promised on thursday that there were would be no job cuts in london if the merger went ahead .
but he did not repeat an earlier pledge that there would be no compulsory redundancies in frankfurt and no german employees would be forced to move to london against their will . " the issue was clearly not important enough for him to repeat this time round , " the mass-circulation daily bild complained in its friday edition . herbert walter , an official of the giant services sector labor union verdi and a member of deutsche börse 's supervisory board , said he believed seifert would honor his pledge for no compulsory redundancies . " but the issue more about frankfurt as a financial center rather than just deutsche börse as a company , " walter said .
" it is to be feared that all the big banks and consultancy firms will move to london .
frankfurt would lose out in know-how and in importance . " the trend to london winfried hartmann , head of the investment fund frankfurt-trust , noted that frankfurt had already lost out to london in the area of investment banking in recent years .
and that trend would continue in the event of a merger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new london stock exchange , -lrb- lse -rrb- , building in paternoster square , london , friday , december 17 , 2004 .
euronext nv contacted london stock exchange plc to discuss an offer for the company , after the lse , europe 's third-largest stock exchange by market value , this week rejected a 1.35 billion-pound -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- offer from frankfurt-based deutsche boerse ag .
-lrb- achtung .
mindesthonorar 75 euro -rrb- .
foto : graham barclay + + + -lrb- c -rrb- dpa - report + + + nevertheless , deutsche börse had no option but to win the battle for the lse , professor gerke said .
if rival bidder euronext were to win , " that would also be bad for frankfurt , " he commented . other observers agreed .
the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote in its leader column friday that the lse -lrb- photo -rrb- " is not just a trophy , it 's the kingmaker among european stock markets .

but a court ruling this week clearing the way for german tuition fees could change that . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe on wednesday struck down a law that had made university tuition fees illegal , arguing it violated the right of the country 's federal states to set education policy . besides revolutionizing higher education for germans , the impending fees could radically alter the makeup of foreigners studying at the country 's universities as they look for less-expensive alternatives . “ since there are no tuition fees here i thought i ’ d come and give it a shot , ” said kim dong-young , a 29-year-old korean studying product design at the university of applied sciences in potsdam , near berlin .
like for so many overseas students , germany 's attraction for kim was a combination of quality instruction and affordability . " obviously the standard of education was important to me , but so was the cost , " he said . while states run by social democratic governments said on thursday they will resist charging college students , conservative-led states want to quickly implement a system of fees . strapped for cash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are chronically underfunded and overfilled . proponents of charging tuition argue germany 's cash-strapped universities need the extra revenue to halt their decline into mediocrity .
but those against fees fear poorer students will find it harder to study with the added costs .
that problem could be especially acute for foreign students from the developing world . germany ’ s tuition-free universities have long been attractive to those students unable to afford more prestigious yet more expensive institutions in the united states or britain .
whether foreigners will still be willing to learn german to study at universities that are often considered at best average internationally is unclear . but some german academic officials remain confident foreign students will still come if the tuition fees are used to improve the quality of education on offer . " we do n't want to earn anything from foreign students , but rather we hope to finance better service that has to be offered to compete internationally : language courses , alumni parties , more student housing for our guests , " christian bode , head of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , told der spiegel newsmagazine . bildunterschrift : better education , better students ? fees could also have the unintended effect of increasing the quality of students from abroad that come to germany .
dismal graduation rates for foreigners have prompted criticism that the country is failing to properly select and prepare prospective overseas students . according to a recent study by a non-profit education organization , only a quarter of all foreign students manage to graduate from german university .
those lucky enough to get a degree normally take an average of eight years to do so .
countless more fail to enroll , unable to pass university entry exams . bode from the daad said he expected the best-qualified students would be ensured access to german universities through scholarships and educational grants .
still , there are sure to be those that fall through the cracks if the fees come . hussein berjavi , a 22-year-old from lebanon currently taking preparatory classes in berlin in a bid to study engineering , said he did n't qualify for financial aid elsewhere , so he likely would n't in germany . " america , england , i could never afford to study in those places , " he said .

" the survivors have attempted to recount the unimaginable , " the paris-based paper wrote .
" who will utter the unspeakable when the last of us has gone ? " it asked .
" the countries bear responsibility that schools carry on in keeping alive the memory , " it wrote and warned , " also , every individual has to take care that the memory does n't fade . " italian daily corriere della sera also underlined the importance of remembering the holocaust .

" the survivors have attempted to recount the unimaginable , " the paris-based paper wrote .
" who will utter the unspeakable when the last of us has gone ? " it asked .
" the countries bear responsibility that schools carry on in keeping alive the memory , " it wrote and warned , " also , every individual has to take care that the memory does n't fade . " italian daily corriere della sera also underlined the importance of remembering the holocaust .

while " no exoneration can be sought in the past or the future , " said the daily , the german people could show their dignity by " standing up for human rights wherever they are violated , for the rule of law and for freedom , wherever they are repressed " .
the paper also suggested that europe is seeking to create a common identity by remembering the mass murder of jews . " auschwitz put the world to shame , " read the front-page headline in polish daily zycie warszawy .

" but we are just as convinced that has to be achieved through diplomatic and political means , " he added . against military action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's main bushehr nuclear power plant , is located southwest of the capital tehran .

german justice authorities reportedly will not take legal action against us defense secretary donald rumsfeld over the abu ghraib prisoner abuse scandal in iraq .
but prosecutors have yet to decide . german court officials have rejected claims in the daily newspaper tagesspiegel friday that german federal prosecutor kay nehm would not seek to try rumsfeld because no germans were victims of the us troop offences at the notorious prison near baghdad . " we have yet to decide whether or not to pursue the charge , " said a federal court spokesman thursday . but the paper reported that under current law , nehm could only take action if germans were suspected of committing crimes or of being the victims of crimes . on november 30 , an international legal team filed a criminal complaint in berlin against rumsfeld and other senior us officials over the abuses . the german factor the new york-based center for constitutional rights -lrb- ccr -rrb- and berlin 's republican lawyers ' association said they and four iraqi citizens mistreated by us soldiers were seeking a probe by german prosecutors of us policy-makers . they said they had chosen germany because of its code of crimes against international law , introduced in 2002 , which grants german courts universal jurisdiction in cases involving war crimes or crimes against humanity . the ccr said that the four iraqis it was representing had been victims of mistreatment including electric shock , severe beatings , sleep and food deprivation and sexual abuse while in us custody . " frivolous lawsuits " rumsfeld was scheduled to take part in an international security conference in the southern city of munich next month , but pulled out due to prior commitments amid speculation he was snubbing germany over the possible legal action . in december , the pentagon expressed concern over the criminal complaint and warned that " frivolous lawsuits " could affect broader us-german relations . according to human rights watch , two investigations have shown that rumsfeld 's policies on interrogation had contributed to torture and abuse in both iraq and afghanistan .

they 're planning to match their words with votes , and officials expect at least 26,000 to cast a ballot in germany . puffing on cigarette after cigarette , iraqi journalist omar fadhil taps away at a keyboard , chatting online from his berlin office to his radio correspondents in baghdad . for the past month , fadhil , who lives in baghdad , has been heading the staff of " election monitor iraq , " a program broadcast from berlin via the internet to iraq , where it appears on local radio stations once a day , five days a week .
sponsored by a german foundation , with support from the german foreign office , election monitor iraq is designed to give iraqis something they do n't get much of : trustworthy news about the country 's first democratic election in more than 50 years . " we want to explain to people why it 's important , why they should go to vote , " said fadhil , who came up to berlin from baghdad to coordinate the team during the elections . whether iraq is ready for sunday 's vote has been the subject of sharp debate in recent months .
violent attacks , like the chain of car bombings across the country on wednesday that killed at least five , are the norm and jordanian jihadist abu musab al-zarqawi has promised chaos on election day . amimals better off than humans fadhil , who will stay in germany another 20 days said that , while many people are too scared to go out and vote , just as many will head out because they see no other alternative . " i want to have security , " he said .
" at the moment , we ca n't go out after 7 p.m.
if a dog is hungry he just has to go outside and eat .
animals are better off than humans at the moment . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : registration topped 26,000 iraqis in germany , and 280,000 worldwide the 27-year-old will vote in germany , along with an estimated 26,000 other iraqis this weekend in polling places in mannheim , munich , cologne and berlin .
in all , iraqis in 14 countries , from the us , to the netherlands to australia will vote from friday to sunday , according to the international organization for migration , which is coordinating the overseas vote .
iom officials say they have registered more than 280,000 registered voters . " there certainly seems to be a great enthusiasm to take part , " said jana kristic , an iom organizer in germany . " we need to start some time " on wednesday , german-iraqi election workers gathered for a last minute election organization workshop in berlin .
though the class mostly dwelt on technical details , the importance of the moment was n't lost on the iraqis taking part . " i 've dreamed the whole time that there would be elections in iraq , and now here i am , helping it along , " said zainab hassin , 34 , who fled to cologne from baghdad in 1994 . hassin 's family in baghdad has stayed healthy and intact despite the chaos and danger in her homeland .
the chaotic security situation is perhaps one of the most important reasons to hold elections , she said . " we need this now , " she said .
" we need to start some time . " democracy needs to win growing pains are part of any young democracy , said baker schwani , 37 , a kurd who fled iraq in 1996 .

german justice authorities reportedly will not take legal action against us defense secretary donald rumsfeld over the abu ghraib prisoner abuse scandal in iraq .
but prosecutors have yet to decide . german court officials have rejected claims in the daily newspaper tagesspiegel friday that german federal prosecutor kay nehm would not seek to try rumsfeld because no germans were victims of the us troop offences at the notorious prison near baghdad . " we have yet to decide whether or not to pursue the charge , " said a federal court spokesman thursday . but the paper reported that under current law , nehm could only take action if germans were suspected of committing crimes or of being the victims of crimes . on november 30 , an international legal team filed a criminal complaint in berlin against rumsfeld and other senior us officials over the abuses . the german factor the new york-based center for constitutional rights -lrb- ccr -rrb- and berlin 's republican lawyers ' association said they and four iraqi citizens mistreated by us soldiers were seeking a probe by german prosecutors of us policy-makers . they said they had chosen germany because of its code of crimes against international law , introduced in 2002 , which grants german courts universal jurisdiction in cases involving war crimes or crimes against humanity . the ccr said that the four iraqis it was representing had been victims of mistreatment including electric shock , severe beatings , sleep and food deprivation and sexual abuse while in us custody . " frivolous lawsuits " rumsfeld was scheduled to take part in an international security conference in the southern city of munich next month , but pulled out due to prior commitments amid speculation he was snubbing germany over the possible legal action . in december , the pentagon expressed concern over the criminal complaint and warned that " frivolous lawsuits " could affect broader us-german relations . according to human rights watch , two investigations have shown that rumsfeld 's policies on interrogation had contributed to torture and abuse in both iraq and afghanistan . " but the investigators lacked the mandate - or the independence - to draw the obvious conclusions regarding the political or legal responsibility of rumsfeld or others who approved illegal tactics , " the group said last week . afp / dw-staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rumsfeld to bypass munich conference us defense secretary donald rumsfeld will not attend the munich security conference in february .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.01.2005 tuition fees likely to deter foreigners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students are protesting against the planned fees foreign university students have long been attracted to germany as an inexpensive alternative to pricier america and britain .
but a court ruling this week clearing the way for german tuition fees could change that . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe on wednesday struck down a law that had made university tuition fees illegal , arguing it violated the right of the country 's federal states to set education policy . besides revolutionizing higher education for germans , the impending fees could radically alter the makeup of foreigners studying at the country 's universities as they look for less-expensive alternatives . “ since there are no tuition fees here i thought i ’ d come and give it a shot , ” said kim dong-young , a 29-year-old korean studying product design at the university of applied sciences in potsdam , near berlin .
like for so many overseas students , germany 's attraction for kim was a combination of quality instruction and affordability . " obviously the standard of education was important to me , but so was the cost , " he said . while states run by social democratic governments said on thursday they will resist charging college students , conservative-led states want to quickly implement a system of fees . strapped for cash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are chronically underfunded and overfilled . proponents of charging tuition argue germany 's cash-strapped universities need the extra revenue to halt their decline into mediocrity .
but those against fees fear poorer students will find it harder to study with the added costs .
that problem could be especially acute for foreign students from the developing world . germany ’ s tuition-free universities have long been attractive to those students unable to afford more prestigious yet more expensive institutions in the united states or britain .
whether foreigners will still be willing to learn german to study at universities that are often considered at best average internationally is unclear . but some german academic officials remain confident foreign students will still come if the tuition fees are used to improve the quality of education on offer . " we do n't want to earn anything from foreign students , but rather we hope to finance better service that has to be offered to compete internationally : language courses , alumni parties , more student housing for our guests , " christian bode , head of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , told der spiegel newsmagazine . bildunterschrift : better education , better students ? fees could also have the unintended effect of increasing the quality of students from abroad that come to germany .
dismal graduation rates for foreigners have prompted criticism that the country is failing to properly select and prepare prospective overseas students . according to a recent study by a non-profit education organization , only a quarter of all foreign students manage to graduate from german university .
those lucky enough to get a degree normally take an average of eight years to do so .
countless more fail to enroll , unable to pass university entry exams . bode from the daad said he expected the best-qualified students would be ensured access to german universities through scholarships and educational grants .
still , there are sure to be those that fall through the cracks if the fees come . hussein berjavi , a 22-year-old from lebanon currently taking preparatory classes in berlin in a bid to study engineering , said he did n't qualify for financial aid elsewhere , so he likely would n't in germany . " america , england , i could never afford to study in those places , " he said .

mädchen .
the judges described the procedure , which typically involves cutting off the clitoris and other parts of genitalia in pre-pubescent and teenage girls , as a " cruel , grave form of abuse that is impossible to justify " and a clear violation of the welfare rights of the child . child protection versus cultural tradition the case involved a gambian-born woman who married a german man in gambia in 2000 and brought her daughter from a previous relationship to germany .
the girl was to be sent back to the woman 's extended family in gambia in 2003 so that her mother could pursue a training course in nursing for the elderly . however , days before the girl 's departure , relatives of the german husband alerted child welfare authorities that the daughter could be threatened with genital mutilation . the mother , who underwent female circumcision herself at the age of 13 , had defended the ritual as a cultural tradition . dresden-based social worker matthias hirche , who is working on the case pointed out on thursday that the federal administrative court had categorically rejected the mother 's stance .
" the court has awarded more importance to the protection of the child than parents ' rights or culture and tradition , " he said . no travel abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's demonstration in somalia against female circumcision .
the girl who was placed in foster care immediately following an emergency ruling by local child welfare authorities once the matter came to light , is now back with her mother .
her mother is now divorced from her german husband . the court in karlsruhe ruled that the girl would most likely be faced with genital mutilation if she was sent to her mother 's family in gambia .
the judges said the fact that the girl 's grandmother had been unable to spare her own daughter from the inhuman procedure raised worries that the grandmother , under the influence of the extended family , would be unable to prevent it from happening to her granddaughter . judges in karlsruhe also made it clear on thursday that the lower court in the eastern city of dresden which issued the original ruling , and the local child welfare office must now act to ensure the child is not taken out of the country where she might be threatened with excision . the court added that the girl could be taken from her mother and put in foster care again if necessary to protect her . state authorities have also withheld her passport .
" we have to ensure that the girl does n't get sent to africa or to france or britain , where genital mutilation is secretly practiced , " said hirche .
" but to monitor that will still be tough , " he added . rampant practice genital mutilation is practiced in some 28 african countries , despite laws that outlaw it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top-model waris dirie waits at a unicef press conference on human right for girls in berlin , nov .
7 , 2002 , while the press watches a video on female circumcision .
dirie is a strong advocate of the issue , which is especially problematic in africa .
the court found that between 80 and 90 percent of woman and girls in gambia undergo excision , known in some countries as female circumcision . an estimated 130 million women have been subjected to female circumcision and 2 million undergo the procedure each year , according to officials at a conference on female circumcision held in november 2003 in sweden . excision impairs a woman 's ability to enjoy sexual relations , and is traditionally seen as controlling female sexuality and improving a girl 's marriage prospects . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de female circumcision threatens girls in germany female circumsion is n't just a problem in african countries .

the judges described the procedure , which typically involves cutting off the clitoris and other parts of genitalia in pre-pubescent and teenage girls , as a " cruel , grave form of abuse that is impossible to justify " and a clear violation of the welfare rights of the child . child protection versus cultural tradition the case involved a gambian-born woman who married a german man in gambia in 2000 and brought her daughter from a previous relationship to germany .
the girl was to be sent back to the woman 's extended family in gambia in 2003 so that her mother could pursue a training course in nursing for the elderly . however , days before the girl 's departure , relatives of the german husband alerted child welfare authorities that the daughter could be threatened with genital mutilation . the mother , who underwent female circumcision herself at the age of 13 , had defended the ritual as a cultural tradition . dresden-based social worker matthias hirche , who is working on the case pointed out on thursday that the federal administrative court had categorically rejected the mother 's stance .

her mother is now divorced from her german husband . the court in karlsruhe ruled that the girl would most likely be faced with genital mutilation if she was sent to her mother 's family in gambia .
the judges said the fact that the girl 's grandmother had been unable to spare her own daughter from the inhuman procedure raised worries that the grandmother , under the influence of the extended family , would be unable to prevent it from happening to her granddaughter . judges in karlsruhe also made it clear on thursday that the lower court in the eastern city of dresden which issued the original ruling , and the local child welfare office must now act to ensure the child is not taken out of the country where she might be threatened with excision . the court added that the girl could be taken from her mother and put in foster care again if necessary to protect her . state authorities have also withheld her passport .
" we have to ensure that the girl does n't get sent to africa or to france or britain , where genital mutilation is secretly practiced , " said hirche .

the court found that between 80 and 90 percent of woman and girls in gambia undergo excision , known in some countries as female circumcision . an estimated 130 million women have been subjected to female circumcision and 2 million undergo the procedure each year , according to officials at a conference on female circumcision held in november 2003 in sweden . excision impairs a woman 's ability to enjoy sexual relations , and is traditionally seen as controlling female sexuality and improving a girl 's marriage prospects . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de female circumcision threatens girls in germany female circumsion is n't just a problem in african countries .

mädchen .
the judges described the procedure , which typically involves cutting off the clitoris and other parts of genitalia in pre-pubescent and teenage girls , as a " cruel , grave form of abuse that is impossible to justify " and a clear violation of the welfare rights of the child . child protection versus cultural tradition the case involved a gambian-born woman who married a german man in gambia in 2000 and brought her daughter from a previous relationship to germany .
the girl was to be sent back to the woman 's extended family in gambia in 2003 so that her mother could pursue a training course in nursing for the elderly . however , days before the girl 's departure , relatives of the german husband alerted child welfare authorities that the daughter could be threatened with genital mutilation . the mother , who underwent female circumcision herself at the age of 13 , had defended the ritual as a cultural tradition . dresden-based social worker matthias hirche , who is working on the case pointed out on thursday that the federal administrative court had categorically rejected the mother 's stance .
" the court has awarded more importance to the protection of the child than parents ' rights or culture and tradition , " he said . no travel abroad bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women 's demonstration in somalia against female circumcision .
the girl who was placed in foster care immediately following an emergency ruling by local child welfare authorities once the matter came to light , is now back with her mother .
her mother is now divorced from her german husband . the court in karlsruhe ruled that the girl would most likely be faced with genital mutilation if she was sent to her mother 's family in gambia .
the judges said the fact that the girl 's grandmother had been unable to spare her own daughter from the inhuman procedure raised worries that the grandmother , under the influence of the extended family , would be unable to prevent it from happening to her granddaughter . judges in karlsruhe also made it clear on thursday that the lower court in the eastern city of dresden which issued the original ruling , and the local child welfare office must now act to ensure the child is not taken out of the country where she might be threatened with excision . the court added that the girl could be taken from her mother and put in foster care again if necessary to protect her . state authorities have also withheld her passport .
" we have to ensure that the girl does n't get sent to africa or to france or britain , where genital mutilation is secretly practiced , " said hirche .
" but to monitor that will still be tough , " he added . rampant practice genital mutilation is practiced in some 28 african countries , despite laws that outlaw it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top-model waris dirie waits at a unicef press conference on human right for girls in berlin , nov .

" we are most decisively in favor of the fact that iran completely gives up military use of nuclear power , forever if at all possible , " schröder told global political and business leaders at the world economic forum in davos , switzerland . " but we are just as convinced that has to be achieved through diplomatic and political means , " he added . against military action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's main bushehr nuclear power plant , is located southwest of the capital tehran .
schröder 's comments came amid reports that the european union had hardened its stance over iran 's controversial nuclear plans , by urging tehran to completely dismantle its nuclear fuel program in order to guarantee that it does not seek atomic weapons . iran has denied that crucial negotiations with britain , france and germany for a long-term solution to the issue were deadlocked . but schröder reiterated his rejection of the use of force , a week after us president george w. bush said he could not rule out military action if iran could not be persuaded to abandon its nuclear energy program .
washington suspects iran is trying to build nuclear weapons . " this is a hotbed region , the last thing we need is a military conflict in that region , " schröder said .

german justice authorities reportedly will not take legal action against us defense secretary donald rumsfeld over the abu ghraib prisoner abuse scandal in iraq .
but prosecutors have yet to decide . german court officials have rejected claims in the daily newspaper tagesspiegel friday that german federal prosecutor kay nehm would not seek to try rumsfeld because no germans were victims of the us troop offences at the notorious prison near baghdad . " we have yet to decide whether or not to pursue the charge , " said a federal court spokesman thursday . but the paper reported that under current law , nehm could only take action if germans were suspected of committing crimes or of being the victims of crimes . on november 30 , an international legal team filed a criminal complaint in berlin against rumsfeld and other senior us officials over the abuses . the german factor the new york-based center for constitutional rights -lrb- ccr -rrb- and berlin 's republican lawyers ' association said they and four iraqi citizens mistreated by us soldiers were seeking a probe by german prosecutors of us policy-makers . they said they had chosen germany because of its code of crimes against international law , introduced in 2002 , which grants german courts universal jurisdiction in cases involving war crimes or crimes against humanity . the ccr said that the four iraqis it was representing had been victims of mistreatment including electric shock , severe beatings , sleep and food deprivation and sexual abuse while in us custody . " frivolous lawsuits " rumsfeld was scheduled to take part in an international security conference in the southern city of munich next month , but pulled out due to prior commitments amid speculation he was snubbing germany over the possible legal action . in december , the pentagon expressed concern over the criminal complaint and warned that " frivolous lawsuits " could affect broader us-german relations . according to human rights watch , two investigations have shown that rumsfeld 's policies on interrogation had contributed to torture and abuse in both iraq and afghanistan . " but the investigators lacked the mandate - or the independence - to draw the obvious conclusions regarding the political or legal responsibility of rumsfeld or others who approved illegal tactics , " the group said last week . afp / dw-staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rumsfeld to bypass munich conference us defense secretary donald rumsfeld will not attend the munich security conference in february .

german justice authorities reportedly will not take legal action against us defense secretary donald rumsfeld over the abu ghraib prisoner abuse scandal in iraq .

" the survivors have attempted to recount the unimaginable , " the paris-based paper wrote .
" who will utter the unspeakable when the last of us has gone ? " it asked .
" the countries bear responsibility that schools carry on in keeping alive the memory , " it wrote and warned , " also , every individual has to take care that the memory does n't fade . " italian daily corriere della sera also underlined the importance of remembering the holocaust .
" one needs to go back there always and look at the rail tracks , the barbed wire , the gas chambers and the barracks , " the milan-based paper wrote .
" and one must take their kids there and advise them to bring their kids and never stop explaining about the unexplainable and the unending horror of this abyss . " in britain , most newspapers filled their front pages with coverage of the poignant anniversary ceremony , many splashing pictures of an elderly auschwitz survivor fighting back tears as he re-entered the camp . " the world remembers " was the banner headline in the guardian above a lengthy account of the ceremony attended by various heads of state and government .
the tone of editorial comment provided by some papers was made clear by eadlines such as " never again , " in the times , and the daily mail 's " we must never forget " . " auschwitz should never be forgotten , " the times said in an editorial , condemning attempts to " relativize " the holocaust 's horrors by other groups comparing their plight to that of the jews .
" britons , like all europeans , must share the legacy of such evil .
the watchword must remain : never again , " it said . the paper also focused on germany 's guilt-riddled legacy .
" almost every aspect of life in germany is still burdened by the awful legacy , " the paper wrote listing the country 's reluctance to deploy troops abroad , pacifism , environmental commitments , and opposition to stem-cell research , language taboos and consensus-seeking politics as some of the examples .
the paper said germans had largely succeeded in coming to terms with the past .
" one must applaud the germans , " it wrote .
" the country knows that it bears a greater responsibility when it comes to democracy and political extremism . " german newspapers too dwelt on the country 's special responsibility . weekly die zeit identified " only one rule " for anyone trying to come to terms with auschwitz : " when you are not disturbed in the depths of your soul every time you hear about it ... then there is something wrong . " conservative berlin-based paper die welt exhorted readers to mark the anniversary with " sorrow and humility " .
while " no exoneration can be sought in the past or the future , " said the daily , the german people could show their dignity by " standing up for human rights wherever they are violated , for the rule of law and for freedom , wherever they are repressed " .
the paper also suggested that europe is seeking to create a common identity by remembering the mass murder of jews . " auschwitz put the world to shame , " read the front-page headline in polish daily zycie warszawy .
" the free world stood idle , " headlined the centre-left gazeta wyborcza , which devoted its entire front page and four inside pages to the ceremonies on thursday to mark the camp 's liberation on january 27 , 1945 , by the soviet red army . spanish daily el pais decried the failure to learn the lessons of the holocaust .
" contrary to the new dawn promised after the second world war , mass genocide has been committed time and time again , " it wrote . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering germany 's darkest place commemorative events marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz continued throughout thursday as world leaders spoke of an evil that must never be allowed to surface again .

the judges described the procedure , which typically involves cutting off the clitoris and other parts of genitalia in pre-pubescent and teenage girls , as a " cruel , grave form of abuse that is impossible to justify " and a clear violation of the welfare rights of the child . child protection versus cultural tradition the case involved a gambian-born woman who married a german man in gambia in 2000 and brought her daughter from a previous relationship to germany .
the girl was to be sent back to the woman 's extended family in gambia in 2003 so that her mother could pursue a training course in nursing for the elderly . however , days before the girl 's departure , relatives of the german husband alerted child welfare authorities that the daughter could be threatened with genital mutilation . the mother , who underwent female circumcision herself at the age of 13 , had defended the ritual as a cultural tradition . dresden-based social worker matthias hirche , who is working on the case pointed out on thursday that the federal administrative court had categorically rejected the mother 's stance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.01.2005 european press review : " we must never forget " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz 's rail tracks were illuminated with fire on thursday newspapers across europe on friday urged the world never to forget the horrors perpetrated by the nazis at auschwitz where ceremonies marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the death camp took place thursday . french paper liberation commented on the need to preserve the memory of the holocaust .
" the survivors have attempted to recount the unimaginable , " the paris-based paper wrote .
" who will utter the unspeakable when the last of us has gone ? " it asked .
" the countries bear responsibility that schools carry on in keeping alive the memory , " it wrote and warned , " also , every individual has to take care that the memory does n't fade . " italian daily corriere della sera also underlined the importance of remembering the holocaust .
" one needs to go back there always and look at the rail tracks , the barbed wire , the gas chambers and the barracks , " the milan-based paper wrote .
" and one must take their kids there and advise them to bring their kids and never stop explaining about the unexplainable and the unending horror of this abyss . " in britain , most newspapers filled their front pages with coverage of the poignant anniversary ceremony , many splashing pictures of an elderly auschwitz survivor fighting back tears as he re-entered the camp . " the world remembers " was the banner headline in the guardian above a lengthy account of the ceremony attended by various heads of state and government .
the tone of editorial comment provided by some papers was made clear by eadlines such as " never again , " in the times , and the daily mail 's " we must never forget " . " auschwitz should never be forgotten , " the times said in an editorial , condemning attempts to " relativize " the holocaust 's horrors by other groups comparing their plight to that of the jews .
" britons , like all europeans , must share the legacy of such evil .
the watchword must remain : never again , " it said . the paper also focused on germany 's guilt-riddled legacy .
" almost every aspect of life in germany is still burdened by the awful legacy , " the paper wrote listing the country 's reluctance to deploy troops abroad , pacifism , environmental commitments , and opposition to stem-cell research , language taboos and consensus-seeking politics as some of the examples .
the paper said germans had largely succeeded in coming to terms with the past .
" one must applaud the germans , " it wrote .
" the country knows that it bears a greater responsibility when it comes to democracy and political extremism . " german newspapers too dwelt on the country 's special responsibility . weekly die zeit identified " only one rule " for anyone trying to come to terms with auschwitz : " when you are not disturbed in the depths of your soul every time you hear about it ... then there is something wrong . " conservative berlin-based paper die welt exhorted readers to mark the anniversary with " sorrow and humility " .
while " no exoneration can be sought in the past or the future , " said the daily , the german people could show their dignity by " standing up for human rights wherever they are violated , for the rule of law and for freedom , wherever they are repressed " .
the paper also suggested that europe is seeking to create a common identity by remembering the mass murder of jews . " auschwitz put the world to shame , " read the front-page headline in polish daily zycie warszawy .
" the free world stood idle , " headlined the centre-left gazeta wyborcza , which devoted its entire front page and four inside pages to the ceremonies on thursday to mark the camp 's liberation on january 27 , 1945 , by the soviet red army . spanish daily el pais decried the failure to learn the lessons of the holocaust .
" contrary to the new dawn promised after the second world war , mass genocide has been committed time and time again , " it wrote . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering germany 's darkest place commemorative events marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz continued throughout thursday as world leaders spoke of an evil that must never be allowed to surface again .

" the survivors have attempted to recount the unimaginable , " the paris-based paper wrote .
" who will utter the unspeakable when the last of us has gone ? " it asked .
" the countries bear responsibility that schools carry on in keeping alive the memory , " it wrote and warned , " also , every individual has to take care that the memory does n't fade . " italian daily corriere della sera also underlined the importance of remembering the holocaust .
" one needs to go back there always and look at the rail tracks , the barbed wire , the gas chambers and the barracks , " the milan-based paper wrote .
" and one must take their kids there and advise them to bring their kids and never stop explaining about the unexplainable and the unending horror of this abyss . " in britain , most newspapers filled their front pages with coverage of the poignant anniversary ceremony , many splashing pictures of an elderly auschwitz survivor fighting back tears as he re-entered the camp . " the world remembers " was the banner headline in the guardian above a lengthy account of the ceremony attended by various heads of state and government .
the tone of editorial comment provided by some papers was made clear by eadlines such as " never again , " in the times , and the daily mail 's " we must never forget " . " auschwitz should never be forgotten , " the times said in an editorial , condemning attempts to " relativize " the holocaust 's horrors by other groups comparing their plight to that of the jews .
" britons , like all europeans , must share the legacy of such evil .
the watchword must remain : never again , " it said . the paper also focused on germany 's guilt-riddled legacy .
" almost every aspect of life in germany is still burdened by the awful legacy , " the paper wrote listing the country 's reluctance to deploy troops abroad , pacifism , environmental commitments , and opposition to stem-cell research , language taboos and consensus-seeking politics as some of the examples .
the paper said germans had largely succeeded in coming to terms with the past .
" one must applaud the germans , " it wrote .
" the country knows that it bears a greater responsibility when it comes to democracy and political extremism . " german newspapers too dwelt on the country 's special responsibility . weekly die zeit identified " only one rule " for anyone trying to come to terms with auschwitz : " when you are not disturbed in the depths of your soul every time you hear about it ... then there is something wrong . " conservative berlin-based paper die welt exhorted readers to mark the anniversary with " sorrow and humility " .
while " no exoneration can be sought in the past or the future , " said the daily , the german people could show their dignity by " standing up for human rights wherever they are violated , for the rule of law and for freedom , wherever they are repressed " .
the paper also suggested that europe is seeking to create a common identity by remembering the mass murder of jews . " auschwitz put the world to shame , " read the front-page headline in polish daily zycie warszawy .
" the free world stood idle , " headlined the centre-left gazeta wyborcza , which devoted its entire front page and four inside pages to the ceremonies on thursday to mark the camp 's liberation on january 27 , 1945 , by the soviet red army . spanish daily el pais decried the failure to learn the lessons of the holocaust .
" contrary to the new dawn promised after the second world war , mass genocide has been committed time and time again , " it wrote . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de remembering germany 's darkest place commemorative events marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz continued throughout thursday as world leaders spoke of an evil that must never be allowed to surface again .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.01.2005 tuition fees likely to deter foreigners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students are protesting against the planned fees foreign university students have long been attracted to germany as an inexpensive alternative to pricier america and britain .
but a court ruling this week clearing the way for german tuition fees could change that . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe on wednesday struck down a law that had made university tuition fees illegal , arguing it violated the right of the country 's federal states to set education policy . besides revolutionizing higher education for germans , the impending fees could radically alter the makeup of foreigners studying at the country 's universities as they look for less-expensive alternatives . “ since there are no tuition fees here i thought i ’ d come and give it a shot , ” said kim dong-young , a 29-year-old korean studying product design at the university of applied sciences in potsdam , near berlin .
like for so many overseas students , germany 's attraction for kim was a combination of quality instruction and affordability . " obviously the standard of education was important to me , but so was the cost , " he said . while states run by social democratic governments said on thursday they will resist charging college students , conservative-led states want to quickly implement a system of fees . strapped for cash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are chronically underfunded and overfilled . proponents of charging tuition argue germany 's cash-strapped universities need the extra revenue to halt their decline into mediocrity .
but those against fees fear poorer students will find it harder to study with the added costs .
that problem could be especially acute for foreign students from the developing world . germany ’ s tuition-free universities have long been attractive to those students unable to afford more prestigious yet more expensive institutions in the united states or britain .
whether foreigners will still be willing to learn german to study at universities that are often considered at best average internationally is unclear . but some german academic officials remain confident foreign students will still come if the tuition fees are used to improve the quality of education on offer . " we do n't want to earn anything from foreign students , but rather we hope to finance better service that has to be offered to compete internationally : language courses , alumni parties , more student housing for our guests , " christian bode , head of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , told der spiegel newsmagazine . bildunterschrift : better education , better students ? fees could also have the unintended effect of increasing the quality of students from abroad that come to germany .
dismal graduation rates for foreigners have prompted criticism that the country is failing to properly select and prepare prospective overseas students . according to a recent study by a non-profit education organization , only a quarter of all foreign students manage to graduate from german university .
those lucky enough to get a degree normally take an average of eight years to do so .
countless more fail to enroll , unable to pass university entry exams . bode from the daad said he expected the best-qualified students would be ensured access to german universities through scholarships and educational grants .
still , there are sure to be those that fall through the cracks if the fees come . hussein berjavi , a 22-year-old from lebanon currently taking preparatory classes in berlin in a bid to study engineering , said he did n't qualify for financial aid elsewhere , so he likely would n't in germany . " america , england , i could never afford to study in those places , " he said .

27 marked the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz death camp .
dw-world readers comment on what needs to be done to keep the memory alive . perhaps one of the best ways to keep the memory of the holocaust alive is to remember the story of anne frank .
your piece -lrb- " anne frank : the face of the holocaust " -rrb- was beautifully poetic in its simplicity and its honesty .
the story of anne frank will , i trust , be remembered for as long as we have hearts to love and sorrows to grieve .
thanks again for the article . - laurence hicks i think that those of us who live in the united states should pay more attention to what happened in nazi germany .
we have people in this country who believe that george bush was sent to us by god and for that reason can do no wrong .
this is the same way many germans thought of adolf hitler during world war ii . - lee davis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky is lit over the collapsed crematorium in the former nazi concentration camp of auschwitz-birkenau on jan .
27 , 2005 during the commemoration for the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the concentration camp i think that the discussion of the holocaust is very limited because of non-jewish people being so fearful of being accused of anti-semitism .
truly , the holocuast is a lesson about anti-semitism in a closed view but in an open mind it is really a lesson about racism and ultra-nationalism .
constantly linking the holocaust to anti-semitism undermines the abilities of all people to point out and deal with injustices of race and ultra-nationalism .
it is a voice that needs a balance .
it is important not to confuse critics of israel 's political policies and government , with anti-semites .
in many cases , the harshness of israeli policy , and the injustices caused by it , are ignored because of this .
rational people can not hold israel accountable for its actions .
the result is that supporters of the israeli policy in the middle-east simply have a louder voice that leaves many others , those affected by racism and similar injustices , crying in the dark .
who can speak up for the millions upon millions of genocide and racism victims in the current world ?
we have a collective responsibility to take care of all people and protect their human rights .
we should never use the injustices of the past as an excuse to isolate and empower ourselves in a manner that allows us to seek revenge and perpetrate similar acts against other groups of people .
reflect as one people , not as jews , germans , palestinians , blacks , whites , asians , hutus , tutsis and so on .
holocaust aniversary and reflection offers a valuable voice on the world stage .

they 're planning to match their words with votes , and officials expect at least 26,000 to cast a ballot in germany . puffing on cigarette after cigarette , iraqi journalist omar fadhil taps away at a keyboard , chatting online from his berlin office to his radio correspondents in baghdad . for the past month , fadhil , who lives in baghdad , has been heading the staff of " election monitor iraq , " a program broadcast from berlin via the internet to iraq , where it appears on local radio stations once a day , five days a week .
sponsored by a german foundation , with support from the german foreign office , election monitor iraq is designed to give iraqis something they do n't get much of : trustworthy news about the country 's first democratic election in more than 50 years . " we want to explain to people why it 's important , why they should go to vote , " said fadhil , who came up to berlin from baghdad to coordinate the team during the elections . whether iraq is ready for sunday 's vote has been the subject of sharp debate in recent months .
violent attacks , like the chain of car bombings across the country on wednesday that killed at least five , are the norm and jordanian jihadist abu musab al-zarqawi has promised chaos on election day . amimals better off than humans fadhil , who will stay in germany another 20 days said that , while many people are too scared to go out and vote , just as many will head out because they see no other alternative .

in all , iraqis in 14 countries , from the us , to the netherlands to australia will vote from friday to sunday , according to the international organization for migration , which is coordinating the overseas vote .
iom officials say they have registered more than 280,000 registered voters . " there certainly seems to be a great enthusiasm to take part , " said jana kristic , an iom organizer in germany . " we need to start some time " on wednesday , german-iraqi election workers gathered for a last minute election organization workshop in berlin .
though the class mostly dwelt on technical details , the importance of the moment was n't lost on the iraqis taking part . " i 've dreamed the whole time that there would be elections in iraq , and now here i am , helping it along , " said zainab hassin , 34 , who fled to cologne from baghdad in 1994 . hassin 's family in baghdad has stayed healthy and intact despite the chaos and danger in her homeland .
the chaotic security situation is perhaps one of the most important reasons to hold elections , she said . " we need this now , " she said .
" we need to start some time . " democracy needs to win growing pains are part of any young democracy , said baker schwani , 37 , a kurd who fled iraq in 1996 .
from the time he was in seventh grade , in 1980 , to the time he graduated university in 1991 , schwani said he knew only war and dictatorship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polling places will be under tight security over the voting weekend " democracy is n't not something we can just buy , we need to fight for it , " said schwani , who will be among the election workers handling an estimated 10,000 iraqi voters in cologne over the weekend . in the end , he said , it is n't even important who wins .
if a large percentage of the population turns out to vote , it could be a sign that the democracy , however fragile , is beginning to take root .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 28.01.2005 tuition fees likely to deter foreigners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german students are protesting against the planned fees foreign university students have long been attracted to germany as an inexpensive alternative to pricier america and britain .
but a court ruling this week clearing the way for german tuition fees could change that . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe on wednesday struck down a law that had made university tuition fees illegal , arguing it violated the right of the country 's federal states to set education policy . besides revolutionizing higher education for germans , the impending fees could radically alter the makeup of foreigners studying at the country 's universities as they look for less-expensive alternatives . “ since there are no tuition fees here i thought i ’ d come and give it a shot , ” said kim dong-young , a 29-year-old korean studying product design at the university of applied sciences in potsdam , near berlin .
like for so many overseas students , germany 's attraction for kim was a combination of quality instruction and affordability . " obviously the standard of education was important to me , but so was the cost , " he said . while states run by social democratic governments said on thursday they will resist charging college students , conservative-led states want to quickly implement a system of fees . strapped for cash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are chronically underfunded and overfilled . proponents of charging tuition argue germany 's cash-strapped universities need the extra revenue to halt their decline into mediocrity .
but those against fees fear poorer students will find it harder to study with the added costs .
that problem could be especially acute for foreign students from the developing world . germany ’ s tuition-free universities have long been attractive to those students unable to afford more prestigious yet more expensive institutions in the united states or britain .
whether foreigners will still be willing to learn german to study at universities that are often considered at best average internationally is unclear . but some german academic officials remain confident foreign students will still come if the tuition fees are used to improve the quality of education on offer . " we do n't want to earn anything from foreign students , but rather we hope to finance better service that has to be offered to compete internationally : language courses , alumni parties , more student housing for our guests , " christian bode , head of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , told der spiegel newsmagazine . bildunterschrift : better education , better students ? fees could also have the unintended effect of increasing the quality of students from abroad that come to germany .
dismal graduation rates for foreigners have prompted criticism that the country is failing to properly select and prepare prospective overseas students . according to a recent study by a non-profit education organization , only a quarter of all foreign students manage to graduate from german university .
those lucky enough to get a degree normally take an average of eight years to do so .
countless more fail to enroll , unable to pass university entry exams . bode from the daad said he expected the best-qualified students would be ensured access to german universities through scholarships and educational grants .
still , there are sure to be those that fall through the cracks if the fees come . hussein berjavi , a 22-year-old from lebanon currently taking preparatory classes in berlin in a bid to study engineering , said he did n't qualify for financial aid elsewhere , so he likely would n't in germany . " america , england , i could never afford to study in those places , " he said .
" things are a lot cheaper here .

but a court ruling this week clearing the way for german tuition fees could change that . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe on wednesday struck down a law that had made university tuition fees illegal , arguing it violated the right of the country 's federal states to set education policy . besides revolutionizing higher education for germans , the impending fees could radically alter the makeup of foreigners studying at the country 's universities as they look for less-expensive alternatives . “ since there are no tuition fees here i thought i ’ d come and give it a shot , ” said kim dong-young , a 29-year-old korean studying product design at the university of applied sciences in potsdam , near berlin .
like for so many overseas students , germany 's attraction for kim was a combination of quality instruction and affordability . " obviously the standard of education was important to me , but so was the cost , " he said . while states run by social democratic governments said on thursday they will resist charging college students , conservative-led states want to quickly implement a system of fees . strapped for cash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are chronically underfunded and overfilled . proponents of charging tuition argue germany 's cash-strapped universities need the extra revenue to halt their decline into mediocrity .
but those against fees fear poorer students will find it harder to study with the added costs .
that problem could be especially acute for foreign students from the developing world . germany ’ s tuition-free universities have long been attractive to those students unable to afford more prestigious yet more expensive institutions in the united states or britain .
whether foreigners will still be willing to learn german to study at universities that are often considered at best average internationally is unclear . but some german academic officials remain confident foreign students will still come if the tuition fees are used to improve the quality of education on offer . " we do n't want to earn anything from foreign students , but rather we hope to finance better service that has to be offered to compete internationally : language courses , alumni parties , more student housing for our guests , " christian bode , head of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , told der spiegel newsmagazine . bildunterschrift : better education , better students ? fees could also have the unintended effect of increasing the quality of students from abroad that come to germany .
dismal graduation rates for foreigners have prompted criticism that the country is failing to properly select and prepare prospective overseas students . according to a recent study by a non-profit education organization , only a quarter of all foreign students manage to graduate from german university .
those lucky enough to get a degree normally take an average of eight years to do so .
countless more fail to enroll , unable to pass university entry exams . bode from the daad said he expected the best-qualified students would be ensured access to german universities through scholarships and educational grants .
still , there are sure to be those that fall through the cracks if the fees come . hussein berjavi , a 22-year-old from lebanon currently taking preparatory classes in berlin in a bid to study engineering , said he did n't qualify for financial aid elsewhere , so he likely would n't in germany .

the judges described the procedure , which typically involves cutting off the clitoris and other parts of genitalia in pre-pubescent and teenage girls , as a " cruel , grave form of abuse that is impossible to justify " and a clear violation of the welfare rights of the child . child protection versus cultural tradition the case involved a gambian-born woman who married a german man in gambia in 2000 and brought her daughter from a previous relationship to germany .
the girl was to be sent back to the woman 's extended family in gambia in 2003 so that her mother could pursue a training course in nursing for the elderly . however , days before the girl 's departure , relatives of the german husband alerted child welfare authorities that the daughter could be threatened with genital mutilation . the mother , who underwent female circumcision herself at the age of 13 , had defended the ritual as a cultural tradition . dresden-based social worker matthias hirche , who is working on the case pointed out on thursday that the federal administrative court had categorically rejected the mother 's stance .

her mother is now divorced from her german husband . the court in karlsruhe ruled that the girl would most likely be faced with genital mutilation if she was sent to her mother 's family in gambia .
the judges said the fact that the girl 's grandmother had been unable to spare her own daughter from the inhuman procedure raised worries that the grandmother , under the influence of the extended family , would be unable to prevent it from happening to her granddaughter . judges in karlsruhe also made it clear on thursday that the lower court in the eastern city of dresden which issued the original ruling , and the local child welfare office must now act to ensure the child is not taken out of the country where she might be threatened with excision . the court added that the girl could be taken from her mother and put in foster care again if necessary to protect her . state authorities have also withheld her passport .
" we have to ensure that the girl does n't get sent to africa or to france or britain , where genital mutilation is secretly practiced , " said hirche .

german justice authorities reportedly will not take legal action against us defense secretary donald rumsfeld over the abu ghraib prisoner abuse scandal in iraq .

german justice authorities reportedly will not take legal action against us defense secretary donald rumsfeld over the abu ghraib prisoner abuse scandal in iraq .
but prosecutors have yet to decide . german court officials have rejected claims in the daily newspaper tagesspiegel friday that german federal prosecutor kay nehm would not seek to try rumsfeld because no germans were victims of the us troop offences at the notorious prison near baghdad . " we have yet to decide whether or not to pursue the charge , " said a federal court spokesman thursday . but the paper reported that under current law , nehm could only take action if germans were suspected of committing crimes or of being the victims of crimes . on november 30 , an international legal team filed a criminal complaint in berlin against rumsfeld and other senior us officials over the abuses . the german factor the new york-based center for constitutional rights -lrb- ccr -rrb- and berlin 's republican lawyers ' association said they and four iraqi citizens mistreated by us soldiers were seeking a probe by german prosecutors of us policy-makers . they said they had chosen germany because of its code of crimes against international law , introduced in 2002 , which grants german courts universal jurisdiction in cases involving war crimes or crimes against humanity . the ccr said that the four iraqis it was representing had been victims of mistreatment including electric shock , severe beatings , sleep and food deprivation and sexual abuse while in us custody . " frivolous lawsuits " rumsfeld was scheduled to take part in an international security conference in the southern city of munich next month , but pulled out due to prior commitments amid speculation he was snubbing germany over the possible legal action . in december , the pentagon expressed concern over the criminal complaint and warned that " frivolous lawsuits " could affect broader us-german relations . according to human rights watch , two investigations have shown that rumsfeld 's policies on interrogation had contributed to torture and abuse in both iraq and afghanistan . " but the investigators lacked the mandate - or the independence - to draw the obvious conclusions regarding the political or legal responsibility of rumsfeld or others who approved illegal tactics , " the group said last week . afp / dw-staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rumsfeld to bypass munich conference us defense secretary donald rumsfeld will not attend the munich security conference in february .

" the survivors have attempted to recount the unimaginable , " the paris-based paper wrote .
" who will utter the unspeakable when the last of us has gone ? " it asked .
" the countries bear responsibility that schools carry on in keeping alive the memory , " it wrote and warned , " also , every individual has to take care that the memory does n't fade . " italian daily corriere della sera also underlined the importance of remembering the holocaust .

the tone of editorial comment provided by some papers was made clear by eadlines such as " never again , " in the times , and the daily mail 's " we must never forget " .

german justice authorities reportedly will not take legal action against us defense secretary donald rumsfeld over the abu ghraib prisoner abuse scandal in iraq .
but prosecutors have yet to decide . german court officials have rejected claims in the daily newspaper tagesspiegel friday that german federal prosecutor kay nehm would not seek to try rumsfeld because no germans were victims of the us troop offences at the notorious prison near baghdad . " we have yet to decide whether or not to pursue the charge , " said a federal court spokesman thursday . but the paper reported that under current law , nehm could only take action if germans were suspected of committing crimes or of being the victims of crimes . on november 30 , an international legal team filed a criminal complaint in berlin against rumsfeld and other senior us officials over the abuses . the german factor the new york-based center for constitutional rights -lrb- ccr -rrb- and berlin 's republican lawyers ' association said they and four iraqi citizens mistreated by us soldiers were seeking a probe by german prosecutors of us policy-makers . they said they had chosen germany because of its code of crimes against international law , introduced in 2002 , which grants german courts universal jurisdiction in cases involving war crimes or crimes against humanity . the ccr said that the four iraqis it was representing had been victims of mistreatment including electric shock , severe beatings , sleep and food deprivation and sexual abuse while in us custody . " frivolous lawsuits " rumsfeld was scheduled to take part in an international security conference in the southern city of munich next month , but pulled out due to prior commitments amid speculation he was snubbing germany over the possible legal action . in december , the pentagon expressed concern over the criminal complaint and warned that " frivolous lawsuits " could affect broader us-german relations . according to human rights watch , two investigations have shown that rumsfeld 's policies on interrogation had contributed to torture and abuse in both iraq and afghanistan .

" it 's not about frankfurt versus london .
both sides will benefit , " seifert repeated a number of times during a news conference . and on paper at least , things look as if they would remain very much the same both on the thames and on the river main in frankfurt .
both exchanges would continue to be overseen by the regulatory authorities of their corresponding countries and trading would continue to be carried out in the euro in frankfurt and sterling in london . london would have equal say in the running of the company , with deutsche börse promising that seven of the 14 shareholder representatives on the supervisory board would have " close ties to the city of london " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt skyline at the same time , deutsche börse promised to retain its global headquarters in frankfurt -lrb- photo -rrb- .
and asked where he would have his main office , seifert insisted it would be frankfurt , even if he immediately added : " i 'm always travelling anyway . " " reverse takeover " but despite such promises , the term " reverse takeover " quickly did the rounds , with concerns that while the deutsche börse would be footing the bill , it would be london that would finally be in command . deutsche börse offered to base the combined cash equities , derivatives and clearing businesses in london , and lse chief clara furse would be offered the job of being in charge of cash equities .
and since the reputation of the city is more powerful than frankfurt anyway , many of the big banks are now considered likely to move to london . " let 's not kid ourselves .
a shift would represent a noticeable weakening of germany and frankfurt as a financial centre , " said the head of deka bank , axel weber . and erlangen university professor and stock market expert wolfgang gerke remarked that following the spectacular failure of the ambitious " ix " merger between deutsche börse and the lse in 2000 , " the germans are bending over backwards " this time round to woo london . " from a german point of view , there 's reason to be nervous , " gerke said . redundancies and re-location ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chairman of the board of german stock exchange -lrb- deutsche börse ag -rrb- werner g. seifert seifert promised on thursday that there were would be no job cuts in london if the merger went ahead .
but he did not repeat an earlier pledge that there would be no compulsory redundancies in frankfurt and no german employees would be forced to move to london against their will . " the issue was clearly not important enough for him to repeat this time round , " the mass-circulation daily bild complained in its friday edition . herbert walter , an official of the giant services sector labor union verdi and a member of deutsche börse 's supervisory board , said he believed seifert would honor his pledge for no compulsory redundancies . " but the issue more about frankfurt as a financial center rather than just deutsche börse as a company , " walter said .
" it is to be feared that all the big banks and consultancy firms will move to london .
frankfurt would lose out in know-how and in importance . " the trend to london winfried hartmann , head of the investment fund frankfurt-trust , noted that frankfurt had already lost out to london in the area of investment banking in recent years .
and that trend would continue in the event of a merger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new london stock exchange , -lrb- lse -rrb- , building in paternoster square , london , friday , december 17 , 2004 .

and asked where he would have his main office , seifert insisted it would be frankfurt , even if he immediately added : " i 'm always travelling anyway . " " reverse takeover " but despite such promises , the term " reverse takeover " quickly did the rounds , with concerns that while the deutsche börse would be footing the bill , it would be london that would finally be in command . deutsche börse offered to base the combined cash equities , derivatives and clearing businesses in london , and lse chief clara furse would be offered the job of being in charge of cash equities .
and since the reputation of the city is more powerful than frankfurt anyway , many of the big banks are now considered likely to move to london . " let 's not kid ourselves .
a shift would represent a noticeable weakening of germany and frankfurt as a financial centre , " said the head of deka bank , axel weber . and erlangen university professor and stock market expert wolfgang gerke remarked that following the spectacular failure of the ambitious " ix " merger between deutsche börse and the lse in 2000 , " the germans are bending over backwards " this time round to woo london .

but he did not repeat an earlier pledge that there would be no compulsory redundancies in frankfurt and no german employees would be forced to move to london against their will . " the issue was clearly not important enough for him to repeat this time round , " the mass-circulation daily bild complained in its friday edition . herbert walter , an official of the giant services sector labor union verdi and a member of deutsche börse 's supervisory board , said he believed seifert would honor his pledge for no compulsory redundancies . " but the issue more about frankfurt as a financial center rather than just deutsche börse as a company , " walter said .
" it is to be feared that all the big banks and consultancy firms will move to london .
frankfurt would lose out in know-how and in importance . " the trend to london winfried hartmann , head of the investment fund frankfurt-trust , noted that frankfurt had already lost out to london in the area of investment banking in recent years .

dw-world readers comment on what needs to be done to keep the memory alive . perhaps one of the best ways to keep the memory of the holocaust alive is to remember the story of anne frank .
your piece -lrb- " anne frank : the face of the holocaust " -rrb- was beautifully poetic in its simplicity and its honesty .
the story of anne frank will , i trust , be remembered for as long as we have hearts to love and sorrows to grieve .

27 , 2005 during the commemoration for the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the concentration camp i think that the discussion of the holocaust is very limited because of non-jewish people being so fearful of being accused of anti-semitism .
truly , the holocuast is a lesson about anti-semitism in a closed view but in an open mind it is really a lesson about racism and ultra-nationalism .
constantly linking the holocaust to anti-semitism undermines the abilities of all people to point out and deal with injustices of race and ultra-nationalism .
it is a voice that needs a balance .
it is important not to confuse critics of israel 's political policies and government , with anti-semites .
in many cases , the harshness of israeli policy , and the injustices caused by it , are ignored because of this .
rational people can not hold israel accountable for its actions .
the result is that supporters of the israeli policy in the middle-east simply have a louder voice that leaves many others , those affected by racism and similar injustices , crying in the dark .
who can speak up for the millions upon millions of genocide and racism victims in the current world ?
we have a collective responsibility to take care of all people and protect their human rights .
we should never use the injustices of the past as an excuse to isolate and empower ourselves in a manner that allows us to seek revenge and perpetrate similar acts against other groups of people .
reflect as one people , not as jews , germans , palestinians , blacks , whites , asians , hutus , tutsis and so on .
holocaust aniversary and reflection offers a valuable voice on the world stage .
give others respect for their struggles and losses of the past as well .
please use the voice to demonstrate the need for compassion and justice for all people in the world . - chris battochio , canada the holocaust is not relevant as long as the killing fields of palestine , afghanistan and iraq exist .
when the us and its allies and the israeli forces cease their onslaught of the innocent men , women and children of afghanistan , iraq and palestine , then someone can say that they have heeeded the lessons of the nazi holocaust .
otherwise nothing has changed . - kenneth t. tellis , canada no i do n't think enough is being done to remember the holocaust or its survivors .
the main fault lies with the school systems , because most people have entrusted the schools to teach our children what is important .

most of the history we studied involved memorizing meaningles dates , battles and names .

in the middle east , teaching the holocaust is not allowed , as they feel it validates the creation of israel .

27 marked the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz death camp .
dw-world readers comment on what needs to be done to keep the memory alive . perhaps one of the best ways to keep the memory of the holocaust alive is to remember the story of anne frank .
your piece -lrb- " anne frank : the face of the holocaust " -rrb- was beautifully poetic in its simplicity and its honesty .
the story of anne frank will , i trust , be remembered for as long as we have hearts to love and sorrows to grieve .
thanks again for the article . - laurence hicks i think that those of us who live in the united states should pay more attention to what happened in nazi germany .
we have people in this country who believe that george bush was sent to us by god and for that reason can do no wrong .
this is the same way many germans thought of adolf hitler during world war ii . - lee davis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky is lit over the collapsed crematorium in the former nazi concentration camp of auschwitz-birkenau on jan .
27 , 2005 during the commemoration for the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the concentration camp i think that the discussion of the holocaust is very limited because of non-jewish people being so fearful of being accused of anti-semitism .
truly , the holocuast is a lesson about anti-semitism in a closed view but in an open mind it is really a lesson about racism and ultra-nationalism .
constantly linking the holocaust to anti-semitism undermines the abilities of all people to point out and deal with injustices of race and ultra-nationalism .
it is a voice that needs a balance .
it is important not to confuse critics of israel 's political policies and government , with anti-semites .
in many cases , the harshness of israeli policy , and the injustices caused by it , are ignored because of this .
rational people can not hold israel accountable for its actions .
the result is that supporters of the israeli policy in the middle-east simply have a louder voice that leaves many others , those affected by racism and similar injustices , crying in the dark .
who can speak up for the millions upon millions of genocide and racism victims in the current world ?
we have a collective responsibility to take care of all people and protect their human rights .
we should never use the injustices of the past as an excuse to isolate and empower ourselves in a manner that allows us to seek revenge and perpetrate similar acts against other groups of people .
reflect as one people , not as jews , germans , palestinians , blacks , whites , asians , hutus , tutsis and so on .
holocaust aniversary and reflection offers a valuable voice on the world stage .
give others respect for their struggles and losses of the past as well .
please use the voice to demonstrate the need for compassion and justice for all people in the world . - chris battochio , canada the holocaust is not relevant as long as the killing fields of palestine , afghanistan and iraq exist .
when the us and its allies and the israeli forces cease their onslaught of the innocent men , women and children of afghanistan , iraq and palestine , then someone can say that they have heeeded the lessons of the nazi holocaust .
otherwise nothing has changed . - kenneth t. tellis , canada no i do n't think enough is being done to remember the holocaust or its survivors .
the main fault lies with the school systems , because most people have entrusted the schools to teach our children what is important .
when i was going to school , i learned nothing of the world wars nor the holocaust .
most of the history we studied involved memorizing meaningles dates , battles and names .
there was no " human connection . "
it has only been through homeschooling my own child that i have developed any understanding of , interest in or compassion for the plight of the persecuted jews in that ugly part of history .
there are still survivors , and children and grandchildren of survivors .
many of them yearn to share their history .
the jews are a proud lot with a long history , and those that wish to share it with the world should be encouraged to teach our children well . - hellen bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler bows in front of a memorial for the victims of the auschwitz death camp the tragedy of auschwitz should be a lesson for all peoples , not only for europeans .
unfortunately in anti-semitic , totalitarian countries , where knowledge of the horrors of the holocaust is needed the most , auschwitz can only be a lesson if it is allowed to be " a lesson " in schools .
as an american teacher teaching in an egyptian english-speaking school , i witnessed one of the grossest atrocities of my teaching career .
the school had disected the american-published highschool history textbooks so that all the pages referring to the holocaust were removed and their page numbers blackened out in the index .
in the middle east , teaching the holocaust is not allowed , as they feel it validates the creation of israel .
having lived in the region for many years , i can tell you this is the norm in schools here , not a gross unique case .
the responsibility to teach the lessons of auschwitz lies not only on the shoulders of the europeans but on the shoulders of all those priviledged enough to come from countries where the unedited version of history is made public knowledge . - monique slave labor compensation the amount that is being given as compensation for germany 's forced slave labor is not enough . . . the health issues arising with age due to immense negligent health and welfare inflicted , the emotional scars that have been set deep into the soul , and the precious loss of life 's years seem to have little value with the way the compensation has awarded .
my mother receives less than $ 40 -lrb- € 30.6 -rrb- a month , and my dad is still awaiting some sort of payment - although both have physical paper proof of their confinement and labor abuse .
the media gives more words than there is strength to recognize the humans that have suffered and now must wait for menial restitution . - mary jane kymer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : " we must never forget " newspapers across europe on friday urged the world never to forget the horrors perpetrated by the nazis at auschwitz where ceremonies marking the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the death camp took place thursday .

they 're planning to match their words with votes , and officials expect at least 26,000 to cast a ballot in germany . puffing on cigarette after cigarette , iraqi journalist omar fadhil taps away at a keyboard , chatting online from his berlin office to his radio correspondents in baghdad . for the past month , fadhil , who lives in baghdad , has been heading the staff of " election monitor iraq , " a program broadcast from berlin via the internet to iraq , where it appears on local radio stations once a day , five days a week .

27 marked the 60th anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz death camp .
dw-world readers comment on what needs to be done to keep the memory alive . perhaps one of the best ways to keep the memory of the holocaust alive is to remember the story of anne frank .
your piece -lrb- " anne frank : the face of the holocaust " -rrb- was beautifully poetic in its simplicity and its honesty .
the story of anne frank will , i trust , be remembered for as long as we have hearts to love and sorrows to grieve .
thanks again for the article . - laurence hicks i think that those of us who live in the united states should pay more attention to what happened in nazi germany .
we have people in this country who believe that george bush was sent to us by god and for that reason can do no wrong .
this is the same way many germans thought of adolf hitler during world war ii . - lee davis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sky is lit over the collapsed crematorium in the former nazi concentration camp of auschwitz-birkenau on jan .
27 , 2005 during the commemoration for the 60th anniversary of the liberation of the concentration camp i think that the discussion of the holocaust is very limited because of non-jewish people being so fearful of being accused of anti-semitism .
truly , the holocuast is a lesson about anti-semitism in a closed view but in an open mind it is really a lesson about racism and ultra-nationalism .
constantly linking the holocaust to anti-semitism undermines the abilities of all people to point out and deal with injustices of race and ultra-nationalism .
it is a voice that needs a balance .
it is important not to confuse critics of israel 's political policies and government , with anti-semites .
in many cases , the harshness of israeli policy , and the injustices caused by it , are ignored because of this .
rational people can not hold israel accountable for its actions .
the result is that supporters of the israeli policy in the middle-east simply have a louder voice that leaves many others , those affected by racism and similar injustices , crying in the dark .
who can speak up for the millions upon millions of genocide and racism victims in the current world ?
we have a collective responsibility to take care of all people and protect their human rights .
we should never use the injustices of the past as an excuse to isolate and empower ourselves in a manner that allows us to seek revenge and perpetrate similar acts against other groups of people .
reflect as one people , not as jews , germans , palestinians , blacks , whites , asians , hutus , tutsis and so on .
holocaust aniversary and reflection offers a valuable voice on the world stage .
give others respect for their struggles and losses of the past as well .

but a court ruling this week clearing the way for german tuition fees could change that . germany 's constitutional court in karlsruhe on wednesday struck down a law that had made university tuition fees illegal , arguing it violated the right of the country 's federal states to set education policy . besides revolutionizing higher education for germans , the impending fees could radically alter the makeup of foreigners studying at the country 's universities as they look for less-expensive alternatives . “ since there are no tuition fees here i thought i ’ d come and give it a shot , ” said kim dong-young , a 29-year-old korean studying product design at the university of applied sciences in potsdam , near berlin .
like for so many overseas students , germany 's attraction for kim was a combination of quality instruction and affordability . " obviously the standard of education was important to me , but so was the cost , " he said . while states run by social democratic governments said on thursday they will resist charging college students , conservative-led states want to quickly implement a system of fees . strapped for cash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are chronically underfunded and overfilled . proponents of charging tuition argue germany 's cash-strapped universities need the extra revenue to halt their decline into mediocrity .
but those against fees fear poorer students will find it harder to study with the added costs .
that problem could be especially acute for foreign students from the developing world . germany ’ s tuition-free universities have long been attractive to those students unable to afford more prestigious yet more expensive institutions in the united states or britain .
whether foreigners will still be willing to learn german to study at universities that are often considered at best average internationally is unclear . but some german academic officials remain confident foreign students will still come if the tuition fees are used to improve the quality of education on offer . " we do n't want to earn anything from foreign students , but rather we hope to finance better service that has to be offered to compete internationally : language courses , alumni parties , more student housing for our guests , " christian bode , head of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , told der spiegel newsmagazine . bildunterschrift : better education , better students ? fees could also have the unintended effect of increasing the quality of students from abroad that come to germany .
dismal graduation rates for foreigners have prompted criticism that the country is failing to properly select and prepare prospective overseas students . according to a recent study by a non-profit education organization , only a quarter of all foreign students manage to graduate from german university .
those lucky enough to get a degree normally take an average of eight years to do so .
countless more fail to enroll , unable to pass university entry exams . bode from the daad said he expected the best-qualified students would be ensured access to german universities through scholarships and educational grants .
still , there are sure to be those that fall through the cracks if the fees come . hussein berjavi , a 22-year-old from lebanon currently taking preparatory classes in berlin in a bid to study engineering , said he did n't qualify for financial aid elsewhere , so he likely would n't in germany . " america , england , i could never afford to study in those places , " he said .

" obviously the standard of education was important to me , but so was the cost , " he said . while states run by social democratic governments said on thursday they will resist charging college students , conservative-led states want to quickly implement a system of fees . strapped for cash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are chronically underfunded and overfilled . proponents of charging tuition argue germany 's cash-strapped universities need the extra revenue to halt their decline into mediocrity .
but those against fees fear poorer students will find it harder to study with the added costs .
that problem could be especially acute for foreign students from the developing world . germany ’ s tuition-free universities have long been attractive to those students unable to afford more prestigious yet more expensive institutions in the united states or britain .
whether foreigners will still be willing to learn german to study at universities that are often considered at best average internationally is unclear . but some german academic officials remain confident foreign students will still come if the tuition fees are used to improve the quality of education on offer . " we do n't want to earn anything from foreign students , but rather we hope to finance better service that has to be offered to compete internationally : language courses , alumni parties , more student housing for our guests , " christian bode , head of the german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- , told der spiegel newsmagazine . bildunterschrift : better education , better students ? fees could also have the unintended effect of increasing the quality of students from abroad that come to germany .
dismal graduation rates for foreigners have prompted criticism that the country is failing to properly select and prepare prospective overseas students . according to a recent study by a non-profit education organization , only a quarter of all foreign students manage to graduate from german university .
those lucky enough to get a degree normally take an average of eight years to do so .
countless more fail to enroll , unable to pass university entry exams . bode from the daad said he expected the best-qualified students would be ensured access to german universities through scholarships and educational grants .
still , there are sure to be those that fall through the cracks if the fees come . hussein berjavi , a 22-year-old from lebanon currently taking preparatory classes in berlin in a bid to study engineering , said he did n't qualify for financial aid elsewhere , so he likely would n't in germany . " america , england , i could never afford to study in those places , " he said .

with aesthetic plastic surgery becoming more popular than ever , one man tells us how his surgery went terribly wrong .
john mcgill had been assured the eyelid surgery was simple and would not take long .
after 25 minutes in the operating chair , he was walking out of the door .
it was only when he got home that things started to go wrong .
mr mcgill , 52 , from cambridgeshire , who had the surgery to remove a lump from above his right eye , said : " there was a lot of swelling and my eyes were sore , itchy and very red . "
it is just unbelievable surgeons are able to operate like this " john mcgill " with just the slightest breeze , they would start watering .
i went back to the clinic and the surgeon just said to give it time but matters did n't improve . "
some 18 months after the operation in 1997 , mr mcgill saw an eye specialist at a norfolk hospital who told him too much skin had been removed from his lower eyelids in the £ 1,500 operation , called a blepharoplasty .
he underwent two operations on the nhs to correct it and took legal action against the surgeon who had originally operated on him .
the case was eventually settled out of court after mediation last year for a six-figure sum , mr mcgill said .
" it was such a painful experience from start to finish and the system does not help the patient at all .
my case dragged on for so long - it is weighted in favour of the doctor , " he said .
" it seems the government is beginning to act but it is too late .
it is just unbelievable surgeons are able to operate like this .
the clinic i went to was a well respected high street outlet , not a back street job .
" but i 've subsequently found out that the operation should have taken two hours and been done under general anaesthetic , not local anaesthetic as i had . "

the ceremony struck the editorialist of the leading french daily le monde with " a feeling of urgency " at the thought that those the paper calls " the direct witnesses ... who can tell us the whole appalling truth " , are dying out .
the memory must be preserved , and the " singularity " of the holocaust asserted , the paper argues , because " every time anyone has deemed it fit to contravene the principles of the un charter and depart from the international order dreamt of in 1945 , there has been a reopening of the door to a possible return to the unimaginable " .
liberation notes that what it calls " europe 's great day of communing in memory of the holocaust " was " marred " by some discordant notes .
" in russia , " the paper notes , " 20 members of parliament signed a violent pamphlet this week demanding a ban on all jewish organizations ... for propagating an ' anti-christian ' religion " .
the memory must be preserved le monde " in germany , " it adds , " the neo-nazi npd also distinguished itself when its representatives in saxony 's regional parliament refused to take part in one minute 's silence in memory of the victims of the holocaust . "
and in the european parliament , the paper goes on , " it took some lively exchanges before a resolution on anti-semitism could be the object of a massive consensus " .
in russia , a commentary in russkiy kuryer notes ironically that " in some respects , we continue to lead the world " .
the paper cites the global forum against anti-semitism which found russia , as it puts it , " one of three countries infected with a hatred of jews " .
speaking at the auschwitz ceremony , it notes , president vladimir putin " availed himself of an excellent opportunity repentantly to declare his shame at the anti-semitic manifestations which still have not been eradicated here " .
' falsification ' a commentary in warsaw 's trybuna welcomes president aleksander kwasniewski 's remark in his speech at the memorial that poland has not forgotten that it was liberated from the nazi occupiers by soviet troops .
" this is worth emphasizing , " the paper believes , " because in our national media the notion of ' liberation ' has been completely ousted by that of ' invasion ' . "
" we hear that one occupation was replaced by another which was no better , " it adds , but this is a " falsification of history " .
" even those with the most vivid imagination , " the paper argues , " would be unable to convince the visitors to auschwitz-birkenau that the soviet soldiers were no different from the ss butchers " .
spain , which supported hitler ... should be very sensitive el periodico barcelona 's el periodico finds " no excuse " for what it sees as spain 's low profile at the auschwitz ceremony , pointing out that the speaker of the spanish parliament found himself rubbing shoulders with heads of state and government , monarchs and prominent royals .
the paper welcomes the tribute to the holocaust victims held on thursday in the madrid parliament , and the fact that it will from now on be an annual event , but it regrets its belatedness .
" it took much too long , " it says , " for a spain which , through franco , supported hitler , to commit itself formally " to marking the anniversary .
" a country that lost 6,000 of its citizens in the concentration camps and sent another 45,000 to fight on the criminals ' side , should be very sensitive to such matters , " it argues .
shared contemplation in germany , die welt sees thursday 's commemoration as an example of what it calls " the europeanization " of the holocaust memory .
the paper suggests that europe is seeking to create a common identity by remembering the mass murder of jews .
a german crime in which many europeans were involved die welt " as a result , it adds , " auschwitz is becoming an emblem not just of nazi crimes but also of a europeanization of national views of history . "
the paper observes that for decades countries in western as well as eastern europe failed to acknowledge the scale of their collaboration with the german occupiers .
" ' auschwitz denotes a german crime in which many europeans were involved , " it points out .
as the paper sees it , this does not relieve germany of its historic guilt , but it does mean that responsibility is shared .
the way the swiss le temps was struck by the ceremony would appear to justify this thesis .
" the dead -lsb- of auschwitz -rsb- , " the paper says , " have brought the living together in shared contemplation " .
" these living , " it adds , " are a europe united as it has never been before by the memory of its self-inflicted evil . "
' time of deepest shame ' germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung expects the nazi era to continue to inform the germans ' self-image for the foreseeable future .
the paper argues that the outrage of a " vast majority " when faced with today 's activities by far-right extremists , suggests that " it is still true that nothing moves this country more than the time of its deepest shame " .
it adds that the willingness of tens of thousands of germans to murder millions of people for being jews , roma , russians or dissidents " is beyond anybody 's understanding and therefore beyond any explanation " .
and the attempt to punish the perpetrators in german courts , the paper adds , led to the " frightening realisation " that most of them were " ordinary people " rather than " sadist monsters , compulsive criminals or half-wits " .
" all germans who seriously think about themselves and their country will continue to be haunted by this " , it believes .
the european press review is compiled by bbc monitoring from internet editions of the main european newspapers and some early printed editions .

the ceremony struck the editorialist of the leading french daily le monde with " a feeling of urgency " at the thought that those the paper calls " the direct witnesses ... who can tell us the whole appalling truth " , are dying out .
the memory must be preserved , and the " singularity " of the holocaust asserted , the paper argues , because " every time anyone has deemed it fit to contravene the principles of the un charter and depart from the international order dreamt of in 1945 , there has been a reopening of the door to a possible return to the unimaginable " .
liberation notes that what it calls " europe 's great day of communing in memory of the holocaust " was " marred " by some discordant notes .
" in russia , " the paper notes , " 20 members of parliament signed a violent pamphlet this week demanding a ban on all jewish organizations ... for propagating an ' anti-christian ' religion " .
the memory must be preserved le monde " in germany , " it adds , " the neo-nazi npd also distinguished itself when its representatives in saxony 's regional parliament refused to take part in one minute 's silence in memory of the victims of the holocaust . "
and in the european parliament , the paper goes on , " it took some lively exchanges before a resolution on anti-semitism could be the object of a massive consensus " .
in russia , a commentary in russkiy kuryer notes ironically that " in some respects , we continue to lead the world " .
the paper cites the global forum against anti-semitism which found russia , as it puts it , " one of three countries infected with a hatred of jews " .
speaking at the auschwitz ceremony , it notes , president vladimir putin " availed himself of an excellent opportunity repentantly to declare his shame at the anti-semitic manifestations which still have not been eradicated here " .
' falsification ' a commentary in warsaw 's trybuna welcomes president aleksander kwasniewski 's remark in his speech at the memorial that poland has not forgotten that it was liberated from the nazi occupiers by soviet troops .
" this is worth emphasizing , " the paper believes , " because in our national media the notion of ' liberation ' has been completely ousted by that of ' invasion ' . "
" we hear that one occupation was replaced by another which was no better , " it adds , but this is a " falsification of history " .
" even those with the most vivid imagination , " the paper argues , " would be unable to convince the visitors to auschwitz-birkenau that the soviet soldiers were no different from the ss butchers " .
spain , which supported hitler ... should be very sensitive el periodico barcelona 's el periodico finds " no excuse " for what it sees as spain 's low profile at the auschwitz ceremony , pointing out that the speaker of the spanish parliament found himself rubbing shoulders with heads of state and government , monarchs and prominent royals .
the paper welcomes the tribute to the holocaust victims held on thursday in the madrid parliament , and the fact that it will from now on be an annual event , but it regrets its belatedness .
" it took much too long , " it says , " for a spain which , through franco , supported hitler , to commit itself formally " to marking the anniversary .
" a country that lost 6,000 of its citizens in the concentration camps and sent another 45,000 to fight on the criminals ' side , should be very sensitive to such matters , " it argues .
shared contemplation in germany , die welt sees thursday 's commemoration as an example of what it calls " the europeanization " of the holocaust memory .
the paper suggests that europe is seeking to create a common identity by remembering the mass murder of jews .
a german crime in which many europeans were involved die welt " as a result , it adds , " auschwitz is becoming an emblem not just of nazi crimes but also of a europeanization of national views of history . "
the paper observes that for decades countries in western as well as eastern europe failed to acknowledge the scale of their collaboration with the german occupiers .
" ' auschwitz denotes a german crime in which many europeans were involved , " it points out .
as the paper sees it , this does not relieve germany of its historic guilt , but it does mean that responsibility is shared .
the way the swiss le temps was struck by the ceremony would appear to justify this thesis .
" the dead -lsb- of auschwitz -rsb- , " the paper says , " have brought the living together in shared contemplation " .
" these living , " it adds , " are a europe united as it has never been before by the memory of its self-inflicted evil . "
' time of deepest shame ' germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung expects the nazi era to continue to inform the germans ' self-image for the foreseeable future .
the paper argues that the outrage of a " vast majority " when faced with today 's activities by far-right extremists , suggests that " it is still true that nothing moves this country more than the time of its deepest shame " .
it adds that the willingness of tens of thousands of germans to murder millions of people for being jews , roma , russians or dissidents " is beyond anybody 's understanding and therefore beyond any explanation " .
and the attempt to punish the perpetrators in german courts , the paper adds , led to the " frightening realisation " that most of them were " ordinary people " rather than " sadist monsters , compulsive criminals or half-wits " .
" all germans who seriously think about themselves and their country will continue to be haunted by this " , it believes .
the european press review is compiled by bbc monitoring from internet editions of the main european newspapers and some early printed editions .

it adds that the willingness of tens of thousands of germans to murder millions of people for being jews , roma , russians or dissidents " is beyond anybody 's understanding and therefore beyond any explanation " .

the ceremony struck the editorialist of the leading french daily le monde with " a feeling of urgency " at the thought that those the paper calls " the direct witnesses ... who can tell us the whole appalling truth " , are dying out .
the memory must be preserved , and the " singularity " of the holocaust asserted , the paper argues , because " every time anyone has deemed it fit to contravene the principles of the un charter and depart from the international order dreamt of in 1945 , there has been a reopening of the door to a possible return to the unimaginable " .
liberation notes that what it calls " europe 's great day of communing in memory of the holocaust " was " marred " by some discordant notes .
" in russia , " the paper notes , " 20 members of parliament signed a violent pamphlet this week demanding a ban on all jewish organizations ... for propagating an ' anti-christian ' religion " . "
the memory must be preserved " le monde " in germany , " it adds , " the neo-nazi npd also distinguished itself when its representatives in saxony 's regional parliament refused to take part in one minute 's silence in memory of the victims of the holocaust . "
and in the european parliament , the paper goes on , " it took some lively exchanges before a resolution on anti-semitism could be the object of a massive consensus " .
in russia , a commentary in russkiy kuryer notes ironically that " in some respects , we continue to lead the world " .
the paper cites the global forum against anti-semitism which found russia , as it puts it , " one of three countries infected with a hatred of jews " .
speaking at the auschwitz ceremony , it notes , president vladimir putin " availed himself of an excellent opportunity repentantly to declare his shame at the anti-semitic manifestations which still have not been eradicated here " .
' falsification ' a commentary in warsaw 's trybuna welcomes president aleksander kwasniewski 's remark in his speech at the memorial that poland has not forgotten that it was liberated from the nazi occupiers by soviet troops .
" this is worth emphasizing , " the paper believes , " because in our national media the notion of ' liberation ' has been completely ousted by that of ' invasion ' . "
" we hear that one occupation was replaced by another which was no better , " it adds , but this is a " falsification of history " .
" even those with the most vivid imagination , " the paper argues , " would be unable to convince the visitors to auschwitz-birkenau that the soviet soldiers were no different from the ss butchers " . "
spain , which supported hitler ... should be very sensitive " el periodico barcelona 's el periodico finds " no excuse " for what it sees as spain 's low profile at the auschwitz ceremony , pointing out that the speaker of the spanish parliament found himself rubbing shoulders with heads of state and government , monarchs and prominent royals .
the paper welcomes the tribute to the holocaust victims held on thursday in the madrid parliament , and the fact that it will from now on be an annual event , but it regrets its belatedness .
" it took much too long , " it says , " for a spain which , through franco , supported hitler , to commit itself formally " to marking the anniversary .
" a country that lost 6,000 of its citizens in the concentration camps and sent another 45,000 to fight on the criminals ' side , should be very sensitive to such matters , " it argues .
shared contemplation in germany , die welt sees thursday 's commemoration as an example of what it calls " the europeanization " of the holocaust memory .
the paper suggests that europe is seeking to create a common identity by remembering the mass murder of jews . "
a german crime in which many europeans were involved " die welt " as a result , it adds , " auschwitz is becoming an emblem not just of nazi crimes but also of a europeanization of national views of history . "
the paper observes that for decades countries in western as well as eastern europe failed to acknowledge the scale of their collaboration with the german occupiers .
" ' auschwitz denotes a german crime in which many europeans were involved , " it points out .
as the paper sees it , this does not relieve germany of its historic guilt , but it does mean that responsibility is shared .
the way the swiss le temps was struck by the ceremony would appear to justify this thesis .
" the dead -lsb- of auschwitz -rsb- , " the paper says , " have brought the living together in shared contemplation " .
" these living , " it adds , " are a europe united as it has never been before by the memory of its self-inflicted evil . "
' time of deepest shame ' germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung expects the nazi era to continue to inform the germans ' self-image for the foreseeable future .
the paper argues that the outrage of a " vast majority " when faced with today 's activities by far-right extremists , suggests that " it is still true that nothing moves this country more than the time of its deepest shame " .
it adds that the willingness of tens of thousands of germans to murder millions of people for being jews , roma , russians or dissidents " is beyond anybody 's understanding and therefore beyond any explanation " .

thousands gathered in heavy snow next to the site of the german gas chambers , where jews and others were murdered .
" it seems as if we can still hear the dead crying out , " israeli president moshe katsav told the crowd .
" when i walk the ground of the concentration camps , i fear that i am walking on the ashes of the victims . "
history of auschwitz construction began in 1940 on site which grew to 40 sq km -lrb- 15 sq mile -rrb- at least 1.1 million deaths , one million of them jewish other victims included poles , roma -lrb- gypsies -rrb- , soviet pows , homosexuals , disabled people and dissidents of 7,000 nazi guards , 750 were prosecuted and punished after the war on this day : auschwitz liberated european press round-up the nazi regime murdered six million jews and many others during what became known as the holocaust .
auschwitz , the largest of the nazi camps , where 1.1 million people died , was liberated by the advancing soviet army on 27 january 1945 .
expressing fears over a resurgence in anti-semitism in europe , mr katsav questioned whether the memory of the holocaust had lost its power to deter attacks and insults against jews .
" the answer is in the hands of europe 's leaders , it is in the hands of the educators and the historians , " he said .
some of the elderly survivors sat wrapped in blankets against the driving snow for up to two hours before the ceremony began .
some wore tags displaying their prison number - numbers that are still tattooed on their bodies .
" i 'm number 4662 , " said one elderly woman .
" we had no names here , and i have a hard time calling myself with my real name here .
it 's too painful . "
german pledge polish president aleksander kwasniewski and russian president vladimir putin addressed the crowd .
but german president horst koehler remained silent , in recognition of germany 's role as perpetrator of the holocaust . "
the snow was falling like today .
we were dressed in stripes and some of us had bare feet " kazimierz orlowski auschwitz survivor anniversary in quotes touring the camp with survivors before the ceremony , he said : " we have the duty to ensure that something like this never happens again - and we germans in particular . "
as the light began to fade , the jewish prayer for the dead , the kaddish was sung .
it was followed by christian prayers - roman catholic , orthodox and protestant .
then , former inmates and veterans of the soviet red army led a candle-lighting ceremony to remember the dead .
flames were lit along the railway tracks and the evocative sounds of a whistle , a stopping train , and a door being flung open , were played over loud-speakers .
other world figures at the ceremony included us vice-president dick cheney and uk foreign secretary jack straw .
in the nearby polish city of krakow , before the ceremony in auschwitz , mr putin spoke out against anti-semitism and admitted that it was a problem in his country .
" even in our country , in russia , which did more than any to combat fascism , for the victory over fascism , which did most to save the jewish people , even in our country we sometimes unfortunately see manifestations of this problem and i , too , am ashamed of that , " he said .
french president jacques chirac , opening an exhibit in honour of french victims , said his country must bear its responsibility for the deportation of jews from nazi-occupied france .
in the german capital , berlin , parliament held a special ceremony including an address by a german-jewish camp survivor , arno lustiger , and the readings of poems by a man murdered in auschwitz .

some of the elderly survivors sat wrapped in blankets against the driving snow for up to two hours before the ceremony began .
some wore tags displaying their prison number - numbers that are still tattooed on their bodies .
" i 'm number 4662 , " said one elderly woman .
" we had no names here , and i have a hard time calling myself with my real name here .
it 's too painful . "
german pledge polish president aleksander kwasniewski and russian president vladimir putin addressed the crowd .
but german president horst koehler remained silent , in recognition of germany 's role as perpetrator of the holocaust .
the snow was falling like today .
we were dressed in stripes and some of us had bare feet kazimierz orlowski auschwitz survivor anniversary in quotes touring the camp with survivors before the ceremony , he said : " we have the duty to ensure that something like this never happens again - and we germans in particular . "
as the light began to fade , the jewish prayer for the dead , the kaddish was sung .
it was followed by christian prayers - roman catholic , orthodox and protestant .
then , former inmates and veterans of the soviet red army led a candle-lighting ceremony to remember the dead .
flames were lit along the railway tracks and the evocative sounds of a whistle , a stopping train , and a door being flung open , were played over loud-speakers .

in the nearby polish city of krakow , before the ceremony in auschwitz , mr putin spoke out against anti-semitism and admitted that it was a problem in his country .
" even in our country , in russia , which did more than any to combat fascism , for the victory over fascism , which did most to save the jewish people , even in our country we sometimes unfortunately see manifestations of this problem and i , too , am ashamed of that , " he said .
french president jacques chirac , opening an exhibit in honour of french victims , said his country must bear its responsibility for the deportation of jews from nazi-occupied france .
in the german capital , berlin , parliament held a special ceremony including an address by a german-jewish camp survivor , arno lustiger , and the readings of poems by a man murdered in auschwitz .

doreen harley 's daughter lisa browne died aged 27 in january 1998 after she was startled by her alarm clock .
members of mrs harley 's family were later found to have the rare hereditary heart complaint long qt syndrome .
mrs harley is launching a postcard in north wales for the charity cardiac risk in the young -lrb- cry -rrb- .
the charity 's uk-wide campaign aims to reduce sudden death from heart conditions in young people under the age of 35 by raising awareness .
we were told they could n't find anything wrong and that lisa should still be alive doreen harley the postcard shows eight young people in wales who have died suddenly of a previously undiagnosed heart complaint .
according to the charity , that number of young people die suddenly each week in the uk from heart conditions .
mrs harley , of connah 's quay , flintshire , said her daughter , a nurse , had no previous history of heart complaints before she died suddenly .
mrs harley said : " she was woken by the alarm and put out her arm to switch it off .
" that is how she was found , with her arm resting on the alarm clock .
" at the post mortem examination , we were told they could n't find anything wrong and that lisa should still be alive .
" an inquest returned an open verdict and said that the cause of death was unascertainable . "

mrs harley said : " we were screened at st george 's hospital in london in 1999 .

" my surviving daughter , rachel , and her children jack and adam have also since been screened .
" both rachel and jack have been diagnosed with long qt syndrome , and adam is still awaiting dna test results . "
long qt syndrome centres on the length of time it takes the heart 's electrical system to recharge following a heartbeat - known as the qt interval .
doreen harley wants a uk-wide cardiac screening programme people who have a long qt interval are vulnerable to a fast , abnormal heart rhythm .
when this occurs , no blood is pumped out from the heart and the brain becomes deprived of blood causing loss of consciousness and sudden death .
those at risk can be treated either with drugs or with an implantable defibrillator -lrb- icd -rrb- which will shock the heart into action during cardiac arrest .
mrs harley added that the members of her family with the condition were receiving treatment and said she wants to raise awareness of the cardiac conditions that can cause sudden death .
' blacked out ' she added : " rachel had shown some symptoms , so she had an icd fitted .
" it saved her life when adam woke up screaming one night .
" she blacked out , but the icd kicked in brought her back around .
" until someone has lost a child , they ca n't understand the heartache it causes a family .
" it is unknown how many young people die of undiagnosed cardiac conditions because many are counted as natural causes , epilepsy or as unascertainable .

as a result , lorries were parked on the m20 heading into the town waiting for the ferries to begin sailing again .

egyptian-born mr habib flew home to sydney on friday and was immediately allowed to join his family .
australian foreign minister alexander downer said he was unlikely to face any charges .
another australian , david hicks , is still being held at guantanamo bay , where he is facing criminal charges .
four british men were returned home earlier this week , and were also released , after being questioned by police .

the bodies of 21 chinese cockle pickers were recovered after they drowned in fast moving tides at hest bank in morecambe bay in february 2004 .
the walney island team was awarded the coastguard wreck shield on thursday .
teams in knott end , bootle , morecambe bay , millon and arnside have already received similar awards for their work .
' traumatic time ' so far 21 bodies have been recovered , but police believe a total of 23 chinese workers died in the tragedy .
the cocklers were caught by rising tides at hest bank .
davy thompson , area operations manager , search and rescue for north west england and north wales , said the award was to recognise the input of the staff .
" the reason was to acknowledge the efforts and the contribution of the teams during a very traumatic incident , " he told bbc news .
" some of our staff found the incident very traumatic , due to the number of fatalities , and they are conscious themselves that it should n't be turned into a celebration . "
he said the shield was given to the teams with " a degree of sadness . "
