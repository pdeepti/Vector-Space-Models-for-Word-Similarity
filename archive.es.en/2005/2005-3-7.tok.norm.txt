program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.03.2005 eu moves to renew battered fiscal rules großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shine 's come off the pact underpinning the euro the eu hopes to hammer out the main points of a revised budget rule book this week , 16 months after the pact meant to protect the euro was left in tatters by eu heavyweight states bent on reviving their ailing economies . eu finance ministers meet from monday evening striving to agree on amendments to the stability and growth pact , the set of fiscal rules underpinning europe 's single currency the euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's jean asselborn is currently head of the eu 's rotating presidency .
the eu 's current luxembourg presidency hopes the two-day ministerial talks will pave the way for final agreement at an eu summit in brussels on march 22-23 .
" the plan is to get as close as possible to an agreement , " said a luxembourg diplomat , adding that the eu leadership would circulate a document proposing a basis for discussion by ministers . the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement of the rule book .
the pact notably stipulates that members of the 12-nation euro-zone must not run public deficits in excess of three percent of gdp . since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had for years submitted wrong data . reform without threatening recovery now the eu - still struggling to emerge from a prolonged economic slowdown - is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten recovery .
to this end the revised pact is expected to allow more flexibility for countries to run bigger deficits during slowdowns , so long as they make up the difference when growth returns . key to the amendments is the so-called " excessive deficit procedure , " triggered when a country 's accounts run too far into the red , allowing a series of warnings and ultimately the threat of huge fines .
" the main outstanding point is the question of triggering the excessive deficit procedure , " said one eu source . eu heavyweights led by germany in particular insist that the procedure should not be initiated automatically when deficit slips above three percent of gdp but should take into account a range of other factors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking a bite at the euro : german finance minister hans eichel " a really central criterion for us is how the economy is developing , " said german finance minister hans eichel .
" in order to reduce debt , both things are needed together - strict fiscal policy and growth . " italian prime minister silvio berlusconi warned friday that rome will veto any system that is not sufficiently flexible .
in particular he wants certain expenses , notably spending on infrastructure , to be excluded from deficit sums .
" i will fight at the march eu -lrb- summit -rrb- to change the parameters set by the stability pact .
without modification i am ready to block things , " he said . " credibility needs to be preserved " eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia , tasked with policing the pact , warned last week against " introducing uncertainty into the decision about the existence or otherwise of an excessive deficit . " european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- chief jean-claude trichet echoed that point thursday .
" the credibility of the excessive deficit procedure needs to be fully preserved , " he said .
" this is not only fundamental for macroeconomic stability and cohesion in the euro area but also for confidence and growth prospects in all member states . " the 12 euro zone ministers will meet on monday , while ministers from all 25 eu member states will meet tuesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de does europe need stability or flexibility ?

the eu 's current luxembourg presidency hopes the two-day ministerial talks will pave the way for final agreement at an eu summit in brussels on march 22-23 .
" the plan is to get as close as possible to an agreement , " said a luxembourg diplomat , adding that the eu leadership would circulate a document proposing a basis for discussion by ministers . the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement of the rule book .
the pact notably stipulates that members of the 12-nation euro-zone must not run public deficits in excess of three percent of gdp . since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had for years submitted wrong data . reform without threatening recovery now the eu - still struggling to emerge from a prolonged economic slowdown - is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten recovery .
to this end the revised pact is expected to allow more flexibility for countries to run bigger deficits during slowdowns , so long as they make up the difference when growth returns . key to the amendments is the so-called " excessive deficit procedure , " triggered when a country 's accounts run too far into the red , allowing a series of warnings and ultimately the threat of huge fines .
" the main outstanding point is the question of triggering the excessive deficit procedure , " said one eu source . eu heavyweights led by germany in particular insist that the procedure should not be initiated automatically when deficit slips above three percent of gdp but should take into account a range of other factors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking a bite at the euro : german finance minister hans eichel " a really central criterion for us is how the economy is developing , " said german finance minister hans eichel .
" in order to reduce debt , both things are needed together - strict fiscal policy and growth . " italian prime minister silvio berlusconi warned friday that rome will veto any system that is not sufficiently flexible .
in particular he wants certain expenses , notably spending on infrastructure , to be excluded from deficit sums .
" i will fight at the march eu -lrb- summit -rrb- to change the parameters set by the stability pact .
without modification i am ready to block things , " he said . " credibility needs to be preserved " eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia , tasked with policing the pact , warned last week against " introducing uncertainty into the decision about the existence or otherwise of an excessive deficit . " european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- chief jean-claude trichet echoed that point thursday .
" the credibility of the excessive deficit procedure needs to be fully preserved , " he said .

the lse had twice rejected informal offers from deutsche börse at that price . in the statement , the deutsche börse chief added that after withdrawing its offer , the company would make " a significant distribution of funds " to its investors , " in a move to pacify those involved with the major shareholder revolt which prompted the withdrawal . börse still believes in consolidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chairman of the board of german stock exchange , deutsche börse ag , werner g. seifert .
" we recognize that a significant portion of our shareholder base is focused on return of capital in the short term , " seifert said .
" we continue to believe that shareholders , issuers , investors and intermediaries would all benefit from consolidation of the european exchange landscape as contemplated in our proposal . " " however , " he continued , " the london stock exchange does not find itself in a position to recommend a transaction at a price we find supportable . " seifert added that despite this , deutsche börse reserved the right to make another offer if any other company makes a bid for the venerable lse . dissident shareholders issued warning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in february , two dissident shareholders went public with fears that deutsche börse would pay over the asking price for the lse and argued that the company should return around € 726 million -lrb- $ 961 million -rrb- of its cash to shareholders . they warned deutsche börse that the majority of investors opposed the bid for the london market and could take action to oust its supervisory board at the next shareholder meeting in may . porsche , the german car maker , became the first big company on the german exchange to publicly express opposition to the takeover bid last week as opposition grew . rival records share price leap euronext , the pan-european stock market operator , which is also continuing talks with the lse , sees synergies worth € 203 million from a merger . the amount was twice that of its german rival deutsche börse , which predicted synergies of € 100 million from 2008 if it won the battle to acquire the lse . euronext shareholders were said by sources to be " particularly interested " in the projected financial advantages of the deal .
the company operates the exchanges in paris , amsterdam , brussels and lisbon . the price of shares in euronext rose by 9.16 percent in early dealing on monday .
shares in euronext gained 9.16 percent to 31.10 euros .
the overall paris stock market , which euronext operates and where it is quoted , was showing a slight gain of 0.16 percent to 4,097.84 points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- building in paternoster square , london .

the eu 's current luxembourg presidency hopes the two-day ministerial talks will pave the way for final agreement at an eu summit in brussels on march 22-23 .
" the plan is to get as close as possible to an agreement , " said a luxembourg diplomat , adding that the eu leadership would circulate a document proposing a basis for discussion by ministers . the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement of the rule book .
the pact notably stipulates that members of the 12-nation euro-zone must not run public deficits in excess of three percent of gdp . since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had for years submitted wrong data . reform without threatening recovery now the eu - still struggling to emerge from a prolonged economic slowdown - is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten recovery .
to this end the revised pact is expected to allow more flexibility for countries to run bigger deficits during slowdowns , so long as they make up the difference when growth returns . key to the amendments is the so-called " excessive deficit procedure , " triggered when a country 's accounts run too far into the red , allowing a series of warnings and ultimately the threat of huge fines .
" the main outstanding point is the question of triggering the excessive deficit procedure , " said one eu source . eu heavyweights led by germany in particular insist that the procedure should not be initiated automatically when deficit slips above three percent of gdp but should take into account a range of other factors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking a bite at the euro : german finance minister hans eichel " a really central criterion for us is how the economy is developing , " said german finance minister hans eichel .
" in order to reduce debt , both things are needed together - strict fiscal policy and growth . " italian prime minister silvio berlusconi warned friday that rome will veto any system that is not sufficiently flexible .
in particular he wants certain expenses , notably spending on infrastructure , to be excluded from deficit sums .
" i will fight at the march eu -lrb- summit -rrb- to change the parameters set by the stability pact .
without modification i am ready to block things , " he said . " credibility needs to be preserved " eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia , tasked with policing the pact , warned last week against " introducing uncertainty into the decision about the existence or otherwise of an excessive deficit . " european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- chief jean-claude trichet echoed that point thursday .
" the credibility of the excessive deficit procedure needs to be fully preserved , " he said .
" this is not only fundamental for macroeconomic stability and cohesion in the euro area but also for confidence and growth prospects in all member states . " the 12 euro zone ministers will meet on monday , while ministers from all 25 eu member states will meet tuesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de does europe need stability or flexibility ?

the informal talks come ahead of an eu summit in two weeks time . the german chancellor and french president were at pains to demonstrate the strength of their ties , and the informal meeting in the state of north-rhine westphalia has been billed as a new landmark in their relations . topping the agenda was the european union 's growth and stability pact , which both leaders have criticized as inflexible .
germany and france have been threatened with punitive measures for allowing their public deficits to exceed eu guidelines .
speaking after their talks , the schröder and chirac stressed that the pact must be reformed to be take greater account of growth . chirac said sanctions should not be automatically triggered when the pact 's guidelines are exceeded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two leaders want to change the stability pact guidelines warning against " technocratic brutality , " chirac said the pact " must not be purely technocratic , it must be political , " and added that " each country has its own different characteristics . " under the pact , euro-zone countries are not allowed to run public deficits beyond 3 percent of their gross domestic product , however , in 2004 both france and germany were in breach of the restrictions .
but chancellor schröder has said he 's confident that changes will be made to the stability pact at the next eu leader 's summit to be held later this month . support for lebanon the leaders also discussed developments in the middle east , in particular recent events in lebanon .
in a joint declaration after their talks in germany , they demanded " free and transparent elections which would allow the lebanese people to determine their democratic future . " their call came as damascus announced that syrian troops in lebanon would pull back towards the eastern bekaa valley by the end of march , a move seen as falling short of international demands .
syria has been under intense diplomatic pressure to end its political and military grip on lebanon three decades after it sent in troops shortly after the start of lebanon 's devastating civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder was greeted by schoolchildren schröder and chirac , who consider their alliance the engine of european union integration , called on syria to make " a full withdrawal of its troops and services from lebanon as quickly as possible . " they reaffirmed their " commitment to lebanon 's independence , sovereignty and democracy " and said their countries were ready to help if needed .
" we will remain vigilant concerning the timetable for the steps to come and , like all the international community , we remain mobilized , " their declaration said . increased pressure on iran the two men also called on iran to forgo developing nuclear weapons . " the iranian government must agree to do without the production and possession of nuclear weapons and to use the nuclear program exclusively for peaceful means , " schröder said after the talks with chirac . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac demonstrated unity the aim of negotiations was " also to illicit objective guarantees , " a french-german position that britain also supports , schröder added .
both germany and france were under the impression that the us government backed their efforts , he said . chirac said he was in full agreement with schröder .
" i could have issued the same statement as the chancellor , " chirac said after the german leader finished speaking . the two men will meet again on march 18 in paris , where they will be joined by russian president vladimir putin and spanish prime minister jose luis zapatero . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu moves to renew battered fiscal rules the eu hopes to hammer out the main points of a revised budget rule book this week , 16 months after the pact meant to protect the euro was left in tatters by eu heavyweight states bent on reviving their ailing economies .

the informal talks come ahead of an eu summit in two weeks time . the german chancellor and french president were at pains to demonstrate the strength of their ties , and the informal meeting in the state of north-rhine westphalia has been billed as a new landmark in their relations . topping the agenda was the european union 's growth and stability pact , which both leaders have criticized as inflexible .
germany and france have been threatened with punitive measures for allowing their public deficits to exceed eu guidelines .
speaking after their talks , the schröder and chirac stressed that the pact must be reformed to be take greater account of growth . chirac said sanctions should not be automatically triggered when the pact 's guidelines are exceeded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two leaders want to change the stability pact guidelines warning against " technocratic brutality , " chirac said the pact " must not be purely technocratic , it must be political , " and added that " each country has its own different characteristics . " under the pact , euro-zone countries are not allowed to run public deficits beyond 3 percent of their gross domestic product , however , in 2004 both france and germany were in breach of the restrictions .
but chancellor schröder has said he 's confident that changes will be made to the stability pact at the next eu leader 's summit to be held later this month . support for lebanon the leaders also discussed developments in the middle east , in particular recent events in lebanon .
in a joint declaration after their talks in germany , they demanded " free and transparent elections which would allow the lebanese people to determine their democratic future . " their call came as damascus announced that syrian troops in lebanon would pull back towards the eastern bekaa valley by the end of march , a move seen as falling short of international demands .
syria has been under intense diplomatic pressure to end its political and military grip on lebanon three decades after it sent in troops shortly after the start of lebanon 's devastating civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder was greeted by schoolchildren schröder and chirac , who consider their alliance the engine of european union integration , called on syria to make " a full withdrawal of its troops and services from lebanon as quickly as possible . " they reaffirmed their " commitment to lebanon 's independence , sovereignty and democracy " and said their countries were ready to help if needed .
" we will remain vigilant concerning the timetable for the steps to come and , like all the international community , we remain mobilized , " their declaration said . increased pressure on iran the two men also called on iran to forgo developing nuclear weapons . " the iranian government must agree to do without the production and possession of nuclear weapons and to use the nuclear program exclusively for peaceful means , " schröder said after the talks with chirac . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac demonstrated unity the aim of negotiations was " also to illicit objective guarantees , " a french-german position that britain also supports , schröder added .
both germany and france were under the impression that the us government backed their efforts , he said . chirac said he was in full agreement with schröder .
" i could have issued the same statement as the chancellor , " chirac said after the german leader finished speaking . the two men will meet again on march 18 in paris , where they will be joined by russian president vladimir putin and spanish prime minister jose luis zapatero . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu moves to renew battered fiscal rules the eu hopes to hammer out the main points of a revised budget rule book this week , 16 months after the pact meant to protect the euro was left in tatters by eu heavyweight states bent on reviving their ailing economies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.03.2005 is turkey losing its reform zeal ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey still has some work to do before eu entry talks get underway with the start of eu accession talks scheduled for later this year , turkey 's critics say its reform zest appears to be waning .
but could it simply be a case that the drone of domestic politics has taken over ? when eu expansion commissioner olli rehn and eu council president jean asselborn arrive in ankara for talks with the turkish foreign minister abdulla gul on monday , it is likely to be under a cloud of some tension .
in the past few weeks a number of incidences have collectively led critics to suggest that turkey 's reform movement has begun to lose momentum . at the end of last year , the picture was quite different .
in the months leading up to the decision on eu entry negotiations , the parliament under prime minister tayyip erdogan passed one reform after another in a flurry of law-making activity .
it was a means to an end , and on dec .
17 last year , the european council gave the green light for entry talks to begin .
it was something of a victory for erdogan . running out of steam ? critics are now loudly questioning the lack of continued activity on turkey 's reform map , and asking whether erdogan simply ran out of steam .
one sign of such is that the turkish prime minister has not yet named a head negotiator for the entry talks even though expansion commissioner olli rehn is arriving in ankara on monday .
it 's a point of some contention in turkey , with even the turkish president ahmet necdet yezer calling on the prime minister to name someone for the post . bildunterschrift : accession negotiations are scheduled for october luxembourg 's european minister nicolas schmidt and the eu ambassador in ankara , the german diplomat hansjörg kretschmer have both criticized turkey 's slowing progress , enraging the turkish government as a result . but professor udo steinbach , director of the german orient institute in hamburg said he believed the evidence being bandied about as proof of turkey 's ebbing commitment to reform can not be used as such , and blames the media for exaggerating the situation . steinbach said that the considerable pressure to get the reform ball rolling ahead of dec .

he said that turkey has simply shifted its attention back to the daily grind of domestic political life . a long path to reform nobody argues that turkey does n't still have a long way to go , and on monday , the eu enlargement commissioner is expected to press ankara to initial an agreement to extend its customs union to the 10 new eu member states , including cyprus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish parliament in ankara originally ankara was supposed to have signed up by the end of february .
but for erdogan the signature is incredibly delicate , as it could be interpreted as recognition of cyprus , which could lead to internal political difficulties .
on the other hand , the eu made it perfectly clear that if turkey does not sign the politically sensitive protocol , there will be no accession talks come october . a further problem is the conflict between turkey and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
last december , the imf agreed to a three year aid program to the tune of more than € 10 billion -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- but turkey has not yet made good on the economic reform it pledged in return for the financial package . steinbach said that in light of the tense situation , monday 's eu delegation visit is not without significance .
he said he believed the most critical point on the agenda is the cyprus problem , but added the responsibility does not only lay with turkey , but also with greece . samira lazarovic -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatives to huddle to block turkey 's eu bid germany 's opposition conservatives are looking to france for support in their bid to dash turkey 's eu hopes by inviting french conservative economics minister sarkozy for talks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.03.2005 eu moves to renew battered fiscal rules großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shine 's come off the pact underpinning the euro the eu hopes to hammer out the main points of a revised budget rule book this week , 16 months after the pact meant to protect the euro was left in tatters by eu heavyweight states bent on reviving their ailing economies . eu finance ministers meet from monday evening striving to agree on amendments to the stability and growth pact , the set of fiscal rules underpinning europe 's single currency the euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's jean asselborn is currently head of the eu 's rotating presidency .
the eu 's current luxembourg presidency hopes the two-day ministerial talks will pave the way for final agreement at an eu summit in brussels on march 22-23 .
" the plan is to get as close as possible to an agreement , " said a luxembourg diplomat , adding that the eu leadership would circulate a document proposing a basis for discussion by ministers . the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement of the rule book .
the pact notably stipulates that members of the 12-nation euro-zone must not run public deficits in excess of three percent of gdp . since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had for years submitted wrong data . reform without threatening recovery now the eu - still struggling to emerge from a prolonged economic slowdown - is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten recovery .
to this end the revised pact is expected to allow more flexibility for countries to run bigger deficits during slowdowns , so long as they make up the difference when growth returns . key to the amendments is the so-called " excessive deficit procedure , " triggered when a country 's accounts run too far into the red , allowing a series of warnings and ultimately the threat of huge fines .
" the main outstanding point is the question of triggering the excessive deficit procedure , " said one eu source . eu heavyweights led by germany in particular insist that the procedure should not be initiated automatically when deficit slips above three percent of gdp but should take into account a range of other factors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking a bite at the euro : german finance minister hans eichel " a really central criterion for us is how the economy is developing , " said german finance minister hans eichel .
" in order to reduce debt , both things are needed together - strict fiscal policy and growth . " italian prime minister silvio berlusconi warned friday that rome will veto any system that is not sufficiently flexible .
in particular he wants certain expenses , notably spending on infrastructure , to be excluded from deficit sums .
" i will fight at the march eu -lrb- summit -rrb- to change the parameters set by the stability pact .
without modification i am ready to block things , " he said . " credibility needs to be preserved " eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia , tasked with policing the pact , warned last week against " introducing uncertainty into the decision about the existence or otherwise of an excessive deficit . " european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- chief jean-claude trichet echoed that point thursday .
" the credibility of the excessive deficit procedure needs to be fully preserved , " he said .
" this is not only fundamental for macroeconomic stability and cohesion in the euro area but also for confidence and growth prospects in all member states . " the 12 euro zone ministers will meet on monday , while ministers from all 25 eu member states will meet tuesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de does europe need stability or flexibility ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.03.2005 is turkey losing its reform zeal ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey still has some work to do before eu entry talks get underway with the start of eu accession talks scheduled for later this year , turkey 's critics say its reform zest appears to be waning .
but could it simply be a case that the drone of domestic politics has taken over ? when eu expansion commissioner olli rehn and eu council president jean asselborn arrive in ankara for talks with the turkish foreign minister abdulla gul on monday , it is likely to be under a cloud of some tension .
in the past few weeks a number of incidences have collectively led critics to suggest that turkey 's reform movement has begun to lose momentum . at the end of last year , the picture was quite different .
in the months leading up to the decision on eu entry negotiations , the parliament under prime minister tayyip erdogan passed one reform after another in a flurry of law-making activity .
it was a means to an end , and on dec .
17 last year , the european council gave the green light for entry talks to begin .
it was something of a victory for erdogan . running out of steam ? critics are now loudly questioning the lack of continued activity on turkey 's reform map , and asking whether erdogan simply ran out of steam .
one sign of such is that the turkish prime minister has not yet named a head negotiator for the entry talks even though expansion commissioner olli rehn is arriving in ankara on monday .
it 's a point of some contention in turkey , with even the turkish president ahmet necdet yezer calling on the prime minister to name someone for the post . bildunterschrift : accession negotiations are scheduled for october luxembourg 's european minister nicolas schmidt and the eu ambassador in ankara , the german diplomat hansjörg kretschmer have both criticized turkey 's slowing progress , enraging the turkish government as a result . but professor udo steinbach , director of the german orient institute in hamburg said he believed the evidence being bandied about as proof of turkey 's ebbing commitment to reform can not be used as such , and blames the media for exaggerating the situation . steinbach said that the considerable pressure to get the reform ball rolling ahead of dec .
17 may have eased off , but that is not to say that the general level of government interest in entry talks has diminished .
he said that turkey has simply shifted its attention back to the daily grind of domestic political life . a long path to reform nobody argues that turkey does n't still have a long way to go , and on monday , the eu enlargement commissioner is expected to press ankara to initial an agreement to extend its customs union to the 10 new eu member states , including cyprus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish parliament in ankara originally ankara was supposed to have signed up by the end of february .
but for erdogan the signature is incredibly delicate , as it could be interpreted as recognition of cyprus , which could lead to internal political difficulties .
on the other hand , the eu made it perfectly clear that if turkey does not sign the politically sensitive protocol , there will be no accession talks come october . a further problem is the conflict between turkey and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
last december , the imf agreed to a three year aid program to the tune of more than € 10 billion -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- but turkey has not yet made good on the economic reform it pledged in return for the financial package . steinbach said that in light of the tense situation , monday 's eu delegation visit is not without significance .
he said he believed the most critical point on the agenda is the cyprus problem , but added the responsibility does not only lay with turkey , but also with greece . samira lazarovic -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatives to huddle to block turkey 's eu bid germany 's opposition conservatives are looking to france for support in their bid to dash turkey 's eu hopes by inviting french conservative economics minister sarkozy for talks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.03.2005 is turkey losing its reform zeal ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey still has some work to do before eu entry talks get underway with the start of eu accession talks scheduled for later this year , turkey 's critics say its reform zest appears to be waning .
but could it simply be a case that the drone of domestic politics has taken over ? when eu expansion commissioner olli rehn and eu council president jean asselborn arrive in ankara for talks with the turkish foreign minister abdulla gul on monday , it is likely to be under a cloud of some tension .
in the past few weeks a number of incidences have collectively led critics to suggest that turkey 's reform movement has begun to lose momentum . at the end of last year , the picture was quite different .
in the months leading up to the decision on eu entry negotiations , the parliament under prime minister tayyip erdogan passed one reform after another in a flurry of law-making activity .
it was a means to an end , and on dec .
17 last year , the european council gave the green light for entry talks to begin .
it was something of a victory for erdogan . running out of steam ? critics are now loudly questioning the lack of continued activity on turkey 's reform map , and asking whether erdogan simply ran out of steam .
one sign of such is that the turkish prime minister has not yet named a head negotiator for the entry talks even though expansion commissioner olli rehn is arriving in ankara on monday .
it 's a point of some contention in turkey , with even the turkish president ahmet necdet yezer calling on the prime minister to name someone for the post . bildunterschrift : accession negotiations are scheduled for october luxembourg 's european minister nicolas schmidt and the eu ambassador in ankara , the german diplomat hansjörg kretschmer have both criticized turkey 's slowing progress , enraging the turkish government as a result . but professor udo steinbach , director of the german orient institute in hamburg said he believed the evidence being bandied about as proof of turkey 's ebbing commitment to reform can not be used as such , and blames the media for exaggerating the situation . steinbach said that the considerable pressure to get the reform ball rolling ahead of dec .
17 may have eased off , but that is not to say that the general level of government interest in entry talks has diminished .
he said that turkey has simply shifted its attention back to the daily grind of domestic political life . a long path to reform nobody argues that turkey does n't still have a long way to go , and on monday , the eu enlargement commissioner is expected to press ankara to initial an agreement to extend its customs union to the 10 new eu member states , including cyprus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish parliament in ankara originally ankara was supposed to have signed up by the end of february .
but for erdogan the signature is incredibly delicate , as it could be interpreted as recognition of cyprus , which could lead to internal political difficulties .
on the other hand , the eu made it perfectly clear that if turkey does not sign the politically sensitive protocol , there will be no accession talks come october . a further problem is the conflict between turkey and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
last december , the imf agreed to a three year aid program to the tune of more than € 10 billion -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- but turkey has not yet made good on the economic reform it pledged in return for the financial package . steinbach said that in light of the tense situation , monday 's eu delegation visit is not without significance .
he said he believed the most critical point on the agenda is the cyprus problem , but added the responsibility does not only lay with turkey , but also with greece . samira lazarovic -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatives to huddle to block turkey 's eu bid germany 's opposition conservatives are looking to france for support in their bid to dash turkey 's eu hopes by inviting french conservative economics minister sarkozy for talks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.03.2005 is turkey losing its reform zeal ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey still has some work to do before eu entry talks get underway with the start of eu accession talks scheduled for later this year , turkey 's critics say its reform zest appears to be waning .
but could it simply be a case that the drone of domestic politics has taken over ? when eu expansion commissioner olli rehn and eu council president jean asselborn arrive in ankara for talks with the turkish foreign minister abdulla gul on monday , it is likely to be under a cloud of some tension .
in the past few weeks a number of incidences have collectively led critics to suggest that turkey 's reform movement has begun to lose momentum . at the end of last year , the picture was quite different .
in the months leading up to the decision on eu entry negotiations , the parliament under prime minister tayyip erdogan passed one reform after another in a flurry of law-making activity .
it was a means to an end , and on dec .
17 last year , the european council gave the green light for entry talks to begin .
it was something of a victory for erdogan . running out of steam ? critics are now loudly questioning the lack of continued activity on turkey 's reform map , and asking whether erdogan simply ran out of steam .
one sign of such is that the turkish prime minister has not yet named a head negotiator for the entry talks even though expansion commissioner olli rehn is arriving in ankara on monday .
it 's a point of some contention in turkey , with even the turkish president ahmet necdet yezer calling on the prime minister to name someone for the post . bildunterschrift : accession negotiations are scheduled for october luxembourg 's european minister nicolas schmidt and the eu ambassador in ankara , the german diplomat hansjörg kretschmer have both criticized turkey 's slowing progress , enraging the turkish government as a result . but professor udo steinbach , director of the german orient institute in hamburg said he believed the evidence being bandied about as proof of turkey 's ebbing commitment to reform can not be used as such , and blames the media for exaggerating the situation . steinbach said that the considerable pressure to get the reform ball rolling ahead of dec .

eurex 's disciplinary committee would examine the controversial bond trades by citigroup , after an inquiry by the regional stock exchange authorities in the german state of hesse found evidence of breach of trust , hesse economics minister alois rhiel , said in a statement .
rhiel , who is in charge of regulating frankfurt 's financial markets , said the committee could fine the bank or its traders up to € 250,000 -lrb- $ 330,000 -rrb- or impose a 30-day trading ban .
the body normally rules within eight weeks , but it could take longer due to the case 's complexity , he added .
in august , citigroup flooded the cash market with € 11 billion euros in sell orders on euro-zone government bonds , causing rivals to rush to hedge their exposure in the eurex market for german government bonds by selling the futures .
about half an hour later , citigroup allegedly bought back € 4 billion of the bonds at a lower price , raising suspicions of market manipulation .
citigroup allegedly made a profit of around € 17 million on the deal .
citigroup also carried out related trades on the eurex derivatives exchange .

the informal talks come ahead of an eu summit in two weeks time . the german chancellor and french president were at pains to demonstrate the strength of their ties , and the informal meeting in the state of north-rhine westphalia has been billed as a new landmark in their relations . topping the agenda was the european union 's growth and stability pact , which both leaders have criticized as inflexible .
germany and france have been threatened with punitive measures for allowing their public deficits to exceed eu guidelines .
speaking after their talks , the schröder and chirac stressed that the pact must be reformed to be take greater account of growth . chirac said sanctions should not be automatically triggered when the pact 's guidelines are exceeded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two leaders want to change the stability pact guidelines warning against " technocratic brutality , " chirac said the pact " must not be purely technocratic , it must be political , " and added that " each country has its own different characteristics . " under the pact , euro-zone countries are not allowed to run public deficits beyond 3 percent of their gross domestic product , however , in 2004 both france and germany were in breach of the restrictions .
but chancellor schröder has said he 's confident that changes will be made to the stability pact at the next eu leader 's summit to be held later this month . support for lebanon the leaders also discussed developments in the middle east , in particular recent events in lebanon .
in a joint declaration after their talks in germany , they demanded " free and transparent elections which would allow the lebanese people to determine their democratic future . " their call came as damascus announced that syrian troops in lebanon would pull back towards the eastern bekaa valley by the end of march , a move seen as falling short of international demands .
syria has been under intense diplomatic pressure to end its political and military grip on lebanon three decades after it sent in troops shortly after the start of lebanon 's devastating civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder was greeted by schoolchildren schröder and chirac , who consider their alliance the engine of european union integration , called on syria to make " a full withdrawal of its troops and services from lebanon as quickly as possible .

eurex 's disciplinary committee would examine the controversial bond trades by citigroup , after an inquiry by the regional stock exchange authorities in the german state of hesse found evidence of breach of trust , hesse economics minister alois rhiel , said in a statement .
rhiel , who is in charge of regulating frankfurt 's financial markets , said the committee could fine the bank or its traders up to € 250,000 -lrb- $ 330,000 -rrb- or impose a 30-day trading ban .
the body normally rules within eight weeks , but it could take longer due to the case 's complexity , he added .
in august , citigroup flooded the cash market with € 11 billion euros in sell orders on euro-zone government bonds , causing rivals to rush to hedge their exposure in the eurex market for german government bonds by selling the futures .
about half an hour later , citigroup allegedly bought back € 4 billion of the bonds at a lower price , raising suspicions of market manipulation .
citigroup allegedly made a profit of around € 17 million on the deal .
citigroup also carried out related trades on the eurex derivatives exchange .
the german financial market regulator bafin has already asked prosecutors to probe the case and italian regulators are also looking into the trades . dw-world.de deutsche börse withdraws offer for lse the operator of the frankfurt stock exchange , deutsche börse , has withdrawn its offer to buy the london stock exchange -lrb- lse -rrb- , according to company officials .

" it was not a great game by any means , " admitted ballack .
" but we took the points and stay top of the table which is important ahead of the schalke game . " bremen fall seven points behind the pacesetters and must now concentrate on netting third place and the final champions league slot .
thomas schaaf 's double winners traveled to munich on the back of five successive league wins but failed to recover from the early ballack goal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bremen star torsten frings delivered the cross for ballack to kill off the champions .

brazilian marksman ailton scored his 100th bundesliga goal on the half hour to put schalke ahead and compatriot lincoln clinched the spoils . " we were concentrated from the very first minute and i never felt we were in danger , " said schalke handler ralf rangnick .

he is also , according to a new poll in a men 's magazine , germany 's best dressed person . some may argue that being named best dressed person in germany is like winning the most sober person award at a bachelor party - there usually is n't much competition .
however , the winds of change may be about to blow through one of europe 's most fashion unconscious states , thanks to one of its most prominent politicians . in a country where denim vests , white socks and sandals -lrb- worn together -rrb- regularly challenge lederhosen and plumed hats in the national dress stakes , it seems that statemanship chic could be germany 's saving grace . according to the german edition of fitness and style magazine men ’ s health , germany 's best dressed person is none other than federal president and hugo boss enthusiast horst köhler . elegance with dignity the former international monetary fund chief , sworn in as president in 2004 , was nominated by a jury of journalists , advertising executives , and fashion designers for his " combination of elegance with dignity " . the 62-year-old , who serves in a mainly ceremonial role , is germany 's top diplomat and therefore the country 's most respected representative on the global stage .
after the men 's health accolade , he may also become a role model for the sartorially challenged back home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while köhler enjoys the cut of boss suits , the magazine also salutes him for his application of accessories and welcomes the fact that he buys his neckties at clearance sales , a nod to his austere side . a who 's who of german style while köhler topped the charts in the overall best dressed category , actor kai wiesinger took the title in the style section while germany 's own soccer monarch franz beckenbauer snatched the award in the business class section .
designers karl lagerfeld and wolfgang joop , as well as ex-tennis star boris becker and musician marius müller-westerhagen were also marked out among the notable winners . special mentions were also given to chancellor gerhard schröder , hamburg mayor ole von beust and the liberal fdp party chief guido westerwelle as fine role models for others to follow .
oli drops the ball in fashion game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli forgot to change out of his goalkeeper 's shirt in this appearance on german tv show " wetten dass . "
at the other end of the scale , however , things averted to type .
bayern munich goalkeeper oliver kahn was announced as the worst dressed person in germany , a remarkable feat considering the lack of fashion sense displayed by many of his counterparts off the field . kahn , a man with a penchant for garish satin shirts , was joined in the bargain basement of the poll by shabbily-suited bundestag president wolfgang thierse and comedian dirk bach who seems to have a habit of dressing in the darkened changing room of a circus outfitter . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de designer blames recession for fashion faux pas while the rest of germany is busy blaming the economy and the government for all sorts of social woes , the designer jil sander believes the current recession has made a more serious impact - on men 's fashion sense .

" it was not a great game by any means , " admitted ballack .
" but we took the points and stay top of the table which is important ahead of the schalke game . " bremen fall seven points behind the pacesetters and must now concentrate on netting third place and the final champions league slot .
thomas schaaf 's double winners traveled to munich on the back of five successive league wins but failed to recover from the early ballack goal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bremen star torsten frings delivered the cross for ballack to kill off the champions .
former bremen favorite torsten frings curled in a precise corner from the right and ballack evaded three werder defenders to power a header past andreas reinke .
" we knew ballack was good in the air before the match but lost concentration , " explained bremen chief schaaf .
" we had an uphill task after bayern scored so early on . " the goal arrived in the seventh minute and seemed to persuade bayern to sit back and invite bremen pressure .
paraguayan nelson valdez and fabian ernst both went close to canceling out bayern 's lead as the hosts played a dangerous game .
but somehow the bayern backline - marshaled brilliantly by brazilian lucio - held firm to defeat bremen for the third time this season . schalke still in the race on goal difference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton scored his 100th league goal to keep schalke in the title race .
bayern remain top of the 18-strong bundesliga but schalke 04 only trail on goal difference after a 2-0 triumph at ruhr rivals vfl bochum .
brazilian marksman ailton scored his 100th bundesliga goal on the half hour to put schalke ahead and compatriot lincoln clinched the spoils . " we were concentrated from the very first minute and i never felt we were in danger , " said schalke handler ralf rangnick .
" if there was a criticism it would be we failed to score more goals late on .

" it was not a great game by any means , " admitted ballack .

brazilian marksman ailton scored his 100th bundesliga goal on the half hour to put schalke ahead and compatriot lincoln clinched the spoils . " we were concentrated from the very first minute and i never felt we were in danger , " said schalke handler ralf rangnick .
" if there was a criticism it would be we failed to score more goals late on . " bayern and schalke are now deadlocked on 50 points and come head-to-head next sunday at the arena auf schalke . a champions league match at arsenal on wednesday is the next challenge for felix magath 's side who hold a 3-1 lead from the first leg in munich .

he is also , according to a new poll in a men 's magazine , germany 's best dressed person . some may argue that being named best dressed person in germany is like winning the most sober person award at a bachelor party - there usually is n't much competition .
however , the winds of change may be about to blow through one of europe 's most fashion unconscious states , thanks to one of its most prominent politicians . in a country where denim vests , white socks and sandals -lrb- worn together -rrb- regularly challenge lederhosen and plumed hats in the national dress stakes , it seems that statemanship chic could be germany 's saving grace . according to the german edition of fitness and style magazine men ’ s health , germany 's best dressed person is none other than federal president and hugo boss enthusiast horst köhler . elegance with dignity the former international monetary fund chief , sworn in as president in 2004 , was nominated by a jury of journalists , advertising executives , and fashion designers for his " combination of elegance with dignity " . the 62-year-old , who serves in a mainly ceremonial role , is germany 's top diplomat and therefore the country 's most respected representative on the global stage .
after the men 's health accolade , he may also become a role model for the sartorially challenged back home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while köhler enjoys the cut of boss suits , the magazine also salutes him for his application of accessories and welcomes the fact that he buys his neckties at clearance sales , a nod to his austere side . a who 's who of german style while köhler topped the charts in the overall best dressed category , actor kai wiesinger took the title in the style section while germany 's own soccer monarch franz beckenbauer snatched the award in the business class section .
designers karl lagerfeld and wolfgang joop , as well as ex-tennis star boris becker and musician marius müller-westerhagen were also marked out among the notable winners . special mentions were also given to chancellor gerhard schröder , hamburg mayor ole von beust and the liberal fdp party chief guido westerwelle as fine role models for others to follow .
oli drops the ball in fashion game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli forgot to change out of his goalkeeper 's shirt in this appearance on german tv show " wetten dass . "
at the other end of the scale , however , things averted to type .
bayern munich goalkeeper oliver kahn was announced as the worst dressed person in germany , a remarkable feat considering the lack of fashion sense displayed by many of his counterparts off the field . kahn , a man with a penchant for garish satin shirts , was joined in the bargain basement of the poll by shabbily-suited bundestag president wolfgang thierse and comedian dirk bach who seems to have a habit of dressing in the darkened changing room of a circus outfitter . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de designer blames recession for fashion faux pas while the rest of germany is busy blaming the economy and the government for all sorts of social woes , the designer jil sander believes the current recession has made a more serious impact - on men 's fashion sense .

the eu 's current luxembourg presidency hopes the two-day ministerial talks will pave the way for final agreement at an eu summit in brussels on march 22-23 .
" the plan is to get as close as possible to an agreement , " said a luxembourg diplomat , adding that the eu leadership would circulate a document proposing a basis for discussion by ministers . the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement of the rule book .
the pact notably stipulates that members of the 12-nation euro-zone must not run public deficits in excess of three percent of gdp . since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had for years submitted wrong data . reform without threatening recovery now the eu - still struggling to emerge from a prolonged economic slowdown - is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten recovery .
to this end the revised pact is expected to allow more flexibility for countries to run bigger deficits during slowdowns , so long as they make up the difference when growth returns . key to the amendments is the so-called " excessive deficit procedure , " triggered when a country 's accounts run too far into the red , allowing a series of warnings and ultimately the threat of huge fines .
" the main outstanding point is the question of triggering the excessive deficit procedure , " said one eu source . eu heavyweights led by germany in particular insist that the procedure should not be initiated automatically when deficit slips above three percent of gdp but should take into account a range of other factors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking a bite at the euro : german finance minister hans eichel " a really central criterion for us is how the economy is developing , " said german finance minister hans eichel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.03.2005 fur makes a comeback in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this fox at the opel zoo is safe from becoming someone 's scarf fur is n't just for a trip to church anymore .
it 's still used in heavy jackets but is also appearing as scarves and decorative trim .
animal rights groups want to make sure consumers know what animal became a stole . there was a time when fur in germany was associated with heavy older woman getting dressed up for church or a coffee-and-cake afternoon .
but , not anymore .
germans of all ages and sizes are now increasingly snuggling into the fluffy material .
after suffering from two years of decline , the german fur industry grew by 2.5 percent to € 965 million -lrb- $ 1.266 million -rrb- in 2004 , and fur is back on catwalks and market squares all around europe .
furs for everyone ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long , heavy , dark jackets are being replaced by lighter more colorful fur " fur is selling well , but it is not the classical fur many are used to , " said susanne kolb-wachtel , general manager of the german fur association .
" it has become lighter , more colorful and even peppy . "
there will be even more light and lively uses of fur on display this week when the 57th fur and fashion frankfurt tradeshow opens wednesday , kolb-wachtel said .
fur 's image transformation from dowdy apparel to hot outfit , could be expected to have made life tougher for animal rights groups like people for the ethical treatment of animals and its efforts to prohibit fur farms around the world .
but the group , which is planning a demonstration during the frankfurt convention , does n't see a major fur revival and points out that many german departments stores no longer carry fur products .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h & m is one of the chains that has decided to stop selling fur " the fur comeback is exaggerated , " said jürgen faulmann , a peta campaign leader .
" it is a perversion for the super rich who do not know what to do with their money and pay thousands for a fur coat . "
that 's where kolb-wachtel disagrees .
fur is still a luxury item compared to other less expensive materials , but there are more types of fur in more price classes than ever .
the change in fur styles , and prices , are key reasons why the average fur buyer 's has dropped from 45-plus to 25-plus , she said .
designers return to animal pelts whether destined for young or old , streetwear shops or upscale boutiques , designers are willing to work with the controversial material again .
in winter collections presented in europe recently fox stoles were used to embellish evening gowns and copious amounts of animal pelt went into a mink bomber jacket .
bildunterschrift : fur has returned to the catwalk in a big way " we never did fur before this season , " cat bresaola spokesperson gharani strok told reporters at the london fashion week in mid-february .
" but we 've had to design it to cater to the russian market . "
russia and china are the reasons why some designers have started kitting out their models in animal pelts again .
the two countries are the new target markets , and they 're looking for something stylish and warm .
" there are two distinct markets in both russia and china , " kolb-wachtel said .
" the rich , who are looking for the most fashionable furs and the people who live in cold areas and want something long and warm to wear . "
where did the fox boa come from ?
in the face of fur 's rising sales and acceptance , it 's the people looking to stay warm , whether in germany or abroad , animal rights activists want to target .
while pointing out that there are warmer synthetic materials designed for frigid conditions , peta is also launching new initiative to make sure people know what used to wear the fur on their back .
" the media has made many people think that wearing fur is n't a crime , " faulmann said .
" with our new theme we want to show people the parts of the fox that is left over when the its fur is gone . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress franka potente and musician bela b. pose for peta 's " i 'd would rather wear tattoos than fur " campaign some people , like verena pirchner , whose jacket 's cotton trim - to the untrained eye - looks like a closely shorn mink , do n't need any more convincing .
" i think it 's terrible that people are still wearing fur , " said the 24-year-old student from bonn .
" my mother inherited a fur coat from her mother but never wears it .
i would n't wear it either . "
european and state oversight german fur farms are subject to supervision from the country 's individual states , which can issue orders regarding animal handling and slaughter .
how effective the orders are at improving animals ' living conditions is disputable .
" it is not possible to understand why the order , which should have improved conditions for fur-bearing animals , to this day is not being enforced , " said wolfgang apel , president of the german animal protection association , of a 2001 state order in schleswig-holstein .
the german fur association 's kolb-wachtel said she was proud of german fur farmers ' willingness to invest in ways to keep animals from suffering , including larger cages , safe toys to keep them occupied and shorter transportation times before slaughter .
customers reading labels and thinking twice consumers who want to know what they 're paying for have to rely on the garment 's label to know what animals there fur comes from , kolb-wachtel said .
and people are examining those labels , and thinking twice before buying a fur .
" i definitely gave it a lot of thought , " said ute krieg , from the west german city of koblenz , of her decision to buy a rabbit fur coat .
" i would not want to wear anything that was tormented .

the eu 's current luxembourg presidency hopes the two-day ministerial talks will pave the way for final agreement at an eu summit in brussels on march 22-23 .
" the plan is to get as close as possible to an agreement , " said a luxembourg diplomat , adding that the eu leadership would circulate a document proposing a basis for discussion by ministers . the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement of the rule book .
the pact notably stipulates that members of the 12-nation euro-zone must not run public deficits in excess of three percent of gdp . since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had for years submitted wrong data . reform without threatening recovery now the eu - still struggling to emerge from a prolonged economic slowdown - is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten recovery .
to this end the revised pact is expected to allow more flexibility for countries to run bigger deficits during slowdowns , so long as they make up the difference when growth returns . key to the amendments is the so-called " excessive deficit procedure , " triggered when a country 's accounts run too far into the red , allowing a series of warnings and ultimately the threat of huge fines .
" the main outstanding point is the question of triggering the excessive deficit procedure , " said one eu source . eu heavyweights led by germany in particular insist that the procedure should not be initiated automatically when deficit slips above three percent of gdp but should take into account a range of other factors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking a bite at the euro : german finance minister hans eichel " a really central criterion for us is how the economy is developing , " said german finance minister hans eichel .
" in order to reduce debt , both things are needed together - strict fiscal policy and growth . " italian prime minister silvio berlusconi warned friday that rome will veto any system that is not sufficiently flexible .
in particular he wants certain expenses , notably spending on infrastructure , to be excluded from deficit sums .
" i will fight at the march eu -lrb- summit -rrb- to change the parameters set by the stability pact .
without modification i am ready to block things , " he said . " credibility needs to be preserved " eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia , tasked with policing the pact , warned last week against " introducing uncertainty into the decision about the existence or otherwise of an excessive deficit . " european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- chief jean-claude trichet echoed that point thursday .
" the credibility of the excessive deficit procedure needs to be fully preserved , " he said .
" this is not only fundamental for macroeconomic stability and cohesion in the euro area but also for confidence and growth prospects in all member states .

the lse had twice rejected informal offers from deutsche börse at that price . in the statement , the deutsche börse chief added that after withdrawing its offer , the company would make " a significant distribution of funds " to its investors , " in a move to pacify those involved with the major shareholder revolt which prompted the withdrawal . börse still believes in consolidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chairman of the board of german stock exchange , deutsche börse ag , werner g. seifert .
" we recognize that a significant portion of our shareholder base is focused on return of capital in the short term , " seifert said .
" we continue to believe that shareholders , issuers , investors and intermediaries would all benefit from consolidation of the european exchange landscape as contemplated in our proposal . " " however , " he continued , " the london stock exchange does not find itself in a position to recommend a transaction at a price we find supportable . " seifert added that despite this , deutsche börse reserved the right to make another offer if any other company makes a bid for the venerable lse . dissident shareholders issued warning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in february , two dissident shareholders went public with fears that deutsche börse would pay over the asking price for the lse and argued that the company should return around € 726 million -lrb- $ 961 million -rrb- of its cash to shareholders . they warned deutsche börse that the majority of investors opposed the bid for the london market and could take action to oust its supervisory board at the next shareholder meeting in may . porsche , the german car maker , became the first big company on the german exchange to publicly express opposition to the takeover bid last week as opposition grew . rival records share price leap euronext , the pan-european stock market operator , which is also continuing talks with the lse , sees synergies worth € 203 million from a merger . the amount was twice that of its german rival deutsche börse , which predicted synergies of € 100 million from 2008 if it won the battle to acquire the lse . euronext shareholders were said by sources to be " particularly interested " in the projected financial advantages of the deal .

the eu 's current luxembourg presidency hopes the two-day ministerial talks will pave the way for final agreement at an eu summit in brussels on march 22-23 .
" the plan is to get as close as possible to an agreement , " said a luxembourg diplomat , adding that the eu leadership would circulate a document proposing a basis for discussion by ministers . the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement of the rule book .
the pact notably stipulates that members of the 12-nation euro-zone must not run public deficits in excess of three percent of gdp . since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had for years submitted wrong data . reform without threatening recovery now the eu - still struggling to emerge from a prolonged economic slowdown - is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten recovery .
to this end the revised pact is expected to allow more flexibility for countries to run bigger deficits during slowdowns , so long as they make up the difference when growth returns . key to the amendments is the so-called " excessive deficit procedure , " triggered when a country 's accounts run too far into the red , allowing a series of warnings and ultimately the threat of huge fines .

furs for everyone ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long , heavy , dark jackets are being replaced by lighter more colorful fur " fur is selling well , but it is not the classical fur many are used to , " said susanne kolb-wachtel , general manager of the german fur association .
" it has become lighter , more colorful and even peppy . "
there will be even more light and lively uses of fur on display this week when the 57th fur and fashion frankfurt tradeshow opens wednesday , kolb-wachtel said .
fur 's image transformation from dowdy apparel to hot outfit , could be expected to have made life tougher for animal rights groups like people for the ethical treatment of animals and its efforts to prohibit fur farms around the world .
but the group , which is planning a demonstration during the frankfurt convention , does n't see a major fur revival and points out that many german departments stores no longer carry fur products .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h & m is one of the chains that has decided to stop selling fur " the fur comeback is exaggerated , " said jürgen faulmann , a peta campaign leader .
" it is a perversion for the super rich who do not know what to do with their money and pay thousands for a fur coat . "
that 's where kolb-wachtel disagrees .
fur is still a luxury item compared to other less expensive materials , but there are more types of fur in more price classes than ever .
the change in fur styles , and prices , are key reasons why the average fur buyer 's has dropped from 45-plus to 25-plus , she said .
designers return to animal pelts whether destined for young or old , streetwear shops or upscale boutiques , designers are willing to work with the controversial material again .

the two countries are the new target markets , and they 're looking for something stylish and warm .
" there are two distinct markets in both russia and china , " kolb-wachtel said .
" the rich , who are looking for the most fashionable furs and the people who live in cold areas and want something long and warm to wear . "
where did the fox boa come from ?
in the face of fur 's rising sales and acceptance , it 's the people looking to stay warm , whether in germany or abroad , animal rights activists want to target .
while pointing out that there are warmer synthetic materials designed for frigid conditions , peta is also launching new initiative to make sure people know what used to wear the fur on their back .
" the media has made many people think that wearing fur is n't a crime , " faulmann said .
" with our new theme we want to show people the parts of the fox that is left over when the its fur is gone . "

" i think it 's terrible that people are still wearing fur , " said the 24-year-old student from bonn .
" my mother inherited a fur coat from her mother but never wears it .
i would n't wear it either . "
european and state oversight german fur farms are subject to supervision from the country 's individual states , which can issue orders regarding animal handling and slaughter .
how effective the orders are at improving animals ' living conditions is disputable .
" it is not possible to understand why the order , which should have improved conditions for fur-bearing animals , to this day is not being enforced , " said wolfgang apel , president of the german animal protection association , of a 2001 state order in schleswig-holstein .
the german fur association 's kolb-wachtel said she was proud of german fur farmers ' willingness to invest in ways to keep animals from suffering , including larger cages , safe toys to keep them occupied and shorter transportation times before slaughter .
customers reading labels and thinking twice consumers who want to know what they 're paying for have to rely on the garment 's label to know what animals there fur comes from , kolb-wachtel said .
and people are examining those labels , and thinking twice before buying a fur .

it 's still used in heavy jackets but is also appearing as scarves and decorative trim .
animal rights groups want to make sure consumers know what animal became a stole . there was a time when fur in germany was associated with heavy older woman getting dressed up for church or a coffee-and-cake afternoon .
but , not anymore .
germans of all ages and sizes are now increasingly snuggling into the fluffy material .
after suffering from two years of decline , the german fur industry grew by 2.5 percent to € 965 million -lrb- $ 1.266 million -rrb- in 2004 , and fur is back on catwalks and market squares all around europe .
furs for everyone ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long , heavy , dark jackets are being replaced by lighter more colorful fur " fur is selling well , but it is not the classical fur many are used to , " said susanne kolb-wachtel , general manager of the german fur association .
" it has become lighter , more colorful and even peppy . "
there will be even more light and lively uses of fur on display this week when the 57th fur and fashion frankfurt tradeshow opens wednesday , kolb-wachtel said .
fur 's image transformation from dowdy apparel to hot outfit , could be expected to have made life tougher for animal rights groups like people for the ethical treatment of animals and its efforts to prohibit fur farms around the world .
but the group , which is planning a demonstration during the frankfurt convention , does n't see a major fur revival and points out that many german departments stores no longer carry fur products .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h & m is one of the chains that has decided to stop selling fur " the fur comeback is exaggerated , " said jürgen faulmann , a peta campaign leader .
" it is a perversion for the super rich who do not know what to do with their money and pay thousands for a fur coat . "
that 's where kolb-wachtel disagrees .
fur is still a luxury item compared to other less expensive materials , but there are more types of fur in more price classes than ever .
the change in fur styles , and prices , are key reasons why the average fur buyer 's has dropped from 45-plus to 25-plus , she said .
designers return to animal pelts whether destined for young or old , streetwear shops or upscale boutiques , designers are willing to work with the controversial material again .
in winter collections presented in europe recently fox stoles were used to embellish evening gowns and copious amounts of animal pelt went into a mink bomber jacket .
bildunterschrift : fur has returned to the catwalk in a big way " we never did fur before this season , " cat bresaola spokesperson gharani strok told reporters at the london fashion week in mid-february .
" but we 've had to design it to cater to the russian market . "
russia and china are the reasons why some designers have started kitting out their models in animal pelts again .
the two countries are the new target markets , and they 're looking for something stylish and warm .
" there are two distinct markets in both russia and china , " kolb-wachtel said .
" the rich , who are looking for the most fashionable furs and the people who live in cold areas and want something long and warm to wear . "
where did the fox boa come from ?
in the face of fur 's rising sales and acceptance , it 's the people looking to stay warm , whether in germany or abroad , animal rights activists want to target .
while pointing out that there are warmer synthetic materials designed for frigid conditions , peta is also launching new initiative to make sure people know what used to wear the fur on their back .

but could it simply be a case that the drone of domestic politics has taken over ? when eu expansion commissioner olli rehn and eu council president jean asselborn arrive in ankara for talks with the turkish foreign minister abdulla gul on monday , it is likely to be under a cloud of some tension .
in the past few weeks a number of incidences have collectively led critics to suggest that turkey 's reform movement has begun to lose momentum . at the end of last year , the picture was quite different .
in the months leading up to the decision on eu entry negotiations , the parliament under prime minister tayyip erdogan passed one reform after another in a flurry of law-making activity .
it was a means to an end , and on dec .
17 last year , the european council gave the green light for entry talks to begin .
it was something of a victory for erdogan . running out of steam ? critics are now loudly questioning the lack of continued activity on turkey 's reform map , and asking whether erdogan simply ran out of steam .
one sign of such is that the turkish prime minister has not yet named a head negotiator for the entry talks even though expansion commissioner olli rehn is arriving in ankara on monday .
it 's a point of some contention in turkey , with even the turkish president ahmet necdet yezer calling on the prime minister to name someone for the post . bildunterschrift : accession negotiations are scheduled for october luxembourg 's european minister nicolas schmidt and the eu ambassador in ankara , the german diplomat hansjörg kretschmer have both criticized turkey 's slowing progress , enraging the turkish government as a result . but professor udo steinbach , director of the german orient institute in hamburg said he believed the evidence being bandied about as proof of turkey 's ebbing commitment to reform can not be used as such , and blames the media for exaggerating the situation . steinbach said that the considerable pressure to get the reform ball rolling ahead of dec .
17 may have eased off , but that is not to say that the general level of government interest in entry talks has diminished .
he said that turkey has simply shifted its attention back to the daily grind of domestic political life . a long path to reform nobody argues that turkey does n't still have a long way to go , and on monday , the eu enlargement commissioner is expected to press ankara to initial an agreement to extend its customs union to the 10 new eu member states , including cyprus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish parliament in ankara originally ankara was supposed to have signed up by the end of february .
but for erdogan the signature is incredibly delicate , as it could be interpreted as recognition of cyprus , which could lead to internal political difficulties .
on the other hand , the eu made it perfectly clear that if turkey does not sign the politically sensitive protocol , there will be no accession talks come october . a further problem is the conflict between turkey and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
last december , the imf agreed to a three year aid program to the tune of more than € 10 billion -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- but turkey has not yet made good on the economic reform it pledged in return for the financial package . steinbach said that in light of the tense situation , monday 's eu delegation visit is not without significance .

it 's still used in heavy jackets but is also appearing as scarves and decorative trim .
animal rights groups want to make sure consumers know what animal became a stole . there was a time when fur in germany was associated with heavy older woman getting dressed up for church or a coffee-and-cake afternoon .
but , not anymore .
germans of all ages and sizes are now increasingly snuggling into the fluffy material .
after suffering from two years of decline , the german fur industry grew by 2.5 percent to € 965 million -lrb- $ 1.266 million -rrb- in 2004 , and fur is back on catwalks and market squares all around europe .
furs for everyone ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long , heavy , dark jackets are being replaced by lighter more colorful fur " fur is selling well , but it is not the classical fur many are used to , " said susanne kolb-wachtel , general manager of the german fur association .
" it has become lighter , more colorful and even peppy . "
there will be even more light and lively uses of fur on display this week when the 57th fur and fashion frankfurt tradeshow opens wednesday , kolb-wachtel said .
fur 's image transformation from dowdy apparel to hot outfit , could be expected to have made life tougher for animal rights groups like people for the ethical treatment of animals and its efforts to prohibit fur farms around the world .
but the group , which is planning a demonstration during the frankfurt convention , does n't see a major fur revival and points out that many german departments stores no longer carry fur products .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h & m is one of the chains that has decided to stop selling fur " the fur comeback is exaggerated , " said jürgen faulmann , a peta campaign leader .
" it is a perversion for the super rich who do not know what to do with their money and pay thousands for a fur coat . "
that 's where kolb-wachtel disagrees .
fur is still a luxury item compared to other less expensive materials , but there are more types of fur in more price classes than ever .
the change in fur styles , and prices , are key reasons why the average fur buyer 's has dropped from 45-plus to 25-plus , she said .
designers return to animal pelts whether destined for young or old , streetwear shops or upscale boutiques , designers are willing to work with the controversial material again .
in winter collections presented in europe recently fox stoles were used to embellish evening gowns and copious amounts of animal pelt went into a mink bomber jacket .
bildunterschrift : fur has returned to the catwalk in a big way " we never did fur before this season , " cat bresaola spokesperson gharani strok told reporters at the london fashion week in mid-february .
" but we 've had to design it to cater to the russian market . "
russia and china are the reasons why some designers have started kitting out their models in animal pelts again .
the two countries are the new target markets , and they 're looking for something stylish and warm .
" there are two distinct markets in both russia and china , " kolb-wachtel said .
" the rich , who are looking for the most fashionable furs and the people who live in cold areas and want something long and warm to wear . "
where did the fox boa come from ?
in the face of fur 's rising sales and acceptance , it 's the people looking to stay warm , whether in germany or abroad , animal rights activists want to target .
while pointing out that there are warmer synthetic materials designed for frigid conditions , peta is also launching new initiative to make sure people know what used to wear the fur on their back .
" the media has made many people think that wearing fur is n't a crime , " faulmann said .
" with our new theme we want to show people the parts of the fox that is left over when the its fur is gone . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress franka potente and musician bela b. pose for peta 's " i 'd would rather wear tattoos than fur " campaign some people , like verena pirchner , whose jacket 's cotton trim - to the untrained eye - looks like a closely shorn mink , do n't need any more convincing .
" i think it 's terrible that people are still wearing fur , " said the 24-year-old student from bonn .
" my mother inherited a fur coat from her mother but never wears it .
i would n't wear it either . "
european and state oversight german fur farms are subject to supervision from the country 's individual states , which can issue orders regarding animal handling and slaughter .
how effective the orders are at improving animals ' living conditions is disputable .
" it is not possible to understand why the order , which should have improved conditions for fur-bearing animals , to this day is not being enforced , " said wolfgang apel , president of the german animal protection association , of a 2001 state order in schleswig-holstein .
the german fur association 's kolb-wachtel said she was proud of german fur farmers ' willingness to invest in ways to keep animals from suffering , including larger cages , safe toys to keep them occupied and shorter transportation times before slaughter .
customers reading labels and thinking twice consumers who want to know what they 're paying for have to rely on the garment 's label to know what animals there fur comes from , kolb-wachtel said .
and people are examining those labels , and thinking twice before buying a fur .
" i definitely gave it a lot of thought , " said ute krieg , from the west german city of koblenz , of her decision to buy a rabbit fur coat .

but could it simply be a case that the drone of domestic politics has taken over ? when eu expansion commissioner olli rehn and eu council president jean asselborn arrive in ankara for talks with the turkish foreign minister abdulla gul on monday , it is likely to be under a cloud of some tension .
in the past few weeks a number of incidences have collectively led critics to suggest that turkey 's reform movement has begun to lose momentum . at the end of last year , the picture was quite different .
in the months leading up to the decision on eu entry negotiations , the parliament under prime minister tayyip erdogan passed one reform after another in a flurry of law-making activity .
it was a means to an end , and on dec .
17 last year , the european council gave the green light for entry talks to begin .
it was something of a victory for erdogan . running out of steam ? critics are now loudly questioning the lack of continued activity on turkey 's reform map , and asking whether erdogan simply ran out of steam .
one sign of such is that the turkish prime minister has not yet named a head negotiator for the entry talks even though expansion commissioner olli rehn is arriving in ankara on monday .
it 's a point of some contention in turkey , with even the turkish president ahmet necdet yezer calling on the prime minister to name someone for the post . bildunterschrift : accession negotiations are scheduled for october luxembourg 's european minister nicolas schmidt and the eu ambassador in ankara , the german diplomat hansjörg kretschmer have both criticized turkey 's slowing progress , enraging the turkish government as a result . but professor udo steinbach , director of the german orient institute in hamburg said he believed the evidence being bandied about as proof of turkey 's ebbing commitment to reform can not be used as such , and blames the media for exaggerating the situation . steinbach said that the considerable pressure to get the reform ball rolling ahead of dec .

he said that turkey has simply shifted its attention back to the daily grind of domestic political life . a long path to reform nobody argues that turkey does n't still have a long way to go , and on monday , the eu enlargement commissioner is expected to press ankara to initial an agreement to extend its customs union to the 10 new eu member states , including cyprus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish parliament in ankara originally ankara was supposed to have signed up by the end of february .
but for erdogan the signature is incredibly delicate , as it could be interpreted as recognition of cyprus , which could lead to internal political difficulties .
on the other hand , the eu made it perfectly clear that if turkey does not sign the politically sensitive protocol , there will be no accession talks come october . a further problem is the conflict between turkey and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .

" we knew ballack was good in the air before the match but lost concentration , " explained bremen chief schaaf .
" we had an uphill task after bayern scored so early on . " the goal arrived in the seventh minute and seemed to persuade bayern to sit back and invite bremen pressure .
paraguayan nelson valdez and fabian ernst both went close to canceling out bayern 's lead as the hosts played a dangerous game .
but somehow the bayern backline - marshaled brilliantly by brazilian lucio - held firm to defeat bremen for the third time this season . schalke still in the race on goal difference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton scored his 100th league goal to keep schalke in the title race .

brazilian marksman ailton scored his 100th bundesliga goal on the half hour to put schalke ahead and compatriot lincoln clinched the spoils . " we were concentrated from the very first minute and i never felt we were in danger , " said schalke handler ralf rangnick .

bayer leverkusen are another team poised to face english opposition in the champions league on wednesday with liverpool visiting the bayarena holding a 3-1 cushion from the first leg .
bayer stumbled to a 1-0 loss at sv hamburg on saturday that puts an enormous dent in their hopes of qualifying for the competition next season . belgian international daniel van buyten headed the all-important goal on 21 minutes as bayer 's aerial weakness was exposed once again .
" van buyten is a tall lad so sometimes he is going to score from set-pieces , " explained bayer manager klaus augenthaler . the reverse sees leverkusen slump to seventh in the table although they are still only four points behind third-placed bremen . hertha miss golden opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha celebrate clinching a point from the jaws of defeat .

however , nuremberg 's usually prolific striker got off the mark by equalizing after a terrible defensive mix-up in the 76th minute . cantaluppi gave away a penalty four minutes from time and was sent off for his reaction after tomas rosicky had scored to put dortmund ahead again but there was still time for robert vittek to win and convert another penalty and earn his side a point from an entertaining game . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hertha hammers unlucky hamburg hertha berlin bested hamburg sv 4-1 on saturday , but the end result was not a fair reflection of what happened on the pitch .

the eu 's current luxembourg presidency hopes the two-day ministerial talks will pave the way for final agreement at an eu summit in brussels on march 22-23 .
" the plan is to get as close as possible to an agreement , " said a luxembourg diplomat , adding that the eu leadership would circulate a document proposing a basis for discussion by ministers . the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement of the rule book .
the pact notably stipulates that members of the 12-nation euro-zone must not run public deficits in excess of three percent of gdp . since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had for years submitted wrong data . reform without threatening recovery now the eu - still struggling to emerge from a prolonged economic slowdown - is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten recovery .
to this end the revised pact is expected to allow more flexibility for countries to run bigger deficits during slowdowns , so long as they make up the difference when growth returns . key to the amendments is the so-called " excessive deficit procedure , " triggered when a country 's accounts run too far into the red , allowing a series of warnings and ultimately the threat of huge fines .
" the main outstanding point is the question of triggering the excessive deficit procedure , " said one eu source . eu heavyweights led by germany in particular insist that the procedure should not be initiated automatically when deficit slips above three percent of gdp but should take into account a range of other factors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking a bite at the euro : german finance minister hans eichel " a really central criterion for us is how the economy is developing , " said german finance minister hans eichel .
" in order to reduce debt , both things are needed together - strict fiscal policy and growth . " italian prime minister silvio berlusconi warned friday that rome will veto any system that is not sufficiently flexible .
in particular he wants certain expenses , notably spending on infrastructure , to be excluded from deficit sums .
" i will fight at the march eu -lrb- summit -rrb- to change the parameters set by the stability pact .
without modification i am ready to block things , " he said . " credibility needs to be preserved " eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia , tasked with policing the pact , warned last week against " introducing uncertainty into the decision about the existence or otherwise of an excessive deficit . " european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- chief jean-claude trichet echoed that point thursday .
" the credibility of the excessive deficit procedure needs to be fully preserved , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.03.2005 is turkey losing its reform zeal ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey still has some work to do before eu entry talks get underway with the start of eu accession talks scheduled for later this year , turkey 's critics say its reform zest appears to be waning .
but could it simply be a case that the drone of domestic politics has taken over ? when eu expansion commissioner olli rehn and eu council president jean asselborn arrive in ankara for talks with the turkish foreign minister abdulla gul on monday , it is likely to be under a cloud of some tension .
in the past few weeks a number of incidences have collectively led critics to suggest that turkey 's reform movement has begun to lose momentum . at the end of last year , the picture was quite different .
in the months leading up to the decision on eu entry negotiations , the parliament under prime minister tayyip erdogan passed one reform after another in a flurry of law-making activity .
it was a means to an end , and on dec .
17 last year , the european council gave the green light for entry talks to begin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.03.2005 is turkey losing its reform zeal ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey still has some work to do before eu entry talks get underway with the start of eu accession talks scheduled for later this year , turkey 's critics say its reform zest appears to be waning .
but could it simply be a case that the drone of domestic politics has taken over ? when eu expansion commissioner olli rehn and eu council president jean asselborn arrive in ankara for talks with the turkish foreign minister abdulla gul on monday , it is likely to be under a cloud of some tension .
in the past few weeks a number of incidences have collectively led critics to suggest that turkey 's reform movement has begun to lose momentum . at the end of last year , the picture was quite different .
in the months leading up to the decision on eu entry negotiations , the parliament under prime minister tayyip erdogan passed one reform after another in a flurry of law-making activity .
it was a means to an end , and on dec .
17 last year , the european council gave the green light for entry talks to begin .
it was something of a victory for erdogan . running out of steam ? critics are now loudly questioning the lack of continued activity on turkey 's reform map , and asking whether erdogan simply ran out of steam .
one sign of such is that the turkish prime minister has not yet named a head negotiator for the entry talks even though expansion commissioner olli rehn is arriving in ankara on monday .
it 's a point of some contention in turkey , with even the turkish president ahmet necdet yezer calling on the prime minister to name someone for the post . bildunterschrift : accession negotiations are scheduled for october luxembourg 's european minister nicolas schmidt and the eu ambassador in ankara , the german diplomat hansjörg kretschmer have both criticized turkey 's slowing progress , enraging the turkish government as a result . but professor udo steinbach , director of the german orient institute in hamburg said he believed the evidence being bandied about as proof of turkey 's ebbing commitment to reform can not be used as such , and blames the media for exaggerating the situation . steinbach said that the considerable pressure to get the reform ball rolling ahead of dec .
17 may have eased off , but that is not to say that the general level of government interest in entry talks has diminished .
he said that turkey has simply shifted its attention back to the daily grind of domestic political life . a long path to reform nobody argues that turkey does n't still have a long way to go , and on monday , the eu enlargement commissioner is expected to press ankara to initial an agreement to extend its customs union to the 10 new eu member states , including cyprus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish parliament in ankara originally ankara was supposed to have signed up by the end of february .
but for erdogan the signature is incredibly delicate , as it could be interpreted as recognition of cyprus , which could lead to internal political difficulties .
on the other hand , the eu made it perfectly clear that if turkey does not sign the politically sensitive protocol , there will be no accession talks come october . a further problem is the conflict between turkey and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
last december , the imf agreed to a three year aid program to the tune of more than € 10 billion -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- but turkey has not yet made good on the economic reform it pledged in return for the financial package . steinbach said that in light of the tense situation , monday 's eu delegation visit is not without significance .
he said he believed the most critical point on the agenda is the cyprus problem , but added the responsibility does not only lay with turkey , but also with greece . samira lazarovic -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatives to huddle to block turkey 's eu bid germany 's opposition conservatives are looking to france for support in their bid to dash turkey 's eu hopes by inviting french conservative economics minister sarkozy for talks .

bayern munich 's 1-0 win over reigning champions werder bremen on saturday kept the bavarian giants on top of the bundesliga .

" it was not a great game by any means , " admitted ballack .
" but we took the points and stay top of the table which is important ahead of the schalke game . " bremen fall seven points behind the pacesetters and must now concentrate on netting third place and the final champions league slot .
thomas schaaf 's double winners traveled to munich on the back of five successive league wins but failed to recover from the early ballack goal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former bremen star torsten frings delivered the cross for ballack to kill off the champions .
former bremen favorite torsten frings curled in a precise corner from the right and ballack evaded three werder defenders to power a header past andreas reinke .
" we knew ballack was good in the air before the match but lost concentration , " explained bremen chief schaaf .
" we had an uphill task after bayern scored so early on . " the goal arrived in the seventh minute and seemed to persuade bayern to sit back and invite bremen pressure .
paraguayan nelson valdez and fabian ernst both went close to canceling out bayern 's lead as the hosts played a dangerous game .
but somehow the bayern backline - marshaled brilliantly by brazilian lucio - held firm to defeat bremen for the third time this season . schalke still in the race on goal difference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton scored his 100th league goal to keep schalke in the title race .

brazilian marksman ailton scored his 100th bundesliga goal on the half hour to put schalke ahead and compatriot lincoln clinched the spoils . " we were concentrated from the very first minute and i never felt we were in danger , " said schalke handler ralf rangnick .
" if there was a criticism it would be we failed to score more goals late on . " bayern and schalke are now deadlocked on 50 points and come head-to-head next sunday at the arena auf schalke . a champions league match at arsenal on wednesday is the next challenge for felix magath 's side who hold a 3-1 lead from the first leg in munich .

" arsenal are very good at home but we are solid at the back and i am confident of going through , " added ballack . leverkusen beaten ahead of vital liverpool clash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leverkusen come off the 1-0 defeat to hamburg to face liverpool in the second leg of their champions league match on wednesday .
bayer leverkusen are another team poised to face english opposition in the champions league on wednesday with liverpool visiting the bayarena holding a 3-1 cushion from the first leg .
bayer stumbled to a 1-0 loss at sv hamburg on saturday that puts an enormous dent in their hopes of qualifying for the competition next season . belgian international daniel van buyten headed the all-important goal on 21 minutes as bayer 's aerial weakness was exposed once again .
" van buyten is a tall lad so sometimes he is going to score from set-pieces , " explained bayer manager klaus augenthaler . the reverse sees leverkusen slump to seventh in the table although they are still only four points behind third-placed bremen . hertha miss golden opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha celebrate clinching a point from the jaws of defeat .

beleaguered borussia dortmund scraped a 2-2 draw with fc nuremberg in the other sunday game in which the referee awarded three penalties , two in the last four minutes , and sent off fc nuremberg 's mario cantaluppi for his ironic applause at the one that went against his team . dortmund had gone ahead through christian wörns in the 62nd minute and rode their luck when marek mintal missed from the spot four minutes later .
however , nuremberg 's usually prolific striker got off the mark by equalizing after a terrible defensive mix-up in the 76th minute . cantaluppi gave away a penalty four minutes from time and was sent off for his reaction after tomas rosicky had scored to put dortmund ahead again but there was still time for robert vittek to win and convert another penalty and earn his side a point from an entertaining game . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hertha hammers unlucky hamburg hertha berlin bested hamburg sv 4-1 on saturday , but the end result was not a fair reflection of what happened on the pitch .

it 's still used in heavy jackets but is also appearing as scarves and decorative trim .
animal rights groups want to make sure consumers know what animal became a stole . there was a time when fur in germany was associated with heavy older woman getting dressed up for church or a coffee-and-cake afternoon .
but , not anymore .
germans of all ages and sizes are now increasingly snuggling into the fluffy material .
after suffering from two years of decline , the german fur industry grew by 2.5 percent to € 965 million -lrb- $ 1.266 million -rrb- in 2004 , and fur is back on catwalks and market squares all around europe .
furs for everyone ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long , heavy , dark jackets are being replaced by lighter more colorful fur " fur is selling well , but it is not the classical fur many are used to , " said susanne kolb-wachtel , general manager of the german fur association .
" it has become lighter , more colorful and even peppy . "
there will be even more light and lively uses of fur on display this week when the 57th fur and fashion frankfurt tradeshow opens wednesday , kolb-wachtel said .
fur 's image transformation from dowdy apparel to hot outfit , could be expected to have made life tougher for animal rights groups like people for the ethical treatment of animals and its efforts to prohibit fur farms around the world .
but the group , which is planning a demonstration during the frankfurt convention , does n't see a major fur revival and points out that many german departments stores no longer carry fur products .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h & m is one of the chains that has decided to stop selling fur " the fur comeback is exaggerated , " said jürgen faulmann , a peta campaign leader .
" it is a perversion for the super rich who do not know what to do with their money and pay thousands for a fur coat . "
that 's where kolb-wachtel disagrees .
fur is still a luxury item compared to other less expensive materials , but there are more types of fur in more price classes than ever .
the change in fur styles , and prices , are key reasons why the average fur buyer 's has dropped from 45-plus to 25-plus , she said .
designers return to animal pelts whether destined for young or old , streetwear shops or upscale boutiques , designers are willing to work with the controversial material again .
in winter collections presented in europe recently fox stoles were used to embellish evening gowns and copious amounts of animal pelt went into a mink bomber jacket .
bildunterschrift : fur has returned to the catwalk in a big way " we never did fur before this season , " cat bresaola spokesperson gharani strok told reporters at the london fashion week in mid-february .
" but we 've had to design it to cater to the russian market . "
russia and china are the reasons why some designers have started kitting out their models in animal pelts again .
the two countries are the new target markets , and they 're looking for something stylish and warm .
" there are two distinct markets in both russia and china , " kolb-wachtel said .
" the rich , who are looking for the most fashionable furs and the people who live in cold areas and want something long and warm to wear . "
where did the fox boa come from ?
in the face of fur 's rising sales and acceptance , it 's the people looking to stay warm , whether in germany or abroad , animal rights activists want to target .
while pointing out that there are warmer synthetic materials designed for frigid conditions , peta is also launching new initiative to make sure people know what used to wear the fur on their back .
" the media has made many people think that wearing fur is n't a crime , " faulmann said .
" with our new theme we want to show people the parts of the fox that is left over when the its fur is gone . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress franka potente and musician bela b. pose for peta 's " i 'd would rather wear tattoos than fur " campaign some people , like verena pirchner , whose jacket 's cotton trim - to the untrained eye - looks like a closely shorn mink , do n't need any more convincing .
" i think it 's terrible that people are still wearing fur , " said the 24-year-old student from bonn .
" my mother inherited a fur coat from her mother but never wears it .
i would n't wear it either . "
european and state oversight german fur farms are subject to supervision from the country 's individual states , which can issue orders regarding animal handling and slaughter .
how effective the orders are at improving animals ' living conditions is disputable .
" it is not possible to understand why the order , which should have improved conditions for fur-bearing animals , to this day is not being enforced , " said wolfgang apel , president of the german animal protection association , of a 2001 state order in schleswig-holstein .
the german fur association 's kolb-wachtel said she was proud of german fur farmers ' willingness to invest in ways to keep animals from suffering , including larger cages , safe toys to keep them occupied and shorter transportation times before slaughter .
customers reading labels and thinking twice consumers who want to know what they 're paying for have to rely on the garment 's label to know what animals there fur comes from , kolb-wachtel said .
and people are examining those labels , and thinking twice before buying a fur .
" i definitely gave it a lot of thought , " said ute krieg , from the west german city of koblenz , of her decision to buy a rabbit fur coat .
" i would not want to wear anything that was tormented .

but could it simply be a case that the drone of domestic politics has taken over ? when eu expansion commissioner olli rehn and eu council president jean asselborn arrive in ankara for talks with the turkish foreign minister abdulla gul on monday , it is likely to be under a cloud of some tension .
in the past few weeks a number of incidences have collectively led critics to suggest that turkey 's reform movement has begun to lose momentum . at the end of last year , the picture was quite different .
in the months leading up to the decision on eu entry negotiations , the parliament under prime minister tayyip erdogan passed one reform after another in a flurry of law-making activity .
it was a means to an end , and on dec .
17 last year , the european council gave the green light for entry talks to begin .
it was something of a victory for erdogan . running out of steam ? critics are now loudly questioning the lack of continued activity on turkey 's reform map , and asking whether erdogan simply ran out of steam .
one sign of such is that the turkish prime minister has not yet named a head negotiator for the entry talks even though expansion commissioner olli rehn is arriving in ankara on monday .
it 's a point of some contention in turkey , with even the turkish president ahmet necdet yezer calling on the prime minister to name someone for the post . bildunterschrift : accession negotiations are scheduled for october luxembourg 's european minister nicolas schmidt and the eu ambassador in ankara , the german diplomat hansjörg kretschmer have both criticized turkey 's slowing progress , enraging the turkish government as a result . but professor udo steinbach , director of the german orient institute in hamburg said he believed the evidence being bandied about as proof of turkey 's ebbing commitment to reform can not be used as such , and blames the media for exaggerating the situation . steinbach said that the considerable pressure to get the reform ball rolling ahead of dec .
17 may have eased off , but that is not to say that the general level of government interest in entry talks has diminished .
he said that turkey has simply shifted its attention back to the daily grind of domestic political life . a long path to reform nobody argues that turkey does n't still have a long way to go , and on monday , the eu enlargement commissioner is expected to press ankara to initial an agreement to extend its customs union to the 10 new eu member states , including cyprus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish parliament in ankara originally ankara was supposed to have signed up by the end of february .
but for erdogan the signature is incredibly delicate , as it could be interpreted as recognition of cyprus , which could lead to internal political difficulties .
on the other hand , the eu made it perfectly clear that if turkey does not sign the politically sensitive protocol , there will be no accession talks come october . a further problem is the conflict between turkey and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
last december , the imf agreed to a three year aid program to the tune of more than € 10 billion -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- but turkey has not yet made good on the economic reform it pledged in return for the financial package . steinbach said that in light of the tense situation , monday 's eu delegation visit is not without significance .
he said he believed the most critical point on the agenda is the cyprus problem , but added the responsibility does not only lay with turkey , but also with greece . samira lazarovic -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatives to huddle to block turkey 's eu bid germany 's opposition conservatives are looking to france for support in their bid to dash turkey 's eu hopes by inviting french conservative economics minister sarkozy for talks .

furs for everyone ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long , heavy , dark jackets are being replaced by lighter more colorful fur " fur is selling well , but it is not the classical fur many are used to , " said susanne kolb-wachtel , general manager of the german fur association .
" it has become lighter , more colorful and even peppy . "
there will be even more light and lively uses of fur on display this week when the 57th fur and fashion frankfurt tradeshow opens wednesday , kolb-wachtel said .
fur 's image transformation from dowdy apparel to hot outfit , could be expected to have made life tougher for animal rights groups like people for the ethical treatment of animals and its efforts to prohibit fur farms around the world .
but the group , which is planning a demonstration during the frankfurt convention , does n't see a major fur revival and points out that many german departments stores no longer carry fur products .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h & m is one of the chains that has decided to stop selling fur " the fur comeback is exaggerated , " said jürgen faulmann , a peta campaign leader .
" it is a perversion for the super rich who do not know what to do with their money and pay thousands for a fur coat . "
that 's where kolb-wachtel disagrees .
fur is still a luxury item compared to other less expensive materials , but there are more types of fur in more price classes than ever .
the change in fur styles , and prices , are key reasons why the average fur buyer 's has dropped from 45-plus to 25-plus , she said .
designers return to animal pelts whether destined for young or old , streetwear shops or upscale boutiques , designers are willing to work with the controversial material again .
in winter collections presented in europe recently fox stoles were used to embellish evening gowns and copious amounts of animal pelt went into a mink bomber jacket .
bildunterschrift : fur has returned to the catwalk in a big way " we never did fur before this season , " cat bresaola spokesperson gharani strok told reporters at the london fashion week in mid-february .
" but we 've had to design it to cater to the russian market . "
russia and china are the reasons why some designers have started kitting out their models in animal pelts again .
the two countries are the new target markets , and they 're looking for something stylish and warm .
" there are two distinct markets in both russia and china , " kolb-wachtel said .
" the rich , who are looking for the most fashionable furs and the people who live in cold areas and want something long and warm to wear . "
where did the fox boa come from ?
in the face of fur 's rising sales and acceptance , it 's the people looking to stay warm , whether in germany or abroad , animal rights activists want to target .
while pointing out that there are warmer synthetic materials designed for frigid conditions , peta is also launching new initiative to make sure people know what used to wear the fur on their back .
" the media has made many people think that wearing fur is n't a crime , " faulmann said .

" i think it 's terrible that people are still wearing fur , " said the 24-year-old student from bonn .
" my mother inherited a fur coat from her mother but never wears it .

european and state oversight german fur farms are subject to supervision from the country 's individual states , which can issue orders regarding animal handling and slaughter .

furs for everyone ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long , heavy , dark jackets are being replaced by lighter more colorful fur " fur is selling well , but it is not the classical fur many are used to , " said susanne kolb-wachtel , general manager of the german fur association .

there will be even more light and lively uses of fur on display this week when the 57th fur and fashion frankfurt tradeshow opens wednesday , kolb-wachtel said .

but could it simply be a case that the drone of domestic politics has taken over ? when eu expansion commissioner olli rehn and eu council president jean asselborn arrive in ankara for talks with the turkish foreign minister abdulla gul on monday , it is likely to be under a cloud of some tension .
in the past few weeks a number of incidences have collectively led critics to suggest that turkey 's reform movement has begun to lose momentum . at the end of last year , the picture was quite different .
in the months leading up to the decision on eu entry negotiations , the parliament under prime minister tayyip erdogan passed one reform after another in a flurry of law-making activity .
it was a means to an end , and on dec .
17 last year , the european council gave the green light for entry talks to begin .
it was something of a victory for erdogan . running out of steam ? critics are now loudly questioning the lack of continued activity on turkey 's reform map , and asking whether erdogan simply ran out of steam .
one sign of such is that the turkish prime minister has not yet named a head negotiator for the entry talks even though expansion commissioner olli rehn is arriving in ankara on monday .
it 's a point of some contention in turkey , with even the turkish president ahmet necdet yezer calling on the prime minister to name someone for the post . bildunterschrift : accession negotiations are scheduled for october luxembourg 's european minister nicolas schmidt and the eu ambassador in ankara , the german diplomat hansjörg kretschmer have both criticized turkey 's slowing progress , enraging the turkish government as a result . but professor udo steinbach , director of the german orient institute in hamburg said he believed the evidence being bandied about as proof of turkey 's ebbing commitment to reform can not be used as such , and blames the media for exaggerating the situation . steinbach said that the considerable pressure to get the reform ball rolling ahead of dec .
17 may have eased off , but that is not to say that the general level of government interest in entry talks has diminished .
he said that turkey has simply shifted its attention back to the daily grind of domestic political life . a long path to reform nobody argues that turkey does n't still have a long way to go , and on monday , the eu enlargement commissioner is expected to press ankara to initial an agreement to extend its customs union to the 10 new eu member states , including cyprus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish parliament in ankara originally ankara was supposed to have signed up by the end of february .
but for erdogan the signature is incredibly delicate , as it could be interpreted as recognition of cyprus , which could lead to internal political difficulties .
on the other hand , the eu made it perfectly clear that if turkey does not sign the politically sensitive protocol , there will be no accession talks come october . a further problem is the conflict between turkey and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
last december , the imf agreed to a three year aid program to the tune of more than € 10 billion -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- but turkey has not yet made good on the economic reform it pledged in return for the financial package . steinbach said that in light of the tense situation , monday 's eu delegation visit is not without significance .
he said he believed the most critical point on the agenda is the cyprus problem , but added the responsibility does not only lay with turkey , but also with greece . samira lazarovic -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatives to huddle to block turkey 's eu bid germany 's opposition conservatives are looking to france for support in their bid to dash turkey 's eu hopes by inviting french conservative economics minister sarkozy for talks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.03.2005 eu moves to renew battered fiscal rules großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shine 's come off the pact underpinning the euro the eu hopes to hammer out the main points of a revised budget rule book this week , 16 months after the pact meant to protect the euro was left in tatters by eu heavyweight states bent on reviving their ailing economies . eu finance ministers meet from monday evening striving to agree on amendments to the stability and growth pact , the set of fiscal rules underpinning europe 's single currency the euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's jean asselborn is currently head of the eu 's rotating presidency .
the eu 's current luxembourg presidency hopes the two-day ministerial talks will pave the way for final agreement at an eu summit in brussels on march 22-23 .
" the plan is to get as close as possible to an agreement , " said a luxembourg diplomat , adding that the eu leadership would circulate a document proposing a basis for discussion by ministers . the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement of the rule book .
the pact notably stipulates that members of the 12-nation euro-zone must not run public deficits in excess of three percent of gdp . since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had for years submitted wrong data . reform without threatening recovery now the eu - still struggling to emerge from a prolonged economic slowdown - is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten recovery .
to this end the revised pact is expected to allow more flexibility for countries to run bigger deficits during slowdowns , so long as they make up the difference when growth returns . key to the amendments is the so-called " excessive deficit procedure , " triggered when a country 's accounts run too far into the red , allowing a series of warnings and ultimately the threat of huge fines .
" the main outstanding point is the question of triggering the excessive deficit procedure , " said one eu source . eu heavyweights led by germany in particular insist that the procedure should not be initiated automatically when deficit slips above three percent of gdp but should take into account a range of other factors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking a bite at the euro : german finance minister hans eichel " a really central criterion for us is how the economy is developing , " said german finance minister hans eichel .
" in order to reduce debt , both things are needed together - strict fiscal policy and growth . " italian prime minister silvio berlusconi warned friday that rome will veto any system that is not sufficiently flexible .
in particular he wants certain expenses , notably spending on infrastructure , to be excluded from deficit sums .
" i will fight at the march eu -lrb- summit -rrb- to change the parameters set by the stability pact .
without modification i am ready to block things , " he said . " credibility needs to be preserved " eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia , tasked with policing the pact , warned last week against " introducing uncertainty into the decision about the existence or otherwise of an excessive deficit . " european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- chief jean-claude trichet echoed that point thursday .
" the credibility of the excessive deficit procedure needs to be fully preserved , " he said .
" this is not only fundamental for macroeconomic stability and cohesion in the euro area but also for confidence and growth prospects in all member states .

the eu 's current luxembourg presidency hopes the two-day ministerial talks will pave the way for final agreement at an eu summit in brussels on march 22-23 .
" the plan is to get as close as possible to an agreement , " said a luxembourg diplomat , adding that the eu leadership would circulate a document proposing a basis for discussion by ministers . the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement of the rule book .
the pact notably stipulates that members of the 12-nation euro-zone must not run public deficits in excess of three percent of gdp . since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had for years submitted wrong data . reform without threatening recovery now the eu - still struggling to emerge from a prolonged economic slowdown - is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten recovery .
to this end the revised pact is expected to allow more flexibility for countries to run bigger deficits during slowdowns , so long as they make up the difference when growth returns . key to the amendments is the so-called " excessive deficit procedure , " triggered when a country 's accounts run too far into the red , allowing a series of warnings and ultimately the threat of huge fines .
" the main outstanding point is the question of triggering the excessive deficit procedure , " said one eu source . eu heavyweights led by germany in particular insist that the procedure should not be initiated automatically when deficit slips above three percent of gdp but should take into account a range of other factors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking a bite at the euro : german finance minister hans eichel " a really central criterion for us is how the economy is developing , " said german finance minister hans eichel .
" in order to reduce debt , both things are needed together - strict fiscal policy and growth . " italian prime minister silvio berlusconi warned friday that rome will veto any system that is not sufficiently flexible .
in particular he wants certain expenses , notably spending on infrastructure , to be excluded from deficit sums .
" i will fight at the march eu -lrb- summit -rrb- to change the parameters set by the stability pact .
without modification i am ready to block things , " he said . " credibility needs to be preserved " eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia , tasked with policing the pact , warned last week against " introducing uncertainty into the decision about the existence or otherwise of an excessive deficit . " european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- chief jean-claude trichet echoed that point thursday .
" the credibility of the excessive deficit procedure needs to be fully preserved , " he said .
" this is not only fundamental for macroeconomic stability and cohesion in the euro area but also for confidence and growth prospects in all member states .

former bremen favorite torsten frings curled in a precise corner from the right and ballack evaded three werder defenders to power a header past andreas reinke .
" we knew ballack was good in the air before the match but lost concentration , " explained bremen chief schaaf .
" we had an uphill task after bayern scored so early on . " the goal arrived in the seventh minute and seemed to persuade bayern to sit back and invite bremen pressure .
paraguayan nelson valdez and fabian ernst both went close to canceling out bayern 's lead as the hosts played a dangerous game .
but somehow the bayern backline - marshaled brilliantly by brazilian lucio - held firm to defeat bremen for the third time this season . schalke still in the race on goal difference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton scored his 100th league goal to keep schalke in the title race .

bayer leverkusen are another team poised to face english opposition in the champions league on wednesday with liverpool visiting the bayarena holding a 3-1 cushion from the first leg .
bayer stumbled to a 1-0 loss at sv hamburg on saturday that puts an enormous dent in their hopes of qualifying for the competition next season . belgian international daniel van buyten headed the all-important goal on 21 minutes as bayer 's aerial weakness was exposed once again .
" van buyten is a tall lad so sometimes he is going to score from set-pieces , " explained bayer manager klaus augenthaler . the reverse sees leverkusen slump to seventh in the table although they are still only four points behind third-placed bremen . hertha miss golden opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha celebrate clinching a point from the jaws of defeat .

however , nuremberg 's usually prolific striker got off the mark by equalizing after a terrible defensive mix-up in the 76th minute . cantaluppi gave away a penalty four minutes from time and was sent off for his reaction after tomas rosicky had scored to put dortmund ahead again but there was still time for robert vittek to win and convert another penalty and earn his side a point from an entertaining game . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hertha hammers unlucky hamburg hertha berlin bested hamburg sv 4-1 on saturday , but the end result was not a fair reflection of what happened on the pitch .

the lse had twice rejected informal offers from deutsche börse at that price . in the statement , the deutsche börse chief added that after withdrawing its offer , the company would make " a significant distribution of funds " to its investors , " in a move to pacify those involved with the major shareholder revolt which prompted the withdrawal . börse still believes in consolidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chairman of the board of german stock exchange , deutsche börse ag , werner g. seifert .
" we recognize that a significant portion of our shareholder base is focused on return of capital in the short term , " seifert said .
" we continue to believe that shareholders , issuers , investors and intermediaries would all benefit from consolidation of the european exchange landscape as contemplated in our proposal . " " however , " he continued , " the london stock exchange does not find itself in a position to recommend a transaction at a price we find supportable . " seifert added that despite this , deutsche börse reserved the right to make another offer if any other company makes a bid for the venerable lse . dissident shareholders issued warning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in february , two dissident shareholders went public with fears that deutsche börse would pay over the asking price for the lse and argued that the company should return around € 726 million -lrb- $ 961 million -rrb- of its cash to shareholders . they warned deutsche börse that the majority of investors opposed the bid for the london market and could take action to oust its supervisory board at the next shareholder meeting in may . porsche , the german car maker , became the first big company on the german exchange to publicly express opposition to the takeover bid last week as opposition grew . rival records share price leap euronext , the pan-european stock market operator , which is also continuing talks with the lse , sees synergies worth € 203 million from a merger . the amount was twice that of its german rival deutsche börse , which predicted synergies of € 100 million from 2008 if it won the battle to acquire the lse . euronext shareholders were said by sources to be " particularly interested " in the projected financial advantages of the deal .
the company operates the exchanges in paris , amsterdam , brussels and lisbon . the price of shares in euronext rose by 9.16 percent in early dealing on monday .
shares in euronext gained 9.16 percent to 31.10 euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.03.2005 eu moves to renew battered fiscal rules großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shine 's come off the pact underpinning the euro the eu hopes to hammer out the main points of a revised budget rule book this week , 16 months after the pact meant to protect the euro was left in tatters by eu heavyweight states bent on reviving their ailing economies . eu finance ministers meet from monday evening striving to agree on amendments to the stability and growth pact , the set of fiscal rules underpinning europe 's single currency the euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's jean asselborn is currently head of the eu 's rotating presidency .
the eu 's current luxembourg presidency hopes the two-day ministerial talks will pave the way for final agreement at an eu summit in brussels on march 22-23 .
" the plan is to get as close as possible to an agreement , " said a luxembourg diplomat , adding that the eu leadership would circulate a document proposing a basis for discussion by ministers . the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement of the rule book .
the pact notably stipulates that members of the 12-nation euro-zone must not run public deficits in excess of three percent of gdp . since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had for years submitted wrong data . reform without threatening recovery now the eu - still struggling to emerge from a prolonged economic slowdown - is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten recovery .

the eu 's current luxembourg presidency hopes the two-day ministerial talks will pave the way for final agreement at an eu summit in brussels on march 22-23 .
" the plan is to get as close as possible to an agreement , " said a luxembourg diplomat , adding that the eu leadership would circulate a document proposing a basis for discussion by ministers . the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement of the rule book .
the pact notably stipulates that members of the 12-nation euro-zone must not run public deficits in excess of three percent of gdp . since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had for years submitted wrong data . reform without threatening recovery now the eu - still struggling to emerge from a prolonged economic slowdown - is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten recovery .
to this end the revised pact is expected to allow more flexibility for countries to run bigger deficits during slowdowns , so long as they make up the difference when growth returns . key to the amendments is the so-called " excessive deficit procedure , " triggered when a country 's accounts run too far into the red , allowing a series of warnings and ultimately the threat of huge fines .
" the main outstanding point is the question of triggering the excessive deficit procedure , " said one eu source . eu heavyweights led by germany in particular insist that the procedure should not be initiated automatically when deficit slips above three percent of gdp but should take into account a range of other factors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking a bite at the euro : german finance minister hans eichel " a really central criterion for us is how the economy is developing , " said german finance minister hans eichel .
" in order to reduce debt , both things are needed together - strict fiscal policy and growth . " italian prime minister silvio berlusconi warned friday that rome will veto any system that is not sufficiently flexible .
in particular he wants certain expenses , notably spending on infrastructure , to be excluded from deficit sums .
" i will fight at the march eu -lrb- summit -rrb- to change the parameters set by the stability pact .
without modification i am ready to block things , " he said . " credibility needs to be preserved " eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia , tasked with policing the pact , warned last week against " introducing uncertainty into the decision about the existence or otherwise of an excessive deficit . " european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- chief jean-claude trichet echoed that point thursday .
" the credibility of the excessive deficit procedure needs to be fully preserved , " he said .
" this is not only fundamental for macroeconomic stability and cohesion in the euro area but also for confidence and growth prospects in all member states .

" van buyten is a tall lad so sometimes he is going to score from set-pieces , " explained bayer manager klaus augenthaler . the reverse sees leverkusen slump to seventh in the table although they are still only four points behind third-placed bremen . hertha miss golden opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha celebrate clinching a point from the jaws of defeat .
hertha berlin failed to capitalize on bremen 's slip-up halving the spoils in a 1-1 draw with kaiserslautern on sunday .
defender alexander madlung rescued a point for hertha with an 85th minute effort as the capital club moved into fifth . vfb stuttgart took advantage of stumbles from their rivals to surge up to fourth courtesy of a 2-1 victory over arminia bielefeld . croat defender zvonimir soldo and brazilian cacau were on target as stuttgart closed to within one point of bremen . busy day for ref as bvb clinch draw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a messy but entertaining match saw bvb clinch a draw .
beleaguered borussia dortmund scraped a 2-2 draw with fc nuremberg in the other sunday game in which the referee awarded three penalties , two in the last four minutes , and sent off fc nuremberg 's mario cantaluppi for his ironic applause at the one that went against his team . dortmund had gone ahead through christian wörns in the 62nd minute and rode their luck when marek mintal missed from the spot four minutes later .
however , nuremberg 's usually prolific striker got off the mark by equalizing after a terrible defensive mix-up in the 76th minute . cantaluppi gave away a penalty four minutes from time and was sent off for his reaction after tomas rosicky had scored to put dortmund ahead again but there was still time for robert vittek to win and convert another penalty and earn his side a point from an entertaining game . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hertha hammers unlucky hamburg hertha berlin bested hamburg sv 4-1 on saturday , but the end result was not a fair reflection of what happened on the pitch .

he is also , according to a new poll in a men 's magazine , germany 's best dressed person . some may argue that being named best dressed person in germany is like winning the most sober person award at a bachelor party - there usually is n't much competition .
however , the winds of change may be about to blow through one of europe 's most fashion unconscious states , thanks to one of its most prominent politicians . in a country where denim vests , white socks and sandals -lrb- worn together -rrb- regularly challenge lederhosen and plumed hats in the national dress stakes , it seems that statemanship chic could be germany 's saving grace . according to the german edition of fitness and style magazine men ’ s health , germany 's best dressed person is none other than federal president and hugo boss enthusiast horst köhler . elegance with dignity the former international monetary fund chief , sworn in as president in 2004 , was nominated by a jury of journalists , advertising executives , and fashion designers for his " combination of elegance with dignity " . the 62-year-old , who serves in a mainly ceremonial role , is germany 's top diplomat and therefore the country 's most respected representative on the global stage .
after the men 's health accolade , he may also become a role model for the sartorially challenged back home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while köhler enjoys the cut of boss suits , the magazine also salutes him for his application of accessories and welcomes the fact that he buys his neckties at clearance sales , a nod to his austere side . a who 's who of german style while köhler topped the charts in the overall best dressed category , actor kai wiesinger took the title in the style section while germany 's own soccer monarch franz beckenbauer snatched the award in the business class section .
designers karl lagerfeld and wolfgang joop , as well as ex-tennis star boris becker and musician marius müller-westerhagen were also marked out among the notable winners . special mentions were also given to chancellor gerhard schröder , hamburg mayor ole von beust and the liberal fdp party chief guido westerwelle as fine role models for others to follow .

at the other end of the scale , however , things averted to type .
bayern munich goalkeeper oliver kahn was announced as the worst dressed person in germany , a remarkable feat considering the lack of fashion sense displayed by many of his counterparts off the field . kahn , a man with a penchant for garish satin shirts , was joined in the bargain basement of the poll by shabbily-suited bundestag president wolfgang thierse and comedian dirk bach who seems to have a habit of dressing in the darkened changing room of a circus outfitter . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de designer blames recession for fashion faux pas while the rest of germany is busy blaming the economy and the government for all sorts of social woes , the designer jil sander believes the current recession has made a more serious impact - on men 's fashion sense .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.03.2005 eu moves to renew battered fiscal rules großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the shine 's come off the pact underpinning the euro the eu hopes to hammer out the main points of a revised budget rule book this week , 16 months after the pact meant to protect the euro was left in tatters by eu heavyweight states bent on reviving their ailing economies . eu finance ministers meet from monday evening striving to agree on amendments to the stability and growth pact , the set of fiscal rules underpinning europe 's single currency the euro . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg 's jean asselborn is currently head of the eu 's rotating presidency .
the eu 's current luxembourg presidency hopes the two-day ministerial talks will pave the way for final agreement at an eu summit in brussels on march 22-23 .
" the plan is to get as close as possible to an agreement , " said a luxembourg diplomat , adding that the eu leadership would circulate a document proposing a basis for discussion by ministers . the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement of the rule book .
the pact notably stipulates that members of the 12-nation euro-zone must not run public deficits in excess of three percent of gdp . since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had for years submitted wrong data . reform without threatening recovery now the eu - still struggling to emerge from a prolonged economic slowdown - is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten recovery .
to this end the revised pact is expected to allow more flexibility for countries to run bigger deficits during slowdowns , so long as they make up the difference when growth returns . key to the amendments is the so-called " excessive deficit procedure , " triggered when a country 's accounts run too far into the red , allowing a series of warnings and ultimately the threat of huge fines .
" the main outstanding point is the question of triggering the excessive deficit procedure , " said one eu source . eu heavyweights led by germany in particular insist that the procedure should not be initiated automatically when deficit slips above three percent of gdp but should take into account a range of other factors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking a bite at the euro : german finance minister hans eichel " a really central criterion for us is how the economy is developing , " said german finance minister hans eichel .
" in order to reduce debt , both things are needed together - strict fiscal policy and growth . " italian prime minister silvio berlusconi warned friday that rome will veto any system that is not sufficiently flexible .
in particular he wants certain expenses , notably spending on infrastructure , to be excluded from deficit sums .
" i will fight at the march eu -lrb- summit -rrb- to change the parameters set by the stability pact .
without modification i am ready to block things , " he said . " credibility needs to be preserved " eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia , tasked with policing the pact , warned last week against " introducing uncertainty into the decision about the existence or otherwise of an excessive deficit . " european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- chief jean-claude trichet echoed that point thursday .
" the credibility of the excessive deficit procedure needs to be fully preserved , " he said .
" this is not only fundamental for macroeconomic stability and cohesion in the euro area but also for confidence and growth prospects in all member states . " the 12 euro zone ministers will meet on monday , while ministers from all 25 eu member states will meet tuesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de does europe need stability or flexibility ?

former bremen favorite torsten frings curled in a precise corner from the right and ballack evaded three werder defenders to power a header past andreas reinke .
" we knew ballack was good in the air before the match but lost concentration , " explained bremen chief schaaf .
" we had an uphill task after bayern scored so early on . " the goal arrived in the seventh minute and seemed to persuade bayern to sit back and invite bremen pressure .
paraguayan nelson valdez and fabian ernst both went close to canceling out bayern 's lead as the hosts played a dangerous game .
but somehow the bayern backline - marshaled brilliantly by brazilian lucio - held firm to defeat bremen for the third time this season . schalke still in the race on goal difference bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton scored his 100th league goal to keep schalke in the title race .

brazilian marksman ailton scored his 100th bundesliga goal on the half hour to put schalke ahead and compatriot lincoln clinched the spoils . " we were concentrated from the very first minute and i never felt we were in danger , " said schalke handler ralf rangnick .
" if there was a criticism it would be we failed to score more goals late on . " bayern and schalke are now deadlocked on 50 points and come head-to-head next sunday at the arena auf schalke . a champions league match at arsenal on wednesday is the next challenge for felix magath 's side who hold a 3-1 lead from the first leg in munich .

bayer leverkusen are another team poised to face english opposition in the champions league on wednesday with liverpool visiting the bayarena holding a 3-1 cushion from the first leg .
bayer stumbled to a 1-0 loss at sv hamburg on saturday that puts an enormous dent in their hopes of qualifying for the competition next season . belgian international daniel van buyten headed the all-important goal on 21 minutes as bayer 's aerial weakness was exposed once again .
" van buyten is a tall lad so sometimes he is going to score from set-pieces , " explained bayer manager klaus augenthaler . the reverse sees leverkusen slump to seventh in the table although they are still only four points behind third-placed bremen . hertha miss golden opportunity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha celebrate clinching a point from the jaws of defeat .

however , nuremberg 's usually prolific striker got off the mark by equalizing after a terrible defensive mix-up in the 76th minute . cantaluppi gave away a penalty four minutes from time and was sent off for his reaction after tomas rosicky had scored to put dortmund ahead again but there was still time for robert vittek to win and convert another penalty and earn his side a point from an entertaining game . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hertha hammers unlucky hamburg hertha berlin bested hamburg sv 4-1 on saturday , but the end result was not a fair reflection of what happened on the pitch .

but could it simply be a case that the drone of domestic politics has taken over ? when eu expansion commissioner olli rehn and eu council president jean asselborn arrive in ankara for talks with the turkish foreign minister abdulla gul on monday , it is likely to be under a cloud of some tension .
in the past few weeks a number of incidences have collectively led critics to suggest that turkey 's reform movement has begun to lose momentum . at the end of last year , the picture was quite different .
in the months leading up to the decision on eu entry negotiations , the parliament under prime minister tayyip erdogan passed one reform after another in a flurry of law-making activity .
it was a means to an end , and on dec .
17 last year , the european council gave the green light for entry talks to begin .
it was something of a victory for erdogan . running out of steam ? critics are now loudly questioning the lack of continued activity on turkey 's reform map , and asking whether erdogan simply ran out of steam .
one sign of such is that the turkish prime minister has not yet named a head negotiator for the entry talks even though expansion commissioner olli rehn is arriving in ankara on monday .
it 's a point of some contention in turkey , with even the turkish president ahmet necdet yezer calling on the prime minister to name someone for the post . bildunterschrift : accession negotiations are scheduled for october luxembourg 's european minister nicolas schmidt and the eu ambassador in ankara , the german diplomat hansjörg kretschmer have both criticized turkey 's slowing progress , enraging the turkish government as a result . but professor udo steinbach , director of the german orient institute in hamburg said he believed the evidence being bandied about as proof of turkey 's ebbing commitment to reform can not be used as such , and blames the media for exaggerating the situation . steinbach said that the considerable pressure to get the reform ball rolling ahead of dec .
17 may have eased off , but that is not to say that the general level of government interest in entry talks has diminished .
he said that turkey has simply shifted its attention back to the daily grind of domestic political life . a long path to reform nobody argues that turkey does n't still have a long way to go , and on monday , the eu enlargement commissioner is expected to press ankara to initial an agreement to extend its customs union to the 10 new eu member states , including cyprus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish parliament in ankara originally ankara was supposed to have signed up by the end of february .
but for erdogan the signature is incredibly delicate , as it could be interpreted as recognition of cyprus , which could lead to internal political difficulties .
on the other hand , the eu made it perfectly clear that if turkey does not sign the politically sensitive protocol , there will be no accession talks come october . a further problem is the conflict between turkey and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
last december , the imf agreed to a three year aid program to the tune of more than € 10 billion -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- but turkey has not yet made good on the economic reform it pledged in return for the financial package . steinbach said that in light of the tense situation , monday 's eu delegation visit is not without significance .
he said he believed the most critical point on the agenda is the cyprus problem , but added the responsibility does not only lay with turkey , but also with greece . samira lazarovic -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatives to huddle to block turkey 's eu bid germany 's opposition conservatives are looking to france for support in their bid to dash turkey 's eu hopes by inviting french conservative economics minister sarkozy for talks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.03.2005 is turkey losing its reform zeal ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey still has some work to do before eu entry talks get underway with the start of eu accession talks scheduled for later this year , turkey 's critics say its reform zest appears to be waning .
but could it simply be a case that the drone of domestic politics has taken over ? when eu expansion commissioner olli rehn and eu council president jean asselborn arrive in ankara for talks with the turkish foreign minister abdulla gul on monday , it is likely to be under a cloud of some tension .
in the past few weeks a number of incidences have collectively led critics to suggest that turkey 's reform movement has begun to lose momentum . at the end of last year , the picture was quite different .
in the months leading up to the decision on eu entry negotiations , the parliament under prime minister tayyip erdogan passed one reform after another in a flurry of law-making activity .
it was a means to an end , and on dec .
17 last year , the european council gave the green light for entry talks to begin .
it was something of a victory for erdogan . running out of steam ? critics are now loudly questioning the lack of continued activity on turkey 's reform map , and asking whether erdogan simply ran out of steam .
one sign of such is that the turkish prime minister has not yet named a head negotiator for the entry talks even though expansion commissioner olli rehn is arriving in ankara on monday .
it 's a point of some contention in turkey , with even the turkish president ahmet necdet yezer calling on the prime minister to name someone for the post . bildunterschrift : accession negotiations are scheduled for october luxembourg 's european minister nicolas schmidt and the eu ambassador in ankara , the german diplomat hansjörg kretschmer have both criticized turkey 's slowing progress , enraging the turkish government as a result . but professor udo steinbach , director of the german orient institute in hamburg said he believed the evidence being bandied about as proof of turkey 's ebbing commitment to reform can not be used as such , and blames the media for exaggerating the situation . steinbach said that the considerable pressure to get the reform ball rolling ahead of dec .
17 may have eased off , but that is not to say that the general level of government interest in entry talks has diminished .
he said that turkey has simply shifted its attention back to the daily grind of domestic political life . a long path to reform nobody argues that turkey does n't still have a long way to go , and on monday , the eu enlargement commissioner is expected to press ankara to initial an agreement to extend its customs union to the 10 new eu member states , including cyprus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish parliament in ankara originally ankara was supposed to have signed up by the end of february .
but for erdogan the signature is incredibly delicate , as it could be interpreted as recognition of cyprus , which could lead to internal political difficulties .
on the other hand , the eu made it perfectly clear that if turkey does not sign the politically sensitive protocol , there will be no accession talks come october . a further problem is the conflict between turkey and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
last december , the imf agreed to a three year aid program to the tune of more than € 10 billion -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- but turkey has not yet made good on the economic reform it pledged in return for the financial package . steinbach said that in light of the tense situation , monday 's eu delegation visit is not without significance .
he said he believed the most critical point on the agenda is the cyprus problem , but added the responsibility does not only lay with turkey , but also with greece . samira lazarovic -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatives to huddle to block turkey 's eu bid germany 's opposition conservatives are looking to france for support in their bid to dash turkey 's eu hopes by inviting french conservative economics minister sarkozy for talks .

the informal talks come ahead of an eu summit in two weeks time . the german chancellor and french president were at pains to demonstrate the strength of their ties , and the informal meeting in the state of north-rhine westphalia has been billed as a new landmark in their relations . topping the agenda was the european union 's growth and stability pact , which both leaders have criticized as inflexible .
germany and france have been threatened with punitive measures for allowing their public deficits to exceed eu guidelines .
speaking after their talks , the schröder and chirac stressed that the pact must be reformed to be take greater account of growth . chirac said sanctions should not be automatically triggered when the pact 's guidelines are exceeded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two leaders want to change the stability pact guidelines warning against " technocratic brutality , " chirac said the pact " must not be purely technocratic , it must be political , " and added that " each country has its own different characteristics . " under the pact , euro-zone countries are not allowed to run public deficits beyond 3 percent of their gross domestic product , however , in 2004 both france and germany were in breach of the restrictions .
but chancellor schröder has said he 's confident that changes will be made to the stability pact at the next eu leader 's summit to be held later this month . support for lebanon the leaders also discussed developments in the middle east , in particular recent events in lebanon .
in a joint declaration after their talks in germany , they demanded " free and transparent elections which would allow the lebanese people to determine their democratic future . " their call came as damascus announced that syrian troops in lebanon would pull back towards the eastern bekaa valley by the end of march , a move seen as falling short of international demands .
syria has been under intense diplomatic pressure to end its political and military grip on lebanon three decades after it sent in troops shortly after the start of lebanon 's devastating civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder was greeted by schoolchildren schröder and chirac , who consider their alliance the engine of european union integration , called on syria to make " a full withdrawal of its troops and services from lebanon as quickly as possible . " they reaffirmed their " commitment to lebanon 's independence , sovereignty and democracy " and said their countries were ready to help if needed .
" we will remain vigilant concerning the timetable for the steps to come and , like all the international community , we remain mobilized , " their declaration said . increased pressure on iran the two men also called on iran to forgo developing nuclear weapons . " the iranian government must agree to do without the production and possession of nuclear weapons and to use the nuclear program exclusively for peaceful means , " schröder said after the talks with chirac . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac demonstrated unity the aim of negotiations was " also to illicit objective guarantees , " a french-german position that britain also supports , schröder added .
both germany and france were under the impression that the us government backed their efforts , he said . chirac said he was in full agreement with schröder .
" i could have issued the same statement as the chancellor , " chirac said after the german leader finished speaking . the two men will meet again on march 18 in paris , where they will be joined by russian president vladimir putin and spanish prime minister jose luis zapatero . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu moves to renew battered fiscal rules the eu hopes to hammer out the main points of a revised budget rule book this week , 16 months after the pact meant to protect the euro was left in tatters by eu heavyweight states bent on reviving their ailing economies .

the eu 's current luxembourg presidency hopes the two-day ministerial talks will pave the way for final agreement at an eu summit in brussels on march 22-23 .
" the plan is to get as close as possible to an agreement , " said a luxembourg diplomat , adding that the eu leadership would circulate a document proposing a basis for discussion by ministers . the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement of the rule book .
the pact notably stipulates that members of the 12-nation euro-zone must not run public deficits in excess of three percent of gdp . since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had for years submitted wrong data . reform without threatening recovery now the eu - still struggling to emerge from a prolonged economic slowdown - is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten recovery .
to this end the revised pact is expected to allow more flexibility for countries to run bigger deficits during slowdowns , so long as they make up the difference when growth returns . key to the amendments is the so-called " excessive deficit procedure , " triggered when a country 's accounts run too far into the red , allowing a series of warnings and ultimately the threat of huge fines .
" the main outstanding point is the question of triggering the excessive deficit procedure , " said one eu source . eu heavyweights led by germany in particular insist that the procedure should not be initiated automatically when deficit slips above three percent of gdp but should take into account a range of other factors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking a bite at the euro : german finance minister hans eichel " a really central criterion for us is how the economy is developing , " said german finance minister hans eichel .
" in order to reduce debt , both things are needed together - strict fiscal policy and growth . " italian prime minister silvio berlusconi warned friday that rome will veto any system that is not sufficiently flexible .
in particular he wants certain expenses , notably spending on infrastructure , to be excluded from deficit sums .
" i will fight at the march eu -lrb- summit -rrb- to change the parameters set by the stability pact .
without modification i am ready to block things , " he said . " credibility needs to be preserved " eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia , tasked with policing the pact , warned last week against " introducing uncertainty into the decision about the existence or otherwise of an excessive deficit . " european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- chief jean-claude trichet echoed that point thursday .
" the credibility of the excessive deficit procedure needs to be fully preserved , " he said .
" this is not only fundamental for macroeconomic stability and cohesion in the euro area but also for confidence and growth prospects in all member states . " the 12 euro zone ministers will meet on monday , while ministers from all 25 eu member states will meet tuesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de does europe need stability or flexibility ?

he is also , according to a new poll in a men 's magazine , germany 's best dressed person . some may argue that being named best dressed person in germany is like winning the most sober person award at a bachelor party - there usually is n't much competition .
however , the winds of change may be about to blow through one of europe 's most fashion unconscious states , thanks to one of its most prominent politicians . in a country where denim vests , white socks and sandals -lrb- worn together -rrb- regularly challenge lederhosen and plumed hats in the national dress stakes , it seems that statemanship chic could be germany 's saving grace . according to the german edition of fitness and style magazine men ’ s health , germany 's best dressed person is none other than federal president and hugo boss enthusiast horst köhler . elegance with dignity the former international monetary fund chief , sworn in as president in 2004 , was nominated by a jury of journalists , advertising executives , and fashion designers for his " combination of elegance with dignity " . the 62-year-old , who serves in a mainly ceremonial role , is germany 's top diplomat and therefore the country 's most respected representative on the global stage .
after the men 's health accolade , he may also become a role model for the sartorially challenged back home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while köhler enjoys the cut of boss suits , the magazine also salutes him for his application of accessories and welcomes the fact that he buys his neckties at clearance sales , a nod to his austere side . a who 's who of german style while köhler topped the charts in the overall best dressed category , actor kai wiesinger took the title in the style section while germany 's own soccer monarch franz beckenbauer snatched the award in the business class section .
designers karl lagerfeld and wolfgang joop , as well as ex-tennis star boris becker and musician marius müller-westerhagen were also marked out among the notable winners . special mentions were also given to chancellor gerhard schröder , hamburg mayor ole von beust and the liberal fdp party chief guido westerwelle as fine role models for others to follow .
oli drops the ball in fashion game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli forgot to change out of his goalkeeper 's shirt in this appearance on german tv show " wetten dass . "
at the other end of the scale , however , things averted to type .
bayern munich goalkeeper oliver kahn was announced as the worst dressed person in germany , a remarkable feat considering the lack of fashion sense displayed by many of his counterparts off the field . kahn , a man with a penchant for garish satin shirts , was joined in the bargain basement of the poll by shabbily-suited bundestag president wolfgang thierse and comedian dirk bach who seems to have a habit of dressing in the darkened changing room of a circus outfitter . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de designer blames recession for fashion faux pas while the rest of germany is busy blaming the economy and the government for all sorts of social woes , the designer jil sander believes the current recession has made a more serious impact - on men 's fashion sense .

it 's still used in heavy jackets but is also appearing as scarves and decorative trim .
animal rights groups want to make sure consumers know what animal became a stole . there was a time when fur in germany was associated with heavy older woman getting dressed up for church or a coffee-and-cake afternoon .
but , not anymore .
germans of all ages and sizes are now increasingly snuggling into the fluffy material .
after suffering from two years of decline , the german fur industry grew by 2.5 percent to € 965 million -lrb- $ 1.266 million -rrb- in 2004 , and fur is back on catwalks and market squares all around europe .
furs for everyone ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long , heavy , dark jackets are being replaced by lighter more colorful fur " fur is selling well , but it is not the classical fur many are used to , " said susanne kolb-wachtel , general manager of the german fur association .
" it has become lighter , more colorful and even peppy . "
there will be even more light and lively uses of fur on display this week when the 57th fur and fashion frankfurt tradeshow opens wednesday , kolb-wachtel said .
fur 's image transformation from dowdy apparel to hot outfit , could be expected to have made life tougher for animal rights groups like people for the ethical treatment of animals and its efforts to prohibit fur farms around the world .
but the group , which is planning a demonstration during the frankfurt convention , does n't see a major fur revival and points out that many german departments stores no longer carry fur products .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h & m is one of the chains that has decided to stop selling fur " the fur comeback is exaggerated , " said jürgen faulmann , a peta campaign leader .
" it is a perversion for the super rich who do not know what to do with their money and pay thousands for a fur coat . "
that 's where kolb-wachtel disagrees .
fur is still a luxury item compared to other less expensive materials , but there are more types of fur in more price classes than ever .
the change in fur styles , and prices , are key reasons why the average fur buyer 's has dropped from 45-plus to 25-plus , she said .
designers return to animal pelts whether destined for young or old , streetwear shops or upscale boutiques , designers are willing to work with the controversial material again .
in winter collections presented in europe recently fox stoles were used to embellish evening gowns and copious amounts of animal pelt went into a mink bomber jacket .
bildunterschrift : fur has returned to the catwalk in a big way " we never did fur before this season , " cat bresaola spokesperson gharani strok told reporters at the london fashion week in mid-february .
" but we 've had to design it to cater to the russian market . "
russia and china are the reasons why some designers have started kitting out their models in animal pelts again .
the two countries are the new target markets , and they 're looking for something stylish and warm .
" there are two distinct markets in both russia and china , " kolb-wachtel said .
" the rich , who are looking for the most fashionable furs and the people who live in cold areas and want something long and warm to wear . "
where did the fox boa come from ?
in the face of fur 's rising sales and acceptance , it 's the people looking to stay warm , whether in germany or abroad , animal rights activists want to target .
while pointing out that there are warmer synthetic materials designed for frigid conditions , peta is also launching new initiative to make sure people know what used to wear the fur on their back .
" the media has made many people think that wearing fur is n't a crime , " faulmann said .
" with our new theme we want to show people the parts of the fox that is left over when the its fur is gone . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress franka potente and musician bela b. pose for peta 's " i 'd would rather wear tattoos than fur " campaign some people , like verena pirchner , whose jacket 's cotton trim - to the untrained eye - looks like a closely shorn mink , do n't need any more convincing .
" i think it 's terrible that people are still wearing fur , " said the 24-year-old student from bonn .
" my mother inherited a fur coat from her mother but never wears it .
i would n't wear it either . "
european and state oversight german fur farms are subject to supervision from the country 's individual states , which can issue orders regarding animal handling and slaughter .
how effective the orders are at improving animals ' living conditions is disputable .
" it is not possible to understand why the order , which should have improved conditions for fur-bearing animals , to this day is not being enforced , " said wolfgang apel , president of the german animal protection association , of a 2001 state order in schleswig-holstein .
the german fur association 's kolb-wachtel said she was proud of german fur farmers ' willingness to invest in ways to keep animals from suffering , including larger cages , safe toys to keep them occupied and shorter transportation times before slaughter .
customers reading labels and thinking twice consumers who want to know what they 're paying for have to rely on the garment 's label to know what animals there fur comes from , kolb-wachtel said .
and people are examining those labels , and thinking twice before buying a fur .
" i definitely gave it a lot of thought , " said ute krieg , from the west german city of koblenz , of her decision to buy a rabbit fur coat .

the eu 's current luxembourg presidency hopes the two-day ministerial talks will pave the way for final agreement at an eu summit in brussels on march 22-23 .
" the plan is to get as close as possible to an agreement , " said a luxembourg diplomat , adding that the eu leadership would circulate a document proposing a basis for discussion by ministers . the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement of the rule book .
the pact notably stipulates that members of the 12-nation euro-zone must not run public deficits in excess of three percent of gdp . since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had for years submitted wrong data . reform without threatening recovery now the eu - still struggling to emerge from a prolonged economic slowdown - is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten recovery .
to this end the revised pact is expected to allow more flexibility for countries to run bigger deficits during slowdowns , so long as they make up the difference when growth returns . key to the amendments is the so-called " excessive deficit procedure , " triggered when a country 's accounts run too far into the red , allowing a series of warnings and ultimately the threat of huge fines .
" the main outstanding point is the question of triggering the excessive deficit procedure , " said one eu source . eu heavyweights led by germany in particular insist that the procedure should not be initiated automatically when deficit slips above three percent of gdp but should take into account a range of other factors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking a bite at the euro : german finance minister hans eichel " a really central criterion for us is how the economy is developing , " said german finance minister hans eichel .
" in order to reduce debt , both things are needed together - strict fiscal policy and growth . " italian prime minister silvio berlusconi warned friday that rome will veto any system that is not sufficiently flexible .
in particular he wants certain expenses , notably spending on infrastructure , to be excluded from deficit sums .
" i will fight at the march eu -lrb- summit -rrb- to change the parameters set by the stability pact .
without modification i am ready to block things , " he said . " credibility needs to be preserved " eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia , tasked with policing the pact , warned last week against " introducing uncertainty into the decision about the existence or otherwise of an excessive deficit . " european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- chief jean-claude trichet echoed that point thursday .
" the credibility of the excessive deficit procedure needs to be fully preserved , " he said .

bildunterschrift : fur has returned to the catwalk in a big way " we never did fur before this season , " cat bresaola spokesperson gharani strok told reporters at the london fashion week in mid-february .
" but we 've had to design it to cater to the russian market . "
russia and china are the reasons why some designers have started kitting out their models in animal pelts again .
the two countries are the new target markets , and they 're looking for something stylish and warm .
" there are two distinct markets in both russia and china , " kolb-wachtel said .
" the rich , who are looking for the most fashionable furs and the people who live in cold areas and want something long and warm to wear . "
where did the fox boa come from ?
in the face of fur 's rising sales and acceptance , it 's the people looking to stay warm , whether in germany or abroad , animal rights activists want to target .
while pointing out that there are warmer synthetic materials designed for frigid conditions , peta is also launching new initiative to make sure people know what used to wear the fur on their back .
" the media has made many people think that wearing fur is n't a crime , " faulmann said .
" with our new theme we want to show people the parts of the fox that is left over when the its fur is gone . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress franka potente and musician bela b. pose for peta 's " i 'd would rather wear tattoos than fur " campaign some people , like verena pirchner , whose jacket 's cotton trim - to the untrained eye - looks like a closely shorn mink , do n't need any more convincing .
" i think it 's terrible that people are still wearing fur , " said the 24-year-old student from bonn .
" my mother inherited a fur coat from her mother but never wears it .
i would n't wear it either . "
european and state oversight german fur farms are subject to supervision from the country 's individual states , which can issue orders regarding animal handling and slaughter .
how effective the orders are at improving animals ' living conditions is disputable .
" it is not possible to understand why the order , which should have improved conditions for fur-bearing animals , to this day is not being enforced , " said wolfgang apel , president of the german animal protection association , of a 2001 state order in schleswig-holstein .
the german fur association 's kolb-wachtel said she was proud of german fur farmers ' willingness to invest in ways to keep animals from suffering , including larger cages , safe toys to keep them occupied and shorter transportation times before slaughter .
customers reading labels and thinking twice consumers who want to know what they 're paying for have to rely on the garment 's label to know what animals there fur comes from , kolb-wachtel said .
and people are examining those labels , and thinking twice before buying a fur .
" i definitely gave it a lot of thought , " said ute krieg , from the west german city of koblenz , of her decision to buy a rabbit fur coat .
" i would not want to wear anything that was tormented .

the eu 's current luxembourg presidency hopes the two-day ministerial talks will pave the way for final agreement at an eu summit in brussels on march 22-23 .
" the plan is to get as close as possible to an agreement , " said a luxembourg diplomat , adding that the eu leadership would circulate a document proposing a basis for discussion by ministers . the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement of the rule book .
the pact notably stipulates that members of the 12-nation euro-zone must not run public deficits in excess of three percent of gdp . since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had for years submitted wrong data . reform without threatening recovery now the eu - still struggling to emerge from a prolonged economic slowdown - is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten recovery .
to this end the revised pact is expected to allow more flexibility for countries to run bigger deficits during slowdowns , so long as they make up the difference when growth returns . key to the amendments is the so-called " excessive deficit procedure , " triggered when a country 's accounts run too far into the red , allowing a series of warnings and ultimately the threat of huge fines .
" the main outstanding point is the question of triggering the excessive deficit procedure , " said one eu source . eu heavyweights led by germany in particular insist that the procedure should not be initiated automatically when deficit slips above three percent of gdp but should take into account a range of other factors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking a bite at the euro : german finance minister hans eichel " a really central criterion for us is how the economy is developing , " said german finance minister hans eichel .
" in order to reduce debt , both things are needed together - strict fiscal policy and growth . " italian prime minister silvio berlusconi warned friday that rome will veto any system that is not sufficiently flexible .
in particular he wants certain expenses , notably spending on infrastructure , to be excluded from deficit sums .
" i will fight at the march eu -lrb- summit -rrb- to change the parameters set by the stability pact .
without modification i am ready to block things , " he said . " credibility needs to be preserved " eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia , tasked with policing the pact , warned last week against " introducing uncertainty into the decision about the existence or otherwise of an excessive deficit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.03.2005 is turkey losing its reform zeal ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey still has some work to do before eu entry talks get underway with the start of eu accession talks scheduled for later this year , turkey 's critics say its reform zest appears to be waning .
but could it simply be a case that the drone of domestic politics has taken over ? when eu expansion commissioner olli rehn and eu council president jean asselborn arrive in ankara for talks with the turkish foreign minister abdulla gul on monday , it is likely to be under a cloud of some tension .
in the past few weeks a number of incidences have collectively led critics to suggest that turkey 's reform movement has begun to lose momentum . at the end of last year , the picture was quite different .
in the months leading up to the decision on eu entry negotiations , the parliament under prime minister tayyip erdogan passed one reform after another in a flurry of law-making activity .
it was a means to an end , and on dec .
17 last year , the european council gave the green light for entry talks to begin .
it was something of a victory for erdogan . running out of steam ? critics are now loudly questioning the lack of continued activity on turkey 's reform map , and asking whether erdogan simply ran out of steam .
one sign of such is that the turkish prime minister has not yet named a head negotiator for the entry talks even though expansion commissioner olli rehn is arriving in ankara on monday .
it 's a point of some contention in turkey , with even the turkish president ahmet necdet yezer calling on the prime minister to name someone for the post . bildunterschrift : accession negotiations are scheduled for october luxembourg 's european minister nicolas schmidt and the eu ambassador in ankara , the german diplomat hansjörg kretschmer have both criticized turkey 's slowing progress , enraging the turkish government as a result . but professor udo steinbach , director of the german orient institute in hamburg said he believed the evidence being bandied about as proof of turkey 's ebbing commitment to reform can not be used as such , and blames the media for exaggerating the situation . steinbach said that the considerable pressure to get the reform ball rolling ahead of dec .
17 may have eased off , but that is not to say that the general level of government interest in entry talks has diminished .
he said that turkey has simply shifted its attention back to the daily grind of domestic political life . a long path to reform nobody argues that turkey does n't still have a long way to go , and on monday , the eu enlargement commissioner is expected to press ankara to initial an agreement to extend its customs union to the 10 new eu member states , including cyprus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish parliament in ankara originally ankara was supposed to have signed up by the end of february .
but for erdogan the signature is incredibly delicate , as it could be interpreted as recognition of cyprus , which could lead to internal political difficulties .
on the other hand , the eu made it perfectly clear that if turkey does not sign the politically sensitive protocol , there will be no accession talks come october . a further problem is the conflict between turkey and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
last december , the imf agreed to a three year aid program to the tune of more than € 10 billion -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- but turkey has not yet made good on the economic reform it pledged in return for the financial package . steinbach said that in light of the tense situation , monday 's eu delegation visit is not without significance .
he said he believed the most critical point on the agenda is the cyprus problem , but added the responsibility does not only lay with turkey , but also with greece . samira lazarovic -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatives to huddle to block turkey 's eu bid germany 's opposition conservatives are looking to france for support in their bid to dash turkey 's eu hopes by inviting french conservative economics minister sarkozy for talks .

the informal talks come ahead of an eu summit in two weeks time . the german chancellor and french president were at pains to demonstrate the strength of their ties , and the informal meeting in the state of north-rhine westphalia has been billed as a new landmark in their relations . topping the agenda was the european union 's growth and stability pact , which both leaders have criticized as inflexible .
germany and france have been threatened with punitive measures for allowing their public deficits to exceed eu guidelines .
speaking after their talks , the schröder and chirac stressed that the pact must be reformed to be take greater account of growth . chirac said sanctions should not be automatically triggered when the pact 's guidelines are exceeded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two leaders want to change the stability pact guidelines warning against " technocratic brutality , " chirac said the pact " must not be purely technocratic , it must be political , " and added that " each country has its own different characteristics . " under the pact , euro-zone countries are not allowed to run public deficits beyond 3 percent of their gross domestic product , however , in 2004 both france and germany were in breach of the restrictions .
but chancellor schröder has said he 's confident that changes will be made to the stability pact at the next eu leader 's summit to be held later this month . support for lebanon the leaders also discussed developments in the middle east , in particular recent events in lebanon .
in a joint declaration after their talks in germany , they demanded " free and transparent elections which would allow the lebanese people to determine their democratic future . " their call came as damascus announced that syrian troops in lebanon would pull back towards the eastern bekaa valley by the end of march , a move seen as falling short of international demands .
syria has been under intense diplomatic pressure to end its political and military grip on lebanon three decades after it sent in troops shortly after the start of lebanon 's devastating civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder was greeted by schoolchildren schröder and chirac , who consider their alliance the engine of european union integration , called on syria to make " a full withdrawal of its troops and services from lebanon as quickly as possible . " they reaffirmed their " commitment to lebanon 's independence , sovereignty and democracy " and said their countries were ready to help if needed .
" we will remain vigilant concerning the timetable for the steps to come and , like all the international community , we remain mobilized , " their declaration said . increased pressure on iran the two men also called on iran to forgo developing nuclear weapons . " the iranian government must agree to do without the production and possession of nuclear weapons and to use the nuclear program exclusively for peaceful means , " schröder said after the talks with chirac . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac demonstrated unity the aim of negotiations was " also to illicit objective guarantees , " a french-german position that britain also supports , schröder added .
both germany and france were under the impression that the us government backed their efforts , he said . chirac said he was in full agreement with schröder .
" i could have issued the same statement as the chancellor , " chirac said after the german leader finished speaking . the two men will meet again on march 18 in paris , where they will be joined by russian president vladimir putin and spanish prime minister jose luis zapatero . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu moves to renew battered fiscal rules the eu hopes to hammer out the main points of a revised budget rule book this week , 16 months after the pact meant to protect the euro was left in tatters by eu heavyweight states bent on reviving their ailing economies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 07.03.2005 model german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the competition was n't fierce but horst köhler was delighted to win german president horst köhler is the country 's top diplomat and representative on the world stage .
he is also , according to a new poll in a men 's magazine , germany 's best dressed person . some may argue that being named best dressed person in germany is like winning the most sober person award at a bachelor party - there usually is n't much competition .
however , the winds of change may be about to blow through one of europe 's most fashion unconscious states , thanks to one of its most prominent politicians . in a country where denim vests , white socks and sandals -lrb- worn together -rrb- regularly challenge lederhosen and plumed hats in the national dress stakes , it seems that statemanship chic could be germany 's saving grace . according to the german edition of fitness and style magazine men ’ s health , germany 's best dressed person is none other than federal president and hugo boss enthusiast horst köhler . elegance with dignity the former international monetary fund chief , sworn in as president in 2004 , was nominated by a jury of journalists , advertising executives , and fashion designers for his " combination of elegance with dignity " . the 62-year-old , who serves in a mainly ceremonial role , is germany 's top diplomat and therefore the country 's most respected representative on the global stage .
after the men 's health accolade , he may also become a role model for the sartorially challenged back home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while köhler enjoys the cut of boss suits , the magazine also salutes him for his application of accessories and welcomes the fact that he buys his neckties at clearance sales , a nod to his austere side . a who 's who of german style while köhler topped the charts in the overall best dressed category , actor kai wiesinger took the title in the style section while germany 's own soccer monarch franz beckenbauer snatched the award in the business class section .
designers karl lagerfeld and wolfgang joop , as well as ex-tennis star boris becker and musician marius müller-westerhagen were also marked out among the notable winners . special mentions were also given to chancellor gerhard schröder , hamburg mayor ole von beust and the liberal fdp party chief guido westerwelle as fine role models for others to follow .
oli drops the ball in fashion game bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli forgot to change out of his goalkeeper 's shirt in this appearance on german tv show " wetten dass . "
at the other end of the scale , however , things averted to type .
bayern munich goalkeeper oliver kahn was announced as the worst dressed person in germany , a remarkable feat considering the lack of fashion sense displayed by many of his counterparts off the field . kahn , a man with a penchant for garish satin shirts , was joined in the bargain basement of the poll by shabbily-suited bundestag president wolfgang thierse and comedian dirk bach who seems to have a habit of dressing in the darkened changing room of a circus outfitter . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de designer blames recession for fashion faux pas while the rest of germany is busy blaming the economy and the government for all sorts of social woes , the designer jil sander believes the current recession has made a more serious impact - on men 's fashion sense .

but could it simply be a case that the drone of domestic politics has taken over ? when eu expansion commissioner olli rehn and eu council president jean asselborn arrive in ankara for talks with the turkish foreign minister abdulla gul on monday , it is likely to be under a cloud of some tension .

it was something of a victory for erdogan . running out of steam ? critics are now loudly questioning the lack of continued activity on turkey 's reform map , and asking whether erdogan simply ran out of steam .
one sign of such is that the turkish prime minister has not yet named a head negotiator for the entry talks even though expansion commissioner olli rehn is arriving in ankara on monday .

last december , the imf agreed to a three year aid program to the tune of more than € 10 billion -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- but turkey has not yet made good on the economic reform it pledged in return for the financial package . steinbach said that in light of the tense situation , monday 's eu delegation visit is not without significance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.03.2005 fur makes a comeback in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this fox at the opel zoo is safe from becoming someone 's scarf fur is n't just for a trip to church anymore .
it 's still used in heavy jackets but is also appearing as scarves and decorative trim .
animal rights groups want to make sure consumers know what animal became a stole . there was a time when fur in germany was associated with heavy older woman getting dressed up for church or a coffee-and-cake afternoon .
but , not anymore .
germans of all ages and sizes are now increasingly snuggling into the fluffy material .
after suffering from two years of decline , the german fur industry grew by 2.5 percent to € 965 million -lrb- $ 1.266 million -rrb- in 2004 , and fur is back on catwalks and market squares all around europe .
furs for everyone ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long , heavy , dark jackets are being replaced by lighter more colorful fur " fur is selling well , but it is not the classical fur many are used to , " said susanne kolb-wachtel , general manager of the german fur association .
" it has become lighter , more colorful and even peppy . "
there will be even more light and lively uses of fur on display this week when the 57th fur and fashion frankfurt tradeshow opens wednesday , kolb-wachtel said .
fur 's image transformation from dowdy apparel to hot outfit , could be expected to have made life tougher for animal rights groups like people for the ethical treatment of animals and its efforts to prohibit fur farms around the world .
but the group , which is planning a demonstration during the frankfurt convention , does n't see a major fur revival and points out that many german departments stores no longer carry fur products .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h & m is one of the chains that has decided to stop selling fur " the fur comeback is exaggerated , " said jürgen faulmann , a peta campaign leader .
" it is a perversion for the super rich who do not know what to do with their money and pay thousands for a fur coat . "
that 's where kolb-wachtel disagrees .

there will be even more light and lively uses of fur on display this week when the 57th fur and fashion frankfurt tradeshow opens wednesday , kolb-wachtel said .

the two countries are the new target markets , and they 're looking for something stylish and warm .
" there are two distinct markets in both russia and china , " kolb-wachtel said .
" the rich , who are looking for the most fashionable furs and the people who live in cold areas and want something long and warm to wear . "
where did the fox boa come from ?
in the face of fur 's rising sales and acceptance , it 's the people looking to stay warm , whether in germany or abroad , animal rights activists want to target .
while pointing out that there are warmer synthetic materials designed for frigid conditions , peta is also launching new initiative to make sure people know what used to wear the fur on their back .
" the media has made many people think that wearing fur is n't a crime , " faulmann said .
" with our new theme we want to show people the parts of the fox that is left over when the its fur is gone . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress franka potente and musician bela b. pose for peta 's " i 'd would rather wear tattoos than fur " campaign some people , like verena pirchner , whose jacket 's cotton trim - to the untrained eye - looks like a closely shorn mink , do n't need any more convincing .
" i think it 's terrible that people are still wearing fur , " said the 24-year-old student from bonn .
" my mother inherited a fur coat from her mother but never wears it .
i would n't wear it either . "
european and state oversight german fur farms are subject to supervision from the country 's individual states , which can issue orders regarding animal handling and slaughter .
how effective the orders are at improving animals ' living conditions is disputable .
" it is not possible to understand why the order , which should have improved conditions for fur-bearing animals , to this day is not being enforced , " said wolfgang apel , president of the german animal protection association , of a 2001 state order in schleswig-holstein .
the german fur association 's kolb-wachtel said she was proud of german fur farmers ' willingness to invest in ways to keep animals from suffering , including larger cages , safe toys to keep them occupied and shorter transportation times before slaughter .
customers reading labels and thinking twice consumers who want to know what they 're paying for have to rely on the garment 's label to know what animals there fur comes from , kolb-wachtel said .
and people are examining those labels , and thinking twice before buying a fur .
" i definitely gave it a lot of thought , " said ute krieg , from the west german city of koblenz , of her decision to buy a rabbit fur coat .
" i would not want to wear anything that was tormented .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.03.2005 is turkey losing its reform zeal ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey still has some work to do before eu entry talks get underway with the start of eu accession talks scheduled for later this year , turkey 's critics say its reform zest appears to be waning .
but could it simply be a case that the drone of domestic politics has taken over ? when eu expansion commissioner olli rehn and eu council president jean asselborn arrive in ankara for talks with the turkish foreign minister abdulla gul on monday , it is likely to be under a cloud of some tension .
in the past few weeks a number of incidences have collectively led critics to suggest that turkey 's reform movement has begun to lose momentum . at the end of last year , the picture was quite different .
in the months leading up to the decision on eu entry negotiations , the parliament under prime minister tayyip erdogan passed one reform after another in a flurry of law-making activity .
it was a means to an end , and on dec .
17 last year , the european council gave the green light for entry talks to begin .
it was something of a victory for erdogan . running out of steam ? critics are now loudly questioning the lack of continued activity on turkey 's reform map , and asking whether erdogan simply ran out of steam .
one sign of such is that the turkish prime minister has not yet named a head negotiator for the entry talks even though expansion commissioner olli rehn is arriving in ankara on monday .
it 's a point of some contention in turkey , with even the turkish president ahmet necdet yezer calling on the prime minister to name someone for the post . bildunterschrift : accession negotiations are scheduled for october luxembourg 's european minister nicolas schmidt and the eu ambassador in ankara , the german diplomat hansjörg kretschmer have both criticized turkey 's slowing progress , enraging the turkish government as a result . but professor udo steinbach , director of the german orient institute in hamburg said he believed the evidence being bandied about as proof of turkey 's ebbing commitment to reform can not be used as such , and blames the media for exaggerating the situation . steinbach said that the considerable pressure to get the reform ball rolling ahead of dec .
17 may have eased off , but that is not to say that the general level of government interest in entry talks has diminished .
he said that turkey has simply shifted its attention back to the daily grind of domestic political life . a long path to reform nobody argues that turkey does n't still have a long way to go , and on monday , the eu enlargement commissioner is expected to press ankara to initial an agreement to extend its customs union to the 10 new eu member states , including cyprus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish parliament in ankara originally ankara was supposed to have signed up by the end of february .
but for erdogan the signature is incredibly delicate , as it could be interpreted as recognition of cyprus , which could lead to internal political difficulties .
on the other hand , the eu made it perfectly clear that if turkey does not sign the politically sensitive protocol , there will be no accession talks come october . a further problem is the conflict between turkey and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
last december , the imf agreed to a three year aid program to the tune of more than € 10 billion -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- but turkey has not yet made good on the economic reform it pledged in return for the financial package . steinbach said that in light of the tense situation , monday 's eu delegation visit is not without significance .
he said he believed the most critical point on the agenda is the cyprus problem , but added the responsibility does not only lay with turkey , but also with greece . samira lazarovic -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatives to huddle to block turkey 's eu bid germany 's opposition conservatives are looking to france for support in their bid to dash turkey 's eu hopes by inviting french conservative economics minister sarkozy for talks .

" we will remain vigilant concerning the timetable for the steps to come and , like all the international community , we remain mobilized , " their declaration said . increased pressure on iran the two men also called on iran to forgo developing nuclear weapons . " the iranian government must agree to do without the production and possession of nuclear weapons and to use the nuclear program exclusively for peaceful means , " schröder said after the talks with chirac . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac demonstrated unity the aim of negotiations was " also to illicit objective guarantees , " a french-german position that britain also supports , schröder added .
both germany and france were under the impression that the us government backed their efforts , he said . chirac said he was in full agreement with schröder .

the informal talks come ahead of an eu summit in two weeks time . the german chancellor and french president were at pains to demonstrate the strength of their ties , and the informal meeting in the state of north-rhine westphalia has been billed as a new landmark in their relations . topping the agenda was the european union 's growth and stability pact , which both leaders have criticized as inflexible .
germany and france have been threatened with punitive measures for allowing their public deficits to exceed eu guidelines .
speaking after their talks , the schröder and chirac stressed that the pact must be reformed to be take greater account of growth . chirac said sanctions should not be automatically triggered when the pact 's guidelines are exceeded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two leaders want to change the stability pact guidelines warning against " technocratic brutality , " chirac said the pact " must not be purely technocratic , it must be political , " and added that " each country has its own different characteristics . " under the pact , euro-zone countries are not allowed to run public deficits beyond 3 percent of their gross domestic product , however , in 2004 both france and germany were in breach of the restrictions .
but chancellor schröder has said he 's confident that changes will be made to the stability pact at the next eu leader 's summit to be held later this month . support for lebanon the leaders also discussed developments in the middle east , in particular recent events in lebanon .
in a joint declaration after their talks in germany , they demanded " free and transparent elections which would allow the lebanese people to determine their democratic future . " their call came as damascus announced that syrian troops in lebanon would pull back towards the eastern bekaa valley by the end of march , a move seen as falling short of international demands .
syria has been under intense diplomatic pressure to end its political and military grip on lebanon three decades after it sent in troops shortly after the start of lebanon 's devastating civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder was greeted by schoolchildren schröder and chirac , who consider their alliance the engine of european union integration , called on syria to make " a full withdrawal of its troops and services from lebanon as quickly as possible . " they reaffirmed their " commitment to lebanon 's independence , sovereignty and democracy " and said their countries were ready to help if needed .
" we will remain vigilant concerning the timetable for the steps to come and , like all the international community , we remain mobilized , " their declaration said . increased pressure on iran the two men also called on iran to forgo developing nuclear weapons . " the iranian government must agree to do without the production and possession of nuclear weapons and to use the nuclear program exclusively for peaceful means , " schröder said after the talks with chirac . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac demonstrated unity the aim of negotiations was " also to illicit objective guarantees , " a french-german position that britain also supports , schröder added .
both germany and france were under the impression that the us government backed their efforts , he said . chirac said he was in full agreement with schröder .
" i could have issued the same statement as the chancellor , " chirac said after the german leader finished speaking . the two men will meet again on march 18 in paris , where they will be joined by russian president vladimir putin and spanish prime minister jose luis zapatero . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu moves to renew battered fiscal rules the eu hopes to hammer out the main points of a revised budget rule book this week , 16 months after the pact meant to protect the euro was left in tatters by eu heavyweight states bent on reviving their ailing economies .

the eu 's current luxembourg presidency hopes the two-day ministerial talks will pave the way for final agreement at an eu summit in brussels on march 22-23 .
" the plan is to get as close as possible to an agreement , " said a luxembourg diplomat , adding that the eu leadership would circulate a document proposing a basis for discussion by ministers . the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement of the rule book .
the pact notably stipulates that members of the 12-nation euro-zone must not run public deficits in excess of three percent of gdp . since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had for years submitted wrong data . reform without threatening recovery now the eu - still struggling to emerge from a prolonged economic slowdown - is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten recovery .
to this end the revised pact is expected to allow more flexibility for countries to run bigger deficits during slowdowns , so long as they make up the difference when growth returns . key to the amendments is the so-called " excessive deficit procedure , " triggered when a country 's accounts run too far into the red , allowing a series of warnings and ultimately the threat of huge fines .
" the main outstanding point is the question of triggering the excessive deficit procedure , " said one eu source . eu heavyweights led by germany in particular insist that the procedure should not be initiated automatically when deficit slips above three percent of gdp but should take into account a range of other factors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking a bite at the euro : german finance minister hans eichel " a really central criterion for us is how the economy is developing , " said german finance minister hans eichel .
" in order to reduce debt , both things are needed together - strict fiscal policy and growth . " italian prime minister silvio berlusconi warned friday that rome will veto any system that is not sufficiently flexible .
in particular he wants certain expenses , notably spending on infrastructure , to be excluded from deficit sums .
" i will fight at the march eu -lrb- summit -rrb- to change the parameters set by the stability pact .
without modification i am ready to block things , " he said . " credibility needs to be preserved " eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia , tasked with policing the pact , warned last week against " introducing uncertainty into the decision about the existence or otherwise of an excessive deficit . " european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- chief jean-claude trichet echoed that point thursday .
" the credibility of the excessive deficit procedure needs to be fully preserved , " he said .

the eu 's current luxembourg presidency hopes the two-day ministerial talks will pave the way for final agreement at an eu summit in brussels on march 22-23 .
" the plan is to get as close as possible to an agreement , " said a luxembourg diplomat , adding that the eu leadership would circulate a document proposing a basis for discussion by ministers . the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement of the rule book .
the pact notably stipulates that members of the 12-nation euro-zone must not run public deficits in excess of three percent of gdp . since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had for years submitted wrong data . reform without threatening recovery now the eu - still struggling to emerge from a prolonged economic slowdown - is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten recovery .
to this end the revised pact is expected to allow more flexibility for countries to run bigger deficits during slowdowns , so long as they make up the difference when growth returns . key to the amendments is the so-called " excessive deficit procedure , " triggered when a country 's accounts run too far into the red , allowing a series of warnings and ultimately the threat of huge fines .
" the main outstanding point is the question of triggering the excessive deficit procedure , " said one eu source . eu heavyweights led by germany in particular insist that the procedure should not be initiated automatically when deficit slips above three percent of gdp but should take into account a range of other factors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking a bite at the euro : german finance minister hans eichel " a really central criterion for us is how the economy is developing , " said german finance minister hans eichel .
" in order to reduce debt , both things are needed together - strict fiscal policy and growth . " italian prime minister silvio berlusconi warned friday that rome will veto any system that is not sufficiently flexible .
in particular he wants certain expenses , notably spending on infrastructure , to be excluded from deficit sums .
" i will fight at the march eu -lrb- summit -rrb- to change the parameters set by the stability pact .
without modification i am ready to block things , " he said . " credibility needs to be preserved " eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia , tasked with policing the pact , warned last week against " introducing uncertainty into the decision about the existence or otherwise of an excessive deficit . " european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- chief jean-claude trichet echoed that point thursday .
" the credibility of the excessive deficit procedure needs to be fully preserved , " he said .
" this is not only fundamental for macroeconomic stability and cohesion in the euro area but also for confidence and growth prospects in all member states . " the 12 euro zone ministers will meet on monday , while ministers from all 25 eu member states will meet tuesday . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de does europe need stability or flexibility ?

he is also , according to a new poll in a men 's magazine , germany 's best dressed person . some may argue that being named best dressed person in germany is like winning the most sober person award at a bachelor party - there usually is n't much competition .
however , the winds of change may be about to blow through one of europe 's most fashion unconscious states , thanks to one of its most prominent politicians . in a country where denim vests , white socks and sandals -lrb- worn together -rrb- regularly challenge lederhosen and plumed hats in the national dress stakes , it seems that statemanship chic could be germany 's saving grace . according to the german edition of fitness and style magazine men ’ s health , germany 's best dressed person is none other than federal president and hugo boss enthusiast horst köhler . elegance with dignity the former international monetary fund chief , sworn in as president in 2004 , was nominated by a jury of journalists , advertising executives , and fashion designers for his " combination of elegance with dignity " . the 62-year-old , who serves in a mainly ceremonial role , is germany 's top diplomat and therefore the country 's most respected representative on the global stage .
after the men 's health accolade , he may also become a role model for the sartorially challenged back home .

designers karl lagerfeld and wolfgang joop , as well as ex-tennis star boris becker and musician marius müller-westerhagen were also marked out among the notable winners . special mentions were also given to chancellor gerhard schröder , hamburg mayor ole von beust and the liberal fdp party chief guido westerwelle as fine role models for others to follow .

the lse had twice rejected informal offers from deutsche börse at that price . in the statement , the deutsche börse chief added that after withdrawing its offer , the company would make " a significant distribution of funds " to its investors , " in a move to pacify those involved with the major shareholder revolt which prompted the withdrawal . börse still believes in consolidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chairman of the board of german stock exchange , deutsche börse ag , werner g. seifert .
" we recognize that a significant portion of our shareholder base is focused on return of capital in the short term , " seifert said .
" we continue to believe that shareholders , issuers , investors and intermediaries would all benefit from consolidation of the european exchange landscape as contemplated in our proposal . " " however , " he continued , " the london stock exchange does not find itself in a position to recommend a transaction at a price we find supportable . " seifert added that despite this , deutsche börse reserved the right to make another offer if any other company makes a bid for the venerable lse . dissident shareholders issued warning bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in february , two dissident shareholders went public with fears that deutsche börse would pay over the asking price for the lse and argued that the company should return around € 726 million -lrb- $ 961 million -rrb- of its cash to shareholders . they warned deutsche börse that the majority of investors opposed the bid for the london market and could take action to oust its supervisory board at the next shareholder meeting in may . porsche , the german car maker , became the first big company on the german exchange to publicly express opposition to the takeover bid last week as opposition grew . rival records share price leap euronext , the pan-european stock market operator , which is also continuing talks with the lse , sees synergies worth € 203 million from a merger . the amount was twice that of its german rival deutsche börse , which predicted synergies of € 100 million from 2008 if it won the battle to acquire the lse . euronext shareholders were said by sources to be " particularly interested " in the projected financial advantages of the deal .

the informal talks come ahead of an eu summit in two weeks time . the german chancellor and french president were at pains to demonstrate the strength of their ties , and the informal meeting in the state of north-rhine westphalia has been billed as a new landmark in their relations . topping the agenda was the european union 's growth and stability pact , which both leaders have criticized as inflexible .
germany and france have been threatened with punitive measures for allowing their public deficits to exceed eu guidelines .
speaking after their talks , the schröder and chirac stressed that the pact must be reformed to be take greater account of growth . chirac said sanctions should not be automatically triggered when the pact 's guidelines are exceeded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two leaders want to change the stability pact guidelines warning against " technocratic brutality , " chirac said the pact " must not be purely technocratic , it must be political , " and added that " each country has its own different characteristics . " under the pact , euro-zone countries are not allowed to run public deficits beyond 3 percent of their gross domestic product , however , in 2004 both france and germany were in breach of the restrictions .
but chancellor schröder has said he 's confident that changes will be made to the stability pact at the next eu leader 's summit to be held later this month . support for lebanon the leaders also discussed developments in the middle east , in particular recent events in lebanon .
in a joint declaration after their talks in germany , they demanded " free and transparent elections which would allow the lebanese people to determine their democratic future . " their call came as damascus announced that syrian troops in lebanon would pull back towards the eastern bekaa valley by the end of march , a move seen as falling short of international demands .
syria has been under intense diplomatic pressure to end its political and military grip on lebanon three decades after it sent in troops shortly after the start of lebanon 's devastating civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder was greeted by schoolchildren schröder and chirac , who consider their alliance the engine of european union integration , called on syria to make " a full withdrawal of its troops and services from lebanon as quickly as possible . " they reaffirmed their " commitment to lebanon 's independence , sovereignty and democracy " and said their countries were ready to help if needed .
" we will remain vigilant concerning the timetable for the steps to come and , like all the international community , we remain mobilized , " their declaration said . increased pressure on iran the two men also called on iran to forgo developing nuclear weapons . " the iranian government must agree to do without the production and possession of nuclear weapons and to use the nuclear program exclusively for peaceful means , " schröder said after the talks with chirac . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac demonstrated unity the aim of negotiations was " also to illicit objective guarantees , " a french-german position that britain also supports , schröder added .
both germany and france were under the impression that the us government backed their efforts , he said . chirac said he was in full agreement with schröder .
" i could have issued the same statement as the chancellor , " chirac said after the german leader finished speaking . the two men will meet again on march 18 in paris , where they will be joined by russian president vladimir putin and spanish prime minister jose luis zapatero . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu moves to renew battered fiscal rules the eu hopes to hammer out the main points of a revised budget rule book this week , 16 months after the pact meant to protect the euro was left in tatters by eu heavyweight states bent on reviving their ailing economies .

the eu 's current luxembourg presidency hopes the two-day ministerial talks will pave the way for final agreement at an eu summit in brussels on march 22-23 .
" the plan is to get as close as possible to an agreement , " said a luxembourg diplomat , adding that the eu leadership would circulate a document proposing a basis for discussion by ministers . the 1997 budget pact was all but suspended in november 2003 when eu heavyweights france and germany were let off the hook despite repeatedly breaching a key requirement of the rule book .
the pact notably stipulates that members of the 12-nation euro-zone must not run public deficits in excess of three percent of gdp . since then nearly half the eu 's 25 states have also triggered disciplinary measures under the pact , while the system 's already-strained credibility has also suffered after it emerged that greece had for years submitted wrong data . reform without threatening recovery now the eu - still struggling to emerge from a prolonged economic slowdown - is determined to renew the budget rules in a way that will not threaten recovery .
to this end the revised pact is expected to allow more flexibility for countries to run bigger deficits during slowdowns , so long as they make up the difference when growth returns . key to the amendments is the so-called " excessive deficit procedure , " triggered when a country 's accounts run too far into the red , allowing a series of warnings and ultimately the threat of huge fines .
" the main outstanding point is the question of triggering the excessive deficit procedure , " said one eu source . eu heavyweights led by germany in particular insist that the procedure should not be initiated automatically when deficit slips above three percent of gdp but should take into account a range of other factors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking a bite at the euro : german finance minister hans eichel " a really central criterion for us is how the economy is developing , " said german finance minister hans eichel .
" in order to reduce debt , both things are needed together - strict fiscal policy and growth . " italian prime minister silvio berlusconi warned friday that rome will veto any system that is not sufficiently flexible .
in particular he wants certain expenses , notably spending on infrastructure , to be excluded from deficit sums .
" i will fight at the march eu -lrb- summit -rrb- to change the parameters set by the stability pact .
without modification i am ready to block things , " he said . " credibility needs to be preserved " eu monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia , tasked with policing the pact , warned last week against " introducing uncertainty into the decision about the existence or otherwise of an excessive deficit . " european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- chief jean-claude trichet echoed that point thursday .
" the credibility of the excessive deficit procedure needs to be fully preserved , " he said .

but could it simply be a case that the drone of domestic politics has taken over ? when eu expansion commissioner olli rehn and eu council president jean asselborn arrive in ankara for talks with the turkish foreign minister abdulla gul on monday , it is likely to be under a cloud of some tension .
in the past few weeks a number of incidences have collectively led critics to suggest that turkey 's reform movement has begun to lose momentum . at the end of last year , the picture was quite different .
in the months leading up to the decision on eu entry negotiations , the parliament under prime minister tayyip erdogan passed one reform after another in a flurry of law-making activity .
it was a means to an end , and on dec .
17 last year , the european council gave the green light for entry talks to begin .
it was something of a victory for erdogan . running out of steam ? critics are now loudly questioning the lack of continued activity on turkey 's reform map , and asking whether erdogan simply ran out of steam .
one sign of such is that the turkish prime minister has not yet named a head negotiator for the entry talks even though expansion commissioner olli rehn is arriving in ankara on monday .
it 's a point of some contention in turkey , with even the turkish president ahmet necdet yezer calling on the prime minister to name someone for the post . bildunterschrift : accession negotiations are scheduled for october luxembourg 's european minister nicolas schmidt and the eu ambassador in ankara , the german diplomat hansjörg kretschmer have both criticized turkey 's slowing progress , enraging the turkish government as a result . but professor udo steinbach , director of the german orient institute in hamburg said he believed the evidence being bandied about as proof of turkey 's ebbing commitment to reform can not be used as such , and blames the media for exaggerating the situation . steinbach said that the considerable pressure to get the reform ball rolling ahead of dec .
17 may have eased off , but that is not to say that the general level of government interest in entry talks has diminished .
he said that turkey has simply shifted its attention back to the daily grind of domestic political life . a long path to reform nobody argues that turkey does n't still have a long way to go , and on monday , the eu enlargement commissioner is expected to press ankara to initial an agreement to extend its customs union to the 10 new eu member states , including cyprus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish parliament in ankara originally ankara was supposed to have signed up by the end of february .
but for erdogan the signature is incredibly delicate , as it could be interpreted as recognition of cyprus , which could lead to internal political difficulties .
on the other hand , the eu made it perfectly clear that if turkey does not sign the politically sensitive protocol , there will be no accession talks come october . a further problem is the conflict between turkey and the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- .
last december , the imf agreed to a three year aid program to the tune of more than € 10 billion -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- but turkey has not yet made good on the economic reform it pledged in return for the financial package . steinbach said that in light of the tense situation , monday 's eu delegation visit is not without significance .
he said he believed the most critical point on the agenda is the cyprus problem , but added the responsibility does not only lay with turkey , but also with greece . samira lazarovic -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatives to huddle to block turkey 's eu bid germany 's opposition conservatives are looking to france for support in their bid to dash turkey 's eu hopes by inviting french conservative economics minister sarkozy for talks .

the lse had twice rejected informal offers from deutsche börse at that price . in the statement , the deutsche börse chief added that after withdrawing its offer , the company would make " a significant distribution of funds " to its investors , " in a move to pacify those involved with the major shareholder revolt which prompted the withdrawal . börse still believes in consolidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chairman of the board of german stock exchange , deutsche börse ag , werner g. seifert .

the informal talks come ahead of an eu summit in two weeks time . the german chancellor and french president were at pains to demonstrate the strength of their ties , and the informal meeting in the state of north-rhine westphalia has been billed as a new landmark in their relations . topping the agenda was the european union 's growth and stability pact , which both leaders have criticized as inflexible .
germany and france have been threatened with punitive measures for allowing their public deficits to exceed eu guidelines .
speaking after their talks , the schröder and chirac stressed that the pact must be reformed to be take greater account of growth . chirac said sanctions should not be automatically triggered when the pact 's guidelines are exceeded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two leaders want to change the stability pact guidelines warning against " technocratic brutality , " chirac said the pact " must not be purely technocratic , it must be political , " and added that " each country has its own different characteristics . " under the pact , euro-zone countries are not allowed to run public deficits beyond 3 percent of their gross domestic product , however , in 2004 both france and germany were in breach of the restrictions .
but chancellor schröder has said he 's confident that changes will be made to the stability pact at the next eu leader 's summit to be held later this month . support for lebanon the leaders also discussed developments in the middle east , in particular recent events in lebanon .
in a joint declaration after their talks in germany , they demanded " free and transparent elections which would allow the lebanese people to determine their democratic future . " their call came as damascus announced that syrian troops in lebanon would pull back towards the eastern bekaa valley by the end of march , a move seen as falling short of international demands .
syria has been under intense diplomatic pressure to end its political and military grip on lebanon three decades after it sent in troops shortly after the start of lebanon 's devastating civil war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder was greeted by schoolchildren schröder and chirac , who consider their alliance the engine of european union integration , called on syria to make " a full withdrawal of its troops and services from lebanon as quickly as possible . " they reaffirmed their " commitment to lebanon 's independence , sovereignty and democracy " and said their countries were ready to help if needed .
" we will remain vigilant concerning the timetable for the steps to come and , like all the international community , we remain mobilized , " their declaration said . increased pressure on iran the two men also called on iran to forgo developing nuclear weapons . " the iranian government must agree to do without the production and possession of nuclear weapons and to use the nuclear program exclusively for peaceful means , " schröder said after the talks with chirac . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and chirac demonstrated unity the aim of negotiations was " also to illicit objective guarantees , " a french-german position that britain also supports , schröder added .
both germany and france were under the impression that the us government backed their efforts , he said . chirac said he was in full agreement with schröder .
" i could have issued the same statement as the chancellor , " chirac said after the german leader finished speaking . the two men will meet again on march 18 in paris , where they will be joined by russian president vladimir putin and spanish prime minister jose luis zapatero . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu moves to renew battered fiscal rules the eu hopes to hammer out the main points of a revised budget rule book this week , 16 months after the pact meant to protect the euro was left in tatters by eu heavyweight states bent on reviving their ailing economies .

the lse had twice rejected informal offers from deutsche börse at that price . in the statement , the deutsche börse chief added that after withdrawing its offer , the company would make " a significant distribution of funds " to its investors , " in a move to pacify those involved with the major shareholder revolt which prompted the withdrawal . börse still believes in consolidation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chairman of the board of german stock exchange , deutsche börse ag , werner g. seifert .
" we recognize that a significant portion of our shareholder base is focused on return of capital in the short term , " seifert said .
" we continue to believe that shareholders , issuers , investors and intermediaries would all benefit from consolidation of the european exchange landscape as contemplated in our proposal . " " however , " he continued , " the london stock exchange does not find itself in a position to recommend a transaction at a price we find supportable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.03.2005 is turkey losing its reform zeal ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey still has some work to do before eu entry talks get underway with the start of eu accession talks scheduled for later this year , turkey 's critics say its reform zest appears to be waning .
but could it simply be a case that the drone of domestic politics has taken over ? when eu expansion commissioner olli rehn and eu council president jean asselborn arrive in ankara for talks with the turkish foreign minister abdulla gul on monday , it is likely to be under a cloud of some tension .
in the past few weeks a number of incidences have collectively led critics to suggest that turkey 's reform movement has begun to lose momentum . at the end of last year , the picture was quite different .
in the months leading up to the decision on eu entry negotiations , the parliament under prime minister tayyip erdogan passed one reform after another in a flurry of law-making activity .
it was a means to an end , and on dec .
17 last year , the european council gave the green light for entry talks to begin .
it was something of a victory for erdogan . running out of steam ? critics are now loudly questioning the lack of continued activity on turkey 's reform map , and asking whether erdogan simply ran out of steam .
one sign of such is that the turkish prime minister has not yet named a head negotiator for the entry talks even though expansion commissioner olli rehn is arriving in ankara on monday .
it 's a point of some contention in turkey , with even the turkish president ahmet necdet yezer calling on the prime minister to name someone for the post . bildunterschrift : accession negotiations are scheduled for october luxembourg 's european minister nicolas schmidt and the eu ambassador in ankara , the german diplomat hansjörg kretschmer have both criticized turkey 's slowing progress , enraging the turkish government as a result . but professor udo steinbach , director of the german orient institute in hamburg said he believed the evidence being bandied about as proof of turkey 's ebbing commitment to reform can not be used as such , and blames the media for exaggerating the situation . steinbach said that the considerable pressure to get the reform ball rolling ahead of dec .
17 may have eased off , but that is not to say that the general level of government interest in entry talks has diminished .
he said that turkey has simply shifted its attention back to the daily grind of domestic political life . a long path to reform nobody argues that turkey does n't still have a long way to go , and on monday , the eu enlargement commissioner is expected to press ankara to initial an agreement to extend its customs union to the 10 new eu member states , including cyprus . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish parliament in ankara originally ankara was supposed to have signed up by the end of february .
but for erdogan the signature is incredibly delicate , as it could be interpreted as recognition of cyprus , which could lead to internal political difficulties .

it 's still used in heavy jackets but is also appearing as scarves and decorative trim .
animal rights groups want to make sure consumers know what animal became a stole . there was a time when fur in germany was associated with heavy older woman getting dressed up for church or a coffee-and-cake afternoon .
but , not anymore .
germans of all ages and sizes are now increasingly snuggling into the fluffy material .
after suffering from two years of decline , the german fur industry grew by 2.5 percent to € 965 million -lrb- $ 1.266 million -rrb- in 2004 , and fur is back on catwalks and market squares all around europe .
furs for everyone ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long , heavy , dark jackets are being replaced by lighter more colorful fur " fur is selling well , but it is not the classical fur many are used to , " said susanne kolb-wachtel , general manager of the german fur association .
" it has become lighter , more colorful and even peppy . "
there will be even more light and lively uses of fur on display this week when the 57th fur and fashion frankfurt tradeshow opens wednesday , kolb-wachtel said .
fur 's image transformation from dowdy apparel to hot outfit , could be expected to have made life tougher for animal rights groups like people for the ethical treatment of animals and its efforts to prohibit fur farms around the world .
but the group , which is planning a demonstration during the frankfurt convention , does n't see a major fur revival and points out that many german departments stores no longer carry fur products .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h & m is one of the chains that has decided to stop selling fur " the fur comeback is exaggerated , " said jürgen faulmann , a peta campaign leader .
" it is a perversion for the super rich who do not know what to do with their money and pay thousands for a fur coat . "
that 's where kolb-wachtel disagrees .
fur is still a luxury item compared to other less expensive materials , but there are more types of fur in more price classes than ever .
the change in fur styles , and prices , are key reasons why the average fur buyer 's has dropped from 45-plus to 25-plus , she said .
designers return to animal pelts whether destined for young or old , streetwear shops or upscale boutiques , designers are willing to work with the controversial material again .
in winter collections presented in europe recently fox stoles were used to embellish evening gowns and copious amounts of animal pelt went into a mink bomber jacket .
bildunterschrift : fur has returned to the catwalk in a big way " we never did fur before this season , " cat bresaola spokesperson gharani strok told reporters at the london fashion week in mid-february .
" but we 've had to design it to cater to the russian market . "
russia and china are the reasons why some designers have started kitting out their models in animal pelts again .
the two countries are the new target markets , and they 're looking for something stylish and warm .
" there are two distinct markets in both russia and china , " kolb-wachtel said .
" the rich , who are looking for the most fashionable furs and the people who live in cold areas and want something long and warm to wear . "
where did the fox boa come from ?
in the face of fur 's rising sales and acceptance , it 's the people looking to stay warm , whether in germany or abroad , animal rights activists want to target .
while pointing out that there are warmer synthetic materials designed for frigid conditions , peta is also launching new initiative to make sure people know what used to wear the fur on their back .
" the media has made many people think that wearing fur is n't a crime , " faulmann said .
" with our new theme we want to show people the parts of the fox that is left over when the its fur is gone . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german actress franka potente and musician bela b. pose for peta 's " i 'd would rather wear tattoos than fur " campaign some people , like verena pirchner , whose jacket 's cotton trim - to the untrained eye - looks like a closely shorn mink , do n't need any more convincing .
" i think it 's terrible that people are still wearing fur , " said the 24-year-old student from bonn .
" my mother inherited a fur coat from her mother but never wears it .
i would n't wear it either . "
european and state oversight german fur farms are subject to supervision from the country 's individual states , which can issue orders regarding animal handling and slaughter .
how effective the orders are at improving animals ' living conditions is disputable .
" it is not possible to understand why the order , which should have improved conditions for fur-bearing animals , to this day is not being enforced , " said wolfgang apel , president of the german animal protection association , of a 2001 state order in schleswig-holstein .
the german fur association 's kolb-wachtel said she was proud of german fur farmers ' willingness to invest in ways to keep animals from suffering , including larger cages , safe toys to keep them occupied and shorter transportation times before slaughter .
customers reading labels and thinking twice consumers who want to know what they 're paying for have to rely on the garment 's label to know what animals there fur comes from , kolb-wachtel said .
and people are examining those labels , and thinking twice before buying a fur .
" i definitely gave it a lot of thought , " said ute krieg , from the west german city of koblenz , of her decision to buy a rabbit fur coat .

transport secretary alistair darling is still considering a slimmed down £ 355m scheme submitted in november .
public transport officials have warned that the project could be axed unless the government approves funding soon .
metro , the west yorkshire transport executive , said time pressures would be high on the agenda at the meeting .
leeds city council will lose its powers to compulsorily buy land for the project in early 2006 .
the department for transport has said it is aware of the timetable implications but has been unable to say when a final decision on the project will be made .
the government suspended the project in july 2004 after costs spiralled to more than £ 500m .

by peter biles bbc news , gaborone gaborone is certainly not your typical african capital .
forty years ago , just before botswana 's independence , there was barely anything here at all .
now though , the skyline is dotted with high-rise buildings , and new shopping malls .
gaborone is an expanding if featureless city in many ways , it is a featureless place , but rush-hour traffic jams have become the norm as the city expands .
botswana is certainly different to most other african countries .
since independence in 1966 , it has been politically stable , with a multiparty democracy .
the country has enjoyed four decades of economic growth , underpinned by its diamond industry ; and is the largest producer of diamonds - by value - in the world .
but the botswana government is concerned that as a success story by african standards , it may be ignored when uk prime minister tony blair 's commission for africa publishes its action plan for helping the world 's poorest continent later this week .
no diamond panacea at the offices of the debswana diamond company , owned jointly by the botswana government and de beers , managing director blackie marole explains that botswana was a poor country at the time of independence .
botswana has zero tolerance for corruption .
it is illegal to offer or ask for a bribe airport poster the mining of diamonds made all the difference , although he acknowledges that now , botswana needs to end its over-dependence on precious gems .
" the wealth from diamonds is not proving to be a panacea " .
so the catchword in botswana these days is " diversification " , moving into new areas of business .
the government is keen to sell itself abroad and demonstrate the benefits of investing here .
textiles , agriculture , tourism , and the financial services sector all offer new opportunities for growth .
however , jay salkin , an economist at the botswana institute for development policy analysis , warns that the country is still facing big challenges .
" the economy is diversifying but not rapidly enough , " he says .
" the non-mining sectors are growing at 5 % per annum at present , and while that 's quite good by international standards , it 's not good enough to absorb the growing labour force , and to move as many people out of poverty as the government is committed to doing . "
beating corruption unlike many african nations , botswana has successfully kept corruption in check .
we do acknowledge we are no longer the poorest of the poor .
but we do n't accept that we should be totally excluded president festus mogae according to the corruption watchdog , transparency international , botswana is the least corrupt country in africa .
the poster on the wall in the arrivals hall at gaborone airport is a clear pointer .
" botswana has zero tolerance for corruption .
it is illegal to offer or ask for a bribe , " it reads .
lebang mpotokwane , chairman of transparency international in botswana , says that in a fast-growing economy , there are temptations , but the government has led by example .
" the government is forever preaching to the nation about corruption , and i ca n't think of any corruption involving government ministers , " he says .
falling short botswana 's diamond wealth has not benefited everyone .
this still remains a country with a divide between rich and poor .
in old naledi , a deprived area on the southern side of gaborone , the houses are small and overcrowded .
many are without mains water and power .
diamonds account for half of botswana 's revenues paul rantao , an mp for the opposition botswana national front , argues that the government has not done enough to address poverty .
" the government is more concerned about per capita income , and that does n't reflect the real quality of life of the majority .
most people here are unemployed , " he says .
in addition to poverty , there is also a huge hiv / aids crisis here , hampering development .
one in three adults is thought to be hiv positive .
it all means that botswana still falls well short of mr blair 's vision for a strong and prosperous africa .
botswana 's president festus mogae welcomes the input that africans have had into the commission for africa .
however , he wonders how with its focus on debt relief , access to markets and more resources , it can help a middle-income country like botswana .
" we do acknowledge we are no longer the poorest of the poor , and that maybe there are some countries more deserving than others , " says president mogae .
" but we do n't accept that we should be totally excluded , as is the case at present . "

bbc news -pipe- africa -pipe- botswana : africa 's success story ?

by peter biles bbc news , gaborone gaborone is certainly not your typical african capital .
forty years ago , just before botswana 's independence , there was barely anything here at all .
now though , the skyline is dotted with high-rise buildings , and new shopping malls .
in many ways , it is a featureless place , but rush-hour traffic jams have become the norm as the city expands .
botswana is certainly different to most other african countries .
since independence in 1966 , it has been politically stable , with a multiparty democracy .
the country has enjoyed four decades of economic growth , underpinned by its diamond industry ; and is the largest producer of diamonds - by value - in the world .
but the botswana government is concerned that as a success story by african standards , it may be ignored when uk prime minister tony blair 's commission for africa publishes its action plan for helping the world 's poorest continent later this week .
no diamond panacea at the offices of the debswana diamond company , owned jointly by the botswana government and de beers , managing director blackie marole explains that botswana was a poor country at the time of independence . "
botswana has zero tolerance for corruption .
it is illegal to offer or ask for a bribe " airport poster the mining of diamonds made all the difference , although he acknowledges that now , botswana needs to end its over-dependence on precious gems .
" the wealth from diamonds is not proving to be a panacea " .
so the catchword in botswana these days is " diversification " , moving into new areas of business .
the government is keen to sell itself abroad and demonstrate the benefits of investing here .
textiles , agriculture , tourism , and the financial services sector all offer new opportunities for growth .
however , jay salkin , an economist at the botswana institute for development policy analysis , warns that the country is still facing big challenges .
" the economy is diversifying but not rapidly enough , " he says .
" the non-mining sectors are growing at 5 % per annum at present , and while that 's quite good by international standards , it 's not good enough to absorb the growing labour force , and to move as many people out of poverty as the government is committed to doing . "
beating corruption unlike many african nations , botswana has successfully kept corruption in check . "
we do acknowledge we are no longer the poorest of the poor .
but we do n't accept that we should be totally excluded " president festus mogae according to the corruption watchdog , transparency international , botswana is the least corrupt country in africa .
the poster on the wall in the arrivals hall at gaborone airport is a clear pointer .
" botswana has zero tolerance for corruption .
it is illegal to offer or ask for a bribe , " it reads .
lebang mpotokwane , chairman of transparency international in botswana , says that in a fast-growing economy , there are temptations , but the government has led by example .
" the government is forever preaching to the nation about corruption , and i ca n't think of any corruption involving government ministers , " he says .
falling short botswana 's diamond wealth has not benefited everyone .
this still remains a country with a divide between rich and poor .
in old naledi , a deprived area on the southern side of gaborone , the houses are small and overcrowded .
many are without mains water and power .
paul rantao , an mp for the opposition botswana national front , argues that the government has not done enough to address poverty .
" the government is more concerned about per capita income , and that does n't reflect the real quality of life of the majority .
most people here are unemployed , " he says .
in addition to poverty , there is also a huge hiv / aids crisis here , hampering development .
one in three adults is thought to be hiv positive .
it all means that botswana still falls well short of mr blair 's vision for a strong and prosperous africa .
botswana 's president festus mogae welcomes the input that africans have had into the commission for africa .
however , he wonders how with its focus on debt relief , access to markets and more resources , it can help a middle-income country like botswana .
" we do acknowledge we are no longer the poorest of the poor , and that maybe there are some countries more deserving than others , " says president mogae .
" but we do n't accept that we should be totally excluded , as is the case at present . "

tensions have been growing since the malaysian state petroleum corporation , petronas , moved to grant exploration rights to the anglo-dutch firm shell .
both indonesia and malaysia claim rights to the region , which is thought to be rich in oil .
the two nations say they hope to resolve the dispute peacefully .
according to indonesia 's chief navy spokesman , the country will never let an inch of its land or a drop of its ocean fall into the hands of foreigners .
the scheduled deployment of three warships and four f16 fighters to the area off the east coast of borneo will certainly lend weight to those words .
however , it is unlikely that the two countries will come to blows .
indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono and the malaysian leader , abdullah badawi , spoke on the telephone early on monday and agreed to hold talks at foreign ministerial level .
in the interim , president yudhoyono is due to visit the disputed area .
his itinerary is expected to include a tour of camps holding thousands of indonesians who have left malaysia because of an operation to expel undocumented workers .
they have gathered in the border region and there are concerns for their health .
the migrant issue has also strained relations between the neighbours , with malaysia wanting the workers back through legal channels , and accusing jakarta of slowing their return .
the last territorial dispute between the two countries - over the islands of sipadan and ligatan , also off borneo 's east coast - was resolved peacefully through the international court of justice in the hague .

the hackney cab drivers want the same rights as cabbies in leicester and derby who are allowed to use bus lanes .
the drivers , who say they have been campaigning for this right for the last 10 years , are expected to stop work on monday afternoon .
they say it would benefit passengers too as journey times would be shorter and fares would be lower .
the hackney cab drivers also want nottingham city council to take more action against private-hire firms that illegally pick up people who flag them down in the street .
councillor brian grocock , cabinet member for transport at the city council , said : " the difficulty we actually have is the bus company does n't want hackney or private-hire cars in bus lanes .
" the police do n't want them in bus lanes either because they ca n't police it and cyclists do n't want them in bus lanes because of the safety aspect . "

moss performs highlights of the trial for sky news and sky one , surrounded by suitably adorned and costumed actors playing lawyers , witnesses , jury members and judge rodney melville .
the 27-year-old from hollywood admits the role has not been too demanding so far as he has only been required to frown , raise the odd eyebrow and pretend to scribble notes .
" well i 'm not about to hop up onto the table ! " he says .
" unless michael does that in court himself , of course . "
moss has been impersonating jackson for a decade , having initially been persuaded to mimic the star for an employee talent contest while working at mcdonald 's .
professional lookalike " the first prize was $ 200 , and as i was being paid $ 4.25 an hour at the time i thought i might as well go for it , " he says .
" people had been telling me that i looked like michael since i was four years old .
i 'm not a huge fan of his but i decided to put the similarity to some use . "
moss won the contest and embarked upon a career as a professional lookalike , singing and moonwalking along to jackson 's hits for audiences in the us , the philippines , new zealand and japan .
he also played jackson on spoof horror movie scary movie 3 and appeared on us tv in nip / tuck , mad tv and the tonight show .
i 'm just glad i no longer have to ask people whether they want to super size edward moss although he does not reveal how much he is paid to mimic the 46-year-old star , moss says it had given him " a comfortable life and a great career " .
" i 'm just glad i no longer have to ask people whether they want to super size , " he says .
moss is now expert at transforming himself into the star , a process he completes in just 45 minutes .
first he applies pale make-up onto his naturally olive skin .
then he uses make-up to make his nose appear " a little thinner " , draws over his nostrils and eyebrows with black pencil then pulls on a long black wig .
" i 've never had any plastic surgery , " he says .
" i 've always said that if i could n't achieve his look with make-up then i would n't do it . "
acting ability moss won the courtroom tv role after an audition process which judged his acting ability as well as his appearance .
" it 's easier to recreate something michael has done on stage or in a music video as that gives you a definite reference point , " he says .
" each day we receive the court transcript and i have to imagine how michael would react .
but i know his mannerisms and body language so that 's no problem . "
moss says he had no hesitation in accepting the role , despite the nature of the court case .
jackson reportedly told moss he was a " really good " impersonator " this a very serious case based around very serious allegations , " he adds .
" people need to know what is going on in court and this a good way of showing them . "
he says he has no idea whether jackson approves of his courtroom mimicry .
moss briefly met the singer in 1997 while he was imitating him in front of hollywood wax museum .
he says the star , who was disguised as a woman at the time , had been watching his performance and told him he was " really good " before disappearing with his entourage .
moss has signed up for the duration of the court case and plans to continue performing afterwards , whether as jackson or not .
" i can easily disguise my similarity to michael by removing the wig and the outfit , " he says .
" i 'm taking my career as it comes but i do see a bright future . "
michael jackson court re-enactments are on sky news at 0930 gmt every day and 1430 gmt from tuesday to saturday .

and with no set end date , contestants could well find themselves living in it forever .
eleven young hopefuls have moved into the new village , which covers an area of 5000 square metres and includes a bar , a gym , and a market square .
in the show , which began at the beginning of march , rather than sit around on sofas , the contestants also have to do some work .
either in a farmyard , a car workshop or a fashion atelier .
and , whereas the winner of season five walked away with one million euros , in this series prize money will be given out bit by bit .
the money , which is paid into big brother bank accounts as a reward for challenges successfully carried out , will be lost if the contestant leaves the village voluntarily .
the " poor " living quarters will test the contestants ' stamina those taking part are divided into three social classes : rich , poor and average .
the bosses give the orders and the lower ranks carry out more menial duties .
even the accommodation reflects each contestant 's social standing in the village .
" it seems to be a bit like a social experiment , " says katrin brinkhoff , a berlin-based media psychologist .
" and i find it especially interesting to have class distinctions in the programme in times likes these , when a seventh of all germans are now defined as living in poverty . "
' soap opera ' but , according to dr joachim huber , who writes about the media for the berlin newspaper der tagespiegel , it 's exactly because of the country 's economic problems that around 26000 people applied to be on the show .
" i think it is rather an ironic coincidence that the new big brother started on the same day that record figures of 5.2 million unemployed were announced , " he says .
contestants in the luxury quarters give orders to the lower ranks " out of the 11 contestants , five or six of them are unemployed .
they have obviously seen this as a chance of doing something .
" faced with having no work , this new form of media celebrity , living in a sort of tv truman show , is certainly another option . "
rtl ii is calling the big brother village " the world 's first real-ife soap opera " .
they aim to build on the massive ratings big brother has attracted so far .
the four-hour finale episode of the fifth series , which was broadcast after 365 days on 1 march , had by far the highest ratings for that slot and was watched by almost 30 % of its target 14-29 year-old audience .
pulling power not everyone however is so impressed .
" i find the people who go on big brother a little bit ridiculous , " says one viewer .
" their whole goal is to do something outrageous simply in order to become famous .
" it 's not like it 's fame based on anything they have actually achieved . "
despite mixed reactions , critics agree that big brother - the village looks as if it will have no difficulty pulling in viewers .
no doubt helped by the fact that , for 15 euros a month , fans can now even watch the series round-the-clock via an online livestream or on the dedicated 24-hour big brother tv channel .

moss performs highlights of the trial for sky news and sky one , surrounded by suitably adorned and costumed actors playing lawyers , witnesses , jury members and judge rodney melville .
the 27-year-old from hollywood admits the role has not been too demanding so far as he has only been required to frown , raise the odd eyebrow and pretend to scribble notes .
" well i 'm not about to hop up onto the table ! " he says .
" unless michael does that in court himself , of course . "
moss has been impersonating jackson for a decade , having initially been persuaded to mimic the star for an employee talent contest while working at mcdonald 's .
professional lookalike " the first prize was $ 200 , and as i was being paid $ 4.25 an hour at the time i thought i might as well go for it , " he says .

moss is now expert at transforming himself into the star , a process he completes in just 45 minutes .

then he uses make-up to make his nose appear " a little thinner " , draws over his nostrils and eyebrows with black pencil then pulls on a long black wig .
" i 've never had any plastic surgery , " he says .
" i 've always said that if i could n't achieve his look with make-up then i would n't do it . "
acting ability moss won the courtroom tv role after an audition process which judged his acting ability as well as his appearance .
" it 's easier to recreate something michael has done on stage or in a music video as that gives you a definite reference point , " he says .
" each day we receive the court transcript and i have to imagine how michael would react .
but i know his mannerisms and body language so that 's no problem . "
moss says he had no hesitation in accepting the role , despite the nature of the court case .
jackson reportedly told moss he was a " really good " impersonator " this a very serious case based around very serious allegations , " he adds .
" people need to know what is going on in court and this a good way of showing them . "
he says he has no idea whether jackson approves of his courtroom mimicry .
moss briefly met the singer in 1997 while he was imitating him in front of hollywood wax museum .
he says the star , who was disguised as a woman at the time , had been watching his performance and told him he was " really good " before disappearing with his entourage .
moss has signed up for the duration of the court case and plans to continue performing afterwards , whether as jackson or not .

moss performs highlights of the trial for sky news and sky one , surrounded by suitably adorned and costumed actors playing lawyers , witnesses , jury members and judge rodney melville .
the 27-year-old from hollywood admits the role has not been too demanding so far as he has only been required to frown , raise the odd eyebrow and pretend to scribble notes .
" well i 'm not about to hop up onto the table ! " he says .
" unless michael does that in court himself , of course . "
moss has been impersonating jackson for a decade , having initially been persuaded to mimic the star for an employee talent contest while working at mcdonald 's .
professional lookalike " the first prize was $ 200 , and as i was being paid $ 4.25 an hour at the time i thought i might as well go for it , " he says .
" people had been telling me that i looked like michael since i was four years old .
i 'm not a huge fan of his but i decided to put the similarity to some use . "
moss won the contest and embarked upon a career as a professional lookalike , singing and moonwalking along to jackson 's hits for audiences in the us , the philippines , new zealand and japan .
he also played jackson on spoof horror movie scary movie 3 and appeared on us tv in nip / tuck , mad tv and the tonight show .
i 'm just glad i no longer have to ask people whether they want to super size edward moss although he does not reveal how much he is paid to mimic the 46-year-old star , moss says it had given him " a comfortable life and a great career " .
" i 'm just glad i no longer have to ask people whether they want to super size , " he says .
moss is now expert at transforming himself into the star , a process he completes in just 45 minutes .
first he applies pale make-up onto his naturally olive skin .
then he uses make-up to make his nose appear " a little thinner " , draws over his nostrils and eyebrows with black pencil then pulls on a long black wig .
" i 've never had any plastic surgery , " he says .
" i 've always said that if i could n't achieve his look with make-up then i would n't do it . "
acting ability moss won the courtroom tv role after an audition process which judged his acting ability as well as his appearance .
" it 's easier to recreate something michael has done on stage or in a music video as that gives you a definite reference point , " he says .
" each day we receive the court transcript and i have to imagine how michael would react .
but i know his mannerisms and body language so that 's no problem . "
moss says he had no hesitation in accepting the role , despite the nature of the court case .
jackson reportedly told moss he was a " really good " impersonator " this a very serious case based around very serious allegations , " he adds .
" people need to know what is going on in court and this a good way of showing them . "
he says he has no idea whether jackson approves of his courtroom mimicry .
moss briefly met the singer in 1997 while he was imitating him in front of hollywood wax museum .
he says the star , who was disguised as a woman at the time , had been watching his performance and told him he was " really good " before disappearing with his entourage .
moss has signed up for the duration of the court case and plans to continue performing afterwards , whether as jackson or not .
" i can easily disguise my similarity to michael by removing the wig and the outfit , " he says .
" i 'm taking my career as it comes but i do see a bright future . "

and with no set end date , contestants could well find themselves living in it forever .
eleven young hopefuls have moved into the new village , which covers an area of 5000 square metres and includes a bar , a gym , and a market square .
in the show , which began at the beginning of march , rather than sit around on sofas , the contestants also have to do some work .
either in a farmyard , a car workshop or a fashion atelier .
and , whereas the winner of season five walked away with one million euros , in this series prize money will be given out bit by bit .
the money , which is paid into big brother bank accounts as a reward for challenges successfully carried out , will be lost if the contestant leaves the village voluntarily .
the " poor " living quarters will test the contestants ' stamina those taking part are divided into three social classes : rich , poor and average .
the bosses give the orders and the lower ranks carry out more menial duties .
even the accommodation reflects each contestant 's social standing in the village .
" it seems to be a bit like a social experiment , " says katrin brinkhoff , a berlin-based media psychologist .
" and i find it especially interesting to have class distinctions in the programme in times likes these , when a seventh of all germans are now defined as living in poverty . "
' soap opera ' but , according to dr joachim huber , who writes about the media for the berlin newspaper der tagespiegel , it 's exactly because of the country 's economic problems that around 26000 people applied to be on the show .
" i think it is rather an ironic coincidence that the new big brother started on the same day that record figures of 5.2 million unemployed were announced , " he says .
contestants in the luxury quarters give orders to the lower ranks " out of the 11 contestants , five or six of them are unemployed .
they have obviously seen this as a chance of doing something .
" faced with having no work , this new form of media celebrity , living in a sort of tv truman show , is certainly another option . "
rtl ii is calling the big brother village " the world 's first real-ife soap opera " .
they aim to build on the massive ratings big brother has attracted so far .
the four-hour finale episode of the fifth series , which was broadcast after 365 days on 1 march , had by far the highest ratings for that slot and was watched by almost 30 % of its target 14-29 year-old audience .
pulling power not everyone however is so impressed .
" i find the people who go on big brother a little bit ridiculous , " says one viewer .
" their whole goal is to do something outrageous simply in order to become famous .
" it 's not like it 's fame based on anything they have actually achieved . "
despite mixed reactions , critics agree that big brother - the village looks as if it will have no difficulty pulling in viewers .
no doubt helped by the fact that , for 15 euros a month , fans can now even watch the series round-the-clock via an online livestream or on the dedicated 24-hour big brother tv channel .
