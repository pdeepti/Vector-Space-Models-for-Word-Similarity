the plan envisages a gradual increase in retirement age which will reach 67 by 2035 . the move comes in the wake of dwindling contributions to the state pension system as a result of low birth rates and rising life expectancy in germany .
government subsidies to the cash-strapped system have skyrocketed over the past decade and have contributed to gaping holes in state coffers . curbi n g early retireme n t the pension woes have been compounded by the fact that a huge number of germans currently retire before the age of 65 .
spd leader franz müntefering said that attempts would be made by the new government to curb early retirement before resorting to an increase in the general pension age . " the decision to increase the retirement age will be decided in 2007 at the earliest , " he said .
" but the possibility is now open and will be part of our coalition treaty . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors have been demonstrating for better work conditions germany 's public health care system is also facing the demographic upheavals caused by an aging german population .
this has led to a drop in the standard of health care and to rising contributions for the population as a whole . attempts in recent months to keep spiralling health costs in check have produced little or no results .
the two parties said that huge differences remain over how to put health care funding on a sound basis again . the draft stays agreement , however , was reached on thursday about the future of military conscription in germany .
chancellor-designate angela merkel appeared pleased , announcing that the first major breakthrough had been made in the negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young germans will continue to have to serve in the military " i strongly welcome the fact that spd and cdu have been able to agree on keeping draft conscription in germany , " she said .
" in addition , progress was made on the use of the bundeswehr in national air space surveillance , as part of domestic attempts to fight terrorism . " educatio n budget safe ? the chief negotiators for the conservative bloc and the social democrats also briefly touched on the hot issue of cutbacks to the national budget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the research sector is seen as an important safe-guard for germany 's future earlier this week , the two parties agreed on a reduction in the budget to the tune of 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 42.5 billion -rrb- , which is more than 10 percent of state expenditure .
despite the dire state of public finances , merkel said that national education and research budgets would not be affected by the cutbacks . she added that plans to increase spending on education and industrial research in germany to 3 percent of gross domestic product by 2010 would also be implemented . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coalition vows to crack down on welfare abuse in their coalition talks , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have agreed to get tough on abuse of germany 's reformed unemployment regulations , known as hartz iv .

but for the majority , suicide still remains a subject they would rather not talk about . while some 6,600 germans died in automobile accidents in 2003 - the last year for which official figures have been compiled - 11,150 took their own lives in the same year , according to germany 's federal statistics office . " when you realize that more people commit suicide than die in traffic accidents and then look at the attention given to automobile accidents , it is clear that suicide is still a taboo subject and not taken as seriously as it should be , " said elmar etzersdorfer of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at stuttgart 's furtbach hospital . the number of suicides yearly has remained fairly constant in recent years , after dropping steadily in the 1980s and 1990s , according to georg fiedler of the therapy center for suicidal persons -lrb- tzs -rrb- in hamburg and secretary of the national suicide prevention initiative . the initiative works to raise awareness and break taboos by providing positive examples of people who have successfully sought and received help . " help used to be centered on large state hospitals where it was hard for many people to get to , " fiedler said of the changes that account for more people seeking help before it 's too late .
" now people have more options closer to home in the normal health system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : help can now be found outside of clinics since people considering taking their own lives nearly always suffer from feelings of guilt and shame , an increase in outpatient therapy means more of them can choose to get help without the stigma of checking into a clinic , fiedler added . suicide can affect anyone there 's no definition of the " typical " suicidal person ; it is a problem that can neither be attributed solely to social or economic conditions nor localized by geographic region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people considering suicide often remove themselves from society " a person 's social situation is one of many factors in suicide , " etzersdorfer said .
" you ca n't say that the unemployed are generally at a higher risk - though that could be one of many factors that play a role - or that cities or rural areas are worse off . " men die more often than women however , there are some demographic conclusions that can be made about who is at risk . statistics show german men are nearly three times more likely to die from suicide , while twice as many women attempt to take their own lives .
women also tend to use techniques , such as drug overdoses , that leave a window for rescue by medical personnel , while men choose methods with a smaller chance of getting outside help , such as hanging and jumping from tall buildings . " women seem to come in earlier when they are experiencing a crisis , " said angela hofmeister of the berlin crisis service , which has nine centers dotted around the german capital .
" men make up about one-third of the visitors to our crisis centers , and by the time they come , the situation is usually already very serious . " the feelings of shame , guilt and helplessness make it especially hard for men to look for help due to entrenched gender roles telling them not to show weakness , fiedler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors often feel suicide is their only option older people also at risk the elderly are another group with an especially high rate of death by suicide , and as the german population continues aging , there is also a likelihood that the number of suicides will increase , fiedler said . " many older people considering suicide are afraid of what will happen to them , " etzersdorfer said .
" they do n't want to die in a hospital , they want to be able to die in dignity and are not aware of options other than taking their own lives . " most of these people , when they receive proper care , decide not to commit suicide , " he added . but it 's not just the elderly that need to be made more sensitive to suicide and suicide prevention treatments .
fiedler said that awareness of suicide 's warning signals plays too small a role in the education of those most often confronted with suicidal people : medical personnel , psychologists , police , social workers , and teachers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people prefer to seek help anonymously talking about suicide does n't cause it often friends and family are afraid of mentioning the topic to someone who may be in danger for fear that it could be enough for the person to take their own life . but studies show people considering suicide often want to talk about their problems and concerns .

" die walküre " is scheduled for saturday and " götterdämmerung " will conclude the circle on tuesday . staging the operas cost about one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- , but the chinese only had to pay for half .
companies operating in the nuremberg region agreed to take care of the rest - clearly not without resulting economic benefits in mind . the guest performance opens an economic door to china for us , " said hans-peter schmidt , who heads the supervisory board of nürnberger insurance group and organized the search for sponsors .
he added that nuremberg 's future depends on business ties with asia - ties that sponsors will be able to strengthen when talking to guests in the entry hall of beijing 's poly theater . admiri n g all thi n gs germa n ic german culture has long proven to be an excellent way to polish the country 's already positive image in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer just interested in german cars " the chinese no longer just know german cars , soccer and punctuality , " said jari grosse-ruyken , who heads the society for chinese studies in bonn .
" it 's always also been recognized as a country of philosophers , thinkers and musicians . " members of china 's growing middle class are familiar with names such as goethe , schiller and wagner , grosse-ruyken said , adding that it does n't surprise him that tickets for the performances have long been sold out since many chinese people have an uncritical admiration for all things " germanic . " wagner 's hero epos " falls on fertile ground in china , " he said . cultural gifts from germa n y but even those who have n't heard of siegfried , freia and wotan before have been drawn to the german guest performance , which has gotten a lot of attention from the chinese media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg 's rhinegold production in beijing " chinese audiences are open to new things , " said ulrich novak , director of the goethe institute in beijing .
" but they love major highlights and smaller events sometimes suffer because of this . " while calling the ring performances a " courageous and interesting " project , novak said that his institute preferred to develop events in cooperation with chinese partners rather than " presenting gifts . " but he also said that an interest in culture from the business sector was a good thing in principle . bridges for busi n ess grosse-ruyken went a step further , calling the marriage of business and culture a " future-oriented " strategy in china .
he said that german companies had so far mainly focussed on economic exchanges while chinese people were more and more interested in cultural ones . the importance of cultural exchanges for economic cooperation can hardly be exaggerated , said katja hellkötter , who worked in the german industry 's bureau in shanghai for seven years before moving to munich to work on sino-german cultural cooperation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interest in german culture is growing among chinese " culture and business can not be separated , " she said , adding that increasing the visibility of german culture in china also increased the attractiveness of germany as a business location for chinese companies . " cultural factors and an appreciation of a foreign culture play a role in deciding about investments , " she said .
as a result , schiller , goethe and wagner can serve as " bridges for sino-german relations . " nuremberg 's cultural sponsors seem to think the same : they 're going to co-finance the state theater 's performance of mozart 's " don giovanni " in hong kong next year . mareike aden -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de urging germany to speak up on human rights us-based international civil rights organization human rights watch has urged any new german government to become more active in raising human rights issues in russia and china in particular .

but for the majority , suicide still remains a subject they would rather not talk about . while some 6,600 germans died in automobile accidents in 2003 - the last year for which official figures have been compiled - 11,150 took their own lives in the same year , according to germany 's federal statistics office . " when you realize that more people commit suicide than die in traffic accidents and then look at the attention given to automobile accidents , it is clear that suicide is still a taboo subject and not taken as seriously as it should be , " said elmar etzersdorfer of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at stuttgart 's furtbach hospital . the number of suicides yearly has remained fairly constant in recent years , after dropping steadily in the 1980s and 1990s , according to georg fiedler of the therapy center for suicidal persons -lrb- tzs -rrb- in hamburg and secretary of the national suicide prevention initiative . the initiative works to raise awareness and break taboos by providing positive examples of people who have successfully sought and received help . " help used to be centered on large state hospitals where it was hard for many people to get to , " fiedler said of the changes that account for more people seeking help before it 's too late .
" now people have more options closer to home in the normal health system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : help can now be found outside of clinics since people considering taking their own lives nearly always suffer from feelings of guilt and shame , an increase in outpatient therapy means more of them can choose to get help without the stigma of checking into a clinic , fiedler added . suicide can affect anyone there 's no definition of the " typical " suicidal person ; it is a problem that can neither be attributed solely to social or economic conditions nor localized by geographic region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people considering suicide often remove themselves from society " a person 's social situation is one of many factors in suicide , " etzersdorfer said .
" you ca n't say that the unemployed are generally at a higher risk - though that could be one of many factors that play a role - or that cities or rural areas are worse off . " men die more often than women however , there are some demographic conclusions that can be made about who is at risk . statistics show german men are nearly three times more likely to die from suicide , while twice as many women attempt to take their own lives .
women also tend to use techniques , such as drug overdoses , that leave a window for rescue by medical personnel , while men choose methods with a smaller chance of getting outside help , such as hanging and jumping from tall buildings . " women seem to come in earlier when they are experiencing a crisis , " said angela hofmeister of the berlin crisis service , which has nine centers dotted around the german capital .
" men make up about one-third of the visitors to our crisis centers , and by the time they come , the situation is usually already very serious . " the feelings of shame , guilt and helplessness make it especially hard for men to look for help due to entrenched gender roles telling them not to show weakness , fiedler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors often feel suicide is their only option older people also at risk the elderly are another group with an especially high rate of death by suicide , and as the german population continues aging , there is also a likelihood that the number of suicides will increase , fiedler said . " many older people considering suicide are afraid of what will happen to them , " etzersdorfer said .
" they do n't want to die in a hospital , they want to be able to die in dignity and are not aware of options other than taking their own lives . " most of these people , when they receive proper care , decide not to commit suicide , " he added . but it 's not just the elderly that need to be made more sensitive to suicide and suicide prevention treatments .
fiedler said that awareness of suicide 's warning signals plays too small a role in the education of those most often confronted with suicidal people : medical personnel , psychologists , police , social workers , and teachers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people prefer to seek help anonymously talking about suicide does n't cause it often friends and family are afraid of mentioning the topic to someone who may be in danger for fear that it could be enough for the person to take their own life . but studies show people considering suicide often want to talk about their problems and concerns . " people want to see that they are being taken seriously , not just hear , ' hey , look how great life is ' , " fiedler said .

" when you realize that more people commit suicide than die in traffic accidents and then look at the attention given to automobile accidents , it is clear that suicide is still a taboo subject and not taken as seriously as it should be , " said elmar etzersdorfer of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at stuttgart 's furtbach hospital . the number of suicides yearly has remained fairly constant in recent years , after dropping steadily in the 1980s and 1990s , according to georg fiedler of the therapy center for suicidal persons -lrb- tzs -rrb- in hamburg and secretary of the national suicide prevention initiative . the initiative works to raise awareness and break taboos by providing positive examples of people who have successfully sought and received help . " help used to be centered on large state hospitals where it was hard for many people to get to , " fiedler said of the changes that account for more people seeking help before it 's too late .
" now people have more options closer to home in the normal health system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : help can now be found outside of clinics since people considering taking their own lives nearly always suffer from feelings of guilt and shame , an increase in outpatient therapy means more of them can choose to get help without the stigma of checking into a clinic , fiedler added . suicide can affect anyone there 's no definition of the " typical " suicidal person ; it is a problem that can neither be attributed solely to social or economic conditions nor localized by geographic region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people considering suicide often remove themselves from society " a person 's social situation is one of many factors in suicide , " etzersdorfer said .
" you ca n't say that the unemployed are generally at a higher risk - though that could be one of many factors that play a role - or that cities or rural areas are worse off . " men die more often than women however , there are some demographic conclusions that can be made about who is at risk . statistics show german men are nearly three times more likely to die from suicide , while twice as many women attempt to take their own lives .
women also tend to use techniques , such as drug overdoses , that leave a window for rescue by medical personnel , while men choose methods with a smaller chance of getting outside help , such as hanging and jumping from tall buildings . " women seem to come in earlier when they are experiencing a crisis , " said angela hofmeister of the berlin crisis service , which has nine centers dotted around the german capital .
" men make up about one-third of the visitors to our crisis centers , and by the time they come , the situation is usually already very serious . " the feelings of shame , guilt and helplessness make it especially hard for men to look for help due to entrenched gender roles telling them not to show weakness , fiedler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors often feel suicide is their only option older people also at risk the elderly are another group with an especially high rate of death by suicide , and as the german population continues aging , there is also a likelihood that the number of suicides will increase , fiedler said . " many older people considering suicide are afraid of what will happen to them , " etzersdorfer said .
" they do n't want to die in a hospital , they want to be able to die in dignity and are not aware of options other than taking their own lives . " most of these people , when they receive proper care , decide not to commit suicide , " he added . but it 's not just the elderly that need to be made more sensitive to suicide and suicide prevention treatments .
fiedler said that awareness of suicide 's warning signals plays too small a role in the education of those most often confronted with suicidal people : medical personnel , psychologists , police , social workers , and teachers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people prefer to seek help anonymously talking about suicide does n't cause it often friends and family are afraid of mentioning the topic to someone who may be in danger for fear that it could be enough for the person to take their own life . but studies show people considering suicide often want to talk about their problems and concerns .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.10.2005 wooing china with german culture großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guarding german culture in china the nuremberg state theater is currently performing richard wagner 's " ring des nibelungen " in beijing .
the cultural event also has a business angle , as nuremberg companies are shouldering half the costs . bringing the " ring " to a chinese stage for the first time ever , 240 artists and stage workers made the trip .
premiering with " rheingold " on oct .
23 , the bavarian guests " set off an earthquake in viewers ' hearts , " according the beiji n g times newspaper .
" siegfried " followed on oct .
26 .
" die walküre " is scheduled for saturday and " götterdämmerung " will conclude the circle on tuesday . staging the operas cost about one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- , but the chinese only had to pay for half .
companies operating in the nuremberg region agreed to take care of the rest - clearly not without resulting economic benefits in mind . the guest performance opens an economic door to china for us , " said hans-peter schmidt , who heads the supervisory board of nürnberger insurance group and organized the search for sponsors .
he added that nuremberg 's future depends on business ties with asia - ties that sponsors will be able to strengthen when talking to guests in the entry hall of beijing 's poly theater . admiri n g all thi n gs germa n ic german culture has long proven to be an excellent way to polish the country 's already positive image in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer just interested in german cars " the chinese no longer just know german cars , soccer and punctuality , " said jari grosse-ruyken , who heads the society for chinese studies in bonn .
" it 's always also been recognized as a country of philosophers , thinkers and musicians . " members of china 's growing middle class are familiar with names such as goethe , schiller and wagner , grosse-ruyken said , adding that it does n't surprise him that tickets for the performances have long been sold out since many chinese people have an uncritical admiration for all things " germanic . " wagner 's hero epos " falls on fertile ground in china , " he said . cultural gifts from germa n y but even those who have n't heard of siegfried , freia and wotan before have been drawn to the german guest performance , which has gotten a lot of attention from the chinese media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg 's rhinegold production in beijing " chinese audiences are open to new things , " said ulrich novak , director of the goethe institute in beijing .
" but they love major highlights and smaller events sometimes suffer because of this . " while calling the ring performances a " courageous and interesting " project , novak said that his institute preferred to develop events in cooperation with chinese partners rather than " presenting gifts . " but he also said that an interest in culture from the business sector was a good thing in principle . bridges for busi n ess grosse-ruyken went a step further , calling the marriage of business and culture a " future-oriented " strategy in china .
he said that german companies had so far mainly focussed on economic exchanges while chinese people were more and more interested in cultural ones . the importance of cultural exchanges for economic cooperation can hardly be exaggerated , said katja hellkötter , who worked in the german industry 's bureau in shanghai for seven years before moving to munich to work on sino-german cultural cooperation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interest in german culture is growing among chinese " culture and business can not be separated , " she said , adding that increasing the visibility of german culture in china also increased the attractiveness of germany as a business location for chinese companies . " cultural factors and an appreciation of a foreign culture play a role in deciding about investments , " she said .
as a result , schiller , goethe and wagner can serve as " bridges for sino-german relations . " nuremberg 's cultural sponsors seem to think the same : they 're going to co-finance the state theater 's performance of mozart 's " don giovanni " in hong kong next year . mareike aden -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de urging germany to speak up on human rights us-based international civil rights organization human rights watch has urged any new german government to become more active in raising human rights issues in russia and china in particular .

given the spread of the virus and the struggle to contain it , fears of a deadly outbreak in the human population are growing . werner lange knows what it 's like when a wave of influenza causes the public apparatus to break down .
the former director of the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , the central institution and coordination center for the federal ministry for health and social security , remembers what happened in the winter of 1969 when , as a virologist in berlin , lange witnessed the second wave of the so-called hong kong influenza outbreak which killed about one million people worldwide . " the hospitals announced that they were forced to stop providing care because a large number of the staff was out ill and there were no beds available , " said lange . many of the dead could n't be buried and some of the corpses had to be stored in an unused subway tunnel .
with many in the coal industry hit by the outbreak , the police stepped in to take over deliveries of the fuel and even transport systems could only function limitedly . risk of infection still low in a bid to avoid a repeat of such widespread chaos , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has been urging governments for years to keep their pandemic emergency plans up-to-date . " in the last two months in particular , countries have begun to do more and more , " said maria chang , spokesperson for the who .
the reason for this is the looming threat of a global avian influenza pandemic . at the moment , the threat to humans remains minimal .
the spread of avian flu from birds to humans remains rare with only those who have intensive , unprotected contact with infected birds being most in danger .
until now , there have been only about 120 confirmed cases of people who have contracted bird flu .
however , half of those have died from the virus . the major concern of the experts is that this figure could explode if the deadly h5n1 strain of the bird virus connects with the human virus , making infection between people highly likely . different plans , same essentials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pandemic emergency plans are in operation all over the world .
some 20 countries have pandemic emergency plans in place . they include most of the european countries as well as the governments of brazil , canada , hong kong , south africa , japan and the us . " the plans differ in each instance , it depends on national circumstances , " said who spokesperson chang .
" if australia wants to close its borders , this is of course easier than in countries which have borders with other lands . " despite national differences , the core elements of the plans are said to have a similar structure . the competence of the emergency services and authorities are checked as are their response procedures in the case of an outbreak ; areas of the population to be vaccinated first with anti-vial drugs are identified , guidelines are laid out to deal with the supervision and control of the infection and public information , travel restrictions and quarantine rules are prepared . german pandemic plan in place , doubts remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health centers around germany have implemented their plans .
for instance in germany , the rki implemented a national pandemic emergency plan in january compiled by a group of 20 experts who drew upon recommendations issued by the who . but , implementation of the plan remains difficult to monitor because a large chunk of it is the responsiblity of the 16 german federal states and the 430 health authorities distributed around the country , said susanne glasmacher , spokeswoman for the rki . " the decision by the federal government to provide 20 million euros for the development of a prototype vaccine was very important , " said glasmacher , adding that it would speed up the development of an effective serum in case of a flu outbreak . in addition , the federal states had decided to stock up on antiviral drugs .
but the stockpile would only last for 10 percent of the population , while the emergency plan recommends securing drugs for 20 percent , glasmacher pointed out . " but one should n't play it down - many countries have n't stockpiled any drugs at all , " she added . international cooperation critically important while the readiness to prepare for a pandemic has increased , what is essential is a significant rise in international cooperation , said maria cheng of the who .
many of the countries in which bird flu has struck do not have the resources to combat the virus and a more concerted global effort would help , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts fear the h5n1 strain may connect with common human flu .
the main challenges are to find ways of identifying the illness early enough , preventing its spread and to create a drug that can combat the h5n1 virus strain .
" if we were able to identify a new strain early enough , we could maybe prevent the spread of the virus , " said cheng . for this reason , the who has hoarded three million boxes of antiviral drugs .
if a strain that was transmitted between humans did arise in a country , the who would then send specialist teams within the shortest possible time there to contain the virus . " according to models , this would happen in areas where there were 20 to 40 cases of infection reported , ” said cheng .
“ nevertheless , this has yet to be applied in practice . " keeping a cool head the best advice at the moment seems to be for everyone to remain level-headed , said susanne glasmacher of the rki . there seems little doubt that there will be a pandemic as the aggressive increase in bird flu cases indicates .
however , the risk of developing the illness is still very low . " if you want to be infected , you must travel to a humid biotope in a chinese nature reserve and pull out the feathers of the birds you find there , " glasmacher said . dennis stute -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chronology : spread of bird flu to europe on wednesday , british lab results confirmed that the bird flu strain found in croatia was the h5n1 type that killed more than 60 people in asia .

the cultural event also has a business angle , as nuremberg companies are shouldering half the costs . bringing the " ring " to a chinese stage for the first time ever , 240 artists and stage workers made the trip .
premiering with " rheingold " on oct .
23 , the bavarian guests " set off an earthquake in viewers ' hearts , " according the beiji n g times newspaper .
" siegfried " followed on oct .
26 .
" die walküre " is scheduled for saturday and " götterdämmerung " will conclude the circle on tuesday . staging the operas cost about one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- , but the chinese only had to pay for half .
companies operating in the nuremberg region agreed to take care of the rest - clearly not without resulting economic benefits in mind . the guest performance opens an economic door to china for us , " said hans-peter schmidt , who heads the supervisory board of nürnberger insurance group and organized the search for sponsors .
he added that nuremberg 's future depends on business ties with asia - ties that sponsors will be able to strengthen when talking to guests in the entry hall of beijing 's poly theater . admiri n g all thi n gs germa n ic german culture has long proven to be an excellent way to polish the country 's already positive image in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer just interested in german cars " the chinese no longer just know german cars , soccer and punctuality , " said jari grosse-ruyken , who heads the society for chinese studies in bonn .
" it 's always also been recognized as a country of philosophers , thinkers and musicians . " members of china 's growing middle class are familiar with names such as goethe , schiller and wagner , grosse-ruyken said , adding that it does n't surprise him that tickets for the performances have long been sold out since many chinese people have an uncritical admiration for all things " germanic . " wagner 's hero epos " falls on fertile ground in china , " he said . cultural gifts from germa n y but even those who have n't heard of siegfried , freia and wotan before have been drawn to the german guest performance , which has gotten a lot of attention from the chinese media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg 's rhinegold production in beijing " chinese audiences are open to new things , " said ulrich novak , director of the goethe institute in beijing .
" but they love major highlights and smaller events sometimes suffer because of this . " while calling the ring performances a " courageous and interesting " project , novak said that his institute preferred to develop events in cooperation with chinese partners rather than " presenting gifts . " but he also said that an interest in culture from the business sector was a good thing in principle . bridges for busi n ess grosse-ruyken went a step further , calling the marriage of business and culture a " future-oriented " strategy in china .
he said that german companies had so far mainly focussed on economic exchanges while chinese people were more and more interested in cultural ones . the importance of cultural exchanges for economic cooperation can hardly be exaggerated , said katja hellkötter , who worked in the german industry 's bureau in shanghai for seven years before moving to munich to work on sino-german cultural cooperation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interest in german culture is growing among chinese " culture and business can not be separated , " she said , adding that increasing the visibility of german culture in china also increased the attractiveness of germany as a business location for chinese companies . " cultural factors and an appreciation of a foreign culture play a role in deciding about investments , " she said .
as a result , schiller , goethe and wagner can serve as " bridges for sino-german relations . " nuremberg 's cultural sponsors seem to think the same : they 're going to co-finance the state theater 's performance of mozart 's " don giovanni " in hong kong next year . mareike aden -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de urging germany to speak up on human rights us-based international civil rights organization human rights watch has urged any new german government to become more active in raising human rights issues in russia and china in particular .

but for the majority , suicide still remains a subject they would rather not talk about . while some 6,600 germans died in automobile accidents in 2003 - the last year for which official figures have been compiled - 11,150 took their own lives in the same year , according to germany 's federal statistics office . " when you realize that more people commit suicide than die in traffic accidents and then look at the attention given to automobile accidents , it is clear that suicide is still a taboo subject and not taken as seriously as it should be , " said elmar etzersdorfer of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at stuttgart 's furtbach hospital . the number of suicides yearly has remained fairly constant in recent years , after dropping steadily in the 1980s and 1990s , according to georg fiedler of the therapy center for suicidal persons -lrb- tzs -rrb- in hamburg and secretary of the national suicide prevention initiative . the initiative works to raise awareness and break taboos by providing positive examples of people who have successfully sought and received help . " help used to be centered on large state hospitals where it was hard for many people to get to , " fiedler said of the changes that account for more people seeking help before it 's too late .
" now people have more options closer to home in the normal health system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : help can now be found outside of clinics since people considering taking their own lives nearly always suffer from feelings of guilt and shame , an increase in outpatient therapy means more of them can choose to get help without the stigma of checking into a clinic , fiedler added . suicide can affect anyone there 's no definition of the " typical " suicidal person ; it is a problem that can neither be attributed solely to social or economic conditions nor localized by geographic region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people considering suicide often remove themselves from society " a person 's social situation is one of many factors in suicide , " etzersdorfer said .
" you ca n't say that the unemployed are generally at a higher risk - though that could be one of many factors that play a role - or that cities or rural areas are worse off . " men die more often than women however , there are some demographic conclusions that can be made about who is at risk . statistics show german men are nearly three times more likely to die from suicide , while twice as many women attempt to take their own lives .
women also tend to use techniques , such as drug overdoses , that leave a window for rescue by medical personnel , while men choose methods with a smaller chance of getting outside help , such as hanging and jumping from tall buildings . " women seem to come in earlier when they are experiencing a crisis , " said angela hofmeister of the berlin crisis service , which has nine centers dotted around the german capital .
" men make up about one-third of the visitors to our crisis centers , and by the time they come , the situation is usually already very serious . " the feelings of shame , guilt and helplessness make it especially hard for men to look for help due to entrenched gender roles telling them not to show weakness , fiedler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors often feel suicide is their only option older people also at risk the elderly are another group with an especially high rate of death by suicide , and as the german population continues aging , there is also a likelihood that the number of suicides will increase , fiedler said . " many older people considering suicide are afraid of what will happen to them , " etzersdorfer said .
" they do n't want to die in a hospital , they want to be able to die in dignity and are not aware of options other than taking their own lives . " most of these people , when they receive proper care , decide not to commit suicide , " he added . but it 's not just the elderly that need to be made more sensitive to suicide and suicide prevention treatments .
fiedler said that awareness of suicide 's warning signals plays too small a role in the education of those most often confronted with suicidal people : medical personnel , psychologists , police , social workers , and teachers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people prefer to seek help anonymously talking about suicide does n't cause it often friends and family are afraid of mentioning the topic to someone who may be in danger for fear that it could be enough for the person to take their own life . but studies show people considering suicide often want to talk about their problems and concerns .

given the spread of the virus and the struggle to contain it , fears of a deadly outbreak in the human population are growing . werner lange knows what it 's like when a wave of influenza causes the public apparatus to break down .
the former director of the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , the central institution and coordination center for the federal ministry for health and social security , remembers what happened in the winter of 1969 when , as a virologist in berlin , lange witnessed the second wave of the so-called hong kong influenza outbreak which killed about one million people worldwide . " the hospitals announced that they were forced to stop providing care because a large number of the staff was out ill and there were no beds available , " said lange . many of the dead could n't be buried and some of the corpses had to be stored in an unused subway tunnel .
with many in the coal industry hit by the outbreak , the police stepped in to take over deliveries of the fuel and even transport systems could only function limitedly . risk of infection still low in a bid to avoid a repeat of such widespread chaos , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has been urging governments for years to keep their pandemic emergency plans up-to-date . " in the last two months in particular , countries have begun to do more and more , " said maria chang , spokesperson for the who .
the reason for this is the looming threat of a global avian influenza pandemic . at the moment , the threat to humans remains minimal .
the spread of avian flu from birds to humans remains rare with only those who have intensive , unprotected contact with infected birds being most in danger .
until now , there have been only about 120 confirmed cases of people who have contracted bird flu .
however , half of those have died from the virus . the major concern of the experts is that this figure could explode if the deadly h5n1 strain of the bird virus connects with the human virus , making infection between people highly likely . different plans , same essentials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pandemic emergency plans are in operation all over the world .
some 20 countries have pandemic emergency plans in place . they include most of the european countries as well as the governments of brazil , canada , hong kong , south africa , japan and the us . " the plans differ in each instance , it depends on national circumstances , " said who spokesperson chang .
" if australia wants to close its borders , this is of course easier than in countries which have borders with other lands . " despite national differences , the core elements of the plans are said to have a similar structure . the competence of the emergency services and authorities are checked as are their response procedures in the case of an outbreak ; areas of the population to be vaccinated first with anti-vial drugs are identified , guidelines are laid out to deal with the supervision and control of the infection and public information , travel restrictions and quarantine rules are prepared . german pandemic plan in place , doubts remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health centers around germany have implemented their plans .
for instance in germany , the rki implemented a national pandemic emergency plan in january compiled by a group of 20 experts who drew upon recommendations issued by the who . but , implementation of the plan remains difficult to monitor because a large chunk of it is the responsiblity of the 16 german federal states and the 430 health authorities distributed around the country , said susanne glasmacher , spokeswoman for the rki . " the decision by the federal government to provide 20 million euros for the development of a prototype vaccine was very important , " said glasmacher , adding that it would speed up the development of an effective serum in case of a flu outbreak . in addition , the federal states had decided to stock up on antiviral drugs .
but the stockpile would only last for 10 percent of the population , while the emergency plan recommends securing drugs for 20 percent , glasmacher pointed out . " but one should n't play it down - many countries have n't stockpiled any drugs at all , " she added . international cooperation critically important while the readiness to prepare for a pandemic has increased , what is essential is a significant rise in international cooperation , said maria cheng of the who .
many of the countries in which bird flu has struck do not have the resources to combat the virus and a more concerted global effort would help , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts fear the h5n1 strain may connect with common human flu .
the main challenges are to find ways of identifying the illness early enough , preventing its spread and to create a drug that can combat the h5n1 virus strain .
" if we were able to identify a new strain early enough , we could maybe prevent the spread of the virus , " said cheng . for this reason , the who has hoarded three million boxes of antiviral drugs .
if a strain that was transmitted between humans did arise in a country , the who would then send specialist teams within the shortest possible time there to contain the virus . " according to models , this would happen in areas where there were 20 to 40 cases of infection reported , ” said cheng .
“ nevertheless , this has yet to be applied in practice . " keeping a cool head the best advice at the moment seems to be for everyone to remain level-headed , said susanne glasmacher of the rki . there seems little doubt that there will be a pandemic as the aggressive increase in bird flu cases indicates .
however , the risk of developing the illness is still very low . " if you want to be infected , you must travel to a humid biotope in a chinese nature reserve and pull out the feathers of the birds you find there , " glasmacher said . dennis stute -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chronology : spread of bird flu to europe on wednesday , british lab results confirmed that the bird flu strain found in croatia was the h5n1 type that killed more than 60 people in asia .

the plan envisages a gradual increase in retirement age which will reach 67 by 2035 . the move comes in the wake of dwindling contributions to the state pension system as a result of low birth rates and rising life expectancy in germany .
government subsidies to the cash-strapped system have skyrocketed over the past decade and have contributed to gaping holes in state coffers . curbi n g early retireme n t the pension woes have been compounded by the fact that a huge number of germans currently retire before the age of 65 .
spd leader franz müntefering said that attempts would be made by the new government to curb early retirement before resorting to an increase in the general pension age . " the decision to increase the retirement age will be decided in 2007 at the earliest , " he said .
" but the possibility is now open and will be part of our coalition treaty .

this has led to a drop in the standard of health care and to rising contributions for the population as a whole . attempts in recent months to keep spiralling health costs in check have produced little or no results .
the two parties said that huge differences remain over how to put health care funding on a sound basis again . the draft stays agreement , however , was reached on thursday about the future of military conscription in germany .
chancellor-designate angela merkel appeared pleased , announcing that the first major breakthrough had been made in the negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young germans will continue to have to serve in the military " i strongly welcome the fact that spd and cdu have been able to agree on keeping draft conscription in germany , " she said .
" in addition , progress was made on the use of the bundeswehr in national air space surveillance , as part of domestic attempts to fight terrorism .

despite the dire state of public finances , merkel said that national education and research budgets would not be affected by the cutbacks . she added that plans to increase spending on education and industrial research in germany to 3 percent of gross domestic product by 2010 would also be implemented . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coalition vows to crack down on welfare abuse in their coalition talks , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have agreed to get tough on abuse of germany 's reformed unemployment regulations , known as hartz iv .

the cultural event also has a business angle , as nuremberg companies are shouldering half the costs . bringing the " ring " to a chinese stage for the first time ever , 240 artists and stage workers made the trip .
premiering with " rheingold " on oct .
23 , the bavarian guests " set off an earthquake in viewers ' hearts , " according the beiji n g times newspaper .
" siegfried " followed on oct .
26 .
" die walküre " is scheduled for saturday and " götterdämmerung " will conclude the circle on tuesday . staging the operas cost about one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- , but the chinese only had to pay for half .
companies operating in the nuremberg region agreed to take care of the rest - clearly not without resulting economic benefits in mind . the guest performance opens an economic door to china for us , " said hans-peter schmidt , who heads the supervisory board of nürnberger insurance group and organized the search for sponsors .
he added that nuremberg 's future depends on business ties with asia - ties that sponsors will be able to strengthen when talking to guests in the entry hall of beijing 's poly theater . admiri n g all thi n gs germa n ic german culture has long proven to be an excellent way to polish the country 's already positive image in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer just interested in german cars " the chinese no longer just know german cars , soccer and punctuality , " said jari grosse-ruyken , who heads the society for chinese studies in bonn .
" it 's always also been recognized as a country of philosophers , thinkers and musicians . " members of china 's growing middle class are familiar with names such as goethe , schiller and wagner , grosse-ruyken said , adding that it does n't surprise him that tickets for the performances have long been sold out since many chinese people have an uncritical admiration for all things " germanic . " wagner 's hero epos " falls on fertile ground in china , " he said . cultural gifts from germa n y but even those who have n't heard of siegfried , freia and wotan before have been drawn to the german guest performance , which has gotten a lot of attention from the chinese media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg 's rhinegold production in beijing " chinese audiences are open to new things , " said ulrich novak , director of the goethe institute in beijing .
" but they love major highlights and smaller events sometimes suffer because of this . " while calling the ring performances a " courageous and interesting " project , novak said that his institute preferred to develop events in cooperation with chinese partners rather than " presenting gifts . " but he also said that an interest in culture from the business sector was a good thing in principle . bridges for busi n ess grosse-ruyken went a step further , calling the marriage of business and culture a " future-oriented " strategy in china .
he said that german companies had so far mainly focussed on economic exchanges while chinese people were more and more interested in cultural ones . the importance of cultural exchanges for economic cooperation can hardly be exaggerated , said katja hellkötter , who worked in the german industry 's bureau in shanghai for seven years before moving to munich to work on sino-german cultural cooperation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interest in german culture is growing among chinese " culture and business can not be separated , " she said , adding that increasing the visibility of german culture in china also increased the attractiveness of germany as a business location for chinese companies . " cultural factors and an appreciation of a foreign culture play a role in deciding about investments , " she said .
as a result , schiller , goethe and wagner can serve as " bridges for sino-german relations . " nuremberg 's cultural sponsors seem to think the same : they 're going to co-finance the state theater 's performance of mozart 's " don giovanni " in hong kong next year . mareike aden -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de urging germany to speak up on human rights us-based international civil rights organization human rights watch has urged any new german government to become more active in raising human rights issues in russia and china in particular .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.10.2005 wooing china with german culture großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guarding german culture in china the nuremberg state theater is currently performing richard wagner 's " ring des nibelungen " in beijing .
the cultural event also has a business angle , as nuremberg companies are shouldering half the costs . bringing the " ring " to a chinese stage for the first time ever , 240 artists and stage workers made the trip .
premiering with " rheingold " on oct .
23 , the bavarian guests " set off an earthquake in viewers ' hearts , " according the beiji n g times newspaper .
" siegfried " followed on oct .
26 .
" die walküre " is scheduled for saturday and " götterdämmerung " will conclude the circle on tuesday . staging the operas cost about one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- , but the chinese only had to pay for half .
companies operating in the nuremberg region agreed to take care of the rest - clearly not without resulting economic benefits in mind . the guest performance opens an economic door to china for us , " said hans-peter schmidt , who heads the supervisory board of nürnberger insurance group and organized the search for sponsors .
he added that nuremberg 's future depends on business ties with asia - ties that sponsors will be able to strengthen when talking to guests in the entry hall of beijing 's poly theater . admiri n g all thi n gs germa n ic german culture has long proven to be an excellent way to polish the country 's already positive image in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer just interested in german cars " the chinese no longer just know german cars , soccer and punctuality , " said jari grosse-ruyken , who heads the society for chinese studies in bonn .
" it 's always also been recognized as a country of philosophers , thinkers and musicians . " members of china 's growing middle class are familiar with names such as goethe , schiller and wagner , grosse-ruyken said , adding that it does n't surprise him that tickets for the performances have long been sold out since many chinese people have an uncritical admiration for all things " germanic . " wagner 's hero epos " falls on fertile ground in china , " he said . cultural gifts from germa n y but even those who have n't heard of siegfried , freia and wotan before have been drawn to the german guest performance , which has gotten a lot of attention from the chinese media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg 's rhinegold production in beijing " chinese audiences are open to new things , " said ulrich novak , director of the goethe institute in beijing .

" but orators bowing out of politics , like schröder , tend to give speeches of a different color . " as you are no doubt aware , this was n't a summit where any groundbreaking decisions were made , " he told reporters after the meeting of the 25 european heads of state ended outside of london thursday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of blair 's plans met with schröder 's disapproval schröder let loose with a sharp string of criticism for the anglo-saxon social model , saying it should " certainly not " be used as an example for the rest of the eu and stressing that europe needs to hold to its social roots . " we should not accept social dumping or the undermining of environmental standards in the name of services liberalization , " he said , addressing the other 24 heads of state at the informal meeting .
" people in europe are ready for change , and reform , but they need this with social change . " globalization , budget quarrels continue the eu leaders had hoped to hash out a response to globalization and how to maintain european prosperity without jeopardizing citizens ' security amid growing competition from asian countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso propsed the fund idea another of the agenda 's items , a multi-billion euro eu fund to soften the blow of globalization on european workers , also met with the still-chancellor 's criticism .
schröder said he was " more than skeptical " of the plan - that is supported by british prime minister blair - and that germany could not afford to send any additional money to brussels for the fund or other projects . germany 's chancellor-designate , angela merkel , has also voiced her opposition to the fund over the past week and stated germany would not be sending a bigger check to the eu under her leadership . disagreements on how to finance europe 's 2007-2013 budget could not be overcome at the meeting as discord in the agricultural and service market sectors continued , the heads of state , however , adding pressure to find a consensus the next time the council meets in december . merkel will be welcome european table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will take over for schöder at the next round of talks as europe anticipates new leadership in germany , britain 's guardian newspaper reported that blair may have set the meeting for a time when he thought merkel - who is expected to be more favorable to some of his to proposals - would have already taken over for schröder . french president jacques chirac also said he is confident relations with germany will not change .
chirac predicted merkel would further strengthen the bond between the two nations regarding the thorny topic of agriculture . " there will be absolutely no change , none at all , " said chirac , who enjoyed a close working friendship with schröder .

" but orators bowing out of politics , like schröder , tend to give speeches of a different color . " as you are no doubt aware , this was n't a summit where any groundbreaking decisions were made , " he told reporters after the meeting of the 25 european heads of state ended outside of london thursday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of blair 's plans met with schröder 's disapproval schröder let loose with a sharp string of criticism for the anglo-saxon social model , saying it should " certainly not " be used as an example for the rest of the eu and stressing that europe needs to hold to its social roots . " we should not accept social dumping or the undermining of environmental standards in the name of services liberalization , " he said , addressing the other 24 heads of state at the informal meeting .
" people in europe are ready for change , and reform , but they need this with social change . " globalization , budget quarrels continue the eu leaders had hoped to hash out a response to globalization and how to maintain european prosperity without jeopardizing citizens ' security amid growing competition from asian countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso propsed the fund idea another of the agenda 's items , a multi-billion euro eu fund to soften the blow of globalization on european workers , also met with the still-chancellor 's criticism .
schröder said he was " more than skeptical " of the plan - that is supported by british prime minister blair - and that germany could not afford to send any additional money to brussels for the fund or other projects . germany 's chancellor-designate , angela merkel , has also voiced her opposition to the fund over the past week and stated germany would not be sending a bigger check to the eu under her leadership . disagreements on how to finance europe 's 2007-2013 budget could not be overcome at the meeting as discord in the agricultural and service market sectors continued , the heads of state , however , adding pressure to find a consensus the next time the council meets in december . merkel will be welcome european table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will take over for schöder at the next round of talks as europe anticipates new leadership in germany , britain 's guardian newspaper reported that blair may have set the meeting for a time when he thought merkel - who is expected to be more favorable to some of his to proposals - would have already taken over for schröder . french president jacques chirac also said he is confident relations with germany will not change .
chirac predicted merkel would further strengthen the bond between the two nations regarding the thorny topic of agriculture . " there will be absolutely no change , none at all , " said chirac , who enjoyed a close working friendship with schröder .

" jürgen klinsmann is willing to extend his contract if the world cup finals are positive , " according to a dfb press release . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winning the world cup on home territory is klinsmann 's aim klinsmann , who said his position as national team coach was " perfect for me , " has set the target of lifting the world cup , running from june 9 to july 9 . " we are glad to know we can plan with klinsmann in the long term but know it all depends on the world cup , " explained dfb president theo zwanziger .
" no decisions can be made before then .

" it 's fun working with jürgen and he can easily imagine doing longer . " it is the first time klinsmann gave any hint as to his future with the national team after the world cup .
but the 41-year-old coach still would n't address the two questions german soccer fans really want answered : will he continue living in califiornia and will it be oliver kahn or jens lehmann standing for germany in goal . klinsmann , who had no previous managerial experience , took over from rudi völler after euro 2004 when germany failed to win a single match .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.10.2005 hot property is turn-off for settled angie großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : great views of berlin but apparently not enough room to swing a cat most people would be glad to have a shorter journey to work but not angela merkel .
the chancellor-designate is unwilling to leave her home of seven years and move into the quarters soon to be vacated by gerhard schröder . one would imagine that there is a berlin estate agent sitting somewhere in the german capital scratching his or her head incredulously at this moment .
berlin is a popular city and there is no shortage of people wanting to live in its impressive and relatively cheap accommodation . but news that willy-brandt-strasse 1 - one of the most desirable addresses in the city - may remain empty when it is vacated in a few weeks has left many property experts perplexed . the eighth floor apartment has a wonderful view of the bundestag parliament building , is in spitting distance of some of berlin 's most stunning and historic architectural sites and has some of the tightest security in the country . and yet , angela merkel has no intention of taking up residency in the chancellor ’ s private quarters in the kanzleramt when she is - presumably - sworn in as germany 's first female leader on november 22 . most people would be glad to live so close to work , especially in a heaving metropolis where rush-hour traffic at each end of the day can leave one feeling drained and claustrophobic .
but frau merkel seems intent on staying on in her central berlin apartment , despite the benefits of moving closer to her place of work . gerd 's old gym shoes behind decision not to move ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel may shudder at the thought of discovering gerd 's old tracksuit .
could it be that the outgoing tenant , gerhard schröder , had some particularly unpleasant habits while in residence there - like leaving his unwashed soccer kit lying around or making an impressive ' beer wall ' out of empty bottles ? " i go to work everyday from my apartment in berlin mitte .
i have done so everyday and will continue to do so , " the chancellor-designate told german news agency dpa while avoiding any reference to any unusual smells in the flat more common of a student squat than the home of a world leader . indeed , potential lingering evidence of past tenants aside , angie has a point .
from her current abode near the city 's museum island , merkel easily gets to work in the morning by foot in less than half an hour while taking a pleasant route along the river spree . chancellor 's quarters hardly a palace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first dog may have even found the apartment a bit cramped .
on top of that , rumor has it that the chancellor 's apartment is not big enough to swing a cat - or in schröder 's case , a border terrier - and that the small rooms are barely separated from working areas in the kanzleramt office block .
even schröder himself mostly lived there alone and went home to hanover whenever possible to be with his family . the married 51-year-old merkel , therefore , sees no reason to up and move herself and husband joachim sauer from their home of seven years . angie 's current home to undergo security upgrade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she wo n't be waving goodbye to her house but certainly to some freedom .
however , her elevation to the top job in german politics does mean that her home life will change even if her address does not .
living in close proximity to the museum island - one of the city 's biggest tourist attractions - the soon-to-be chancellor will have to get used to increased security around her house . a small price to pay , it could be said , when the alternative would be perhaps discovering gerd 's tennis socks down the back of the sofa during a flat warming party . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bidding farewell to berlin 's squatters police this week evicted squatters of a famous tenement in berlin .

the plan envisages a gradual increase in retirement age which will reach 67 by 2035 . the move comes in the wake of dwindling contributions to the state pension system as a result of low birth rates and rising life expectancy in germany .

given the spread of the virus and the struggle to contain it , fears of a deadly outbreak in the human population are growing . werner lange knows what it 's like when a wave of influenza causes the public apparatus to break down .
the former director of the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , the central institution and coordination center for the federal ministry for health and social security , remembers what happened in the winter of 1969 when , as a virologist in berlin , lange witnessed the second wave of the so-called hong kong influenza outbreak which killed about one million people worldwide . " the hospitals announced that they were forced to stop providing care because a large number of the staff was out ill and there were no beds available , " said lange . many of the dead could n't be buried and some of the corpses had to be stored in an unused subway tunnel .
with many in the coal industry hit by the outbreak , the police stepped in to take over deliveries of the fuel and even transport systems could only function limitedly . risk of infection still low in a bid to avoid a repeat of such widespread chaos , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has been urging governments for years to keep their pandemic emergency plans up-to-date . " in the last two months in particular , countries have begun to do more and more , " said maria chang , spokesperson for the who .
the reason for this is the looming threat of a global avian influenza pandemic . at the moment , the threat to humans remains minimal .
the spread of avian flu from birds to humans remains rare with only those who have intensive , unprotected contact with infected birds being most in danger .
until now , there have been only about 120 confirmed cases of people who have contracted bird flu .
however , half of those have died from the virus . the major concern of the experts is that this figure could explode if the deadly h5n1 strain of the bird virus connects with the human virus , making infection between people highly likely . different plans , same essentials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pandemic emergency plans are in operation all over the world .
some 20 countries have pandemic emergency plans in place . they include most of the european countries as well as the governments of brazil , canada , hong kong , south africa , japan and the us . " the plans differ in each instance , it depends on national circumstances , " said who spokesperson chang .
" if australia wants to close its borders , this is of course easier than in countries which have borders with other lands . " despite national differences , the core elements of the plans are said to have a similar structure . the competence of the emergency services and authorities are checked as are their response procedures in the case of an outbreak ; areas of the population to be vaccinated first with anti-vial drugs are identified , guidelines are laid out to deal with the supervision and control of the infection and public information , travel restrictions and quarantine rules are prepared . german pandemic plan in place , doubts remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health centers around germany have implemented their plans .
for instance in germany , the rki implemented a national pandemic emergency plan in january compiled by a group of 20 experts who drew upon recommendations issued by the who . but , implementation of the plan remains difficult to monitor because a large chunk of it is the responsiblity of the 16 german federal states and the 430 health authorities distributed around the country , said susanne glasmacher , spokeswoman for the rki . " the decision by the federal government to provide 20 million euros for the development of a prototype vaccine was very important , " said glasmacher , adding that it would speed up the development of an effective serum in case of a flu outbreak . in addition , the federal states had decided to stock up on antiviral drugs .
but the stockpile would only last for 10 percent of the population , while the emergency plan recommends securing drugs for 20 percent , glasmacher pointed out . " but one should n't play it down - many countries have n't stockpiled any drugs at all , " she added . international cooperation critically important while the readiness to prepare for a pandemic has increased , what is essential is a significant rise in international cooperation , said maria cheng of the who .
many of the countries in which bird flu has struck do not have the resources to combat the virus and a more concerted global effort would help , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts fear the h5n1 strain may connect with common human flu .
the main challenges are to find ways of identifying the illness early enough , preventing its spread and to create a drug that can combat the h5n1 virus strain .
" if we were able to identify a new strain early enough , we could maybe prevent the spread of the virus , " said cheng . for this reason , the who has hoarded three million boxes of antiviral drugs .
if a strain that was transmitted between humans did arise in a country , the who would then send specialist teams within the shortest possible time there to contain the virus . " according to models , this would happen in areas where there were 20 to 40 cases of infection reported , ” said cheng .
“ nevertheless , this has yet to be applied in practice . " keeping a cool head the best advice at the moment seems to be for everyone to remain level-headed , said susanne glasmacher of the rki . there seems little doubt that there will be a pandemic as the aggressive increase in bird flu cases indicates .
however , the risk of developing the illness is still very low . " if you want to be infected , you must travel to a humid biotope in a chinese nature reserve and pull out the feathers of the birds you find there , " glasmacher said . dennis stute -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chronology : spread of bird flu to europe on wednesday , british lab results confirmed that the bird flu strain found in croatia was the h5n1 type that killed more than 60 people in asia .

given the spread of the virus and the struggle to contain it , fears of a deadly outbreak in the human population are growing . werner lange knows what it 's like when a wave of influenza causes the public apparatus to break down .
the former director of the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , the central institution and coordination center for the federal ministry for health and social security , remembers what happened in the winter of 1969 when , as a virologist in berlin , lange witnessed the second wave of the so-called hong kong influenza outbreak which killed about one million people worldwide . " the hospitals announced that they were forced to stop providing care because a large number of the staff was out ill and there were no beds available , " said lange . many of the dead could n't be buried and some of the corpses had to be stored in an unused subway tunnel .
with many in the coal industry hit by the outbreak , the police stepped in to take over deliveries of the fuel and even transport systems could only function limitedly . risk of infection still low in a bid to avoid a repeat of such widespread chaos , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has been urging governments for years to keep their pandemic emergency plans up-to-date . " in the last two months in particular , countries have begun to do more and more , " said maria chang , spokesperson for the who .
the reason for this is the looming threat of a global avian influenza pandemic . at the moment , the threat to humans remains minimal .
the spread of avian flu from birds to humans remains rare with only those who have intensive , unprotected contact with infected birds being most in danger .
until now , there have been only about 120 confirmed cases of people who have contracted bird flu .
however , half of those have died from the virus . the major concern of the experts is that this figure could explode if the deadly h5n1 strain of the bird virus connects with the human virus , making infection between people highly likely . different plans , same essentials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pandemic emergency plans are in operation all over the world .
some 20 countries have pandemic emergency plans in place . they include most of the european countries as well as the governments of brazil , canada , hong kong , south africa , japan and the us . " the plans differ in each instance , it depends on national circumstances , " said who spokesperson chang .
" if australia wants to close its borders , this is of course easier than in countries which have borders with other lands . " despite national differences , the core elements of the plans are said to have a similar structure . the competence of the emergency services and authorities are checked as are their response procedures in the case of an outbreak ; areas of the population to be vaccinated first with anti-vial drugs are identified , guidelines are laid out to deal with the supervision and control of the infection and public information , travel restrictions and quarantine rules are prepared . german pandemic plan in place , doubts remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health centers around germany have implemented their plans .
for instance in germany , the rki implemented a national pandemic emergency plan in january compiled by a group of 20 experts who drew upon recommendations issued by the who . but , implementation of the plan remains difficult to monitor because a large chunk of it is the responsiblity of the 16 german federal states and the 430 health authorities distributed around the country , said susanne glasmacher , spokeswoman for the rki . " the decision by the federal government to provide 20 million euros for the development of a prototype vaccine was very important , " said glasmacher , adding that it would speed up the development of an effective serum in case of a flu outbreak . in addition , the federal states had decided to stock up on antiviral drugs .

the chancellor-designate is unwilling to leave her home of seven years and move into the quarters soon to be vacated by gerhard schröder . one would imagine that there is a berlin estate agent sitting somewhere in the german capital scratching his or her head incredulously at this moment .
berlin is a popular city and there is no shortage of people wanting to live in its impressive and relatively cheap accommodation . but news that willy-brandt-strasse 1 - one of the most desirable addresses in the city - may remain empty when it is vacated in a few weeks has left many property experts perplexed . the eighth floor apartment has a wonderful view of the bundestag parliament building , is in spitting distance of some of berlin 's most stunning and historic architectural sites and has some of the tightest security in the country . and yet , angela merkel has no intention of taking up residency in the chancellor ’ s private quarters in the kanzleramt when she is - presumably - sworn in as germany 's first female leader on november 22 . most people would be glad to live so close to work , especially in a heaving metropolis where rush-hour traffic at each end of the day can leave one feeling drained and claustrophobic .
but frau merkel seems intent on staying on in her central berlin apartment , despite the benefits of moving closer to her place of work . gerd 's old gym shoes behind decision not to move ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel may shudder at the thought of discovering gerd 's old tracksuit .
could it be that the outgoing tenant , gerhard schröder , had some particularly unpleasant habits while in residence there - like leaving his unwashed soccer kit lying around or making an impressive ' beer wall ' out of empty bottles ? " i go to work everyday from my apartment in berlin mitte .
i have done so everyday and will continue to do so , " the chancellor-designate told german news agency dpa while avoiding any reference to any unusual smells in the flat more common of a student squat than the home of a world leader . indeed , potential lingering evidence of past tenants aside , angie has a point .
from her current abode near the city 's museum island , merkel easily gets to work in the morning by foot in less than half an hour while taking a pleasant route along the river spree . chancellor 's quarters hardly a palace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first dog may have even found the apartment a bit cramped .
on top of that , rumor has it that the chancellor 's apartment is not big enough to swing a cat - or in schröder 's case , a border terrier - and that the small rooms are barely separated from working areas in the kanzleramt office block .
even schröder himself mostly lived there alone and went home to hanover whenever possible to be with his family . the married 51-year-old merkel , therefore , sees no reason to up and move herself and husband joachim sauer from their home of seven years . angie 's current home to undergo security upgrade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she wo n't be waving goodbye to her house but certainly to some freedom .
however , her elevation to the top job in german politics does mean that her home life will change even if her address does not .
living in close proximity to the museum island - one of the city 's biggest tourist attractions - the soon-to-be chancellor will have to get used to increased security around her house . a small price to pay , it could be said , when the alternative would be perhaps discovering gerd 's tennis socks down the back of the sofa during a flat warming party . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bidding farewell to berlin 's squatters police this week evicted squatters of a famous tenement in berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : death and dying in germany end-of-life care neglected in germany filling the final days with laughter when life becomes worse than death choosing physician-assisted death germany -pipe- 28.10.2005 germans too quiet about suicide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people considering suicide want to be taken seriously more than 11,000 germans take their own lives annually , though more people are deciding to seek help .
but for the majority , suicide still remains a subject they would rather not talk about . while some 6,600 germans died in automobile accidents in 2003 - the last year for which official figures have been compiled - 11,150 took their own lives in the same year , according to germany 's federal statistics office . " when you realize that more people commit suicide than die in traffic accidents and then look at the attention given to automobile accidents , it is clear that suicide is still a taboo subject and not taken as seriously as it should be , " said elmar etzersdorfer of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at stuttgart 's furtbach hospital . the number of suicides yearly has remained fairly constant in recent years , after dropping steadily in the 1980s and 1990s , according to georg fiedler of the therapy center for suicidal persons -lrb- tzs -rrb- in hamburg and secretary of the national suicide prevention initiative . the initiative works to raise awareness and break taboos by providing positive examples of people who have successfully sought and received help . " help used to be centered on large state hospitals where it was hard for many people to get to , " fiedler said of the changes that account for more people seeking help before it 's too late .
" now people have more options closer to home in the normal health system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : help can now be found outside of clinics since people considering taking their own lives nearly always suffer from feelings of guilt and shame , an increase in outpatient therapy means more of them can choose to get help without the stigma of checking into a clinic , fiedler added . suicide can affect anyone there 's no definition of the " typical " suicidal person ; it is a problem that can neither be attributed solely to social or economic conditions nor localized by geographic region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people considering suicide often remove themselves from society " a person 's social situation is one of many factors in suicide , " etzersdorfer said .
" you ca n't say that the unemployed are generally at a higher risk - though that could be one of many factors that play a role - or that cities or rural areas are worse off . " men die more often than women however , there are some demographic conclusions that can be made about who is at risk . statistics show german men are nearly three times more likely to die from suicide , while twice as many women attempt to take their own lives .
women also tend to use techniques , such as drug overdoses , that leave a window for rescue by medical personnel , while men choose methods with a smaller chance of getting outside help , such as hanging and jumping from tall buildings .

but for the majority , suicide still remains a subject they would rather not talk about . while some 6,600 germans died in automobile accidents in 2003 - the last year for which official figures have been compiled - 11,150 took their own lives in the same year , according to germany 's federal statistics office . " when you realize that more people commit suicide than die in traffic accidents and then look at the attention given to automobile accidents , it is clear that suicide is still a taboo subject and not taken as seriously as it should be , " said elmar etzersdorfer of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at stuttgart 's furtbach hospital . the number of suicides yearly has remained fairly constant in recent years , after dropping steadily in the 1980s and 1990s , according to georg fiedler of the therapy center for suicidal persons -lrb- tzs -rrb- in hamburg and secretary of the national suicide prevention initiative . the initiative works to raise awareness and break taboos by providing positive examples of people who have successfully sought and received help .

" " we know of no kick-back payments initiated or tolerated by siemens to seal contracts related to the oil-for food programme , " a siemens spokesman said .
" the committee has not been able to provide any evidence of the alleged kickback payments . " siemens ag , the company flagship , allegedly paid 48,925 euros -lrb- $ 59,434 -rrb- in kickbacks for a contract to provide equipment to the ministry of electricity , according to iraqi government documents submitted for un approval cited by the inquiry . the kickbacks from siemens are also corroborated in records obtained from a bank in jordan , the inquiry said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler is investigating the alleged bribes internally a daimlerchrysler manager is alleged to have paid bribes of $ 7,134 .
there was no evidence that others in the company were aware of the payouts . though un general secretary kofi annan said he hoped the companies listed in the report would be held accountable by local authorities , german prosecutors in stuttgart and munich , where siemens and daimlerchrysler are respectively based , said they did not have enough information to press charges against the companies . saddam manipulated aid program the international inquiry committee , led by former us federal reserve chairman paul volcker , spent 18 months examining what went wrong with the un oil-for-food program that ran from 1996 to 2003 and was meant to provide relief to ordinary iraqis suffering under international sanctions by selling a limited amount of iraqi oil under un supervision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the money was supposed to help ordinary iraqis in need the inquiry committee , however , found that saddam 's regime manipulated the program to extract $ 1.8 billion in surcharges and bribes while an inept un headquarters failed to exert administrative control .

" " we know of no kick-back payments initiated or tolerated by siemens to seal contracts related to the oil-for food programme , " a siemens spokesman said .
" the committee has not been able to provide any evidence of the alleged kickback payments . " siemens ag , the company flagship , allegedly paid 48,925 euros -lrb- $ 59,434 -rrb- in kickbacks for a contract to provide equipment to the ministry of electricity , according to iraqi government documents submitted for un approval cited by the inquiry . the kickbacks from siemens are also corroborated in records obtained from a bank in jordan , the inquiry said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler is investigating the alleged bribes internally a daimlerchrysler manager is alleged to have paid bribes of $ 7,134 .
there was no evidence that others in the company were aware of the payouts . though un general secretary kofi annan said he hoped the companies listed in the report would be held accountable by local authorities , german prosecutors in stuttgart and munich , where siemens and daimlerchrysler are respectively based , said they did not have enough information to press charges against the companies . saddam manipulated aid program the international inquiry committee , led by former us federal reserve chairman paul volcker , spent 18 months examining what went wrong with the un oil-for-food program that ran from 1996 to 2003 and was meant to provide relief to ordinary iraqis suffering under international sanctions by selling a limited amount of iraqi oil under un supervision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the money was supposed to help ordinary iraqis in need the inquiry committee , however , found that saddam 's regime manipulated the program to extract $ 1.8 billion in surcharges and bribes while an inept un headquarters failed to exert administrative control .
according to the report , 139 companies paid illegal oil surcharges to baghdad and 2,253 firms gave saddam 's regime kickbacks on humanitarian-related goods shipped to iraq . hansjörg elshorst , head of the anti-corruption agency transparency international called the bribes and payments the " biggest scandal in the last decades . " companies may not have known of payments while the committee 's report raised serious questions about the practices of the companies named , volcker stopped short of an explicit condemnation or verdict . " the identification of a particular company in the report does not necessarily mean that that company as opposed to an agent ... made , authorized or even knew about illicit payments , " volcker told reporters in new york . in written responses included in the report , the named corporations said they had no idea such kickbacks were paid out and that such transactions were ever authorized . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un is best seen in humble light on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the un charter , dw 's klaus dahmann comments on the shortcomings - and occasional strengths - of an organization dedicated to world peace .

he said that german companies had so far mainly focussed on economic exchanges while chinese people were more and more interested in cultural ones . the importance of cultural exchanges for economic cooperation can hardly be exaggerated , said katja hellkötter , who worked in the german industry 's bureau in shanghai for seven years before moving to munich to work on sino-german cultural cooperation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interest in german culture is growing among chinese " culture and business can not be separated , " she said , adding that increasing the visibility of german culture in china also increased the attractiveness of germany as a business location for chinese companies . " cultural factors and an appreciation of a foreign culture play a role in deciding about investments , " she said .
as a result , schiller , goethe and wagner can serve as " bridges for sino-german relations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.10.2005 hot property is turn-off for settled angie großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : great views of berlin but apparently not enough room to swing a cat most people would be glad to have a shorter journey to work but not angela merkel .
the chancellor-designate is unwilling to leave her home of seven years and move into the quarters soon to be vacated by gerhard schröder . one would imagine that there is a berlin estate agent sitting somewhere in the german capital scratching his or her head incredulously at this moment .
berlin is a popular city and there is no shortage of people wanting to live in its impressive and relatively cheap accommodation . but news that willy-brandt-strasse 1 - one of the most desirable addresses in the city - may remain empty when it is vacated in a few weeks has left many property experts perplexed . the eighth floor apartment has a wonderful view of the bundestag parliament building , is in spitting distance of some of berlin 's most stunning and historic architectural sites and has some of the tightest security in the country . and yet , angela merkel has no intention of taking up residency in the chancellor ’ s private quarters in the kanzleramt when she is - presumably - sworn in as germany 's first female leader on november 22 . most people would be glad to live so close to work , especially in a heaving metropolis where rush-hour traffic at each end of the day can leave one feeling drained and claustrophobic .
but frau merkel seems intent on staying on in her central berlin apartment , despite the benefits of moving closer to her place of work . gerd 's old gym shoes behind decision not to move ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel may shudder at the thought of discovering gerd 's old tracksuit .
could it be that the outgoing tenant , gerhard schröder , had some particularly unpleasant habits while in residence there - like leaving his unwashed soccer kit lying around or making an impressive ' beer wall ' out of empty bottles ? " i go to work everyday from my apartment in berlin mitte .
i have done so everyday and will continue to do so , " the chancellor-designate told german news agency dpa while avoiding any reference to any unusual smells in the flat more common of a student squat than the home of a world leader . indeed , potential lingering evidence of past tenants aside , angie has a point .
from her current abode near the city 's museum island , merkel easily gets to work in the morning by foot in less than half an hour while taking a pleasant route along the river spree . chancellor 's quarters hardly a palace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first dog may have even found the apartment a bit cramped .
on top of that , rumor has it that the chancellor 's apartment is not big enough to swing a cat - or in schröder 's case , a border terrier - and that the small rooms are barely separated from working areas in the kanzleramt office block .
even schröder himself mostly lived there alone and went home to hanover whenever possible to be with his family . the married 51-year-old merkel , therefore , sees no reason to up and move herself and husband joachim sauer from their home of seven years . angie 's current home to undergo security upgrade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she wo n't be waving goodbye to her house but certainly to some freedom .
however , her elevation to the top job in german politics does mean that her home life will change even if her address does not .
living in close proximity to the museum island - one of the city 's biggest tourist attractions - the soon-to-be chancellor will have to get used to increased security around her house . a small price to pay , it could be said , when the alternative would be perhaps discovering gerd 's tennis socks down the back of the sofa during a flat warming party . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bidding farewell to berlin 's squatters police this week evicted squatters of a famous tenement in berlin .

but for the majority , suicide still remains a subject they would rather not talk about . while some 6,600 germans died in automobile accidents in 2003 - the last year for which official figures have been compiled - 11,150 took their own lives in the same year , according to germany 's federal statistics office . " when you realize that more people commit suicide than die in traffic accidents and then look at the attention given to automobile accidents , it is clear that suicide is still a taboo subject and not taken as seriously as it should be , " said elmar etzersdorfer of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at stuttgart 's furtbach hospital . the number of suicides yearly has remained fairly constant in recent years , after dropping steadily in the 1980s and 1990s , according to georg fiedler of the therapy center for suicidal persons -lrb- tzs -rrb- in hamburg and secretary of the national suicide prevention initiative . the initiative works to raise awareness and break taboos by providing positive examples of people who have successfully sought and received help . " help used to be centered on large state hospitals where it was hard for many people to get to , " fiedler said of the changes that account for more people seeking help before it 's too late .
" now people have more options closer to home in the normal health system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : help can now be found outside of clinics since people considering taking their own lives nearly always suffer from feelings of guilt and shame , an increase in outpatient therapy means more of them can choose to get help without the stigma of checking into a clinic , fiedler added . suicide can affect anyone there 's no definition of the " typical " suicidal person ; it is a problem that can neither be attributed solely to social or economic conditions nor localized by geographic region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people considering suicide often remove themselves from society " a person 's social situation is one of many factors in suicide , " etzersdorfer said .
" you ca n't say that the unemployed are generally at a higher risk - though that could be one of many factors that play a role - or that cities or rural areas are worse off . " men die more often than women however , there are some demographic conclusions that can be made about who is at risk . statistics show german men are nearly three times more likely to die from suicide , while twice as many women attempt to take their own lives .
women also tend to use techniques , such as drug overdoses , that leave a window for rescue by medical personnel , while men choose methods with a smaller chance of getting outside help , such as hanging and jumping from tall buildings . " women seem to come in earlier when they are experiencing a crisis , " said angela hofmeister of the berlin crisis service , which has nine centers dotted around the german capital .
" men make up about one-third of the visitors to our crisis centers , and by the time they come , the situation is usually already very serious . " the feelings of shame , guilt and helplessness make it especially hard for men to look for help due to entrenched gender roles telling them not to show weakness , fiedler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors often feel suicide is their only option older people also at risk the elderly are another group with an especially high rate of death by suicide , and as the german population continues aging , there is also a likelihood that the number of suicides will increase , fiedler said . " many older people considering suicide are afraid of what will happen to them , " etzersdorfer said .
" they do n't want to die in a hospital , they want to be able to die in dignity and are not aware of options other than taking their own lives . " most of these people , when they receive proper care , decide not to commit suicide , " he added . but it 's not just the elderly that need to be made more sensitive to suicide and suicide prevention treatments .
fiedler said that awareness of suicide 's warning signals plays too small a role in the education of those most often confronted with suicidal people : medical personnel , psychologists , police , social workers , and teachers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people prefer to seek help anonymously talking about suicide does n't cause it often friends and family are afraid of mentioning the topic to someone who may be in danger for fear that it could be enough for the person to take their own life . but studies show people considering suicide often want to talk about their problems and concerns . " people want to see that they are being taken seriously , not just hear , ' hey , look how great life is ' , " fiedler said .

the former director of the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , the central institution and coordination center for the federal ministry for health and social security , remembers what happened in the winter of 1969 when , as a virologist in berlin , lange witnessed the second wave of the so-called hong kong influenza outbreak which killed about one million people worldwide . " the hospitals announced that they were forced to stop providing care because a large number of the staff was out ill and there were no beds available , " said lange . many of the dead could n't be buried and some of the corpses had to be stored in an unused subway tunnel .

the reason for this is the looming threat of a global avian influenza pandemic . at the moment , the threat to humans remains minimal .
the spread of avian flu from birds to humans remains rare with only those who have intensive , unprotected contact with infected birds being most in danger .
until now , there have been only about 120 confirmed cases of people who have contracted bird flu .

" the decision by the federal government to provide 20 million euros for the development of a prototype vaccine was very important , " said glasmacher , adding that it would speed up the development of an effective serum in case of a flu outbreak . in addition , the federal states had decided to stock up on antiviral drugs .
but the stockpile would only last for 10 percent of the population , while the emergency plan recommends securing drugs for 20 percent , glasmacher pointed out . " but one should n't play it down - many countries have n't stockpiled any drugs at all , " she added . international cooperation critically important while the readiness to prepare for a pandemic has increased , what is essential is a significant rise in international cooperation , said maria cheng of the who .
many of the countries in which bird flu has struck do not have the resources to combat the virus and a more concerted global effort would help , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts fear the h5n1 strain may connect with common human flu .
the main challenges are to find ways of identifying the illness early enough , preventing its spread and to create a drug that can combat the h5n1 virus strain .
" if we were able to identify a new strain early enough , we could maybe prevent the spread of the virus , " said cheng . for this reason , the who has hoarded three million boxes of antiviral drugs .
if a strain that was transmitted between humans did arise in a country , the who would then send specialist teams within the shortest possible time there to contain the virus . " according to models , this would happen in areas where there were 20 to 40 cases of infection reported , ” said cheng .

however , the risk of developing the illness is still very low .

" the decision by the federal government to provide 20 million euros for the development of a prototype vaccine was very important , " said glasmacher , adding that it would speed up the development of an effective serum in case of a flu outbreak . in addition , the federal states had decided to stock up on antiviral drugs .

for instance in germany , the rki implemented a national pandemic emergency plan in january compiled by a group of 20 experts who drew upon recommendations issued by the who . but , implementation of the plan remains difficult to monitor because a large chunk of it is the responsiblity of the 16 german federal states and the 430 health authorities distributed around the country , said susanne glasmacher , spokeswoman for the rki . " the decision by the federal government to provide 20 million euros for the development of a prototype vaccine was very important , " said glasmacher , adding that it would speed up the development of an effective serum in case of a flu outbreak . in addition , the federal states had decided to stock up on antiviral drugs .
but the stockpile would only last for 10 percent of the population , while the emergency plan recommends securing drugs for 20 percent , glasmacher pointed out . " but one should n't play it down - many countries have n't stockpiled any drugs at all , " she added . international cooperation critically important while the readiness to prepare for a pandemic has increased , what is essential is a significant rise in international cooperation , said maria cheng of the who .
many of the countries in which bird flu has struck do not have the resources to combat the virus and a more concerted global effort would help , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts fear the h5n1 strain may connect with common human flu .
the main challenges are to find ways of identifying the illness early enough , preventing its spread and to create a drug that can combat the h5n1 virus strain .
" if we were able to identify a new strain early enough , we could maybe prevent the spread of the virus , " said cheng . for this reason , the who has hoarded three million boxes of antiviral drugs .
if a strain that was transmitted between humans did arise in a country , the who would then send specialist teams within the shortest possible time there to contain the virus . " according to models , this would happen in areas where there were 20 to 40 cases of infection reported , ” said cheng .
“ nevertheless , this has yet to be applied in practice . " keeping a cool head the best advice at the moment seems to be for everyone to remain level-headed , said susanne glasmacher of the rki . there seems little doubt that there will be a pandemic as the aggressive increase in bird flu cases indicates .
however , the risk of developing the illness is still very low . " if you want to be infected , you must travel to a humid biotope in a chinese nature reserve and pull out the feathers of the birds you find there , " glasmacher said . dennis stute -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chronology : spread of bird flu to europe on wednesday , british lab results confirmed that the bird flu strain found in croatia was the h5n1 type that killed more than 60 people in asia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.10.2005 hot property is turn-off for settled angie großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : great views of berlin but apparently not enough room to swing a cat most people would be glad to have a shorter journey to work but not angela merkel .
the chancellor-designate is unwilling to leave her home of seven years and move into the quarters soon to be vacated by gerhard schröder . one would imagine that there is a berlin estate agent sitting somewhere in the german capital scratching his or her head incredulously at this moment .
berlin is a popular city and there is no shortage of people wanting to live in its impressive and relatively cheap accommodation . but news that willy-brandt-strasse 1 - one of the most desirable addresses in the city - may remain empty when it is vacated in a few weeks has left many property experts perplexed . the eighth floor apartment has a wonderful view of the bundestag parliament building , is in spitting distance of some of berlin 's most stunning and historic architectural sites and has some of the tightest security in the country . and yet , angela merkel has no intention of taking up residency in the chancellor ’ s private quarters in the kanzleramt when she is - presumably - sworn in as germany 's first female leader on november 22 . most people would be glad to live so close to work , especially in a heaving metropolis where rush-hour traffic at each end of the day can leave one feeling drained and claustrophobic .
but frau merkel seems intent on staying on in her central berlin apartment , despite the benefits of moving closer to her place of work . gerd 's old gym shoes behind decision not to move ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel may shudder at the thought of discovering gerd 's old tracksuit .
could it be that the outgoing tenant , gerhard schröder , had some particularly unpleasant habits while in residence there - like leaving his unwashed soccer kit lying around or making an impressive ' beer wall ' out of empty bottles ? " i go to work everyday from my apartment in berlin mitte .
i have done so everyday and will continue to do so , " the chancellor-designate told german news agency dpa while avoiding any reference to any unusual smells in the flat more common of a student squat than the home of a world leader . indeed , potential lingering evidence of past tenants aside , angie has a point .
from her current abode near the city 's museum island , merkel easily gets to work in the morning by foot in less than half an hour while taking a pleasant route along the river spree . chancellor 's quarters hardly a palace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first dog may have even found the apartment a bit cramped .
on top of that , rumor has it that the chancellor 's apartment is not big enough to swing a cat - or in schröder 's case , a border terrier - and that the small rooms are barely separated from working areas in the kanzleramt office block .
even schröder himself mostly lived there alone and went home to hanover whenever possible to be with his family . the married 51-year-old merkel , therefore , sees no reason to up and move herself and husband joachim sauer from their home of seven years . angie 's current home to undergo security upgrade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she wo n't be waving goodbye to her house but certainly to some freedom .
however , her elevation to the top job in german politics does mean that her home life will change even if her address does not .
living in close proximity to the museum island - one of the city 's biggest tourist attractions - the soon-to-be chancellor will have to get used to increased security around her house . a small price to pay , it could be said , when the alternative would be perhaps discovering gerd 's tennis socks down the back of the sofa during a flat warming party . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bidding farewell to berlin 's squatters police this week evicted squatters of a famous tenement in berlin .
the move is just one more example of how the new german capital moves away from its post-war past .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.10.2005 hot property is turn-off for settled angie großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : great views of berlin but apparently not enough room to swing a cat most people would be glad to have a shorter journey to work but not angela merkel .
the chancellor-designate is unwilling to leave her home of seven years and move into the quarters soon to be vacated by gerhard schröder . one would imagine that there is a berlin estate agent sitting somewhere in the german capital scratching his or her head incredulously at this moment .
berlin is a popular city and there is no shortage of people wanting to live in its impressive and relatively cheap accommodation . but news that willy-brandt-strasse 1 - one of the most desirable addresses in the city - may remain empty when it is vacated in a few weeks has left many property experts perplexed . the eighth floor apartment has a wonderful view of the bundestag parliament building , is in spitting distance of some of berlin 's most stunning and historic architectural sites and has some of the tightest security in the country . and yet , angela merkel has no intention of taking up residency in the chancellor ’ s private quarters in the kanzleramt when she is - presumably - sworn in as germany 's first female leader on november 22 . most people would be glad to live so close to work , especially in a heaving metropolis where rush-hour traffic at each end of the day can leave one feeling drained and claustrophobic .
but frau merkel seems intent on staying on in her central berlin apartment , despite the benefits of moving closer to her place of work . gerd 's old gym shoes behind decision not to move ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel may shudder at the thought of discovering gerd 's old tracksuit .
could it be that the outgoing tenant , gerhard schröder , had some particularly unpleasant habits while in residence there - like leaving his unwashed soccer kit lying around or making an impressive ' beer wall ' out of empty bottles ? " i go to work everyday from my apartment in berlin mitte .
i have done so everyday and will continue to do so , " the chancellor-designate told german news agency dpa while avoiding any reference to any unusual smells in the flat more common of a student squat than the home of a world leader . indeed , potential lingering evidence of past tenants aside , angie has a point .

the cultural event also has a business angle , as nuremberg companies are shouldering half the costs . bringing the " ring " to a chinese stage for the first time ever , 240 artists and stage workers made the trip .
premiering with " rheingold " on oct .
23 , the bavarian guests " set off an earthquake in viewers ' hearts , " according the beiji n g times newspaper .
" siegfried " followed on oct .
26 .
" die walküre " is scheduled for saturday and " götterdämmerung " will conclude the circle on tuesday . staging the operas cost about one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- , but the chinese only had to pay for half .
companies operating in the nuremberg region agreed to take care of the rest - clearly not without resulting economic benefits in mind . the guest performance opens an economic door to china for us , " said hans-peter schmidt , who heads the supervisory board of nürnberger insurance group and organized the search for sponsors .
he added that nuremberg 's future depends on business ties with asia - ties that sponsors will be able to strengthen when talking to guests in the entry hall of beijing 's poly theater . admiri n g all thi n gs germa n ic german culture has long proven to be an excellent way to polish the country 's already positive image in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer just interested in german cars " the chinese no longer just know german cars , soccer and punctuality , " said jari grosse-ruyken , who heads the society for chinese studies in bonn .
" it 's always also been recognized as a country of philosophers , thinkers and musicians . " members of china 's growing middle class are familiar with names such as goethe , schiller and wagner , grosse-ruyken said , adding that it does n't surprise him that tickets for the performances have long been sold out since many chinese people have an uncritical admiration for all things " germanic . " wagner 's hero epos " falls on fertile ground in china , " he said . cultural gifts from germa n y but even those who have n't heard of siegfried , freia and wotan before have been drawn to the german guest performance , which has gotten a lot of attention from the chinese media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg 's rhinegold production in beijing " chinese audiences are open to new things , " said ulrich novak , director of the goethe institute in beijing .
" but they love major highlights and smaller events sometimes suffer because of this . " while calling the ring performances a " courageous and interesting " project , novak said that his institute preferred to develop events in cooperation with chinese partners rather than " presenting gifts . " but he also said that an interest in culture from the business sector was a good thing in principle . bridges for busi n ess grosse-ruyken went a step further , calling the marriage of business and culture a " future-oriented " strategy in china .
he said that german companies had so far mainly focussed on economic exchanges while chinese people were more and more interested in cultural ones . the importance of cultural exchanges for economic cooperation can hardly be exaggerated , said katja hellkötter , who worked in the german industry 's bureau in shanghai for seven years before moving to munich to work on sino-german cultural cooperation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interest in german culture is growing among chinese " culture and business can not be separated , " she said , adding that increasing the visibility of german culture in china also increased the attractiveness of germany as a business location for chinese companies . " cultural factors and an appreciation of a foreign culture play a role in deciding about investments , " she said .
as a result , schiller , goethe and wagner can serve as " bridges for sino-german relations . " nuremberg 's cultural sponsors seem to think the same : they 're going to co-finance the state theater 's performance of mozart 's " don giovanni " in hong kong next year . mareike aden -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de urging germany to speak up on human rights us-based international civil rights organization human rights watch has urged any new german government to become more active in raising human rights issues in russia and china in particular .

" but orators bowing out of politics , like schröder , tend to give speeches of a different color . " as you are no doubt aware , this was n't a summit where any groundbreaking decisions were made , " he told reporters after the meeting of the 25 european heads of state ended outside of london thursday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of blair 's plans met with schröder 's disapproval schröder let loose with a sharp string of criticism for the anglo-saxon social model , saying it should " certainly not " be used as an example for the rest of the eu and stressing that europe needs to hold to its social roots . " we should not accept social dumping or the undermining of environmental standards in the name of services liberalization , " he said , addressing the other 24 heads of state at the informal meeting .
" people in europe are ready for change , and reform , but they need this with social change . " globalization , budget quarrels continue the eu leaders had hoped to hash out a response to globalization and how to maintain european prosperity without jeopardizing citizens ' security amid growing competition from asian countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso propsed the fund idea another of the agenda 's items , a multi-billion euro eu fund to soften the blow of globalization on european workers , also met with the still-chancellor 's criticism .
schröder said he was " more than skeptical " of the plan - that is supported by british prime minister blair - and that germany could not afford to send any additional money to brussels for the fund or other projects . germany 's chancellor-designate , angela merkel , has also voiced her opposition to the fund over the past week and stated germany would not be sending a bigger check to the eu under her leadership . disagreements on how to finance europe 's 2007-2013 budget could not be overcome at the meeting as discord in the agricultural and service market sectors continued , the heads of state , however , adding pressure to find a consensus the next time the council meets in december . merkel will be welcome european table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will take over for schöder at the next round of talks as europe anticipates new leadership in germany , britain 's guardian newspaper reported that blair may have set the meeting for a time when he thought merkel - who is expected to be more favorable to some of his to proposals - would have already taken over for schröder . french president jacques chirac also said he is confident relations with germany will not change .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : death and dying in germany end-of-life care neglected in germany filling the final days with laughter when life becomes worse than death choosing physician-assisted death germany -pipe- 28.10.2005 germans too quiet about suicide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people considering suicide want to be taken seriously more than 11,000 germans take their own lives annually , though more people are deciding to seek help .
but for the majority , suicide still remains a subject they would rather not talk about . while some 6,600 germans died in automobile accidents in 2003 - the last year for which official figures have been compiled - 11,150 took their own lives in the same year , according to germany 's federal statistics office . " when you realize that more people commit suicide than die in traffic accidents and then look at the attention given to automobile accidents , it is clear that suicide is still a taboo subject and not taken as seriously as it should be , " said elmar etzersdorfer of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at stuttgart 's furtbach hospital . the number of suicides yearly has remained fairly constant in recent years , after dropping steadily in the 1980s and 1990s , according to georg fiedler of the therapy center for suicidal persons -lrb- tzs -rrb- in hamburg and secretary of the national suicide prevention initiative . the initiative works to raise awareness and break taboos by providing positive examples of people who have successfully sought and received help . " help used to be centered on large state hospitals where it was hard for many people to get to , " fiedler said of the changes that account for more people seeking help before it 's too late .
" now people have more options closer to home in the normal health system . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : death and dying in germany end-of-life care neglected in germany filling the final days with laughter when life becomes worse than death choosing physician-assisted death germany -pipe- 28.10.2005 germans too quiet about suicide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people considering suicide want to be taken seriously more than 11,000 germans take their own lives annually , though more people are deciding to seek help .
but for the majority , suicide still remains a subject they would rather not talk about . while some 6,600 germans died in automobile accidents in 2003 - the last year for which official figures have been compiled - 11,150 took their own lives in the same year , according to germany 's federal statistics office . " when you realize that more people commit suicide than die in traffic accidents and then look at the attention given to automobile accidents , it is clear that suicide is still a taboo subject and not taken as seriously as it should be , " said elmar etzersdorfer of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at stuttgart 's furtbach hospital . the number of suicides yearly has remained fairly constant in recent years , after dropping steadily in the 1980s and 1990s , according to georg fiedler of the therapy center for suicidal persons -lrb- tzs -rrb- in hamburg and secretary of the national suicide prevention initiative . the initiative works to raise awareness and break taboos by providing positive examples of people who have successfully sought and received help . " help used to be centered on large state hospitals where it was hard for many people to get to , " fiedler said of the changes that account for more people seeking help before it 's too late .
" now people have more options closer to home in the normal health system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : help can now be found outside of clinics since people considering taking their own lives nearly always suffer from feelings of guilt and shame , an increase in outpatient therapy means more of them can choose to get help without the stigma of checking into a clinic , fiedler added . suicide can affect anyone there 's no definition of the " typical " suicidal person ; it is a problem that can neither be attributed solely to social or economic conditions nor localized by geographic region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people considering suicide often remove themselves from society " a person 's social situation is one of many factors in suicide , " etzersdorfer said .
" you ca n't say that the unemployed are generally at a higher risk - though that could be one of many factors that play a role - or that cities or rural areas are worse off . " men die more often than women however , there are some demographic conclusions that can be made about who is at risk . statistics show german men are nearly three times more likely to die from suicide , while twice as many women attempt to take their own lives .
women also tend to use techniques , such as drug overdoses , that leave a window for rescue by medical personnel , while men choose methods with a smaller chance of getting outside help , such as hanging and jumping from tall buildings . " women seem to come in earlier when they are experiencing a crisis , " said angela hofmeister of the berlin crisis service , which has nine centers dotted around the german capital .
" men make up about one-third of the visitors to our crisis centers , and by the time they come , the situation is usually already very serious . " the feelings of shame , guilt and helplessness make it especially hard for men to look for help due to entrenched gender roles telling them not to show weakness , fiedler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors often feel suicide is their only option older people also at risk the elderly are another group with an especially high rate of death by suicide , and as the german population continues aging , there is also a likelihood that the number of suicides will increase , fiedler said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.10.2005 preparing for the pandemic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a car is disinfected in croatia after the outbreak of the bird flu more and more governments are preparing for the possibility of a worldwide bird flu pandemic .
given the spread of the virus and the struggle to contain it , fears of a deadly outbreak in the human population are growing . werner lange knows what it 's like when a wave of influenza causes the public apparatus to break down .
the former director of the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , the central institution and coordination center for the federal ministry for health and social security , remembers what happened in the winter of 1969 when , as a virologist in berlin , lange witnessed the second wave of the so-called hong kong influenza outbreak which killed about one million people worldwide . " the hospitals announced that they were forced to stop providing care because a large number of the staff was out ill and there were no beds available , " said lange . many of the dead could n't be buried and some of the corpses had to be stored in an unused subway tunnel .
with many in the coal industry hit by the outbreak , the police stepped in to take over deliveries of the fuel and even transport systems could only function limitedly . risk of infection still low in a bid to avoid a repeat of such widespread chaos , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has been urging governments for years to keep their pandemic emergency plans up-to-date . " in the last two months in particular , countries have begun to do more and more , " said maria chang , spokesperson for the who .
the reason for this is the looming threat of a global avian influenza pandemic . at the moment , the threat to humans remains minimal .
the spread of avian flu from birds to humans remains rare with only those who have intensive , unprotected contact with infected birds being most in danger .
until now , there have been only about 120 confirmed cases of people who have contracted bird flu .
however , half of those have died from the virus . the major concern of the experts is that this figure could explode if the deadly h5n1 strain of the bird virus connects with the human virus , making infection between people highly likely . different plans , same essentials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pandemic emergency plans are in operation all over the world .
some 20 countries have pandemic emergency plans in place . they include most of the european countries as well as the governments of brazil , canada , hong kong , south africa , japan and the us . " the plans differ in each instance , it depends on national circumstances , " said who spokesperson chang .
" if australia wants to close its borders , this is of course easier than in countries which have borders with other lands . " despite national differences , the core elements of the plans are said to have a similar structure . the competence of the emergency services and authorities are checked as are their response procedures in the case of an outbreak ; areas of the population to be vaccinated first with anti-vial drugs are identified , guidelines are laid out to deal with the supervision and control of the infection and public information , travel restrictions and quarantine rules are prepared . german pandemic plan in place , doubts remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health centers around germany have implemented their plans .
for instance in germany , the rki implemented a national pandemic emergency plan in january compiled by a group of 20 experts who drew upon recommendations issued by the who . but , implementation of the plan remains difficult to monitor because a large chunk of it is the responsiblity of the 16 german federal states and the 430 health authorities distributed around the country , said susanne glasmacher , spokeswoman for the rki . " the decision by the federal government to provide 20 million euros for the development of a prototype vaccine was very important , " said glasmacher , adding that it would speed up the development of an effective serum in case of a flu outbreak . in addition , the federal states had decided to stock up on antiviral drugs .
but the stockpile would only last for 10 percent of the population , while the emergency plan recommends securing drugs for 20 percent , glasmacher pointed out . " but one should n't play it down - many countries have n't stockpiled any drugs at all , " she added . international cooperation critically important while the readiness to prepare for a pandemic has increased , what is essential is a significant rise in international cooperation , said maria cheng of the who .
many of the countries in which bird flu has struck do not have the resources to combat the virus and a more concerted global effort would help , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts fear the h5n1 strain may connect with common human flu .
the main challenges are to find ways of identifying the illness early enough , preventing its spread and to create a drug that can combat the h5n1 virus strain .
" if we were able to identify a new strain early enough , we could maybe prevent the spread of the virus , " said cheng . for this reason , the who has hoarded three million boxes of antiviral drugs .
if a strain that was transmitted between humans did arise in a country , the who would then send specialist teams within the shortest possible time there to contain the virus . " according to models , this would happen in areas where there were 20 to 40 cases of infection reported , ” said cheng .
“ nevertheless , this has yet to be applied in practice . " keeping a cool head the best advice at the moment seems to be for everyone to remain level-headed , said susanne glasmacher of the rki . there seems little doubt that there will be a pandemic as the aggressive increase in bird flu cases indicates .
however , the risk of developing the illness is still very low . " if you want to be infected , you must travel to a humid biotope in a chinese nature reserve and pull out the feathers of the birds you find there , " glasmacher said . dennis stute -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chronology : spread of bird flu to europe on wednesday , british lab results confirmed that the bird flu strain found in croatia was the h5n1 type that killed more than 60 people in asia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.10.2005 hot property is turn-off for settled angie großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : great views of berlin but apparently not enough room to swing a cat most people would be glad to have a shorter journey to work but not angela merkel .
the chancellor-designate is unwilling to leave her home of seven years and move into the quarters soon to be vacated by gerhard schröder . one would imagine that there is a berlin estate agent sitting somewhere in the german capital scratching his or her head incredulously at this moment .
berlin is a popular city and there is no shortage of people wanting to live in its impressive and relatively cheap accommodation . but news that willy-brandt-strasse 1 - one of the most desirable addresses in the city - may remain empty when it is vacated in a few weeks has left many property experts perplexed . the eighth floor apartment has a wonderful view of the bundestag parliament building , is in spitting distance of some of berlin 's most stunning and historic architectural sites and has some of the tightest security in the country . and yet , angela merkel has no intention of taking up residency in the chancellor ’ s private quarters in the kanzleramt when she is - presumably - sworn in as germany 's first female leader on november 22 . most people would be glad to live so close to work , especially in a heaving metropolis where rush-hour traffic at each end of the day can leave one feeling drained and claustrophobic .
but frau merkel seems intent on staying on in her central berlin apartment , despite the benefits of moving closer to her place of work . gerd 's old gym shoes behind decision not to move ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel may shudder at the thought of discovering gerd 's old tracksuit .
could it be that the outgoing tenant , gerhard schröder , had some particularly unpleasant habits while in residence there - like leaving his unwashed soccer kit lying around or making an impressive ' beer wall ' out of empty bottles ? " i go to work everyday from my apartment in berlin mitte .
i have done so everyday and will continue to do so , " the chancellor-designate told german news agency dpa while avoiding any reference to any unusual smells in the flat more common of a student squat than the home of a world leader . indeed , potential lingering evidence of past tenants aside , angie has a point .
from her current abode near the city 's museum island , merkel easily gets to work in the morning by foot in less than half an hour while taking a pleasant route along the river spree . chancellor 's quarters hardly a palace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's first dog may have even found the apartment a bit cramped .
on top of that , rumor has it that the chancellor 's apartment is not big enough to swing a cat - or in schröder 's case , a border terrier - and that the small rooms are barely separated from working areas in the kanzleramt office block .
even schröder himself mostly lived there alone and went home to hanover whenever possible to be with his family . the married 51-year-old merkel , therefore , sees no reason to up and move herself and husband joachim sauer from their home of seven years . angie 's current home to undergo security upgrade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she wo n't be waving goodbye to her house but certainly to some freedom .
however , her elevation to the top job in german politics does mean that her home life will change even if her address does not .
living in close proximity to the museum island - one of the city 's biggest tourist attractions - the soon-to-be chancellor will have to get used to increased security around her house . a small price to pay , it could be said , when the alternative would be perhaps discovering gerd 's tennis socks down the back of the sofa during a flat warming party . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bidding farewell to berlin 's squatters police this week evicted squatters of a famous tenement in berlin .

" " we know of no kick-back payments initiated or tolerated by siemens to seal contracts related to the oil-for food programme , " a siemens spokesman said .
" the committee has not been able to provide any evidence of the alleged kickback payments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : death and dying in germany end-of-life care neglected in germany filling the final days with laughter when life becomes worse than death choosing physician-assisted death germany -pipe- 28.10.2005 germans too quiet about suicide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people considering suicide want to be taken seriously more than 11,000 germans take their own lives annually , though more people are deciding to seek help .
but for the majority , suicide still remains a subject they would rather not talk about . while some 6,600 germans died in automobile accidents in 2003 - the last year for which official figures have been compiled - 11,150 took their own lives in the same year , according to germany 's federal statistics office . " when you realize that more people commit suicide than die in traffic accidents and then look at the attention given to automobile accidents , it is clear that suicide is still a taboo subject and not taken as seriously as it should be , " said elmar etzersdorfer of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at stuttgart 's furtbach hospital . the number of suicides yearly has remained fairly constant in recent years , after dropping steadily in the 1980s and 1990s , according to georg fiedler of the therapy center for suicidal persons -lrb- tzs -rrb- in hamburg and secretary of the national suicide prevention initiative . the initiative works to raise awareness and break taboos by providing positive examples of people who have successfully sought and received help . " help used to be centered on large state hospitals where it was hard for many people to get to , " fiedler said of the changes that account for more people seeking help before it 's too late .
" now people have more options closer to home in the normal health system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : help can now be found outside of clinics since people considering taking their own lives nearly always suffer from feelings of guilt and shame , an increase in outpatient therapy means more of them can choose to get help without the stigma of checking into a clinic , fiedler added . suicide can affect anyone there 's no definition of the " typical " suicidal person ; it is a problem that can neither be attributed solely to social or economic conditions nor localized by geographic region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people considering suicide often remove themselves from society " a person 's social situation is one of many factors in suicide , " etzersdorfer said .
" you ca n't say that the unemployed are generally at a higher risk - though that could be one of many factors that play a role - or that cities or rural areas are worse off . " men die more often than women however , there are some demographic conclusions that can be made about who is at risk . statistics show german men are nearly three times more likely to die from suicide , while twice as many women attempt to take their own lives .
women also tend to use techniques , such as drug overdoses , that leave a window for rescue by medical personnel , while men choose methods with a smaller chance of getting outside help , such as hanging and jumping from tall buildings .

but for the majority , suicide still remains a subject they would rather not talk about . while some 6,600 germans died in automobile accidents in 2003 - the last year for which official figures have been compiled - 11,150 took their own lives in the same year , according to germany 's federal statistics office . " when you realize that more people commit suicide than die in traffic accidents and then look at the attention given to automobile accidents , it is clear that suicide is still a taboo subject and not taken as seriously as it should be , " said elmar etzersdorfer of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at stuttgart 's furtbach hospital . the number of suicides yearly has remained fairly constant in recent years , after dropping steadily in the 1980s and 1990s , according to georg fiedler of the therapy center for suicidal persons -lrb- tzs -rrb- in hamburg and secretary of the national suicide prevention initiative . the initiative works to raise awareness and break taboos by providing positive examples of people who have successfully sought and received help . " help used to be centered on large state hospitals where it was hard for many people to get to , " fiedler said of the changes that account for more people seeking help before it 's too late .
" now people have more options closer to home in the normal health system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : help can now be found outside of clinics since people considering taking their own lives nearly always suffer from feelings of guilt and shame , an increase in outpatient therapy means more of them can choose to get help without the stigma of checking into a clinic , fiedler added . suicide can affect anyone there 's no definition of the " typical " suicidal person ; it is a problem that can neither be attributed solely to social or economic conditions nor localized by geographic region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people considering suicide often remove themselves from society " a person 's social situation is one of many factors in suicide , " etzersdorfer said .
" you ca n't say that the unemployed are generally at a higher risk - though that could be one of many factors that play a role - or that cities or rural areas are worse off . " men die more often than women however , there are some demographic conclusions that can be made about who is at risk . statistics show german men are nearly three times more likely to die from suicide , while twice as many women attempt to take their own lives .
women also tend to use techniques , such as drug overdoses , that leave a window for rescue by medical personnel , while men choose methods with a smaller chance of getting outside help , such as hanging and jumping from tall buildings .

but for the majority , suicide still remains a subject they would rather not talk about . while some 6,600 germans died in automobile accidents in 2003 - the last year for which official figures have been compiled - 11,150 took their own lives in the same year , according to germany 's federal statistics office . " when you realize that more people commit suicide than die in traffic accidents and then look at the attention given to automobile accidents , it is clear that suicide is still a taboo subject and not taken as seriously as it should be , " said elmar etzersdorfer of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at stuttgart 's furtbach hospital . the number of suicides yearly has remained fairly constant in recent years , after dropping steadily in the 1980s and 1990s , according to georg fiedler of the therapy center for suicidal persons -lrb- tzs -rrb- in hamburg and secretary of the national suicide prevention initiative . the initiative works to raise awareness and break taboos by providing positive examples of people who have successfully sought and received help . " help used to be centered on large state hospitals where it was hard for many people to get to , " fiedler said of the changes that account for more people seeking help before it 's too late .
" now people have more options closer to home in the normal health system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : help can now be found outside of clinics since people considering taking their own lives nearly always suffer from feelings of guilt and shame , an increase in outpatient therapy means more of them can choose to get help without the stigma of checking into a clinic , fiedler added . suicide can affect anyone there 's no definition of the " typical " suicidal person ; it is a problem that can neither be attributed solely to social or economic conditions nor localized by geographic region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people considering suicide often remove themselves from society " a person 's social situation is one of many factors in suicide , " etzersdorfer said .
" you ca n't say that the unemployed are generally at a higher risk - though that could be one of many factors that play a role - or that cities or rural areas are worse off . " men die more often than women however , there are some demographic conclusions that can be made about who is at risk . statistics show german men are nearly three times more likely to die from suicide , while twice as many women attempt to take their own lives .
women also tend to use techniques , such as drug overdoses , that leave a window for rescue by medical personnel , while men choose methods with a smaller chance of getting outside help , such as hanging and jumping from tall buildings . " women seem to come in earlier when they are experiencing a crisis , " said angela hofmeister of the berlin crisis service , which has nine centers dotted around the german capital .
" men make up about one-third of the visitors to our crisis centers , and by the time they come , the situation is usually already very serious . " the feelings of shame , guilt and helplessness make it especially hard for men to look for help due to entrenched gender roles telling them not to show weakness , fiedler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors often feel suicide is their only option older people also at risk the elderly are another group with an especially high rate of death by suicide , and as the german population continues aging , there is also a likelihood that the number of suicides will increase , fiedler said . " many older people considering suicide are afraid of what will happen to them , " etzersdorfer said .
" they do n't want to die in a hospital , they want to be able to die in dignity and are not aware of options other than taking their own lives . " most of these people , when they receive proper care , decide not to commit suicide , " he added . but it 's not just the elderly that need to be made more sensitive to suicide and suicide prevention treatments .
fiedler said that awareness of suicide 's warning signals plays too small a role in the education of those most often confronted with suicidal people : medical personnel , psychologists , police , social workers , and teachers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people prefer to seek help anonymously talking about suicide does n't cause it often friends and family are afraid of mentioning the topic to someone who may be in danger for fear that it could be enough for the person to take their own life . but studies show people considering suicide often want to talk about their problems and concerns .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.10.2005 preparing for the pandemic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a car is disinfected in croatia after the outbreak of the bird flu more and more governments are preparing for the possibility of a worldwide bird flu pandemic .
given the spread of the virus and the struggle to contain it , fears of a deadly outbreak in the human population are growing . werner lange knows what it 's like when a wave of influenza causes the public apparatus to break down .
the former director of the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , the central institution and coordination center for the federal ministry for health and social security , remembers what happened in the winter of 1969 when , as a virologist in berlin , lange witnessed the second wave of the so-called hong kong influenza outbreak which killed about one million people worldwide . " the hospitals announced that they were forced to stop providing care because a large number of the staff was out ill and there were no beds available , " said lange . many of the dead could n't be buried and some of the corpses had to be stored in an unused subway tunnel .
with many in the coal industry hit by the outbreak , the police stepped in to take over deliveries of the fuel and even transport systems could only function limitedly . risk of infection still low in a bid to avoid a repeat of such widespread chaos , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has been urging governments for years to keep their pandemic emergency plans up-to-date . " in the last two months in particular , countries have begun to do more and more , " said maria chang , spokesperson for the who .
the reason for this is the looming threat of a global avian influenza pandemic . at the moment , the threat to humans remains minimal .
the spread of avian flu from birds to humans remains rare with only those who have intensive , unprotected contact with infected birds being most in danger .
until now , there have been only about 120 confirmed cases of people who have contracted bird flu .
however , half of those have died from the virus . the major concern of the experts is that this figure could explode if the deadly h5n1 strain of the bird virus connects with the human virus , making infection between people highly likely . different plans , same essentials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pandemic emergency plans are in operation all over the world .
some 20 countries have pandemic emergency plans in place . they include most of the european countries as well as the governments of brazil , canada , hong kong , south africa , japan and the us . " the plans differ in each instance , it depends on national circumstances , " said who spokesperson chang .
" if australia wants to close its borders , this is of course easier than in countries which have borders with other lands . " despite national differences , the core elements of the plans are said to have a similar structure . the competence of the emergency services and authorities are checked as are their response procedures in the case of an outbreak ; areas of the population to be vaccinated first with anti-vial drugs are identified , guidelines are laid out to deal with the supervision and control of the infection and public information , travel restrictions and quarantine rules are prepared . german pandemic plan in place , doubts remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health centers around germany have implemented their plans .
for instance in germany , the rki implemented a national pandemic emergency plan in january compiled by a group of 20 experts who drew upon recommendations issued by the who . but , implementation of the plan remains difficult to monitor because a large chunk of it is the responsiblity of the 16 german federal states and the 430 health authorities distributed around the country , said susanne glasmacher , spokeswoman for the rki . " the decision by the federal government to provide 20 million euros for the development of a prototype vaccine was very important , " said glasmacher , adding that it would speed up the development of an effective serum in case of a flu outbreak . in addition , the federal states had decided to stock up on antiviral drugs .
but the stockpile would only last for 10 percent of the population , while the emergency plan recommends securing drugs for 20 percent , glasmacher pointed out . " but one should n't play it down - many countries have n't stockpiled any drugs at all , " she added . international cooperation critically important while the readiness to prepare for a pandemic has increased , what is essential is a significant rise in international cooperation , said maria cheng of the who .
many of the countries in which bird flu has struck do not have the resources to combat the virus and a more concerted global effort would help , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts fear the h5n1 strain may connect with common human flu .
the main challenges are to find ways of identifying the illness early enough , preventing its spread and to create a drug that can combat the h5n1 virus strain .
" if we were able to identify a new strain early enough , we could maybe prevent the spread of the virus , " said cheng . for this reason , the who has hoarded three million boxes of antiviral drugs .
if a strain that was transmitted between humans did arise in a country , the who would then send specialist teams within the shortest possible time there to contain the virus . " according to models , this would happen in areas where there were 20 to 40 cases of infection reported , ” said cheng .
“ nevertheless , this has yet to be applied in practice . " keeping a cool head the best advice at the moment seems to be for everyone to remain level-headed , said susanne glasmacher of the rki . there seems little doubt that there will be a pandemic as the aggressive increase in bird flu cases indicates .
however , the risk of developing the illness is still very low . " if you want to be infected , you must travel to a humid biotope in a chinese nature reserve and pull out the feathers of the birds you find there , " glasmacher said . dennis stute -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chronology : spread of bird flu to europe on wednesday , british lab results confirmed that the bird flu strain found in croatia was the h5n1 type that killed more than 60 people in asia .

given the spread of the virus and the struggle to contain it , fears of a deadly outbreak in the human population are growing . werner lange knows what it 's like when a wave of influenza causes the public apparatus to break down .
the former director of the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , the central institution and coordination center for the federal ministry for health and social security , remembers what happened in the winter of 1969 when , as a virologist in berlin , lange witnessed the second wave of the so-called hong kong influenza outbreak which killed about one million people worldwide . " the hospitals announced that they were forced to stop providing care because a large number of the staff was out ill and there were no beds available , " said lange . many of the dead could n't be buried and some of the corpses had to be stored in an unused subway tunnel .
with many in the coal industry hit by the outbreak , the police stepped in to take over deliveries of the fuel and even transport systems could only function limitedly . risk of infection still low in a bid to avoid a repeat of such widespread chaos , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has been urging governments for years to keep their pandemic emergency plans up-to-date . " in the last two months in particular , countries have begun to do more and more , " said maria chang , spokesperson for the who .
the reason for this is the looming threat of a global avian influenza pandemic . at the moment , the threat to humans remains minimal .
the spread of avian flu from birds to humans remains rare with only those who have intensive , unprotected contact with infected birds being most in danger .
until now , there have been only about 120 confirmed cases of people who have contracted bird flu .
however , half of those have died from the virus . the major concern of the experts is that this figure could explode if the deadly h5n1 strain of the bird virus connects with the human virus , making infection between people highly likely . different plans , same essentials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pandemic emergency plans are in operation all over the world .
some 20 countries have pandemic emergency plans in place . they include most of the european countries as well as the governments of brazil , canada , hong kong , south africa , japan and the us . " the plans differ in each instance , it depends on national circumstances , " said who spokesperson chang .
" if australia wants to close its borders , this is of course easier than in countries which have borders with other lands . " despite national differences , the core elements of the plans are said to have a similar structure . the competence of the emergency services and authorities are checked as are their response procedures in the case of an outbreak ; areas of the population to be vaccinated first with anti-vial drugs are identified , guidelines are laid out to deal with the supervision and control of the infection and public information , travel restrictions and quarantine rules are prepared . german pandemic plan in place , doubts remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health centers around germany have implemented their plans .
for instance in germany , the rki implemented a national pandemic emergency plan in january compiled by a group of 20 experts who drew upon recommendations issued by the who . but , implementation of the plan remains difficult to monitor because a large chunk of it is the responsiblity of the 16 german federal states and the 430 health authorities distributed around the country , said susanne glasmacher , spokeswoman for the rki . " the decision by the federal government to provide 20 million euros for the development of a prototype vaccine was very important , " said glasmacher , adding that it would speed up the development of an effective serum in case of a flu outbreak . in addition , the federal states had decided to stock up on antiviral drugs .
but the stockpile would only last for 10 percent of the population , while the emergency plan recommends securing drugs for 20 percent , glasmacher pointed out . " but one should n't play it down - many countries have n't stockpiled any drugs at all , " she added . international cooperation critically important while the readiness to prepare for a pandemic has increased , what is essential is a significant rise in international cooperation , said maria cheng of the who .
many of the countries in which bird flu has struck do not have the resources to combat the virus and a more concerted global effort would help , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts fear the h5n1 strain may connect with common human flu .
the main challenges are to find ways of identifying the illness early enough , preventing its spread and to create a drug that can combat the h5n1 virus strain .
" if we were able to identify a new strain early enough , we could maybe prevent the spread of the virus , " said cheng . for this reason , the who has hoarded three million boxes of antiviral drugs .
if a strain that was transmitted between humans did arise in a country , the who would then send specialist teams within the shortest possible time there to contain the virus . " according to models , this would happen in areas where there were 20 to 40 cases of infection reported , ” said cheng .
“ nevertheless , this has yet to be applied in practice . " keeping a cool head the best advice at the moment seems to be for everyone to remain level-headed , said susanne glasmacher of the rki . there seems little doubt that there will be a pandemic as the aggressive increase in bird flu cases indicates .
however , the risk of developing the illness is still very low . " if you want to be infected , you must travel to a humid biotope in a chinese nature reserve and pull out the feathers of the birds you find there , " glasmacher said . dennis stute -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chronology : spread of bird flu to europe on wednesday , british lab results confirmed that the bird flu strain found in croatia was the h5n1 type that killed more than 60 people in asia .

given the spread of the virus and the struggle to contain it , fears of a deadly outbreak in the human population are growing . werner lange knows what it 's like when a wave of influenza causes the public apparatus to break down .
the former director of the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , the central institution and coordination center for the federal ministry for health and social security , remembers what happened in the winter of 1969 when , as a virologist in berlin , lange witnessed the second wave of the so-called hong kong influenza outbreak which killed about one million people worldwide . " the hospitals announced that they were forced to stop providing care because a large number of the staff was out ill and there were no beds available , " said lange . many of the dead could n't be buried and some of the corpses had to be stored in an unused subway tunnel .
with many in the coal industry hit by the outbreak , the police stepped in to take over deliveries of the fuel and even transport systems could only function limitedly . risk of infection still low in a bid to avoid a repeat of such widespread chaos , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has been urging governments for years to keep their pandemic emergency plans up-to-date . " in the last two months in particular , countries have begun to do more and more , " said maria chang , spokesperson for the who .
the reason for this is the looming threat of a global avian influenza pandemic . at the moment , the threat to humans remains minimal .
the spread of avian flu from birds to humans remains rare with only those who have intensive , unprotected contact with infected birds being most in danger .
until now , there have been only about 120 confirmed cases of people who have contracted bird flu .
however , half of those have died from the virus . the major concern of the experts is that this figure could explode if the deadly h5n1 strain of the bird virus connects with the human virus , making infection between people highly likely . different plans , same essentials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pandemic emergency plans are in operation all over the world .
some 20 countries have pandemic emergency plans in place . they include most of the european countries as well as the governments of brazil , canada , hong kong , south africa , japan and the us . " the plans differ in each instance , it depends on national circumstances , " said who spokesperson chang .
" if australia wants to close its borders , this is of course easier than in countries which have borders with other lands . " despite national differences , the core elements of the plans are said to have a similar structure . the competence of the emergency services and authorities are checked as are their response procedures in the case of an outbreak ; areas of the population to be vaccinated first with anti-vial drugs are identified , guidelines are laid out to deal with the supervision and control of the infection and public information , travel restrictions and quarantine rules are prepared . german pandemic plan in place , doubts remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health centers around germany have implemented their plans .
for instance in germany , the rki implemented a national pandemic emergency plan in january compiled by a group of 20 experts who drew upon recommendations issued by the who . but , implementation of the plan remains difficult to monitor because a large chunk of it is the responsiblity of the 16 german federal states and the 430 health authorities distributed around the country , said susanne glasmacher , spokeswoman for the rki . " the decision by the federal government to provide 20 million euros for the development of a prototype vaccine was very important , " said glasmacher , adding that it would speed up the development of an effective serum in case of a flu outbreak . in addition , the federal states had decided to stock up on antiviral drugs .
but the stockpile would only last for 10 percent of the population , while the emergency plan recommends securing drugs for 20 percent , glasmacher pointed out . " but one should n't play it down - many countries have n't stockpiled any drugs at all , " she added . international cooperation critically important while the readiness to prepare for a pandemic has increased , what is essential is a significant rise in international cooperation , said maria cheng of the who .
many of the countries in which bird flu has struck do not have the resources to combat the virus and a more concerted global effort would help , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts fear the h5n1 strain may connect with common human flu .
the main challenges are to find ways of identifying the illness early enough , preventing its spread and to create a drug that can combat the h5n1 virus strain .
" if we were able to identify a new strain early enough , we could maybe prevent the spread of the virus , " said cheng . for this reason , the who has hoarded three million boxes of antiviral drugs .
if a strain that was transmitted between humans did arise in a country , the who would then send specialist teams within the shortest possible time there to contain the virus . " according to models , this would happen in areas where there were 20 to 40 cases of infection reported , ” said cheng .
“ nevertheless , this has yet to be applied in practice . " keeping a cool head the best advice at the moment seems to be for everyone to remain level-headed , said susanne glasmacher of the rki . there seems little doubt that there will be a pandemic as the aggressive increase in bird flu cases indicates .
however , the risk of developing the illness is still very low .

" but orators bowing out of politics , like schröder , tend to give speeches of a different color . " as you are no doubt aware , this was n't a summit where any groundbreaking decisions were made , " he told reporters after the meeting of the 25 european heads of state ended outside of london thursday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of blair 's plans met with schröder 's disapproval schröder let loose with a sharp string of criticism for the anglo-saxon social model , saying it should " certainly not " be used as an example for the rest of the eu and stressing that europe needs to hold to its social roots . " we should not accept social dumping or the undermining of environmental standards in the name of services liberalization , " he said , addressing the other 24 heads of state at the informal meeting .
" people in europe are ready for change , and reform , but they need this with social change . " globalization , budget quarrels continue the eu leaders had hoped to hash out a response to globalization and how to maintain european prosperity without jeopardizing citizens ' security amid growing competition from asian countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso propsed the fund idea another of the agenda 's items , a multi-billion euro eu fund to soften the blow of globalization on european workers , also met with the still-chancellor 's criticism .
schröder said he was " more than skeptical " of the plan - that is supported by british prime minister blair - and that germany could not afford to send any additional money to brussels for the fund or other projects . germany 's chancellor-designate , angela merkel , has also voiced her opposition to the fund over the past week and stated germany would not be sending a bigger check to the eu under her leadership . disagreements on how to finance europe 's 2007-2013 budget could not be overcome at the meeting as discord in the agricultural and service market sectors continued , the heads of state , however , adding pressure to find a consensus the next time the council meets in december . merkel will be welcome european table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will take over for schöder at the next round of talks as europe anticipates new leadership in germany , britain 's guardian newspaper reported that blair may have set the meeting for a time when he thought merkel - who is expected to be more favorable to some of his to proposals - would have already taken over for schröder . french president jacques chirac also said he is confident relations with germany will not change .
chirac predicted merkel would further strengthen the bond between the two nations regarding the thorny topic of agriculture . " there will be absolutely no change , none at all , " said chirac , who enjoyed a close working friendship with schröder .

" but orators bowing out of politics , like schröder , tend to give speeches of a different color . " as you are no doubt aware , this was n't a summit where any groundbreaking decisions were made , " he told reporters after the meeting of the 25 european heads of state ended outside of london thursday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of blair 's plans met with schröder 's disapproval schröder let loose with a sharp string of criticism for the anglo-saxon social model , saying it should " certainly not " be used as an example for the rest of the eu and stressing that europe needs to hold to its social roots . " we should not accept social dumping or the undermining of environmental standards in the name of services liberalization , " he said , addressing the other 24 heads of state at the informal meeting .
" people in europe are ready for change , and reform , but they need this with social change . " globalization , budget quarrels continue the eu leaders had hoped to hash out a response to globalization and how to maintain european prosperity without jeopardizing citizens ' security amid growing competition from asian countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso propsed the fund idea another of the agenda 's items , a multi-billion euro eu fund to soften the blow of globalization on european workers , also met with the still-chancellor 's criticism .
schröder said he was " more than skeptical " of the plan - that is supported by british prime minister blair - and that germany could not afford to send any additional money to brussels for the fund or other projects . germany 's chancellor-designate , angela merkel , has also voiced her opposition to the fund over the past week and stated germany would not be sending a bigger check to the eu under her leadership . disagreements on how to finance europe 's 2007-2013 budget could not be overcome at the meeting as discord in the agricultural and service market sectors continued , the heads of state , however , adding pressure to find a consensus the next time the council meets in december . merkel will be welcome european table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will take over for schöder at the next round of talks as europe anticipates new leadership in germany , britain 's guardian newspaper reported that blair may have set the meeting for a time when he thought merkel - who is expected to be more favorable to some of his to proposals - would have already taken over for schröder . french president jacques chirac also said he is confident relations with germany will not change .
chirac predicted merkel would further strengthen the bond between the two nations regarding the thorny topic of agriculture . " there will be absolutely no change , none at all , " said chirac , who enjoyed a close working friendship with schröder .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.10.2005 wooing china with german culture großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guarding german culture in china the nuremberg state theater is currently performing richard wagner 's " ring des nibelungen " in beijing .
the cultural event also has a business angle , as nuremberg companies are shouldering half the costs . bringing the " ring " to a chinese stage for the first time ever , 240 artists and stage workers made the trip .
premiering with " rheingold " on oct .
23 , the bavarian guests " set off an earthquake in viewers ' hearts , " according the beiji n g times newspaper .
" siegfried " followed on oct .
26 .
" die walküre " is scheduled for saturday and " götterdämmerung " will conclude the circle on tuesday . staging the operas cost about one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- , but the chinese only had to pay for half .
companies operating in the nuremberg region agreed to take care of the rest - clearly not without resulting economic benefits in mind . the guest performance opens an economic door to china for us , " said hans-peter schmidt , who heads the supervisory board of nürnberger insurance group and organized the search for sponsors .
he added that nuremberg 's future depends on business ties with asia - ties that sponsors will be able to strengthen when talking to guests in the entry hall of beijing 's poly theater . admiri n g all thi n gs germa n ic german culture has long proven to be an excellent way to polish the country 's already positive image in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer just interested in german cars " the chinese no longer just know german cars , soccer and punctuality , " said jari grosse-ruyken , who heads the society for chinese studies in bonn .
" it 's always also been recognized as a country of philosophers , thinkers and musicians . " members of china 's growing middle class are familiar with names such as goethe , schiller and wagner , grosse-ruyken said , adding that it does n't surprise him that tickets for the performances have long been sold out since many chinese people have an uncritical admiration for all things " germanic . " wagner 's hero epos " falls on fertile ground in china , " he said . cultural gifts from germa n y but even those who have n't heard of siegfried , freia and wotan before have been drawn to the german guest performance , which has gotten a lot of attention from the chinese media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg 's rhinegold production in beijing " chinese audiences are open to new things , " said ulrich novak , director of the goethe institute in beijing .
" but they love major highlights and smaller events sometimes suffer because of this . " while calling the ring performances a " courageous and interesting " project , novak said that his institute preferred to develop events in cooperation with chinese partners rather than " presenting gifts . " but he also said that an interest in culture from the business sector was a good thing in principle . bridges for busi n ess grosse-ruyken went a step further , calling the marriage of business and culture a " future-oriented " strategy in china .
he said that german companies had so far mainly focussed on economic exchanges while chinese people were more and more interested in cultural ones . the importance of cultural exchanges for economic cooperation can hardly be exaggerated , said katja hellkötter , who worked in the german industry 's bureau in shanghai for seven years before moving to munich to work on sino-german cultural cooperation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interest in german culture is growing among chinese " culture and business can not be separated , " she said , adding that increasing the visibility of german culture in china also increased the attractiveness of germany as a business location for chinese companies . " cultural factors and an appreciation of a foreign culture play a role in deciding about investments , " she said .
as a result , schiller , goethe and wagner can serve as " bridges for sino-german relations . " nuremberg 's cultural sponsors seem to think the same : they 're going to co-finance the state theater 's performance of mozart 's " don giovanni " in hong kong next year . mareike aden -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de urging germany to speak up on human rights us-based international civil rights organization human rights watch has urged any new german government to become more active in raising human rights issues in russia and china in particular .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.10.2005 preparing for the pandemic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a car is disinfected in croatia after the outbreak of the bird flu more and more governments are preparing for the possibility of a worldwide bird flu pandemic .
given the spread of the virus and the struggle to contain it , fears of a deadly outbreak in the human population are growing . werner lange knows what it 's like when a wave of influenza causes the public apparatus to break down .
the former director of the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , the central institution and coordination center for the federal ministry for health and social security , remembers what happened in the winter of 1969 when , as a virologist in berlin , lange witnessed the second wave of the so-called hong kong influenza outbreak which killed about one million people worldwide . " the hospitals announced that they were forced to stop providing care because a large number of the staff was out ill and there were no beds available , " said lange . many of the dead could n't be buried and some of the corpses had to be stored in an unused subway tunnel .
with many in the coal industry hit by the outbreak , the police stepped in to take over deliveries of the fuel and even transport systems could only function limitedly . risk of infection still low in a bid to avoid a repeat of such widespread chaos , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has been urging governments for years to keep their pandemic emergency plans up-to-date . " in the last two months in particular , countries have begun to do more and more , " said maria chang , spokesperson for the who .
the reason for this is the looming threat of a global avian influenza pandemic . at the moment , the threat to humans remains minimal .
the spread of avian flu from birds to humans remains rare with only those who have intensive , unprotected contact with infected birds being most in danger .
until now , there have been only about 120 confirmed cases of people who have contracted bird flu .
however , half of those have died from the virus . the major concern of the experts is that this figure could explode if the deadly h5n1 strain of the bird virus connects with the human virus , making infection between people highly likely . different plans , same essentials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pandemic emergency plans are in operation all over the world .
some 20 countries have pandemic emergency plans in place . they include most of the european countries as well as the governments of brazil , canada , hong kong , south africa , japan and the us . " the plans differ in each instance , it depends on national circumstances , " said who spokesperson chang .
" if australia wants to close its borders , this is of course easier than in countries which have borders with other lands . " despite national differences , the core elements of the plans are said to have a similar structure . the competence of the emergency services and authorities are checked as are their response procedures in the case of an outbreak ; areas of the population to be vaccinated first with anti-vial drugs are identified , guidelines are laid out to deal with the supervision and control of the infection and public information , travel restrictions and quarantine rules are prepared . german pandemic plan in place , doubts remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health centers around germany have implemented their plans .
for instance in germany , the rki implemented a national pandemic emergency plan in january compiled by a group of 20 experts who drew upon recommendations issued by the who . but , implementation of the plan remains difficult to monitor because a large chunk of it is the responsiblity of the 16 german federal states and the 430 health authorities distributed around the country , said susanne glasmacher , spokeswoman for the rki . " the decision by the federal government to provide 20 million euros for the development of a prototype vaccine was very important , " said glasmacher , adding that it would speed up the development of an effective serum in case of a flu outbreak . in addition , the federal states had decided to stock up on antiviral drugs .
but the stockpile would only last for 10 percent of the population , while the emergency plan recommends securing drugs for 20 percent , glasmacher pointed out . " but one should n't play it down - many countries have n't stockpiled any drugs at all , " she added . international cooperation critically important while the readiness to prepare for a pandemic has increased , what is essential is a significant rise in international cooperation , said maria cheng of the who .
many of the countries in which bird flu has struck do not have the resources to combat the virus and a more concerted global effort would help , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts fear the h5n1 strain may connect with common human flu .
the main challenges are to find ways of identifying the illness early enough , preventing its spread and to create a drug that can combat the h5n1 virus strain .
" if we were able to identify a new strain early enough , we could maybe prevent the spread of the virus , " said cheng . for this reason , the who has hoarded three million boxes of antiviral drugs .
if a strain that was transmitted between humans did arise in a country , the who would then send specialist teams within the shortest possible time there to contain the virus . " according to models , this would happen in areas where there were 20 to 40 cases of infection reported , ” said cheng .
“ nevertheless , this has yet to be applied in practice . " keeping a cool head the best advice at the moment seems to be for everyone to remain level-headed , said susanne glasmacher of the rki . there seems little doubt that there will be a pandemic as the aggressive increase in bird flu cases indicates .
however , the risk of developing the illness is still very low . " if you want to be infected , you must travel to a humid biotope in a chinese nature reserve and pull out the feathers of the birds you find there , " glasmacher said . dennis stute -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chronology : spread of bird flu to europe on wednesday , british lab results confirmed that the bird flu strain found in croatia was the h5n1 type that killed more than 60 people in asia .

the cultural event also has a business angle , as nuremberg companies are shouldering half the costs . bringing the " ring " to a chinese stage for the first time ever , 240 artists and stage workers made the trip .
premiering with " rheingold " on oct .
23 , the bavarian guests " set off an earthquake in viewers ' hearts , " according the beiji n g times newspaper .
" siegfried " followed on oct .
26 .
" die walküre " is scheduled for saturday and " götterdämmerung " will conclude the circle on tuesday . staging the operas cost about one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- , but the chinese only had to pay for half .
companies operating in the nuremberg region agreed to take care of the rest - clearly not without resulting economic benefits in mind . the guest performance opens an economic door to china for us , " said hans-peter schmidt , who heads the supervisory board of nürnberger insurance group and organized the search for sponsors .
he added that nuremberg 's future depends on business ties with asia - ties that sponsors will be able to strengthen when talking to guests in the entry hall of beijing 's poly theater . admiri n g all thi n gs germa n ic german culture has long proven to be an excellent way to polish the country 's already positive image in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer just interested in german cars " the chinese no longer just know german cars , soccer and punctuality , " said jari grosse-ruyken , who heads the society for chinese studies in bonn .
" it 's always also been recognized as a country of philosophers , thinkers and musicians . " members of china 's growing middle class are familiar with names such as goethe , schiller and wagner , grosse-ruyken said , adding that it does n't surprise him that tickets for the performances have long been sold out since many chinese people have an uncritical admiration for all things " germanic . " wagner 's hero epos " falls on fertile ground in china , " he said . cultural gifts from germa n y but even those who have n't heard of siegfried , freia and wotan before have been drawn to the german guest performance , which has gotten a lot of attention from the chinese media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg 's rhinegold production in beijing " chinese audiences are open to new things , " said ulrich novak , director of the goethe institute in beijing .
" but they love major highlights and smaller events sometimes suffer because of this . " while calling the ring performances a " courageous and interesting " project , novak said that his institute preferred to develop events in cooperation with chinese partners rather than " presenting gifts . " but he also said that an interest in culture from the business sector was a good thing in principle . bridges for busi n ess grosse-ruyken went a step further , calling the marriage of business and culture a " future-oriented " strategy in china .
he said that german companies had so far mainly focussed on economic exchanges while chinese people were more and more interested in cultural ones . the importance of cultural exchanges for economic cooperation can hardly be exaggerated , said katja hellkötter , who worked in the german industry 's bureau in shanghai for seven years before moving to munich to work on sino-german cultural cooperation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interest in german culture is growing among chinese " culture and business can not be separated , " she said , adding that increasing the visibility of german culture in china also increased the attractiveness of germany as a business location for chinese companies . " cultural factors and an appreciation of a foreign culture play a role in deciding about investments , " she said .
as a result , schiller , goethe and wagner can serve as " bridges for sino-german relations . " nuremberg 's cultural sponsors seem to think the same : they 're going to co-finance the state theater 's performance of mozart 's " don giovanni " in hong kong next year . mareike aden -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de urging germany to speak up on human rights us-based international civil rights organization human rights watch has urged any new german government to become more active in raising human rights issues in russia and china in particular .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.10.2005 preparing for the pandemic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a car is disinfected in croatia after the outbreak of the bird flu more and more governments are preparing for the possibility of a worldwide bird flu pandemic .
given the spread of the virus and the struggle to contain it , fears of a deadly outbreak in the human population are growing . werner lange knows what it 's like when a wave of influenza causes the public apparatus to break down .
the former director of the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , the central institution and coordination center for the federal ministry for health and social security , remembers what happened in the winter of 1969 when , as a virologist in berlin , lange witnessed the second wave of the so-called hong kong influenza outbreak which killed about one million people worldwide . " the hospitals announced that they were forced to stop providing care because a large number of the staff was out ill and there were no beds available , " said lange . many of the dead could n't be buried and some of the corpses had to be stored in an unused subway tunnel .
with many in the coal industry hit by the outbreak , the police stepped in to take over deliveries of the fuel and even transport systems could only function limitedly . risk of infection still low in a bid to avoid a repeat of such widespread chaos , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has been urging governments for years to keep their pandemic emergency plans up-to-date . " in the last two months in particular , countries have begun to do more and more , " said maria chang , spokesperson for the who .
the reason for this is the looming threat of a global avian influenza pandemic . at the moment , the threat to humans remains minimal .
the spread of avian flu from birds to humans remains rare with only those who have intensive , unprotected contact with infected birds being most in danger .
until now , there have been only about 120 confirmed cases of people who have contracted bird flu .
however , half of those have died from the virus . the major concern of the experts is that this figure could explode if the deadly h5n1 strain of the bird virus connects with the human virus , making infection between people highly likely . different plans , same essentials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pandemic emergency plans are in operation all over the world .
some 20 countries have pandemic emergency plans in place . they include most of the european countries as well as the governments of brazil , canada , hong kong , south africa , japan and the us . " the plans differ in each instance , it depends on national circumstances , " said who spokesperson chang .
" if australia wants to close its borders , this is of course easier than in countries which have borders with other lands . " despite national differences , the core elements of the plans are said to have a similar structure . the competence of the emergency services and authorities are checked as are their response procedures in the case of an outbreak ; areas of the population to be vaccinated first with anti-vial drugs are identified , guidelines are laid out to deal with the supervision and control of the infection and public information , travel restrictions and quarantine rules are prepared . german pandemic plan in place , doubts remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health centers around germany have implemented their plans .
for instance in germany , the rki implemented a national pandemic emergency plan in january compiled by a group of 20 experts who drew upon recommendations issued by the who . but , implementation of the plan remains difficult to monitor because a large chunk of it is the responsiblity of the 16 german federal states and the 430 health authorities distributed around the country , said susanne glasmacher , spokeswoman for the rki . " the decision by the federal government to provide 20 million euros for the development of a prototype vaccine was very important , " said glasmacher , adding that it would speed up the development of an effective serum in case of a flu outbreak . in addition , the federal states had decided to stock up on antiviral drugs .
but the stockpile would only last for 10 percent of the population , while the emergency plan recommends securing drugs for 20 percent , glasmacher pointed out . " but one should n't play it down - many countries have n't stockpiled any drugs at all , " she added . international cooperation critically important while the readiness to prepare for a pandemic has increased , what is essential is a significant rise in international cooperation , said maria cheng of the who .
many of the countries in which bird flu has struck do not have the resources to combat the virus and a more concerted global effort would help , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts fear the h5n1 strain may connect with common human flu .
the main challenges are to find ways of identifying the illness early enough , preventing its spread and to create a drug that can combat the h5n1 virus strain .
" if we were able to identify a new strain early enough , we could maybe prevent the spread of the virus , " said cheng . for this reason , the who has hoarded three million boxes of antiviral drugs .
if a strain that was transmitted between humans did arise in a country , the who would then send specialist teams within the shortest possible time there to contain the virus . " according to models , this would happen in areas where there were 20 to 40 cases of infection reported , ” said cheng .
“ nevertheless , this has yet to be applied in practice . " keeping a cool head the best advice at the moment seems to be for everyone to remain level-headed , said susanne glasmacher of the rki . there seems little doubt that there will be a pandemic as the aggressive increase in bird flu cases indicates .
however , the risk of developing the illness is still very low . " if you want to be infected , you must travel to a humid biotope in a chinese nature reserve and pull out the feathers of the birds you find there , " glasmacher said . dennis stute -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chronology : spread of bird flu to europe on wednesday , british lab results confirmed that the bird flu strain found in croatia was the h5n1 type that killed more than 60 people in asia .

" but orators bowing out of politics , like schröder , tend to give speeches of a different color . " as you are no doubt aware , this was n't a summit where any groundbreaking decisions were made , " he told reporters after the meeting of the 25 european heads of state ended outside of london thursday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of blair 's plans met with schröder 's disapproval schröder let loose with a sharp string of criticism for the anglo-saxon social model , saying it should " certainly not " be used as an example for the rest of the eu and stressing that europe needs to hold to its social roots . " we should not accept social dumping or the undermining of environmental standards in the name of services liberalization , " he said , addressing the other 24 heads of state at the informal meeting .
" people in europe are ready for change , and reform , but they need this with social change . " globalization , budget quarrels continue the eu leaders had hoped to hash out a response to globalization and how to maintain european prosperity without jeopardizing citizens ' security amid growing competition from asian countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso propsed the fund idea another of the agenda 's items , a multi-billion euro eu fund to soften the blow of globalization on european workers , also met with the still-chancellor 's criticism .
schröder said he was " more than skeptical " of the plan - that is supported by british prime minister blair - and that germany could not afford to send any additional money to brussels for the fund or other projects . germany 's chancellor-designate , angela merkel , has also voiced her opposition to the fund over the past week and stated germany would not be sending a bigger check to the eu under her leadership . disagreements on how to finance europe 's 2007-2013 budget could not be overcome at the meeting as discord in the agricultural and service market sectors continued , the heads of state , however , adding pressure to find a consensus the next time the council meets in december . merkel will be welcome european table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will take over for schöder at the next round of talks as europe anticipates new leadership in germany , britain 's guardian newspaper reported that blair may have set the meeting for a time when he thought merkel - who is expected to be more favorable to some of his to proposals - would have already taken over for schröder . french president jacques chirac also said he is confident relations with germany will not change .
chirac predicted merkel would further strengthen the bond between the two nations regarding the thorny topic of agriculture . " there will be absolutely no change , none at all , " said chirac , who enjoyed a close working friendship with schröder .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : death and dying in germany end-of-life care neglected in germany filling the final days with laughter when life becomes worse than death choosing physician-assisted death germany -pipe- 28.10.2005 germans too quiet about suicide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people considering suicide want to be taken seriously more than 11,000 germans take their own lives annually , though more people are deciding to seek help .
but for the majority , suicide still remains a subject they would rather not talk about . while some 6,600 germans died in automobile accidents in 2003 - the last year for which official figures have been compiled - 11,150 took their own lives in the same year , according to germany 's federal statistics office . " when you realize that more people commit suicide than die in traffic accidents and then look at the attention given to automobile accidents , it is clear that suicide is still a taboo subject and not taken as seriously as it should be , " said elmar etzersdorfer of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at stuttgart 's furtbach hospital . the number of suicides yearly has remained fairly constant in recent years , after dropping steadily in the 1980s and 1990s , according to georg fiedler of the therapy center for suicidal persons -lrb- tzs -rrb- in hamburg and secretary of the national suicide prevention initiative . the initiative works to raise awareness and break taboos by providing positive examples of people who have successfully sought and received help . " help used to be centered on large state hospitals where it was hard for many people to get to , " fiedler said of the changes that account for more people seeking help before it 's too late .
" now people have more options closer to home in the normal health system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : help can now be found outside of clinics since people considering taking their own lives nearly always suffer from feelings of guilt and shame , an increase in outpatient therapy means more of them can choose to get help without the stigma of checking into a clinic , fiedler added . suicide can affect anyone there 's no definition of the " typical " suicidal person ; it is a problem that can neither be attributed solely to social or economic conditions nor localized by geographic region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people considering suicide often remove themselves from society " a person 's social situation is one of many factors in suicide , " etzersdorfer said .
" you ca n't say that the unemployed are generally at a higher risk - though that could be one of many factors that play a role - or that cities or rural areas are worse off . " men die more often than women however , there are some demographic conclusions that can be made about who is at risk . statistics show german men are nearly three times more likely to die from suicide , while twice as many women attempt to take their own lives .
women also tend to use techniques , such as drug overdoses , that leave a window for rescue by medical personnel , while men choose methods with a smaller chance of getting outside help , such as hanging and jumping from tall buildings . " women seem to come in earlier when they are experiencing a crisis , " said angela hofmeister of the berlin crisis service , which has nine centers dotted around the german capital .
" men make up about one-third of the visitors to our crisis centers , and by the time they come , the situation is usually already very serious . " the feelings of shame , guilt and helplessness make it especially hard for men to look for help due to entrenched gender roles telling them not to show weakness , fiedler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors often feel suicide is their only option older people also at risk the elderly are another group with an especially high rate of death by suicide , and as the german population continues aging , there is also a likelihood that the number of suicides will increase , fiedler said .

but for the majority , suicide still remains a subject they would rather not talk about . while some 6,600 germans died in automobile accidents in 2003 - the last year for which official figures have been compiled - 11,150 took their own lives in the same year , according to germany 's federal statistics office . " when you realize that more people commit suicide than die in traffic accidents and then look at the attention given to automobile accidents , it is clear that suicide is still a taboo subject and not taken as seriously as it should be , " said elmar etzersdorfer of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at stuttgart 's furtbach hospital . the number of suicides yearly has remained fairly constant in recent years , after dropping steadily in the 1980s and 1990s , according to georg fiedler of the therapy center for suicidal persons -lrb- tzs -rrb- in hamburg and secretary of the national suicide prevention initiative . the initiative works to raise awareness and break taboos by providing positive examples of people who have successfully sought and received help .

" you ca n't say that the unemployed are generally at a higher risk - though that could be one of many factors that play a role - or that cities or rural areas are worse off . " men die more often than women however , there are some demographic conclusions that can be made about who is at risk . statistics show german men are nearly three times more likely to die from suicide , while twice as many women attempt to take their own lives .
women also tend to use techniques , such as drug overdoses , that leave a window for rescue by medical personnel , while men choose methods with a smaller chance of getting outside help , such as hanging and jumping from tall buildings . " women seem to come in earlier when they are experiencing a crisis , " said angela hofmeister of the berlin crisis service , which has nine centers dotted around the german capital .
" men make up about one-third of the visitors to our crisis centers , and by the time they come , the situation is usually already very serious .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : death and dying in germany end-of-life care neglected in germany filling the final days with laughter when life becomes worse than death choosing physician-assisted death germany -pipe- 28.10.2005 germans too quiet about suicide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people considering suicide want to be taken seriously more than 11,000 germans take their own lives annually , though more people are deciding to seek help .
but for the majority , suicide still remains a subject they would rather not talk about . while some 6,600 germans died in automobile accidents in 2003 - the last year for which official figures have been compiled - 11,150 took their own lives in the same year , according to germany 's federal statistics office . " when you realize that more people commit suicide than die in traffic accidents and then look at the attention given to automobile accidents , it is clear that suicide is still a taboo subject and not taken as seriously as it should be , " said elmar etzersdorfer of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at stuttgart 's furtbach hospital . the number of suicides yearly has remained fairly constant in recent years , after dropping steadily in the 1980s and 1990s , according to georg fiedler of the therapy center for suicidal persons -lrb- tzs -rrb- in hamburg and secretary of the national suicide prevention initiative . the initiative works to raise awareness and break taboos by providing positive examples of people who have successfully sought and received help . " help used to be centered on large state hospitals where it was hard for many people to get to , " fiedler said of the changes that account for more people seeking help before it 's too late .
" now people have more options closer to home in the normal health system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : help can now be found outside of clinics since people considering taking their own lives nearly always suffer from feelings of guilt and shame , an increase in outpatient therapy means more of them can choose to get help without the stigma of checking into a clinic , fiedler added . suicide can affect anyone there 's no definition of the " typical " suicidal person ; it is a problem that can neither be attributed solely to social or economic conditions nor localized by geographic region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people considering suicide often remove themselves from society " a person 's social situation is one of many factors in suicide , " etzersdorfer said .
" you ca n't say that the unemployed are generally at a higher risk - though that could be one of many factors that play a role - or that cities or rural areas are worse off . " men die more often than women however , there are some demographic conclusions that can be made about who is at risk . statistics show german men are nearly three times more likely to die from suicide , while twice as many women attempt to take their own lives .
women also tend to use techniques , such as drug overdoses , that leave a window for rescue by medical personnel , while men choose methods with a smaller chance of getting outside help , such as hanging and jumping from tall buildings . " women seem to come in earlier when they are experiencing a crisis , " said angela hofmeister of the berlin crisis service , which has nine centers dotted around the german capital .
" men make up about one-third of the visitors to our crisis centers , and by the time they come , the situation is usually already very serious . " the feelings of shame , guilt and helplessness make it especially hard for men to look for help due to entrenched gender roles telling them not to show weakness , fiedler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors often feel suicide is their only option older people also at risk the elderly are another group with an especially high rate of death by suicide , and as the german population continues aging , there is also a likelihood that the number of suicides will increase , fiedler said . " many older people considering suicide are afraid of what will happen to them , " etzersdorfer said .
" they do n't want to die in a hospital , they want to be able to die in dignity and are not aware of options other than taking their own lives . " most of these people , when they receive proper care , decide not to commit suicide , " he added . but it 's not just the elderly that need to be made more sensitive to suicide and suicide prevention treatments .
fiedler said that awareness of suicide 's warning signals plays too small a role in the education of those most often confronted with suicidal people : medical personnel , psychologists , police , social workers , and teachers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people prefer to seek help anonymously talking about suicide does n't cause it often friends and family are afraid of mentioning the topic to someone who may be in danger for fear that it could be enough for the person to take their own life . but studies show people considering suicide often want to talk about their problems and concerns . " people want to see that they are being taken seriously , not just hear , ' hey , look how great life is ' , " fiedler said . " it makes sense to talk about it and try and influence the person to seek professional help .

" but orators bowing out of politics , like schröder , tend to give speeches of a different color . " as you are no doubt aware , this was n't a summit where any groundbreaking decisions were made , " he told reporters after the meeting of the 25 european heads of state ended outside of london thursday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of blair 's plans met with schröder 's disapproval schröder let loose with a sharp string of criticism for the anglo-saxon social model , saying it should " certainly not " be used as an example for the rest of the eu and stressing that europe needs to hold to its social roots . " we should not accept social dumping or the undermining of environmental standards in the name of services liberalization , " he said , addressing the other 24 heads of state at the informal meeting .
" people in europe are ready for change , and reform , but they need this with social change . " globalization , budget quarrels continue the eu leaders had hoped to hash out a response to globalization and how to maintain european prosperity without jeopardizing citizens ' security amid growing competition from asian countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commission president jose manuel barroso propsed the fund idea another of the agenda 's items , a multi-billion euro eu fund to soften the blow of globalization on european workers , also met with the still-chancellor 's criticism .
schröder said he was " more than skeptical " of the plan - that is supported by british prime minister blair - and that germany could not afford to send any additional money to brussels for the fund or other projects . germany 's chancellor-designate , angela merkel , has also voiced her opposition to the fund over the past week and stated germany would not be sending a bigger check to the eu under her leadership . disagreements on how to finance europe 's 2007-2013 budget could not be overcome at the meeting as discord in the agricultural and service market sectors continued , the heads of state , however , adding pressure to find a consensus the next time the council meets in december . merkel will be welcome european table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will take over for schöder at the next round of talks as europe anticipates new leadership in germany , britain 's guardian newspaper reported that blair may have set the meeting for a time when he thought merkel - who is expected to be more favorable to some of his to proposals - would have already taken over for schröder . french president jacques chirac also said he is confident relations with germany will not change .
chirac predicted merkel would further strengthen the bond between the two nations regarding the thorny topic of agriculture . " there will be absolutely no change , none at all , " said chirac , who enjoyed a close working friendship with schröder .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : death and dying in germany end-of-life care neglected in germany filling the final days with laughter when life becomes worse than death choosing physician-assisted death germany -pipe- 28.10.2005 germans too quiet about suicide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people considering suicide want to be taken seriously more than 11,000 germans take their own lives annually , though more people are deciding to seek help .
but for the majority , suicide still remains a subject they would rather not talk about . while some 6,600 germans died in automobile accidents in 2003 - the last year for which official figures have been compiled - 11,150 took their own lives in the same year , according to germany 's federal statistics office . " when you realize that more people commit suicide than die in traffic accidents and then look at the attention given to automobile accidents , it is clear that suicide is still a taboo subject and not taken as seriously as it should be , " said elmar etzersdorfer of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at stuttgart 's furtbach hospital . the number of suicides yearly has remained fairly constant in recent years , after dropping steadily in the 1980s and 1990s , according to georg fiedler of the therapy center for suicidal persons -lrb- tzs -rrb- in hamburg and secretary of the national suicide prevention initiative . the initiative works to raise awareness and break taboos by providing positive examples of people who have successfully sought and received help . " help used to be centered on large state hospitals where it was hard for many people to get to , " fiedler said of the changes that account for more people seeking help before it 's too late .
" now people have more options closer to home in the normal health system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : help can now be found outside of clinics since people considering taking their own lives nearly always suffer from feelings of guilt and shame , an increase in outpatient therapy means more of them can choose to get help without the stigma of checking into a clinic , fiedler added . suicide can affect anyone there 's no definition of the " typical " suicidal person ; it is a problem that can neither be attributed solely to social or economic conditions nor localized by geographic region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people considering suicide often remove themselves from society " a person 's social situation is one of many factors in suicide , " etzersdorfer said .
" you ca n't say that the unemployed are generally at a higher risk - though that could be one of many factors that play a role - or that cities or rural areas are worse off . " men die more often than women however , there are some demographic conclusions that can be made about who is at risk . statistics show german men are nearly three times more likely to die from suicide , while twice as many women attempt to take their own lives .
women also tend to use techniques , such as drug overdoses , that leave a window for rescue by medical personnel , while men choose methods with a smaller chance of getting outside help , such as hanging and jumping from tall buildings . " women seem to come in earlier when they are experiencing a crisis , " said angela hofmeister of the berlin crisis service , which has nine centers dotted around the german capital .
" men make up about one-third of the visitors to our crisis centers , and by the time they come , the situation is usually already very serious . " the feelings of shame , guilt and helplessness make it especially hard for men to look for help due to entrenched gender roles telling them not to show weakness , fiedler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors often feel suicide is their only option older people also at risk the elderly are another group with an especially high rate of death by suicide , and as the german population continues aging , there is also a likelihood that the number of suicides will increase , fiedler said . " many older people considering suicide are afraid of what will happen to them , " etzersdorfer said .
" they do n't want to die in a hospital , they want to be able to die in dignity and are not aware of options other than taking their own lives . " most of these people , when they receive proper care , decide not to commit suicide , " he added . but it 's not just the elderly that need to be made more sensitive to suicide and suicide prevention treatments .
fiedler said that awareness of suicide 's warning signals plays too small a role in the education of those most often confronted with suicidal people : medical personnel , psychologists , police , social workers , and teachers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people prefer to seek help anonymously talking about suicide does n't cause it often friends and family are afraid of mentioning the topic to someone who may be in danger for fear that it could be enough for the person to take their own life . but studies show people considering suicide often want to talk about their problems and concerns . " people want to see that they are being taken seriously , not just hear , ' hey , look how great life is ' , " fiedler said . " it makes sense to talk about it and try and influence the person to seek professional help .

" but orators bowing out of politics , like schröder , tend to give speeches of a different color . " as you are no doubt aware , this was n't a summit where any groundbreaking decisions were made , " he told reporters after the meeting of the 25 european heads of state ended outside of london thursday night . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of blair 's plans met with schröder 's disapproval schröder let loose with a sharp string of criticism for the anglo-saxon social model , saying it should " certainly not " be used as an example for the rest of the eu and stressing that europe needs to hold to its social roots . " we should not accept social dumping or the undermining of environmental standards in the name of services liberalization , " he said , addressing the other 24 heads of state at the informal meeting .
" people in europe are ready for change , and reform , but they need this with social change .

schröder said he was " more than skeptical " of the plan - that is supported by british prime minister blair - and that germany could not afford to send any additional money to brussels for the fund or other projects . germany 's chancellor-designate , angela merkel , has also voiced her opposition to the fund over the past week and stated germany would not be sending a bigger check to the eu under her leadership . disagreements on how to finance europe 's 2007-2013 budget could not be overcome at the meeting as discord in the agricultural and service market sectors continued , the heads of state , however , adding pressure to find a consensus the next time the council meets in december . merkel will be welcome european table bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel will take over for schöder at the next round of talks as europe anticipates new leadership in germany , britain 's guardian newspaper reported that blair may have set the meeting for a time when he thought merkel - who is expected to be more favorable to some of his to proposals - would have already taken over for schröder . french president jacques chirac also said he is confident relations with germany will not change .
chirac predicted merkel would further strengthen the bond between the two nations regarding the thorny topic of agriculture . " there will be absolutely no change , none at all , " said chirac , who enjoyed a close working friendship with schröder .

he said that german companies had so far mainly focussed on economic exchanges while chinese people were more and more interested in cultural ones . the importance of cultural exchanges for economic cooperation can hardly be exaggerated , said katja hellkötter , who worked in the german industry 's bureau in shanghai for seven years before moving to munich to work on sino-german cultural cooperation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interest in german culture is growing among chinese " culture and business can not be separated , " she said , adding that increasing the visibility of german culture in china also increased the attractiveness of germany as a business location for chinese companies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.10.2005 hot property is turn-off for settled angie großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : great views of berlin but apparently not enough room to swing a cat most people would be glad to have a shorter journey to work but not angela merkel .
the chancellor-designate is unwilling to leave her home of seven years and move into the quarters soon to be vacated by gerhard schröder . one would imagine that there is a berlin estate agent sitting somewhere in the german capital scratching his or her head incredulously at this moment .
berlin is a popular city and there is no shortage of people wanting to live in its impressive and relatively cheap accommodation . but news that willy-brandt-strasse 1 - one of the most desirable addresses in the city - may remain empty when it is vacated in a few weeks has left many property experts perplexed . the eighth floor apartment has a wonderful view of the bundestag parliament building , is in spitting distance of some of berlin 's most stunning and historic architectural sites and has some of the tightest security in the country . and yet , angela merkel has no intention of taking up residency in the chancellor ’ s private quarters in the kanzleramt when she is - presumably - sworn in as germany 's first female leader on november 22 . most people would be glad to live so close to work , especially in a heaving metropolis where rush-hour traffic at each end of the day can leave one feeling drained and claustrophobic .
but frau merkel seems intent on staying on in her central berlin apartment , despite the benefits of moving closer to her place of work . gerd 's old gym shoes behind decision not to move ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel may shudder at the thought of discovering gerd 's old tracksuit .
could it be that the outgoing tenant , gerhard schröder , had some particularly unpleasant habits while in residence there - like leaving his unwashed soccer kit lying around or making an impressive ' beer wall ' out of empty bottles ? " i go to work everyday from my apartment in berlin mitte .

the chancellor-designate is unwilling to leave her home of seven years and move into the quarters soon to be vacated by gerhard schröder . one would imagine that there is a berlin estate agent sitting somewhere in the german capital scratching his or her head incredulously at this moment .
berlin is a popular city and there is no shortage of people wanting to live in its impressive and relatively cheap accommodation . but news that willy-brandt-strasse 1 - one of the most desirable addresses in the city - may remain empty when it is vacated in a few weeks has left many property experts perplexed . the eighth floor apartment has a wonderful view of the bundestag parliament building , is in spitting distance of some of berlin 's most stunning and historic architectural sites and has some of the tightest security in the country . and yet , angela merkel has no intention of taking up residency in the chancellor ’ s private quarters in the kanzleramt when she is - presumably - sworn in as germany 's first female leader on november 22 . most people would be glad to live so close to work , especially in a heaving metropolis where rush-hour traffic at each end of the day can leave one feeling drained and claustrophobic .
but frau merkel seems intent on staying on in her central berlin apartment , despite the benefits of moving closer to her place of work . gerd 's old gym shoes behind decision not to move ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel may shudder at the thought of discovering gerd 's old tracksuit .
could it be that the outgoing tenant , gerhard schröder , had some particularly unpleasant habits while in residence there - like leaving his unwashed soccer kit lying around or making an impressive ' beer wall ' out of empty bottles ? " i go to work everyday from my apartment in berlin mitte .
i have done so everyday and will continue to do so , " the chancellor-designate told german news agency dpa while avoiding any reference to any unusual smells in the flat more common of a student squat than the home of a world leader . indeed , potential lingering evidence of past tenants aside , angie has a point .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : death and dying in germany end-of-life care neglected in germany filling the final days with laughter when life becomes worse than death choosing physician-assisted death germany -pipe- 28.10.2005 germans too quiet about suicide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people considering suicide want to be taken seriously more than 11,000 germans take their own lives annually , though more people are deciding to seek help .
but for the majority , suicide still remains a subject they would rather not talk about . while some 6,600 germans died in automobile accidents in 2003 - the last year for which official figures have been compiled - 11,150 took their own lives in the same year , according to germany 's federal statistics office . " when you realize that more people commit suicide than die in traffic accidents and then look at the attention given to automobile accidents , it is clear that suicide is still a taboo subject and not taken as seriously as it should be , " said elmar etzersdorfer of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at stuttgart 's furtbach hospital . the number of suicides yearly has remained fairly constant in recent years , after dropping steadily in the 1980s and 1990s , according to georg fiedler of the therapy center for suicidal persons -lrb- tzs -rrb- in hamburg and secretary of the national suicide prevention initiative . the initiative works to raise awareness and break taboos by providing positive examples of people who have successfully sought and received help . " help used to be centered on large state hospitals where it was hard for many people to get to , " fiedler said of the changes that account for more people seeking help before it 's too late .
" now people have more options closer to home in the normal health system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : help can now be found outside of clinics since people considering taking their own lives nearly always suffer from feelings of guilt and shame , an increase in outpatient therapy means more of them can choose to get help without the stigma of checking into a clinic , fiedler added . suicide can affect anyone there 's no definition of the " typical " suicidal person ; it is a problem that can neither be attributed solely to social or economic conditions nor localized by geographic region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people considering suicide often remove themselves from society " a person 's social situation is one of many factors in suicide , " etzersdorfer said .
" you ca n't say that the unemployed are generally at a higher risk - though that could be one of many factors that play a role - or that cities or rural areas are worse off . " men die more often than women however , there are some demographic conclusions that can be made about who is at risk . statistics show german men are nearly three times more likely to die from suicide , while twice as many women attempt to take their own lives .
women also tend to use techniques , such as drug overdoses , that leave a window for rescue by medical personnel , while men choose methods with a smaller chance of getting outside help , such as hanging and jumping from tall buildings . " women seem to come in earlier when they are experiencing a crisis , " said angela hofmeister of the berlin crisis service , which has nine centers dotted around the german capital .
" men make up about one-third of the visitors to our crisis centers , and by the time they come , the situation is usually already very serious . " the feelings of shame , guilt and helplessness make it especially hard for men to look for help due to entrenched gender roles telling them not to show weakness , fiedler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors often feel suicide is their only option older people also at risk the elderly are another group with an especially high rate of death by suicide , and as the german population continues aging , there is also a likelihood that the number of suicides will increase , fiedler said . " many older people considering suicide are afraid of what will happen to them , " etzersdorfer said .

but for the majority , suicide still remains a subject they would rather not talk about . while some 6,600 germans died in automobile accidents in 2003 - the last year for which official figures have been compiled - 11,150 took their own lives in the same year , according to germany 's federal statistics office . " when you realize that more people commit suicide than die in traffic accidents and then look at the attention given to automobile accidents , it is clear that suicide is still a taboo subject and not taken as seriously as it should be , " said elmar etzersdorfer of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at stuttgart 's furtbach hospital . the number of suicides yearly has remained fairly constant in recent years , after dropping steadily in the 1980s and 1990s , according to georg fiedler of the therapy center for suicidal persons -lrb- tzs -rrb- in hamburg and secretary of the national suicide prevention initiative . the initiative works to raise awareness and break taboos by providing positive examples of people who have successfully sought and received help . " help used to be centered on large state hospitals where it was hard for many people to get to , " fiedler said of the changes that account for more people seeking help before it 's too late .
" now people have more options closer to home in the normal health system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : help can now be found outside of clinics since people considering taking their own lives nearly always suffer from feelings of guilt and shame , an increase in outpatient therapy means more of them can choose to get help without the stigma of checking into a clinic , fiedler added . suicide can affect anyone there 's no definition of the " typical " suicidal person ; it is a problem that can neither be attributed solely to social or economic conditions nor localized by geographic region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people considering suicide often remove themselves from society " a person 's social situation is one of many factors in suicide , " etzersdorfer said .
" you ca n't say that the unemployed are generally at a higher risk - though that could be one of many factors that play a role - or that cities or rural areas are worse off . " men die more often than women however , there are some demographic conclusions that can be made about who is at risk . statistics show german men are nearly three times more likely to die from suicide , while twice as many women attempt to take their own lives .
women also tend to use techniques , such as drug overdoses , that leave a window for rescue by medical personnel , while men choose methods with a smaller chance of getting outside help , such as hanging and jumping from tall buildings . " women seem to come in earlier when they are experiencing a crisis , " said angela hofmeister of the berlin crisis service , which has nine centers dotted around the german capital .
" men make up about one-third of the visitors to our crisis centers , and by the time they come , the situation is usually already very serious . " the feelings of shame , guilt and helplessness make it especially hard for men to look for help due to entrenched gender roles telling them not to show weakness , fiedler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors often feel suicide is their only option older people also at risk the elderly are another group with an especially high rate of death by suicide , and as the german population continues aging , there is also a likelihood that the number of suicides will increase , fiedler said . " many older people considering suicide are afraid of what will happen to them , " etzersdorfer said .
" they do n't want to die in a hospital , they want to be able to die in dignity and are not aware of options other than taking their own lives . " most of these people , when they receive proper care , decide not to commit suicide , " he added . but it 's not just the elderly that need to be made more sensitive to suicide and suicide prevention treatments .
fiedler said that awareness of suicide 's warning signals plays too small a role in the education of those most often confronted with suicidal people : medical personnel , psychologists , police , social workers , and teachers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people prefer to seek help anonymously talking about suicide does n't cause it often friends and family are afraid of mentioning the topic to someone who may be in danger for fear that it could be enough for the person to take their own life . but studies show people considering suicide often want to talk about their problems and concerns . " people want to see that they are being taken seriously , not just hear , ' hey , look how great life is ' , " fiedler said .

the cultural event also has a business angle , as nuremberg companies are shouldering half the costs . bringing the " ring " to a chinese stage for the first time ever , 240 artists and stage workers made the trip .
premiering with " rheingold " on oct .
23 , the bavarian guests " set off an earthquake in viewers ' hearts , " according the beiji n g times newspaper .
" siegfried " followed on oct .
26 .
" die walküre " is scheduled for saturday and " götterdämmerung " will conclude the circle on tuesday . staging the operas cost about one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- , but the chinese only had to pay for half .
companies operating in the nuremberg region agreed to take care of the rest - clearly not without resulting economic benefits in mind . the guest performance opens an economic door to china for us , " said hans-peter schmidt , who heads the supervisory board of nürnberger insurance group and organized the search for sponsors .
he added that nuremberg 's future depends on business ties with asia - ties that sponsors will be able to strengthen when talking to guests in the entry hall of beijing 's poly theater . admiri n g all thi n gs germa n ic german culture has long proven to be an excellent way to polish the country 's already positive image in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer just interested in german cars " the chinese no longer just know german cars , soccer and punctuality , " said jari grosse-ruyken , who heads the society for chinese studies in bonn .
" it 's always also been recognized as a country of philosophers , thinkers and musicians . " members of china 's growing middle class are familiar with names such as goethe , schiller and wagner , grosse-ruyken said , adding that it does n't surprise him that tickets for the performances have long been sold out since many chinese people have an uncritical admiration for all things " germanic . " wagner 's hero epos " falls on fertile ground in china , " he said . cultural gifts from germa n y but even those who have n't heard of siegfried , freia and wotan before have been drawn to the german guest performance , which has gotten a lot of attention from the chinese media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg 's rhinegold production in beijing " chinese audiences are open to new things , " said ulrich novak , director of the goethe institute in beijing .
" but they love major highlights and smaller events sometimes suffer because of this . " while calling the ring performances a " courageous and interesting " project , novak said that his institute preferred to develop events in cooperation with chinese partners rather than " presenting gifts . " but he also said that an interest in culture from the business sector was a good thing in principle . bridges for busi n ess grosse-ruyken went a step further , calling the marriage of business and culture a " future-oriented " strategy in china .
he said that german companies had so far mainly focussed on economic exchanges while chinese people were more and more interested in cultural ones . the importance of cultural exchanges for economic cooperation can hardly be exaggerated , said katja hellkötter , who worked in the german industry 's bureau in shanghai for seven years before moving to munich to work on sino-german cultural cooperation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interest in german culture is growing among chinese " culture and business can not be separated , " she said , adding that increasing the visibility of german culture in china also increased the attractiveness of germany as a business location for chinese companies . " cultural factors and an appreciation of a foreign culture play a role in deciding about investments , " she said .
as a result , schiller , goethe and wagner can serve as " bridges for sino-german relations . " nuremberg 's cultural sponsors seem to think the same : they 're going to co-finance the state theater 's performance of mozart 's " don giovanni " in hong kong next year . mareike aden -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de urging germany to speak up on human rights us-based international civil rights organization human rights watch has urged any new german government to become more active in raising human rights issues in russia and china in particular .

" " we know of no kick-back payments initiated or tolerated by siemens to seal contracts related to the oil-for food programme , " a siemens spokesman said .
" the committee has not been able to provide any evidence of the alleged kickback payments . " siemens ag , the company flagship , allegedly paid 48,925 euros -lrb- $ 59,434 -rrb- in kickbacks for a contract to provide equipment to the ministry of electricity , according to iraqi government documents submitted for un approval cited by the inquiry . the kickbacks from siemens are also corroborated in records obtained from a bank in jordan , the inquiry said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler is investigating the alleged bribes internally a daimlerchrysler manager is alleged to have paid bribes of $ 7,134 .
there was no evidence that others in the company were aware of the payouts . though un general secretary kofi annan said he hoped the companies listed in the report would be held accountable by local authorities , german prosecutors in stuttgart and munich , where siemens and daimlerchrysler are respectively based , said they did not have enough information to press charges against the companies . saddam manipulated aid program the international inquiry committee , led by former us federal reserve chairman paul volcker , spent 18 months examining what went wrong with the un oil-for-food program that ran from 1996 to 2003 and was meant to provide relief to ordinary iraqis suffering under international sanctions by selling a limited amount of iraqi oil under un supervision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the money was supposed to help ordinary iraqis in need the inquiry committee , however , found that saddam 's regime manipulated the program to extract $ 1.8 billion in surcharges and bribes while an inept un headquarters failed to exert administrative control .
according to the report , 139 companies paid illegal oil surcharges to baghdad and 2,253 firms gave saddam 's regime kickbacks on humanitarian-related goods shipped to iraq . hansjörg elshorst , head of the anti-corruption agency transparency international called the bribes and payments the " biggest scandal in the last decades . " companies may not have known of payments while the committee 's report raised serious questions about the practices of the companies named , volcker stopped short of an explicit condemnation or verdict . " the identification of a particular company in the report does not necessarily mean that that company as opposed to an agent ... made , authorized or even knew about illicit payments , " volcker told reporters in new york . in written responses included in the report , the named corporations said they had no idea such kickbacks were paid out and that such transactions were ever authorized . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un is best seen in humble light on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the un charter , dw 's klaus dahmann comments on the shortcomings - and occasional strengths - of an organization dedicated to world peace .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : death and dying in germany end-of-life care neglected in germany filling the final days with laughter when life becomes worse than death choosing physician-assisted death germany -pipe- 28.10.2005 germans too quiet about suicide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people considering suicide want to be taken seriously more than 11,000 germans take their own lives annually , though more people are deciding to seek help .
but for the majority , suicide still remains a subject they would rather not talk about . while some 6,600 germans died in automobile accidents in 2003 - the last year for which official figures have been compiled - 11,150 took their own lives in the same year , according to germany 's federal statistics office . " when you realize that more people commit suicide than die in traffic accidents and then look at the attention given to automobile accidents , it is clear that suicide is still a taboo subject and not taken as seriously as it should be , " said elmar etzersdorfer of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at stuttgart 's furtbach hospital . the number of suicides yearly has remained fairly constant in recent years , after dropping steadily in the 1980s and 1990s , according to georg fiedler of the therapy center for suicidal persons -lrb- tzs -rrb- in hamburg and secretary of the national suicide prevention initiative . the initiative works to raise awareness and break taboos by providing positive examples of people who have successfully sought and received help . " help used to be centered on large state hospitals where it was hard for many people to get to , " fiedler said of the changes that account for more people seeking help before it 's too late .
" now people have more options closer to home in the normal health system . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : help can now be found outside of clinics since people considering taking their own lives nearly always suffer from feelings of guilt and shame , an increase in outpatient therapy means more of them can choose to get help without the stigma of checking into a clinic , fiedler added . suicide can affect anyone there 's no definition of the " typical " suicidal person ; it is a problem that can neither be attributed solely to social or economic conditions nor localized by geographic region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people considering suicide often remove themselves from society " a person 's social situation is one of many factors in suicide , " etzersdorfer said .
" you ca n't say that the unemployed are generally at a higher risk - though that could be one of many factors that play a role - or that cities or rural areas are worse off . " men die more often than women however , there are some demographic conclusions that can be made about who is at risk . statistics show german men are nearly three times more likely to die from suicide , while twice as many women attempt to take their own lives .
women also tend to use techniques , such as drug overdoses , that leave a window for rescue by medical personnel , while men choose methods with a smaller chance of getting outside help , such as hanging and jumping from tall buildings . " women seem to come in earlier when they are experiencing a crisis , " said angela hofmeister of the berlin crisis service , which has nine centers dotted around the german capital .
" men make up about one-third of the visitors to our crisis centers , and by the time they come , the situation is usually already very serious . " the feelings of shame , guilt and helplessness make it especially hard for men to look for help due to entrenched gender roles telling them not to show weakness , fiedler said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seniors often feel suicide is their only option older people also at risk the elderly are another group with an especially high rate of death by suicide , and as the german population continues aging , there is also a likelihood that the number of suicides will increase , fiedler said . " many older people considering suicide are afraid of what will happen to them , " etzersdorfer said .
" they do n't want to die in a hospital , they want to be able to die in dignity and are not aware of options other than taking their own lives . " most of these people , when they receive proper care , decide not to commit suicide , " he added . but it 's not just the elderly that need to be made more sensitive to suicide and suicide prevention treatments .
fiedler said that awareness of suicide 's warning signals plays too small a role in the education of those most often confronted with suicidal people : medical personnel , psychologists , police , social workers , and teachers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some people prefer to seek help anonymously talking about suicide does n't cause it often friends and family are afraid of mentioning the topic to someone who may be in danger for fear that it could be enough for the person to take their own life . but studies show people considering suicide often want to talk about their problems and concerns . " people want to see that they are being taken seriously , not just hear , ' hey , look how great life is ' , " fiedler said . " it makes sense to talk about it and try and influence the person to seek professional help .

" " we know of no kick-back payments initiated or tolerated by siemens to seal contracts related to the oil-for food programme , " a siemens spokesman said .
" the committee has not been able to provide any evidence of the alleged kickback payments . " siemens ag , the company flagship , allegedly paid 48,925 euros -lrb- $ 59,434 -rrb- in kickbacks for a contract to provide equipment to the ministry of electricity , according to iraqi government documents submitted for un approval cited by the inquiry . the kickbacks from siemens are also corroborated in records obtained from a bank in jordan , the inquiry said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler is investigating the alleged bribes internally a daimlerchrysler manager is alleged to have paid bribes of $ 7,134 .
there was no evidence that others in the company were aware of the payouts . though un general secretary kofi annan said he hoped the companies listed in the report would be held accountable by local authorities , german prosecutors in stuttgart and munich , where siemens and daimlerchrysler are respectively based , said they did not have enough information to press charges against the companies . saddam manipulated aid program the international inquiry committee , led by former us federal reserve chairman paul volcker , spent 18 months examining what went wrong with the un oil-for-food program that ran from 1996 to 2003 and was meant to provide relief to ordinary iraqis suffering under international sanctions by selling a limited amount of iraqi oil under un supervision . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the money was supposed to help ordinary iraqis in need the inquiry committee , however , found that saddam 's regime manipulated the program to extract $ 1.8 billion in surcharges and bribes while an inept un headquarters failed to exert administrative control .
according to the report , 139 companies paid illegal oil surcharges to baghdad and 2,253 firms gave saddam 's regime kickbacks on humanitarian-related goods shipped to iraq . hansjörg elshorst , head of the anti-corruption agency transparency international called the bribes and payments the " biggest scandal in the last decades . " companies may not have known of payments while the committee 's report raised serious questions about the practices of the companies named , volcker stopped short of an explicit condemnation or verdict . " the identification of a particular company in the report does not necessarily mean that that company as opposed to an agent ... made , authorized or even knew about illicit payments , " volcker told reporters in new york . in written responses included in the report , the named corporations said they had no idea such kickbacks were paid out and that such transactions were ever authorized . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un is best seen in humble light on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the un charter , dw 's klaus dahmann comments on the shortcomings - and occasional strengths - of an organization dedicated to world peace .

given the spread of the virus and the struggle to contain it , fears of a deadly outbreak in the human population are growing . werner lange knows what it 's like when a wave of influenza causes the public apparatus to break down .
the former director of the robert koch institute -lrb- rki -rrb- , the central institution and coordination center for the federal ministry for health and social security , remembers what happened in the winter of 1969 when , as a virologist in berlin , lange witnessed the second wave of the so-called hong kong influenza outbreak which killed about one million people worldwide . " the hospitals announced that they were forced to stop providing care because a large number of the staff was out ill and there were no beds available , " said lange . many of the dead could n't be buried and some of the corpses had to be stored in an unused subway tunnel .
with many in the coal industry hit by the outbreak , the police stepped in to take over deliveries of the fuel and even transport systems could only function limitedly . risk of infection still low in a bid to avoid a repeat of such widespread chaos , the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- has been urging governments for years to keep their pandemic emergency plans up-to-date . " in the last two months in particular , countries have begun to do more and more , " said maria chang , spokesperson for the who .
the reason for this is the looming threat of a global avian influenza pandemic . at the moment , the threat to humans remains minimal .
the spread of avian flu from birds to humans remains rare with only those who have intensive , unprotected contact with infected birds being most in danger .
until now , there have been only about 120 confirmed cases of people who have contracted bird flu .
however , half of those have died from the virus . the major concern of the experts is that this figure could explode if the deadly h5n1 strain of the bird virus connects with the human virus , making infection between people highly likely . different plans , same essentials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pandemic emergency plans are in operation all over the world .
some 20 countries have pandemic emergency plans in place . they include most of the european countries as well as the governments of brazil , canada , hong kong , south africa , japan and the us . " the plans differ in each instance , it depends on national circumstances , " said who spokesperson chang .
" if australia wants to close its borders , this is of course easier than in countries which have borders with other lands . " despite national differences , the core elements of the plans are said to have a similar structure . the competence of the emergency services and authorities are checked as are their response procedures in the case of an outbreak ; areas of the population to be vaccinated first with anti-vial drugs are identified , guidelines are laid out to deal with the supervision and control of the infection and public information , travel restrictions and quarantine rules are prepared . german pandemic plan in place , doubts remain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : health centers around germany have implemented their plans .
for instance in germany , the rki implemented a national pandemic emergency plan in january compiled by a group of 20 experts who drew upon recommendations issued by the who . but , implementation of the plan remains difficult to monitor because a large chunk of it is the responsiblity of the 16 german federal states and the 430 health authorities distributed around the country , said susanne glasmacher , spokeswoman for the rki . " the decision by the federal government to provide 20 million euros for the development of a prototype vaccine was very important , " said glasmacher , adding that it would speed up the development of an effective serum in case of a flu outbreak . in addition , the federal states had decided to stock up on antiviral drugs .
but the stockpile would only last for 10 percent of the population , while the emergency plan recommends securing drugs for 20 percent , glasmacher pointed out . " but one should n't play it down - many countries have n't stockpiled any drugs at all , " she added . international cooperation critically important while the readiness to prepare for a pandemic has increased , what is essential is a significant rise in international cooperation , said maria cheng of the who .
many of the countries in which bird flu has struck do not have the resources to combat the virus and a more concerted global effort would help , she added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts fear the h5n1 strain may connect with common human flu .
the main challenges are to find ways of identifying the illness early enough , preventing its spread and to create a drug that can combat the h5n1 virus strain .
" if we were able to identify a new strain early enough , we could maybe prevent the spread of the virus , " said cheng . for this reason , the who has hoarded three million boxes of antiviral drugs .
if a strain that was transmitted between humans did arise in a country , the who would then send specialist teams within the shortest possible time there to contain the virus . " according to models , this would happen in areas where there were 20 to 40 cases of infection reported , ” said cheng .
“ nevertheless , this has yet to be applied in practice . " keeping a cool head the best advice at the moment seems to be for everyone to remain level-headed , said susanne glasmacher of the rki . there seems little doubt that there will be a pandemic as the aggressive increase in bird flu cases indicates .
however , the risk of developing the illness is still very low . " if you want to be infected , you must travel to a humid biotope in a chinese nature reserve and pull out the feathers of the birds you find there , " glasmacher said . dennis stute -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chronology : spread of bird flu to europe on wednesday , british lab results confirmed that the bird flu strain found in croatia was the h5n1 type that killed more than 60 people in asia .

the plan envisages a gradual increase in retirement age which will reach 67 by 2035 . the move comes in the wake of dwindling contributions to the state pension system as a result of low birth rates and rising life expectancy in germany .
government subsidies to the cash-strapped system have skyrocketed over the past decade and have contributed to gaping holes in state coffers . curbi n g early retireme n t the pension woes have been compounded by the fact that a huge number of germans currently retire before the age of 65 .
spd leader franz müntefering said that attempts would be made by the new government to curb early retirement before resorting to an increase in the general pension age . " the decision to increase the retirement age will be decided in 2007 at the earliest , " he said .
" but the possibility is now open and will be part of our coalition treaty . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : doctors have been demonstrating for better work conditions germany 's public health care system is also facing the demographic upheavals caused by an aging german population .
this has led to a drop in the standard of health care and to rising contributions for the population as a whole . attempts in recent months to keep spiralling health costs in check have produced little or no results .
the two parties said that huge differences remain over how to put health care funding on a sound basis again . the draft stays agreement , however , was reached on thursday about the future of military conscription in germany .
chancellor-designate angela merkel appeared pleased , announcing that the first major breakthrough had been made in the negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young germans will continue to have to serve in the military " i strongly welcome the fact that spd and cdu have been able to agree on keeping draft conscription in germany , " she said .
" in addition , progress was made on the use of the bundeswehr in national air space surveillance , as part of domestic attempts to fight terrorism . " educatio n budget safe ? the chief negotiators for the conservative bloc and the social democrats also briefly touched on the hot issue of cutbacks to the national budget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the research sector is seen as an important safe-guard for germany 's future earlier this week , the two parties agreed on a reduction in the budget to the tune of 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 42.5 billion -rrb- , which is more than 10 percent of state expenditure .
despite the dire state of public finances , merkel said that national education and research budgets would not be affected by the cutbacks . she added that plans to increase spending on education and industrial research in germany to 3 percent of gross domestic product by 2010 would also be implemented . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de coalition vows to crack down on welfare abuse in their coalition talks , the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have agreed to get tough on abuse of germany 's reformed unemployment regulations , known as hartz iv .

the cultural event also has a business angle , as nuremberg companies are shouldering half the costs . bringing the " ring " to a chinese stage for the first time ever , 240 artists and stage workers made the trip .
premiering with " rheingold " on oct .
23 , the bavarian guests " set off an earthquake in viewers ' hearts , " according the beiji n g times newspaper .
" siegfried " followed on oct .
26 .
" die walküre " is scheduled for saturday and " götterdämmerung " will conclude the circle on tuesday . staging the operas cost about one million euros -lrb- $ 1.2 million -rrb- , but the chinese only had to pay for half .
companies operating in the nuremberg region agreed to take care of the rest - clearly not without resulting economic benefits in mind . the guest performance opens an economic door to china for us , " said hans-peter schmidt , who heads the supervisory board of nürnberger insurance group and organized the search for sponsors .
he added that nuremberg 's future depends on business ties with asia - ties that sponsors will be able to strengthen when talking to guests in the entry hall of beijing 's poly theater . admiri n g all thi n gs germa n ic german culture has long proven to be an excellent way to polish the country 's already positive image in china . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no longer just interested in german cars " the chinese no longer just know german cars , soccer and punctuality , " said jari grosse-ruyken , who heads the society for chinese studies in bonn .
" it 's always also been recognized as a country of philosophers , thinkers and musicians . " members of china 's growing middle class are familiar with names such as goethe , schiller and wagner , grosse-ruyken said , adding that it does n't surprise him that tickets for the performances have long been sold out since many chinese people have an uncritical admiration for all things " germanic . " wagner 's hero epos " falls on fertile ground in china , " he said . cultural gifts from germa n y but even those who have n't heard of siegfried , freia and wotan before have been drawn to the german guest performance , which has gotten a lot of attention from the chinese media . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg 's rhinegold production in beijing " chinese audiences are open to new things , " said ulrich novak , director of the goethe institute in beijing .
" but they love major highlights and smaller events sometimes suffer because of this . " while calling the ring performances a " courageous and interesting " project , novak said that his institute preferred to develop events in cooperation with chinese partners rather than " presenting gifts . " but he also said that an interest in culture from the business sector was a good thing in principle . bridges for busi n ess grosse-ruyken went a step further , calling the marriage of business and culture a " future-oriented " strategy in china .
he said that german companies had so far mainly focussed on economic exchanges while chinese people were more and more interested in cultural ones . the importance of cultural exchanges for economic cooperation can hardly be exaggerated , said katja hellkötter , who worked in the german industry 's bureau in shanghai for seven years before moving to munich to work on sino-german cultural cooperation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interest in german culture is growing among chinese " culture and business can not be separated , " she said , adding that increasing the visibility of german culture in china also increased the attractiveness of germany as a business location for chinese companies . " cultural factors and an appreciation of a foreign culture play a role in deciding about investments , " she said .
as a result , schiller , goethe and wagner can serve as " bridges for sino-german relations . " nuremberg 's cultural sponsors seem to think the same : they 're going to co-finance the state theater 's performance of mozart 's " don giovanni " in hong kong next year . mareike aden -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de urging germany to speak up on human rights us-based international civil rights organization human rights watch has urged any new german government to become more active in raising human rights issues in russia and china in particular .

delphi , which made a loss of $ 741m in the first half of 2005 , filed for chapter 11 protection at the start of this month , blaming weak demand .
it is in the process of restructuring its finances , but warned that it will have to cut jobs , wages and benefits .
delphi 's problems have weighed heavily on former parent firm general motors .
dip financing general motors ' shares fell 7 % on thursday after the firm revealed it was being probed by us regulators over the way it books pension liabilities .
the company said it would underwrite many of delphi 's pension costs , after it spun off the firm in 1999 .
delphi has been both open and damning about the problems facing the auto industry , claiming that unless workers are willing to accept harsh changes then there are likely to be many other bankruptcies .
the latest loan - called " debtor-in-possession " financing - was approved by a bankruptcy judge and will give delphi time to renegotiate terms with debtors and workers .

2 of 9 cardiff 's wealth was founded on the export of coal .
prior to world war one , the city had the busiest coal-exporting docks in the world .
3 of 9 by the end of the war , the city 's docks and international coal trade were in decline .
the change would affect the city 's economy for generations .
4 of 9 worse was to come during the world war two .
cardiff took its share of the german bombings raids on docks across south wales .
hundreds of homes were destroyed .

but many football fans would wonder how an apparently well-run championship club could come to be homeless for nearly a decade .
most seagulls followers feel just as much disbelief - with some still refusing to even drive past the shopping complex which now stands on the site of the goldstone ground , the club 's former home .
home games are now watched by about 7,000 people , but the club and fans have stressed for a long time that many thousands more would come if there was room for them in the stadium .
in disarray they point to the fact that nearly 30,000 brighton fans watched the team clinch promotion in the play-off final at cardiff 's millennium stadium in 2004 and say many of those would love to come to games week-in , week-out .
the goldstone ground is now the site of a shopping centre brighton 's spell as footballing nomads began when the goldstone ground closed in 1997 , after 96 years of hosting matches .
the ground 's closure was first revealed in 1995 and fans were furious with then-chairman bill archer for selling the ground without finding a permanent replacement .
a move to ground-share with portsmouth was rumoured , to the disgust of fans who would have faced a 100-mile round trip to home games .
brighton were in disarray on the pitch too , which did not help the mood - being relegated into division three in 1996 , just 13 years after reaching the fa cup final .
a pitch invasion led to the abandonment of what was scheduled to be the last game at the goldstone , bringing the issue national attention .
concerted effort the stadium was given a year 's stay of execution but 1996-97 was to prove brighton 's last season at the goldstone .
it was marked by a concerted effort to raise sympathy and awareness of the club 's plight across the country .
withdean is an athletics stadium with no seats behind one goal a match against mansfield was boycotted by all but 1,933 fans - most games had been attracting about 10,000 , while in the 1980s top division football had brought crowds of more than 30,000 .
in february 1997 fans called on supporters from every league club to join them for what they called " fans united " day at a game against hartlepool .
thousands answered the call and a full house saw brighton - adrift at the bottom of the entire league - win 5-0 and start a remarkable comeback which would end with the side maintaining its league status on the final day of the season .
but the goldstone did close - its final game being a 1-0 win over doncaster .
lodgers in kent the following two seasons saw brighton playing home games in gillingham , 75 miles away in kent .
the unpopular bill archer was replaced as chairman by dick knight who set about finding the club a home back in brighton .
fans filled the goldstone ground in the club 's 70s and 80s heyday in 1999 the albion returned to brighton , securing a deal to play at the withdean stadium , a small athletics ground in the city .
it has remained the club 's borrowed home ever since , with temporary seating and a limited capacity of just 7,000 .
in 2001 the club submitted a planning application for a new stadium in the falmer area of the city , close to the university of sussex .
upturn in fortunes the scheme was backed by the city council but some locals objected , as did environmentalists concerned that part of the planned site is in a designated area of outstanding natural beauty .
but the fans who did so much to raise awareness of the club 's plight before it left the goldstone have carried on their high-profile campaigning .
two years running they have held a peaceful protest march during the labour party conference at the brighton centre , and a host of imaginative publicity stunts have included delivering john prescott a giant postcard and inviting opposition fans to throw sponges at celebrity fan des lynam .
brighton took nearly 30,000 fans to the play-off final in cardiff an upturn in fortunes on the pitch has seen brighton move up two divisions in their time at the withdean , but this has only brought the inadequacy of the temporary home into sharper focus .
low crowds and general uncertainty over the club 's future without a real home has seen a succession of talented managers leave the club in recent years , despite its run of success .
among those to resign since the closure of the goldstone ground are micky adams , peter taylor and steve coppell , who tellingly all now manage clubs with big new stadia .
brighton fans will be hoping john prescott 's decision to let the club make its new home at falmer will herald a move towards big club status for the seagulls - or at least let some more of them see a few games .
