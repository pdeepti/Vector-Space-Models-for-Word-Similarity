along with the vw bug and the goggomobil , the car stood out on the streets of mid-1950s west germany .
nowadays only a handful of isettas putter along germany 's roads - unfortunately . at 16 , sven höttges discovered his mint-green isetta in a junkyard .
it was love at first sight .
" i scraped together my school money and bought the thing , " höttges recalled .
" we loaded it onto a coal truck and transported it home .
i restored it there , much to the chagrin of my neighbors .
that took two years . " an isetta is three meters -lrb- 10 feet -rrb- long , 1.4 meters wide and 1.3 meter tall .
thus , it can be a pretty tight squeeze inside .
but that has advantages , too ; the narrow settee allowed people to quickly get to know each other better , remarked bmw historian manfred grunert .
the isetta cost only 2,550 deutsche marks -lrb- € 1,300 , $ 1,720 -rrb- at the time and was thus an introduction to car ownership .
" it was a roof on four wheels , " said grunert , a car for young people .
" and in the early years , getting closer to the opposite sex really was an issue . "
and the isetta was soon dubbed the knutschkugel or " smooch ball . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : west germany in the 1950s : luxurious , clingy stockings for sale in the 1950s , west germany awoke from its postwar lethargy .
the economy flourished and the future looked bright .
but business was n't going well for bavaria 's bmw .
" in effect , we did n't have any production facilities in munich .
our plants were in eisenach , in the soviet zone , and had been largely dismantled .
that is , we had to start production again from nothing and we also needed personnel , " said grunert .
going goggomobil the lack of production facilities was only one of the problems .
bmw was n't particularly successful in developing new models .
the bmw 501 , the so-called baroque angel , did n't sell as well as expected .
and the company was practically broke .
a car like the goggomobil , the big seller from the town of dingolfing , was what bmw needed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the four-door isetta allowed a tad more room .
but it would have taken too long to develop a similar sedan from scratch .
instead , the bavarians bought the license for the isetta from the italian refrigerator and car manufacturer iso .
" in this phase , the liquid capital was n't especially plentiful .
and what could be more obvious than licensed production ? " said grunert .
in contrast to the original italian isetta , however , the bavarian sister developed into a money-maker and a cult object thanks to its robust four cycle engine .
even today the car has ardent fans , like sven höttges .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.03.2005 czechs mull communist party ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the sun setting for communist symbols in the czech republic ?
unlike in most former eastern bloc countries , the czech republic 's communists did not transform themselves into a modern left-wing party after the fall of the iron curtain .
now , a campaign is on to outlaw them . maintaining their old name and symbols has not hindered the communists ; in fact , they enjoy the support of almost 20 percent of czech voters and have slowly acquired legitimacy . but not everyone is prepared to sit back and watch the communists go from strength to strength : a new campaign wants to make the propagation of communism illegal . " let 's ban the communists , " is the cry at a demonstration on prague 's old town square , in front of the very balcony where communist leader klement gottwald announced that the party had taken power in 1948 .
now , over 15 years after they were swept from power , a campaign has been launched to make the propagation of communism - like nazism - punishable by up to five years in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of demonstrators in prague helped bring about the fall of communism during the " velvet revolution " of 1989 " what we would like to achieve in fact is to change the focus onto the fact that the communist party never accepted responsibility for the things that happened during the 40 years of communism in this country , " said simon panek , one of the organizers of the campaign and a student leader in 1989 .
" visibly we are asking for the banning of the communist party name and symbols - the same as nazi symbols - because for us these are the symbols of a dictatorship which maybe was less hard in the short term , but the impact of communism was devastating as well . " adapting to a changed reality forcing the czech communist party to adapt to the new system as have others in eastern europe was the reason behind the campaign , said czech senator jaroslav stetina , one of the authors of the new amendment . " our communist party is the last totalitarian , not reformed communist party in central europe , " he said .
" and we want to change it like in hungary , like in poland and other countries . " but even some of those who suffered under the communist regime oppose the ban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 20,000 people stand around st.wenceslas statue , to support a declaration of student leaders of the 1989 velvet revolution , calling on top czech politicians to resign " now it 's too late , " said czech interior minister frantisek bublan , who for years was forced to take menial jobs .
" this campaign should have started 15 years ago , when there was more political will .

unlike in most former eastern bloc countries , the czech republic 's communists did not transform themselves into a modern left-wing party after the fall of the iron curtain .
now , a campaign is on to outlaw them . maintaining their old name and symbols has not hindered the communists ; in fact , they enjoy the support of almost 20 percent of czech voters and have slowly acquired legitimacy . but not everyone is prepared to sit back and watch the communists go from strength to strength : a new campaign wants to make the propagation of communism illegal . " let 's ban the communists , " is the cry at a demonstration on prague 's old town square , in front of the very balcony where communist leader klement gottwald announced that the party had taken power in 1948 .
now , over 15 years after they were swept from power , a campaign has been launched to make the propagation of communism - like nazism - punishable by up to five years in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of demonstrators in prague helped bring about the fall of communism during the " velvet revolution " of 1989 " what we would like to achieve in fact is to change the focus onto the fact that the communist party never accepted responsibility for the things that happened during the 40 years of communism in this country , " said simon panek , one of the organizers of the campaign and a student leader in 1989 .
" visibly we are asking for the banning of the communist party name and symbols - the same as nazi symbols - because for us these are the symbols of a dictatorship which maybe was less hard in the short term , but the impact of communism was devastating as well . " adapting to a changed reality forcing the czech communist party to adapt to the new system as have others in eastern europe was the reason behind the campaign , said czech senator jaroslav stetina , one of the authors of the new amendment . " our communist party is the last totalitarian , not reformed communist party in central europe , " he said .
" and we want to change it like in hungary , like in poland and other countries . " but even some of those who suffered under the communist regime oppose the ban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 20,000 people stand around st.wenceslas statue , to support a declaration of student leaders of the 1989 velvet revolution , calling on top czech politicians to resign " now it 's too late , " said czech interior minister frantisek bublan , who for years was forced to take menial jobs .

unlike in most former eastern bloc countries , the czech republic 's communists did not transform themselves into a modern left-wing party after the fall of the iron curtain .
now , a campaign is on to outlaw them . maintaining their old name and symbols has not hindered the communists ; in fact , they enjoy the support of almost 20 percent of czech voters and have slowly acquired legitimacy . but not everyone is prepared to sit back and watch the communists go from strength to strength : a new campaign wants to make the propagation of communism illegal . " let 's ban the communists , " is the cry at a demonstration on prague 's old town square , in front of the very balcony where communist leader klement gottwald announced that the party had taken power in 1948 .
now , over 15 years after they were swept from power , a campaign has been launched to make the propagation of communism - like nazism - punishable by up to five years in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of demonstrators in prague helped bring about the fall of communism during the " velvet revolution " of 1989 " what we would like to achieve in fact is to change the focus onto the fact that the communist party never accepted responsibility for the things that happened during the 40 years of communism in this country , " said simon panek , one of the organizers of the campaign and a student leader in 1989 .
" visibly we are asking for the banning of the communist party name and symbols - the same as nazi symbols - because for us these are the symbols of a dictatorship which maybe was less hard in the short term , but the impact of communism was devastating as well . " adapting to a changed reality forcing the czech communist party to adapt to the new system as have others in eastern europe was the reason behind the campaign , said czech senator jaroslav stetina , one of the authors of the new amendment . " our communist party is the last totalitarian , not reformed communist party in central europe , " he said .
" and we want to change it like in hungary , like in poland and other countries . " but even some of those who suffered under the communist regime oppose the ban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 20,000 people stand around st.wenceslas statue , to support a declaration of student leaders of the 1989 velvet revolution , calling on top czech politicians to resign " now it 's too late , " said czech interior minister frantisek bublan , who for years was forced to take menial jobs .
" this campaign should have started 15 years ago , when there was more political will .
if the communist party had been banned after the velvet revolution -lrb- of 1989 -rrb- , its members would have just transformed themselves .
but at least now we would n't have communist symbols or that name .
this new campaign is basically a lot of hullabaloo ; banning the party now would be unconstitutional and it would n't achieve anything positive . " havel 's mistake ? whether the communists should have been banned in the immediate aftermath of the revolution has always been a bone of contention .

the visit comes at a sensitive time when ukraine is at the center of an illegal immigration scandal in germany . it is yushchenko 's first official visit to germany since the " orange revolution " which forced out the pro-russian regime and carried the reformist liberal to power in the former soviet republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , right , meets ukraine president viktor yushchenko at the nato meeting in brussels in february .
yushchenko begins his visit on tuesday and will meet chancellor gerhard schröder the following day when he will also be granted the rare honor of addressing the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , following in the footsteps of world leaders such as us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin . german business daily handelsblatt reported on thursday that former defense minister volker rühe from the german opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- had expressed reservations about a leader making a speech to the parliament so soon after taking office . but the government opted to give yushchenko a firm boost as a statesman with the offer , setting the tone for strong bilateral ties in the future .
yushchenko 's discussions with schröder will focus on german-ukrainian relations and ukraine 's ties with russia , the european union and the nato military alliance , a german government spokesman said . ukraine a test for schröder-putin relations schröder invited yushchenko to germany immediately after his victory in the re-run presidential election in late december and urged the new leader to steer the country on a " course towards democracy and a market economy under the rule of law " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin -lrb- right -rrb- speaks with german chancellor gerhard schröder during their walk in the bocharov ruchei presidential residence in sochi at the black sea shore in aug .
2004 .
the furor over the first ukrainian presidential election , which gave victory to the pro-russia candidate viktor yanukovich but was marred by widespread reports of regularities , was a severe test for schröder 's close relationship with putin . schröder telephoned putin twice during the crisis to encourage him to support a re-run of the poll .
putin had openly backed yanukovich in the first election . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the re-run ukrainian election " was a central principle of the new europe and the end of thinking in blocs " .
" the fallout from it will be widespread , " he said in an interview with the frankfurter rundschau newspaper on saturday . shadow on kiev-berlin ties yushchenko 's visit has added significance because ukraine is currently at the centre of a political scandal over illegal immigration in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer is under increasing pressure for his role in the visa affair .
fischer is under pressure to explain claims from the opposition that hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants from the former soviet bloc - especially ukraine - were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed . the opposition cdu says the revised system was exploited by organized crime groups and encouraged prostitution .
fischer has admitted to making mistakes in the handling of the visa issue , but has ruled out resigning . on friday , yushchenko indicated that the ongoing visa affair in germany could have a negative impact on relations between kiev and berlin .
" naturally , a certain shadow will be cast on our relations , " yushchenko told financial times deutschland . he added that he feared the scandal would also create a false image in germany of ukrainians .

the visit comes at a sensitive time when ukraine is at the center of an illegal immigration scandal in germany . it is yushchenko 's first official visit to germany since the " orange revolution " which forced out the pro-russian regime and carried the reformist liberal to power in the former soviet republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , right , meets ukraine president viktor yushchenko at the nato meeting in brussels in february .
yushchenko begins his visit on tuesday and will meet chancellor gerhard schröder the following day when he will also be granted the rare honor of addressing the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , following in the footsteps of world leaders such as us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin . german business daily handelsblatt reported on thursday that former defense minister volker rühe from the german opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- had expressed reservations about a leader making a speech to the parliament so soon after taking office . but the government opted to give yushchenko a firm boost as a statesman with the offer , setting the tone for strong bilateral ties in the future .
yushchenko 's discussions with schröder will focus on german-ukrainian relations and ukraine 's ties with russia , the european union and the nato military alliance , a german government spokesman said . ukraine a test for schröder-putin relations schröder invited yushchenko to germany immediately after his victory in the re-run presidential election in late december and urged the new leader to steer the country on a " course towards democracy and a market economy under the rule of law " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin -lrb- right -rrb- speaks with german chancellor gerhard schröder during their walk in the bocharov ruchei presidential residence in sochi at the black sea shore in aug .

the furor over the first ukrainian presidential election , which gave victory to the pro-russia candidate viktor yanukovich but was marred by widespread reports of regularities , was a severe test for schröder 's close relationship with putin . schröder telephoned putin twice during the crisis to encourage him to support a re-run of the poll .
putin had openly backed yanukovich in the first election . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the re-run ukrainian election " was a central principle of the new europe and the end of thinking in blocs " .
" the fallout from it will be widespread , " he said in an interview with the frankfurter rundschau newspaper on saturday . shadow on kiev-berlin ties yushchenko 's visit has added significance because ukraine is currently at the centre of a political scandal over illegal immigration in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer is under increasing pressure for his role in the visa affair .
fischer is under pressure to explain claims from the opposition that hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants from the former soviet bloc - especially ukraine - were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed . the opposition cdu says the revised system was exploited by organized crime groups and encouraged prostitution .
fischer has admitted to making mistakes in the handling of the visa issue , but has ruled out resigning . on friday , yushchenko indicated that the ongoing visa affair in germany could have a negative impact on relations between kiev and berlin .
" naturally , a certain shadow will be cast on our relations , " yushchenko told financial times deutschland . he added that he feared the scandal would also create a false image in germany of ukrainians .

german foreign minister fischer , engulfed in a tourist visa row , saw first-hand the vast number of people flocking to the country 's embassy in ukraine years ago , according to a newspaper report . the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said that fischer had witnessed during a visit to kiev in june 2000 how the german embassy there was overwhelmed by people seeking travel visas . " my goodness , did they all come to see me ? " he joked at the time , according to the respected weekly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german embassy in kiev fischer has been accused of indirectly allowing thousands of clandestine immigrants from the former soviet bloc - ukraine in particular - to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed . the allegations , by the conservative opposition , include claims that his lack of vigilance fostered organized crime , a submerged economy and prostitution . fischer , the country 's most popular politician until the scandal broke , has acknowledged making mistakes but has refused to resign .
he has also received the backing of chancellor gerhard schröder . foreign ministry spokesman walter lindner confirmed fischer 's visit to the kiev embassy but said that it was only to examine staffing issues . " there was no question about the misuse of visas , " lindner said .
the german foreign ministry has until now insisted that fischer only got wind of the visa abuse affair much later . but fischer did order an increase in visa-issuing staff on his return , the newspaper said , which led to the fact that the number of german visas issued by the embassy in kiev between 1999 and 2001 almost doubled to 300,000 . fischer considered stepping down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer " i 've made mistakes , " fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- told a cologne meeting of his party , the greens , junior members of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrat-led government coalition , at the end of last month .
" i did not react with sufficient speed or firmness , or fully enough as the responsible minister , " he said . in an interview with saturday 's frankfurter rundschau , fischer , who is also deputy chancellor , said that he had considered stepping down over the affair .
" it 's a question that i put to myself , myself and others , " he said .
" and when i look at that on balance , taking into account the foreign and domestic political challenges facing us , i arrived at the conclusion : i will stay on . " germany 's conservative opposition has seized upon the latest allegations as further proof that fischer turned a blind eye to the unfolding abuse in his own department .

unlike in most former eastern bloc countries , the czech republic 's communists did not transform themselves into a modern left-wing party after the fall of the iron curtain .

german foreign minister fischer , engulfed in a tourist visa row , saw first-hand the vast number of people flocking to the country 's embassy in ukraine years ago , according to a newspaper report . the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said that fischer had witnessed during a visit to kiev in june 2000 how the german embassy there was overwhelmed by people seeking travel visas . " my goodness , did they all come to see me ? " he joked at the time , according to the respected weekly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german embassy in kiev fischer has been accused of indirectly allowing thousands of clandestine immigrants from the former soviet bloc - ukraine in particular - to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed . the allegations , by the conservative opposition , include claims that his lack of vigilance fostered organized crime , a submerged economy and prostitution . fischer , the country 's most popular politician until the scandal broke , has acknowledged making mistakes but has refused to resign .
he has also received the backing of chancellor gerhard schröder . foreign ministry spokesman walter lindner confirmed fischer 's visit to the kiev embassy but said that it was only to examine staffing issues . " there was no question about the misuse of visas , " lindner said .
the german foreign ministry has until now insisted that fischer only got wind of the visa abuse affair much later . but fischer did order an increase in visa-issuing staff on his return , the newspaper said , which led to the fact that the number of german visas issued by the embassy in kiev between 1999 and 2001 almost doubled to 300,000 . fischer considered stepping down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer " i 've made mistakes , " fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- told a cologne meeting of his party , the greens , junior members of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrat-led government coalition , at the end of last month .
" i did not react with sufficient speed or firmness , or fully enough as the responsible minister , " he said . in an interview with saturday 's frankfurter rundschau , fischer , who is also deputy chancellor , said that he had considered stepping down over the affair .
" it 's a question that i put to myself , myself and others , " he said .
" and when i look at that on balance , taking into account the foreign and domestic political challenges facing us , i arrived at the conclusion : i will stay on . " germany 's conservative opposition has seized upon the latest allegations as further proof that fischer turned a blind eye to the unfolding abuse in his own department . " it 's very obvious now that fischer 's earlier confession that he did n't have anything to do with the visa policies is simply not true , " wolfgang schäuble , a christian democrat told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .

unlike in most former eastern bloc countries , the czech republic 's communists did not transform themselves into a modern left-wing party after the fall of the iron curtain .
now , a campaign is on to outlaw them . maintaining their old name and symbols has not hindered the communists ; in fact , they enjoy the support of almost 20 percent of czech voters and have slowly acquired legitimacy . but not everyone is prepared to sit back and watch the communists go from strength to strength : a new campaign wants to make the propagation of communism illegal . " let 's ban the communists , " is the cry at a demonstration on prague 's old town square , in front of the very balcony where communist leader klement gottwald announced that the party had taken power in 1948 .
now , over 15 years after they were swept from power , a campaign has been launched to make the propagation of communism - like nazism - punishable by up to five years in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of demonstrators in prague helped bring about the fall of communism during the " velvet revolution " of 1989 " what we would like to achieve in fact is to change the focus onto the fact that the communist party never accepted responsibility for the things that happened during the 40 years of communism in this country , " said simon panek , one of the organizers of the campaign and a student leader in 1989 .
" visibly we are asking for the banning of the communist party name and symbols - the same as nazi symbols - because for us these are the symbols of a dictatorship which maybe was less hard in the short term , but the impact of communism was devastating as well . " adapting to a changed reality forcing the czech communist party to adapt to the new system as have others in eastern europe was the reason behind the campaign , said czech senator jaroslav stetina , one of the authors of the new amendment . " our communist party is the last totalitarian , not reformed communist party in central europe , " he said .
" and we want to change it like in hungary , like in poland and other countries . " but even some of those who suffered under the communist regime oppose the ban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 20,000 people stand around st.wenceslas statue , to support a declaration of student leaders of the 1989 velvet revolution , calling on top czech politicians to resign " now it 's too late , " said czech interior minister frantisek bublan , who for years was forced to take menial jobs .
" this campaign should have started 15 years ago , when there was more political will .
if the communist party had been banned after the velvet revolution -lrb- of 1989 -rrb- , its members would have just transformed themselves .
but at least now we would n't have communist symbols or that name .

german foreign minister fischer , engulfed in a tourist visa row , saw first-hand the vast number of people flocking to the country 's embassy in ukraine years ago , according to a newspaper report . the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said that fischer had witnessed during a visit to kiev in june 2000 how the german embassy there was overwhelmed by people seeking travel visas . " my goodness , did they all come to see me ? " he joked at the time , according to the respected weekly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german embassy in kiev fischer has been accused of indirectly allowing thousands of clandestine immigrants from the former soviet bloc - ukraine in particular - to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed . the allegations , by the conservative opposition , include claims that his lack of vigilance fostered organized crime , a submerged economy and prostitution . fischer , the country 's most popular politician until the scandal broke , has acknowledged making mistakes but has refused to resign .
he has also received the backing of chancellor gerhard schröder . foreign ministry spokesman walter lindner confirmed fischer 's visit to the kiev embassy but said that it was only to examine staffing issues . " there was no question about the misuse of visas , " lindner said .
the german foreign ministry has until now insisted that fischer only got wind of the visa abuse affair much later . but fischer did order an increase in visa-issuing staff on his return , the newspaper said , which led to the fact that the number of german visas issued by the embassy in kiev between 1999 and 2001 almost doubled to 300,000 . fischer considered stepping down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer " i 've made mistakes , " fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- told a cologne meeting of his party , the greens , junior members of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrat-led government coalition , at the end of last month .
" i did not react with sufficient speed or firmness , or fully enough as the responsible minister , " he said . in an interview with saturday 's frankfurter rundschau , fischer , who is also deputy chancellor , said that he had considered stepping down over the affair .
" it 's a question that i put to myself , myself and others , " he said .
" and when i look at that on balance , taking into account the foreign and domestic political challenges facing us , i arrived at the conclusion : i will stay on . " germany 's conservative opposition has seized upon the latest allegations as further proof that fischer turned a blind eye to the unfolding abuse in his own department . " it 's very obvious now that fischer 's earlier confession that he did n't have anything to do with the visa policies is simply not true , " wolfgang schäuble , a christian democrat told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .

the visit comes at a sensitive time when ukraine is at the center of an illegal immigration scandal in germany . it is yushchenko 's first official visit to germany since the " orange revolution " which forced out the pro-russian regime and carried the reformist liberal to power in the former soviet republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , right , meets ukraine president viktor yushchenko at the nato meeting in brussels in february .
yushchenko begins his visit on tuesday and will meet chancellor gerhard schröder the following day when he will also be granted the rare honor of addressing the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , following in the footsteps of world leaders such as us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin . german business daily handelsblatt reported on thursday that former defense minister volker rühe from the german opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- had expressed reservations about a leader making a speech to the parliament so soon after taking office . but the government opted to give yushchenko a firm boost as a statesman with the offer , setting the tone for strong bilateral ties in the future .
yushchenko 's discussions with schröder will focus on german-ukrainian relations and ukraine 's ties with russia , the european union and the nato military alliance , a german government spokesman said . ukraine a test for schröder-putin relations schröder invited yushchenko to germany immediately after his victory in the re-run presidential election in late december and urged the new leader to steer the country on a " course towards democracy and a market economy under the rule of law " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin -lrb- right -rrb- speaks with german chancellor gerhard schröder during their walk in the bocharov ruchei presidential residence in sochi at the black sea shore in aug .
2004 .
the furor over the first ukrainian presidential election , which gave victory to the pro-russia candidate viktor yanukovich but was marred by widespread reports of regularities , was a severe test for schröder 's close relationship with putin . schröder telephoned putin twice during the crisis to encourage him to support a re-run of the poll .
putin had openly backed yanukovich in the first election . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the re-run ukrainian election " was a central principle of the new europe and the end of thinking in blocs " .
" the fallout from it will be widespread , " he said in an interview with the frankfurter rundschau newspaper on saturday . shadow on kiev-berlin ties yushchenko 's visit has added significance because ukraine is currently at the centre of a political scandal over illegal immigration in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer is under increasing pressure for his role in the visa affair .
fischer is under pressure to explain claims from the opposition that hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants from the former soviet bloc - especially ukraine - were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed . the opposition cdu says the revised system was exploited by organized crime groups and encouraged prostitution .
fischer has admitted to making mistakes in the handling of the visa issue , but has ruled out resigning . on friday , yushchenko indicated that the ongoing visa affair in germany could have a negative impact on relations between kiev and berlin .
" naturally , a certain shadow will be cast on our relations , " yushchenko told financial times deutschland . he added that he feared the scandal would also create a false image in germany of ukrainians .
" i wish the germans would have a normal relationship to ukrainians and not see each one as an illegal laborer , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , warsaw to boost ukrainian democracy germany and poland plan to step up efforts to strengthen ukraine 's fledgling democracy .

the visit comes at a sensitive time when ukraine is at the center of an illegal immigration scandal in germany . it is yushchenko 's first official visit to germany since the " orange revolution " which forced out the pro-russian regime and carried the reformist liberal to power in the former soviet republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , right , meets ukraine president viktor yushchenko at the nato meeting in brussels in february .
yushchenko begins his visit on tuesday and will meet chancellor gerhard schröder the following day when he will also be granted the rare honor of addressing the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , following in the footsteps of world leaders such as us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin . german business daily handelsblatt reported on thursday that former defense minister volker rühe from the german opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- had expressed reservations about a leader making a speech to the parliament so soon after taking office . but the government opted to give yushchenko a firm boost as a statesman with the offer , setting the tone for strong bilateral ties in the future .
yushchenko 's discussions with schröder will focus on german-ukrainian relations and ukraine 's ties with russia , the european union and the nato military alliance , a german government spokesman said . ukraine a test for schröder-putin relations schröder invited yushchenko to germany immediately after his victory in the re-run presidential election in late december and urged the new leader to steer the country on a " course towards democracy and a market economy under the rule of law " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin -lrb- right -rrb- speaks with german chancellor gerhard schröder during their walk in the bocharov ruchei presidential residence in sochi at the black sea shore in aug .

the furor over the first ukrainian presidential election , which gave victory to the pro-russia candidate viktor yanukovich but was marred by widespread reports of regularities , was a severe test for schröder 's close relationship with putin . schröder telephoned putin twice during the crisis to encourage him to support a re-run of the poll .
putin had openly backed yanukovich in the first election . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the re-run ukrainian election " was a central principle of the new europe and the end of thinking in blocs " .
" the fallout from it will be widespread , " he said in an interview with the frankfurter rundschau newspaper on saturday . shadow on kiev-berlin ties yushchenko 's visit has added significance because ukraine is currently at the centre of a political scandal over illegal immigration in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer is under increasing pressure for his role in the visa affair .
fischer is under pressure to explain claims from the opposition that hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants from the former soviet bloc - especially ukraine - were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed . the opposition cdu says the revised system was exploited by organized crime groups and encouraged prostitution .
fischer has admitted to making mistakes in the handling of the visa issue , but has ruled out resigning . on friday , yushchenko indicated that the ongoing visa affair in germany could have a negative impact on relations between kiev and berlin .

yushchenko 's discussions with schröder will focus on german-ukrainian relations and ukraine 's ties with russia , the european union and the nato military alliance , a german government spokesman said . ukraine a test for schröder-putin relations schröder invited yushchenko to germany immediately after his victory in the re-run presidential election in late december and urged the new leader to steer the country on a " course towards democracy and a market economy under the rule of law " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin -lrb- right -rrb- speaks with german chancellor gerhard schröder during their walk in the bocharov ruchei presidential residence in sochi at the black sea shore in aug .
2004 .
the furor over the first ukrainian presidential election , which gave victory to the pro-russia candidate viktor yanukovich but was marred by widespread reports of regularities , was a severe test for schröder 's close relationship with putin . schröder telephoned putin twice during the crisis to encourage him to support a re-run of the poll .
putin had openly backed yanukovich in the first election . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the re-run ukrainian election " was a central principle of the new europe and the end of thinking in blocs " .
" the fallout from it will be widespread , " he said in an interview with the frankfurter rundschau newspaper on saturday . shadow on kiev-berlin ties yushchenko 's visit has added significance because ukraine is currently at the centre of a political scandal over illegal immigration in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer is under increasing pressure for his role in the visa affair .
fischer is under pressure to explain claims from the opposition that hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants from the former soviet bloc - especially ukraine - were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed . the opposition cdu says the revised system was exploited by organized crime groups and encouraged prostitution .
fischer has admitted to making mistakes in the handling of the visa issue , but has ruled out resigning . on friday , yushchenko indicated that the ongoing visa affair in germany could have a negative impact on relations between kiev and berlin .
" naturally , a certain shadow will be cast on our relations , " yushchenko told financial times deutschland . he added that he feared the scandal would also create a false image in germany of ukrainians .
" i wish the germans would have a normal relationship to ukrainians and not see each one as an illegal laborer , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin , warsaw to boost ukrainian democracy germany and poland plan to step up efforts to strengthen ukraine 's fledgling democracy .

german foreign minister fischer , engulfed in a tourist visa row , saw first-hand the vast number of people flocking to the country 's embassy in ukraine years ago , according to a newspaper report . the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said that fischer had witnessed during a visit to kiev in june 2000 how the german embassy there was overwhelmed by people seeking travel visas .

german foreign minister fischer , engulfed in a tourist visa row , saw first-hand the vast number of people flocking to the country 's embassy in ukraine years ago , according to a newspaper report . the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said that fischer had witnessed during a visit to kiev in june 2000 how the german embassy there was overwhelmed by people seeking travel visas . " my goodness , did they all come to see me ? " he joked at the time , according to the respected weekly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german embassy in kiev fischer has been accused of indirectly allowing thousands of clandestine immigrants from the former soviet bloc - ukraine in particular - to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed . the allegations , by the conservative opposition , include claims that his lack of vigilance fostered organized crime , a submerged economy and prostitution . fischer , the country 's most popular politician until the scandal broke , has acknowledged making mistakes but has refused to resign .

the visit comes at a sensitive time when ukraine is at the center of an illegal immigration scandal in germany . it is yushchenko 's first official visit to germany since the " orange revolution " which forced out the pro-russian regime and carried the reformist liberal to power in the former soviet republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , right , meets ukraine president viktor yushchenko at the nato meeting in brussels in february .
yushchenko begins his visit on tuesday and will meet chancellor gerhard schröder the following day when he will also be granted the rare honor of addressing the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , following in the footsteps of world leaders such as us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin . german business daily handelsblatt reported on thursday that former defense minister volker rühe from the german opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- had expressed reservations about a leader making a speech to the parliament so soon after taking office . but the government opted to give yushchenko a firm boost as a statesman with the offer , setting the tone for strong bilateral ties in the future .

the furor over the first ukrainian presidential election , which gave victory to the pro-russia candidate viktor yanukovich but was marred by widespread reports of regularities , was a severe test for schröder 's close relationship with putin . schröder telephoned putin twice during the crisis to encourage him to support a re-run of the poll .
putin had openly backed yanukovich in the first election . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the re-run ukrainian election " was a central principle of the new europe and the end of thinking in blocs " .

fischer is under pressure to explain claims from the opposition that hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants from the former soviet bloc - especially ukraine - were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed . the opposition cdu says the revised system was exploited by organized crime groups and encouraged prostitution .
fischer has admitted to making mistakes in the handling of the visa issue , but has ruled out resigning . on friday , yushchenko indicated that the ongoing visa affair in germany could have a negative impact on relations between kiev and berlin .

the visit comes at a sensitive time when ukraine is at the center of an illegal immigration scandal in germany . it is yushchenko 's first official visit to germany since the " orange revolution " which forced out the pro-russian regime and carried the reformist liberal to power in the former soviet republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , right , meets ukraine president viktor yushchenko at the nato meeting in brussels in february .
yushchenko begins his visit on tuesday and will meet chancellor gerhard schröder the following day when he will also be granted the rare honor of addressing the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , following in the footsteps of world leaders such as us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin . german business daily handelsblatt reported on thursday that former defense minister volker rühe from the german opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- had expressed reservations about a leader making a speech to the parliament so soon after taking office . but the government opted to give yushchenko a firm boost as a statesman with the offer , setting the tone for strong bilateral ties in the future .

putin had openly backed yanukovich in the first election . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the re-run ukrainian election " was a central principle of the new europe and the end of thinking in blocs " .

fischer is under pressure to explain claims from the opposition that hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants from the former soviet bloc - especially ukraine - were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed . the opposition cdu says the revised system was exploited by organized crime groups and encouraged prostitution .

the visit comes at a sensitive time when ukraine is at the center of an illegal immigration scandal in germany . it is yushchenko 's first official visit to germany since the " orange revolution " which forced out the pro-russian regime and carried the reformist liberal to power in the former soviet republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , right , meets ukraine president viktor yushchenko at the nato meeting in brussels in february .
yushchenko begins his visit on tuesday and will meet chancellor gerhard schröder the following day when he will also be granted the rare honor of addressing the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , following in the footsteps of world leaders such as us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin . german business daily handelsblatt reported on thursday that former defense minister volker rühe from the german opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- had expressed reservations about a leader making a speech to the parliament so soon after taking office . but the government opted to give yushchenko a firm boost as a statesman with the offer , setting the tone for strong bilateral ties in the future .
yushchenko 's discussions with schröder will focus on german-ukrainian relations and ukraine 's ties with russia , the european union and the nato military alliance , a german government spokesman said . ukraine a test for schröder-putin relations schröder invited yushchenko to germany immediately after his victory in the re-run presidential election in late december and urged the new leader to steer the country on a " course towards democracy and a market economy under the rule of law " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin -lrb- right -rrb- speaks with german chancellor gerhard schröder during their walk in the bocharov ruchei presidential residence in sochi at the black sea shore in aug .

the furor over the first ukrainian presidential election , which gave victory to the pro-russia candidate viktor yanukovich but was marred by widespread reports of regularities , was a severe test for schröder 's close relationship with putin . schröder telephoned putin twice during the crisis to encourage him to support a re-run of the poll .
putin had openly backed yanukovich in the first election . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the re-run ukrainian election " was a central principle of the new europe and the end of thinking in blocs " .
" the fallout from it will be widespread , " he said in an interview with the frankfurter rundschau newspaper on saturday . shadow on kiev-berlin ties yushchenko 's visit has added significance because ukraine is currently at the centre of a political scandal over illegal immigration in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer is under increasing pressure for his role in the visa affair .
fischer is under pressure to explain claims from the opposition that hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants from the former soviet bloc - especially ukraine - were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed . the opposition cdu says the revised system was exploited by organized crime groups and encouraged prostitution .
fischer has admitted to making mistakes in the handling of the visa issue , but has ruled out resigning . on friday , yushchenko indicated that the ongoing visa affair in germany could have a negative impact on relations between kiev and berlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.03.2005 czechs mull communist party ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the sun setting for communist symbols in the czech republic ?
unlike in most former eastern bloc countries , the czech republic 's communists did not transform themselves into a modern left-wing party after the fall of the iron curtain .
now , a campaign is on to outlaw them . maintaining their old name and symbols has not hindered the communists ; in fact , they enjoy the support of almost 20 percent of czech voters and have slowly acquired legitimacy . but not everyone is prepared to sit back and watch the communists go from strength to strength : a new campaign wants to make the propagation of communism illegal . " let 's ban the communists , " is the cry at a demonstration on prague 's old town square , in front of the very balcony where communist leader klement gottwald announced that the party had taken power in 1948 .
now , over 15 years after they were swept from power , a campaign has been launched to make the propagation of communism - like nazism - punishable by up to five years in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of demonstrators in prague helped bring about the fall of communism during the " velvet revolution " of 1989 " what we would like to achieve in fact is to change the focus onto the fact that the communist party never accepted responsibility for the things that happened during the 40 years of communism in this country , " said simon panek , one of the organizers of the campaign and a student leader in 1989 .
" visibly we are asking for the banning of the communist party name and symbols - the same as nazi symbols - because for us these are the symbols of a dictatorship which maybe was less hard in the short term , but the impact of communism was devastating as well . " adapting to a changed reality forcing the czech communist party to adapt to the new system as have others in eastern europe was the reason behind the campaign , said czech senator jaroslav stetina , one of the authors of the new amendment . " our communist party is the last totalitarian , not reformed communist party in central europe , " he said .
" and we want to change it like in hungary , like in poland and other countries . " but even some of those who suffered under the communist regime oppose the ban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 20,000 people stand around st.wenceslas statue , to support a declaration of student leaders of the 1989 velvet revolution , calling on top czech politicians to resign " now it 's too late , " said czech interior minister frantisek bublan , who for years was forced to take menial jobs .
" this campaign should have started 15 years ago , when there was more political will .
if the communist party had been banned after the velvet revolution -lrb- of 1989 -rrb- , its members would have just transformed themselves .
but at least now we would n't have communist symbols or that name .

unlike in most former eastern bloc countries , the czech republic 's communists did not transform themselves into a modern left-wing party after the fall of the iron curtain .
now , a campaign is on to outlaw them . maintaining their old name and symbols has not hindered the communists ; in fact , they enjoy the support of almost 20 percent of czech voters and have slowly acquired legitimacy . but not everyone is prepared to sit back and watch the communists go from strength to strength : a new campaign wants to make the propagation of communism illegal . " let 's ban the communists , " is the cry at a demonstration on prague 's old town square , in front of the very balcony where communist leader klement gottwald announced that the party had taken power in 1948 .
now , over 15 years after they were swept from power , a campaign has been launched to make the propagation of communism - like nazism - punishable by up to five years in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of demonstrators in prague helped bring about the fall of communism during the " velvet revolution " of 1989 " what we would like to achieve in fact is to change the focus onto the fact that the communist party never accepted responsibility for the things that happened during the 40 years of communism in this country , " said simon panek , one of the organizers of the campaign and a student leader in 1989 .
" visibly we are asking for the banning of the communist party name and symbols - the same as nazi symbols - because for us these are the symbols of a dictatorship which maybe was less hard in the short term , but the impact of communism was devastating as well . " adapting to a changed reality forcing the czech communist party to adapt to the new system as have others in eastern europe was the reason behind the campaign , said czech senator jaroslav stetina , one of the authors of the new amendment . " our communist party is the last totalitarian , not reformed communist party in central europe , " he said .
" and we want to change it like in hungary , like in poland and other countries .

unlike in most former eastern bloc countries , the czech republic 's communists did not transform themselves into a modern left-wing party after the fall of the iron curtain .
now , a campaign is on to outlaw them . maintaining their old name and symbols has not hindered the communists ; in fact , they enjoy the support of almost 20 percent of czech voters and have slowly acquired legitimacy . but not everyone is prepared to sit back and watch the communists go from strength to strength : a new campaign wants to make the propagation of communism illegal . " let 's ban the communists , " is the cry at a demonstration on prague 's old town square , in front of the very balcony where communist leader klement gottwald announced that the party had taken power in 1948 .
now , over 15 years after they were swept from power , a campaign has been launched to make the propagation of communism - like nazism - punishable by up to five years in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of demonstrators in prague helped bring about the fall of communism during the " velvet revolution " of 1989 " what we would like to achieve in fact is to change the focus onto the fact that the communist party never accepted responsibility for the things that happened during the 40 years of communism in this country , " said simon panek , one of the organizers of the campaign and a student leader in 1989 .
" visibly we are asking for the banning of the communist party name and symbols - the same as nazi symbols - because for us these are the symbols of a dictatorship which maybe was less hard in the short term , but the impact of communism was devastating as well . " adapting to a changed reality forcing the czech communist party to adapt to the new system as have others in eastern europe was the reason behind the campaign , said czech senator jaroslav stetina , one of the authors of the new amendment . " our communist party is the last totalitarian , not reformed communist party in central europe , " he said .
" and we want to change it like in hungary , like in poland and other countries . " but even some of those who suffered under the communist regime oppose the ban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 20,000 people stand around st.wenceslas statue , to support a declaration of student leaders of the 1989 velvet revolution , calling on top czech politicians to resign " now it 's too late , " said czech interior minister frantisek bublan , who for years was forced to take menial jobs .
" this campaign should have started 15 years ago , when there was more political will .
if the communist party had been banned after the velvet revolution -lrb- of 1989 -rrb- , its members would have just transformed themselves .
but at least now we would n't have communist symbols or that name .
this new campaign is basically a lot of hullabaloo ; banning the party now would be unconstitutional and it would n't achieve anything positive . " havel 's mistake ? whether the communists should have been banned in the immediate aftermath of the revolution has always been a bone of contention .

german foreign minister fischer , engulfed in a tourist visa row , saw first-hand the vast number of people flocking to the country 's embassy in ukraine years ago , according to a newspaper report . the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said that fischer had witnessed during a visit to kiev in june 2000 how the german embassy there was overwhelmed by people seeking travel visas . " my goodness , did they all come to see me ? " he joked at the time , according to the respected weekly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german embassy in kiev fischer has been accused of indirectly allowing thousands of clandestine immigrants from the former soviet bloc - ukraine in particular - to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed . the allegations , by the conservative opposition , include claims that his lack of vigilance fostered organized crime , a submerged economy and prostitution . fischer , the country 's most popular politician until the scandal broke , has acknowledged making mistakes but has refused to resign .
he has also received the backing of chancellor gerhard schröder . foreign ministry spokesman walter lindner confirmed fischer 's visit to the kiev embassy but said that it was only to examine staffing issues . " there was no question about the misuse of visas , " lindner said .
the german foreign ministry has until now insisted that fischer only got wind of the visa abuse affair much later . but fischer did order an increase in visa-issuing staff on his return , the newspaper said , which led to the fact that the number of german visas issued by the embassy in kiev between 1999 and 2001 almost doubled to 300,000 . fischer considered stepping down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer " i 've made mistakes , " fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- told a cologne meeting of his party , the greens , junior members of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrat-led government coalition , at the end of last month .
" i did not react with sufficient speed or firmness , or fully enough as the responsible minister , " he said . in an interview with saturday 's frankfurter rundschau , fischer , who is also deputy chancellor , said that he had considered stepping down over the affair .
" it 's a question that i put to myself , myself and others , " he said .
" and when i look at that on balance , taking into account the foreign and domestic political challenges facing us , i arrived at the conclusion : i will stay on . " germany 's conservative opposition has seized upon the latest allegations as further proof that fischer turned a blind eye to the unfolding abuse in his own department . " it 's very obvious now that fischer 's earlier confession that he did n't have anything to do with the visa policies is simply not true , " wolfgang schäuble , a christian democrat told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .

german foreign minister fischer , engulfed in a tourist visa row , saw first-hand the vast number of people flocking to the country 's embassy in ukraine years ago , according to a newspaper report . the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said that fischer had witnessed during a visit to kiev in june 2000 how the german embassy there was overwhelmed by people seeking travel visas . " my goodness , did they all come to see me ? " he joked at the time , according to the respected weekly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german embassy in kiev fischer has been accused of indirectly allowing thousands of clandestine immigrants from the former soviet bloc - ukraine in particular - to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed . the allegations , by the conservative opposition , include claims that his lack of vigilance fostered organized crime , a submerged economy and prostitution . fischer , the country 's most popular politician until the scandal broke , has acknowledged making mistakes but has refused to resign .

unlike in most former eastern bloc countries , the czech republic 's communists did not transform themselves into a modern left-wing party after the fall of the iron curtain .
now , a campaign is on to outlaw them . maintaining their old name and symbols has not hindered the communists ; in fact , they enjoy the support of almost 20 percent of czech voters and have slowly acquired legitimacy . but not everyone is prepared to sit back and watch the communists go from strength to strength : a new campaign wants to make the propagation of communism illegal . " let 's ban the communists , " is the cry at a demonstration on prague 's old town square , in front of the very balcony where communist leader klement gottwald announced that the party had taken power in 1948 .
now , over 15 years after they were swept from power , a campaign has been launched to make the propagation of communism - like nazism - punishable by up to five years in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of demonstrators in prague helped bring about the fall of communism during the " velvet revolution " of 1989 " what we would like to achieve in fact is to change the focus onto the fact that the communist party never accepted responsibility for the things that happened during the 40 years of communism in this country , " said simon panek , one of the organizers of the campaign and a student leader in 1989 .
" visibly we are asking for the banning of the communist party name and symbols - the same as nazi symbols - because for us these are the symbols of a dictatorship which maybe was less hard in the short term , but the impact of communism was devastating as well . " adapting to a changed reality forcing the czech communist party to adapt to the new system as have others in eastern europe was the reason behind the campaign , said czech senator jaroslav stetina , one of the authors of the new amendment . " our communist party is the last totalitarian , not reformed communist party in central europe , " he said .
" and we want to change it like in hungary , like in poland and other countries . " but even some of those who suffered under the communist regime oppose the ban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 20,000 people stand around st.wenceslas statue , to support a declaration of student leaders of the 1989 velvet revolution , calling on top czech politicians to resign " now it 's too late , " said czech interior minister frantisek bublan , who for years was forced to take menial jobs .
" this campaign should have started 15 years ago , when there was more political will .
if the communist party had been banned after the velvet revolution -lrb- of 1989 -rrb- , its members would have just transformed themselves .
but at least now we would n't have communist symbols or that name .
this new campaign is basically a lot of hullabaloo ; banning the party now would be unconstitutional and it would n't achieve anything positive . " havel 's mistake ? whether the communists should have been banned in the immediate aftermath of the revolution has always been a bone of contention .
at the time , democracy leader vaclav havel opted for a more practical , conciliatory approach . milan paulmer , who fled communist czechoslovakia , said havel - as the first post-1989 president - should have banned the party immediately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former czech president vaclav havel , right , and his wife dagmar " i think president havel should have done that , " he said .
" he should n't have had so many people around him who were in government during the communist system .
if he had had over there some new blood or some democratically oriented people , it could have been done at that time . " but is n't it to late now ? “ it 's never too late , " paulmer said .
" it will be a little harder but i think it 's not too late . " communists outraged but miloslav ransdorf , a leading member of the communist party , said he was outraged by any attempts to equate communism and nazism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miloslav ransdorf -lrb- far left -rrb- during a meeting to prepare the founding of a united european left party in berlin in 2004 " it is an offensive , offensive argument , " said ransdorf , who is deputy chairman of the united left grouping at the european parliament .
" this comparison can not be valid .
you know from history that communism and nazism were opposite political concepts .
in the struggle against fascism , nazism a third of the members of the communist party in the past died .

unlike in most former eastern bloc countries , the czech republic 's communists did not transform themselves into a modern left-wing party after the fall of the iron curtain .
now , a campaign is on to outlaw them . maintaining their old name and symbols has not hindered the communists ; in fact , they enjoy the support of almost 20 percent of czech voters and have slowly acquired legitimacy . but not everyone is prepared to sit back and watch the communists go from strength to strength : a new campaign wants to make the propagation of communism illegal . " let 's ban the communists , " is the cry at a demonstration on prague 's old town square , in front of the very balcony where communist leader klement gottwald announced that the party had taken power in 1948 .
now , over 15 years after they were swept from power , a campaign has been launched to make the propagation of communism - like nazism - punishable by up to five years in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of demonstrators in prague helped bring about the fall of communism during the " velvet revolution " of 1989 " what we would like to achieve in fact is to change the focus onto the fact that the communist party never accepted responsibility for the things that happened during the 40 years of communism in this country , " said simon panek , one of the organizers of the campaign and a student leader in 1989 .
" visibly we are asking for the banning of the communist party name and symbols - the same as nazi symbols - because for us these are the symbols of a dictatorship which maybe was less hard in the short term , but the impact of communism was devastating as well . " adapting to a changed reality forcing the czech communist party to adapt to the new system as have others in eastern europe was the reason behind the campaign , said czech senator jaroslav stetina , one of the authors of the new amendment . " our communist party is the last totalitarian , not reformed communist party in central europe , " he said .
" and we want to change it like in hungary , like in poland and other countries . " but even some of those who suffered under the communist regime oppose the ban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 20,000 people stand around st.wenceslas statue , to support a declaration of student leaders of the 1989 velvet revolution , calling on top czech politicians to resign " now it 's too late , " said czech interior minister frantisek bublan , who for years was forced to take menial jobs .
" this campaign should have started 15 years ago , when there was more political will .
if the communist party had been banned after the velvet revolution -lrb- of 1989 -rrb- , its members would have just transformed themselves .
but at least now we would n't have communist symbols or that name .
this new campaign is basically a lot of hullabaloo ; banning the party now would be unconstitutional and it would n't achieve anything positive . " havel 's mistake ? whether the communists should have been banned in the immediate aftermath of the revolution has always been a bone of contention .
at the time , democracy leader vaclav havel opted for a more practical , conciliatory approach . milan paulmer , who fled communist czechoslovakia , said havel - as the first post-1989 president - should have banned the party immediately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former czech president vaclav havel , right , and his wife dagmar " i think president havel should have done that , " he said .
" he should n't have had so many people around him who were in government during the communist system .
if he had had over there some new blood or some democratically oriented people , it could have been done at that time . " but is n't it to late now ? “ it 's never too late , " paulmer said .
" it will be a little harder but i think it 's not too late . " communists outraged but miloslav ransdorf , a leading member of the communist party , said he was outraged by any attempts to equate communism and nazism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miloslav ransdorf -lrb- far left -rrb- during a meeting to prepare the founding of a united european left party in berlin in 2004 " it is an offensive , offensive argument , " said ransdorf , who is deputy chairman of the united left grouping at the european parliament .

unlike in most former eastern bloc countries , the czech republic 's communists did not transform themselves into a modern left-wing party after the fall of the iron curtain .
now , a campaign is on to outlaw them . maintaining their old name and symbols has not hindered the communists ; in fact , they enjoy the support of almost 20 percent of czech voters and have slowly acquired legitimacy . but not everyone is prepared to sit back and watch the communists go from strength to strength : a new campaign wants to make the propagation of communism illegal . " let 's ban the communists , " is the cry at a demonstration on prague 's old town square , in front of the very balcony where communist leader klement gottwald announced that the party had taken power in 1948 .
now , over 15 years after they were swept from power , a campaign has been launched to make the propagation of communism - like nazism - punishable by up to five years in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of demonstrators in prague helped bring about the fall of communism during the " velvet revolution " of 1989 " what we would like to achieve in fact is to change the focus onto the fact that the communist party never accepted responsibility for the things that happened during the 40 years of communism in this country , " said simon panek , one of the organizers of the campaign and a student leader in 1989 .
" visibly we are asking for the banning of the communist party name and symbols - the same as nazi symbols - because for us these are the symbols of a dictatorship which maybe was less hard in the short term , but the impact of communism was devastating as well . " adapting to a changed reality forcing the czech communist party to adapt to the new system as have others in eastern europe was the reason behind the campaign , said czech senator jaroslav stetina , one of the authors of the new amendment . " our communist party is the last totalitarian , not reformed communist party in central europe , " he said .
" and we want to change it like in hungary , like in poland and other countries . " but even some of those who suffered under the communist regime oppose the ban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 20,000 people stand around st.wenceslas statue , to support a declaration of student leaders of the 1989 velvet revolution , calling on top czech politicians to resign " now it 's too late , " said czech interior minister frantisek bublan , who for years was forced to take menial jobs .
" this campaign should have started 15 years ago , when there was more political will .
if the communist party had been banned after the velvet revolution -lrb- of 1989 -rrb- , its members would have just transformed themselves .
but at least now we would n't have communist symbols or that name .
this new campaign is basically a lot of hullabaloo ; banning the party now would be unconstitutional and it would n't achieve anything positive . " havel 's mistake ? whether the communists should have been banned in the immediate aftermath of the revolution has always been a bone of contention .
at the time , democracy leader vaclav havel opted for a more practical , conciliatory approach . milan paulmer , who fled communist czechoslovakia , said havel - as the first post-1989 president - should have banned the party immediately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former czech president vaclav havel , right , and his wife dagmar " i think president havel should have done that , " he said .

if he had had over there some new blood or some democratically oriented people , it could have been done at that time . " but is n't it to late now ? “ it 's never too late , " paulmer said .
" it will be a little harder but i think it 's not too late .

german foreign minister fischer , engulfed in a tourist visa row , saw first-hand the vast number of people flocking to the country 's embassy in ukraine years ago , according to a newspaper report . the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said that fischer had witnessed during a visit to kiev in june 2000 how the german embassy there was overwhelmed by people seeking travel visas . " my goodness , did they all come to see me ? " he joked at the time , according to the respected weekly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german embassy in kiev fischer has been accused of indirectly allowing thousands of clandestine immigrants from the former soviet bloc - ukraine in particular - to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed . the allegations , by the conservative opposition , include claims that his lack of vigilance fostered organized crime , a submerged economy and prostitution . fischer , the country 's most popular politician until the scandal broke , has acknowledged making mistakes but has refused to resign .
he has also received the backing of chancellor gerhard schröder . foreign ministry spokesman walter lindner confirmed fischer 's visit to the kiev embassy but said that it was only to examine staffing issues . " there was no question about the misuse of visas , " lindner said .
the german foreign ministry has until now insisted that fischer only got wind of the visa abuse affair much later . but fischer did order an increase in visa-issuing staff on his return , the newspaper said , which led to the fact that the number of german visas issued by the embassy in kiev between 1999 and 2001 almost doubled to 300,000 . fischer considered stepping down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer " i 've made mistakes , " fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- told a cologne meeting of his party , the greens , junior members of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrat-led government coalition , at the end of last month .
" i did not react with sufficient speed or firmness , or fully enough as the responsible minister , " he said . in an interview with saturday 's frankfurter rundschau , fischer , who is also deputy chancellor , said that he had considered stepping down over the affair .
" it 's a question that i put to myself , myself and others , " he said .
" and when i look at that on balance , taking into account the foreign and domestic political challenges facing us , i arrived at the conclusion : i will stay on . " germany 's conservative opposition has seized upon the latest allegations as further proof that fischer turned a blind eye to the unfolding abuse in his own department . " it 's very obvious now that fischer 's earlier confession that he did n't have anything to do with the visa policies is simply not true , " wolfgang schäuble , a christian democrat told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.03.2005 czechs mull communist party ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the sun setting for communist symbols in the czech republic ?
unlike in most former eastern bloc countries , the czech republic 's communists did not transform themselves into a modern left-wing party after the fall of the iron curtain .
now , a campaign is on to outlaw them . maintaining their old name and symbols has not hindered the communists ; in fact , they enjoy the support of almost 20 percent of czech voters and have slowly acquired legitimacy . but not everyone is prepared to sit back and watch the communists go from strength to strength : a new campaign wants to make the propagation of communism illegal . " let 's ban the communists , " is the cry at a demonstration on prague 's old town square , in front of the very balcony where communist leader klement gottwald announced that the party had taken power in 1948 .
now , over 15 years after they were swept from power , a campaign has been launched to make the propagation of communism - like nazism - punishable by up to five years in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of demonstrators in prague helped bring about the fall of communism during the " velvet revolution " of 1989 " what we would like to achieve in fact is to change the focus onto the fact that the communist party never accepted responsibility for the things that happened during the 40 years of communism in this country , " said simon panek , one of the organizers of the campaign and a student leader in 1989 .
" visibly we are asking for the banning of the communist party name and symbols - the same as nazi symbols - because for us these are the symbols of a dictatorship which maybe was less hard in the short term , but the impact of communism was devastating as well . " adapting to a changed reality forcing the czech communist party to adapt to the new system as have others in eastern europe was the reason behind the campaign , said czech senator jaroslav stetina , one of the authors of the new amendment . " our communist party is the last totalitarian , not reformed communist party in central europe , " he said .
" and we want to change it like in hungary , like in poland and other countries . " but even some of those who suffered under the communist regime oppose the ban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 20,000 people stand around st.wenceslas statue , to support a declaration of student leaders of the 1989 velvet revolution , calling on top czech politicians to resign " now it 's too late , " said czech interior minister frantisek bublan , who for years was forced to take menial jobs .
" this campaign should have started 15 years ago , when there was more political will .
if the communist party had been banned after the velvet revolution -lrb- of 1989 -rrb- , its members would have just transformed themselves .
but at least now we would n't have communist symbols or that name .
this new campaign is basically a lot of hullabaloo ; banning the party now would be unconstitutional and it would n't achieve anything positive . " havel 's mistake ? whether the communists should have been banned in the immediate aftermath of the revolution has always been a bone of contention .
at the time , democracy leader vaclav havel opted for a more practical , conciliatory approach . milan paulmer , who fled communist czechoslovakia , said havel - as the first post-1989 president - should have banned the party immediately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former czech president vaclav havel , right , and his wife dagmar " i think president havel should have done that , " he said .
" he should n't have had so many people around him who were in government during the communist system .
if he had had over there some new blood or some democratically oriented people , it could have been done at that time . " but is n't it to late now ? “ it 's never too late , " paulmer said .
" it will be a little harder but i think it 's not too late . " communists outraged but miloslav ransdorf , a leading member of the communist party , said he was outraged by any attempts to equate communism and nazism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miloslav ransdorf -lrb- far left -rrb- during a meeting to prepare the founding of a united european left party in berlin in 2004 " it is an offensive , offensive argument , " said ransdorf , who is deputy chairman of the united left grouping at the european parliament .
" this comparison can not be valid .
you know from history that communism and nazism were opposite political concepts .
in the struggle against fascism , nazism a third of the members of the communist party in the past died .
so for us it is something incredible . ” the majority of czechs have so far reacted with indifference .
and given the fact no major political parties have backed the ban , debate on the issue looks likely to remain in the realm of the symbolic . ian willoughby -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czech velvet revolution lives on fifteen years after the velvet revolution of november 1989 rid their country of communist dictatorship , czech students are still demonstrating against the ghosts of the past , whose influence has far from disappeared .

german foreign minister fischer , engulfed in a tourist visa row , saw first-hand the vast number of people flocking to the country 's embassy in ukraine years ago , according to a newspaper report . the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said that fischer had witnessed during a visit to kiev in june 2000 how the german embassy there was overwhelmed by people seeking travel visas . " my goodness , did they all come to see me ? " he joked at the time , according to the respected weekly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german embassy in kiev fischer has been accused of indirectly allowing thousands of clandestine immigrants from the former soviet bloc - ukraine in particular - to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed . the allegations , by the conservative opposition , include claims that his lack of vigilance fostered organized crime , a submerged economy and prostitution . fischer , the country 's most popular politician until the scandal broke , has acknowledged making mistakes but has refused to resign .
he has also received the backing of chancellor gerhard schröder . foreign ministry spokesman walter lindner confirmed fischer 's visit to the kiev embassy but said that it was only to examine staffing issues . " there was no question about the misuse of visas , " lindner said .
the german foreign ministry has until now insisted that fischer only got wind of the visa abuse affair much later . but fischer did order an increase in visa-issuing staff on his return , the newspaper said , which led to the fact that the number of german visas issued by the embassy in kiev between 1999 and 2001 almost doubled to 300,000 . fischer considered stepping down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer " i 've made mistakes , " fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- told a cologne meeting of his party , the greens , junior members of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrat-led government coalition , at the end of last month .
" i did not react with sufficient speed or firmness , or fully enough as the responsible minister , " he said . in an interview with saturday 's frankfurter rundschau , fischer , who is also deputy chancellor , said that he had considered stepping down over the affair .
" it 's a question that i put to myself , myself and others , " he said .
" and when i look at that on balance , taking into account the foreign and domestic political challenges facing us , i arrived at the conclusion : i will stay on . " germany 's conservative opposition has seized upon the latest allegations as further proof that fischer turned a blind eye to the unfolding abuse in his own department . " it 's very obvious now that fischer 's earlier confession that he did n't have anything to do with the visa policies is simply not true , " wolfgang schäuble , a christian democrat told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.03.2005 czechs mull communist party ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the sun setting for communist symbols in the czech republic ?
unlike in most former eastern bloc countries , the czech republic 's communists did not transform themselves into a modern left-wing party after the fall of the iron curtain .
now , a campaign is on to outlaw them . maintaining their old name and symbols has not hindered the communists ; in fact , they enjoy the support of almost 20 percent of czech voters and have slowly acquired legitimacy . but not everyone is prepared to sit back and watch the communists go from strength to strength : a new campaign wants to make the propagation of communism illegal . " let 's ban the communists , " is the cry at a demonstration on prague 's old town square , in front of the very balcony where communist leader klement gottwald announced that the party had taken power in 1948 .
now , over 15 years after they were swept from power , a campaign has been launched to make the propagation of communism - like nazism - punishable by up to five years in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of demonstrators in prague helped bring about the fall of communism during the " velvet revolution " of 1989 " what we would like to achieve in fact is to change the focus onto the fact that the communist party never accepted responsibility for the things that happened during the 40 years of communism in this country , " said simon panek , one of the organizers of the campaign and a student leader in 1989 .
" visibly we are asking for the banning of the communist party name and symbols - the same as nazi symbols - because for us these are the symbols of a dictatorship which maybe was less hard in the short term , but the impact of communism was devastating as well . " adapting to a changed reality forcing the czech communist party to adapt to the new system as have others in eastern europe was the reason behind the campaign , said czech senator jaroslav stetina , one of the authors of the new amendment . " our communist party is the last totalitarian , not reformed communist party in central europe , " he said .
" and we want to change it like in hungary , like in poland and other countries . " but even some of those who suffered under the communist regime oppose the ban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 20,000 people stand around st.wenceslas statue , to support a declaration of student leaders of the 1989 velvet revolution , calling on top czech politicians to resign " now it 's too late , " said czech interior minister frantisek bublan , who for years was forced to take menial jobs .
" this campaign should have started 15 years ago , when there was more political will .
if the communist party had been banned after the velvet revolution -lrb- of 1989 -rrb- , its members would have just transformed themselves .
but at least now we would n't have communist symbols or that name .
this new campaign is basically a lot of hullabaloo ; banning the party now would be unconstitutional and it would n't achieve anything positive . " havel 's mistake ? whether the communists should have been banned in the immediate aftermath of the revolution has always been a bone of contention .
at the time , democracy leader vaclav havel opted for a more practical , conciliatory approach . milan paulmer , who fled communist czechoslovakia , said havel - as the first post-1989 president - should have banned the party immediately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former czech president vaclav havel , right , and his wife dagmar " i think president havel should have done that , " he said .
" he should n't have had so many people around him who were in government during the communist system .

unlike in most former eastern bloc countries , the czech republic 's communists did not transform themselves into a modern left-wing party after the fall of the iron curtain .
now , a campaign is on to outlaw them . maintaining their old name and symbols has not hindered the communists ; in fact , they enjoy the support of almost 20 percent of czech voters and have slowly acquired legitimacy . but not everyone is prepared to sit back and watch the communists go from strength to strength : a new campaign wants to make the propagation of communism illegal . " let 's ban the communists , " is the cry at a demonstration on prague 's old town square , in front of the very balcony where communist leader klement gottwald announced that the party had taken power in 1948 .
now , over 15 years after they were swept from power , a campaign has been launched to make the propagation of communism - like nazism - punishable by up to five years in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of demonstrators in prague helped bring about the fall of communism during the " velvet revolution " of 1989 " what we would like to achieve in fact is to change the focus onto the fact that the communist party never accepted responsibility for the things that happened during the 40 years of communism in this country , " said simon panek , one of the organizers of the campaign and a student leader in 1989 .
" visibly we are asking for the banning of the communist party name and symbols - the same as nazi symbols - because for us these are the symbols of a dictatorship which maybe was less hard in the short term , but the impact of communism was devastating as well . " adapting to a changed reality forcing the czech communist party to adapt to the new system as have others in eastern europe was the reason behind the campaign , said czech senator jaroslav stetina , one of the authors of the new amendment . " our communist party is the last totalitarian , not reformed communist party in central europe , " he said .
" and we want to change it like in hungary , like in poland and other countries . " but even some of those who suffered under the communist regime oppose the ban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 20,000 people stand around st.wenceslas statue , to support a declaration of student leaders of the 1989 velvet revolution , calling on top czech politicians to resign " now it 's too late , " said czech interior minister frantisek bublan , who for years was forced to take menial jobs .
" this campaign should have started 15 years ago , when there was more political will .
if the communist party had been banned after the velvet revolution -lrb- of 1989 -rrb- , its members would have just transformed themselves .
but at least now we would n't have communist symbols or that name .
this new campaign is basically a lot of hullabaloo ; banning the party now would be unconstitutional and it would n't achieve anything positive . " havel 's mistake ? whether the communists should have been banned in the immediate aftermath of the revolution has always been a bone of contention .
at the time , democracy leader vaclav havel opted for a more practical , conciliatory approach . milan paulmer , who fled communist czechoslovakia , said havel - as the first post-1989 president - should have banned the party immediately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former czech president vaclav havel , right , and his wife dagmar " i think president havel should have done that , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 06.03.2005 czechs mull communist party ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the sun setting for communist symbols in the czech republic ?
unlike in most former eastern bloc countries , the czech republic 's communists did not transform themselves into a modern left-wing party after the fall of the iron curtain .
now , a campaign is on to outlaw them . maintaining their old name and symbols has not hindered the communists ; in fact , they enjoy the support of almost 20 percent of czech voters and have slowly acquired legitimacy . but not everyone is prepared to sit back and watch the communists go from strength to strength : a new campaign wants to make the propagation of communism illegal . " let 's ban the communists , " is the cry at a demonstration on prague 's old town square , in front of the very balcony where communist leader klement gottwald announced that the party had taken power in 1948 .
now , over 15 years after they were swept from power , a campaign has been launched to make the propagation of communism - like nazism - punishable by up to five years in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of demonstrators in prague helped bring about the fall of communism during the " velvet revolution " of 1989 " what we would like to achieve in fact is to change the focus onto the fact that the communist party never accepted responsibility for the things that happened during the 40 years of communism in this country , " said simon panek , one of the organizers of the campaign and a student leader in 1989 .
" visibly we are asking for the banning of the communist party name and symbols - the same as nazi symbols - because for us these are the symbols of a dictatorship which maybe was less hard in the short term , but the impact of communism was devastating as well . " adapting to a changed reality forcing the czech communist party to adapt to the new system as have others in eastern europe was the reason behind the campaign , said czech senator jaroslav stetina , one of the authors of the new amendment . " our communist party is the last totalitarian , not reformed communist party in central europe , " he said .
" and we want to change it like in hungary , like in poland and other countries . " but even some of those who suffered under the communist regime oppose the ban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 20,000 people stand around st.wenceslas statue , to support a declaration of student leaders of the 1989 velvet revolution , calling on top czech politicians to resign " now it 's too late , " said czech interior minister frantisek bublan , who for years was forced to take menial jobs .
" this campaign should have started 15 years ago , when there was more political will .
if the communist party had been banned after the velvet revolution -lrb- of 1989 -rrb- , its members would have just transformed themselves .
but at least now we would n't have communist symbols or that name .
this new campaign is basically a lot of hullabaloo ; banning the party now would be unconstitutional and it would n't achieve anything positive . " havel 's mistake ? whether the communists should have been banned in the immediate aftermath of the revolution has always been a bone of contention .
at the time , democracy leader vaclav havel opted for a more practical , conciliatory approach . milan paulmer , who fled communist czechoslovakia , said havel - as the first post-1989 president - should have banned the party immediately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former czech president vaclav havel , right , and his wife dagmar " i think president havel should have done that , " he said .
" he should n't have had so many people around him who were in government during the communist system .
if he had had over there some new blood or some democratically oriented people , it could have been done at that time . " but is n't it to late now ? “ it 's never too late , " paulmer said .
" it will be a little harder but i think it 's not too late . " communists outraged but miloslav ransdorf , a leading member of the communist party , said he was outraged by any attempts to equate communism and nazism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miloslav ransdorf -lrb- far left -rrb- during a meeting to prepare the founding of a united european left party in berlin in 2004 " it is an offensive , offensive argument , " said ransdorf , who is deputy chairman of the united left grouping at the european parliament .
" this comparison can not be valid .
you know from history that communism and nazism were opposite political concepts .
in the struggle against fascism , nazism a third of the members of the communist party in the past died .
so for us it is something incredible . ” the majority of czechs have so far reacted with indifference .
and given the fact no major political parties have backed the ban , debate on the issue looks likely to remain in the realm of the symbolic . ian willoughby -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czech velvet revolution lives on fifteen years after the velvet revolution of november 1989 rid their country of communist dictatorship , czech students are still demonstrating against the ghosts of the past , whose influence has far from disappeared .

german foreign minister fischer , engulfed in a tourist visa row , saw first-hand the vast number of people flocking to the country 's embassy in ukraine years ago , according to a newspaper report . the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said that fischer had witnessed during a visit to kiev in june 2000 how the german embassy there was overwhelmed by people seeking travel visas . " my goodness , did they all come to see me ? " he joked at the time , according to the respected weekly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german embassy in kiev fischer has been accused of indirectly allowing thousands of clandestine immigrants from the former soviet bloc - ukraine in particular - to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed . the allegations , by the conservative opposition , include claims that his lack of vigilance fostered organized crime , a submerged economy and prostitution . fischer , the country 's most popular politician until the scandal broke , has acknowledged making mistakes but has refused to resign .
he has also received the backing of chancellor gerhard schröder . foreign ministry spokesman walter lindner confirmed fischer 's visit to the kiev embassy but said that it was only to examine staffing issues . " there was no question about the misuse of visas , " lindner said .
the german foreign ministry has until now insisted that fischer only got wind of the visa abuse affair much later . but fischer did order an increase in visa-issuing staff on his return , the newspaper said , which led to the fact that the number of german visas issued by the embassy in kiev between 1999 and 2001 almost doubled to 300,000 . fischer considered stepping down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer " i 've made mistakes , " fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- told a cologne meeting of his party , the greens , junior members of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrat-led government coalition , at the end of last month .
" i did not react with sufficient speed or firmness , or fully enough as the responsible minister , " he said . in an interview with saturday 's frankfurter rundschau , fischer , who is also deputy chancellor , said that he had considered stepping down over the affair .
" it 's a question that i put to myself , myself and others , " he said .
" and when i look at that on balance , taking into account the foreign and domestic political challenges facing us , i arrived at the conclusion : i will stay on .

german foreign minister fischer , engulfed in a tourist visa row , saw first-hand the vast number of people flocking to the country 's embassy in ukraine years ago , according to a newspaper report . the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said that fischer had witnessed during a visit to kiev in june 2000 how the german embassy there was overwhelmed by people seeking travel visas . " my goodness , did they all come to see me ? " he joked at the time , according to the respected weekly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german embassy in kiev fischer has been accused of indirectly allowing thousands of clandestine immigrants from the former soviet bloc - ukraine in particular - to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed . the allegations , by the conservative opposition , include claims that his lack of vigilance fostered organized crime , a submerged economy and prostitution . fischer , the country 's most popular politician until the scandal broke , has acknowledged making mistakes but has refused to resign .
he has also received the backing of chancellor gerhard schröder . foreign ministry spokesman walter lindner confirmed fischer 's visit to the kiev embassy but said that it was only to examine staffing issues . " there was no question about the misuse of visas , " lindner said .
the german foreign ministry has until now insisted that fischer only got wind of the visa abuse affair much later . but fischer did order an increase in visa-issuing staff on his return , the newspaper said , which led to the fact that the number of german visas issued by the embassy in kiev between 1999 and 2001 almost doubled to 300,000 . fischer considered stepping down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer " i 've made mistakes , " fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- told a cologne meeting of his party , the greens , junior members of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrat-led government coalition , at the end of last month .
" i did not react with sufficient speed or firmness , or fully enough as the responsible minister , " he said . in an interview with saturday 's frankfurter rundschau , fischer , who is also deputy chancellor , said that he had considered stepping down over the affair .
" it 's a question that i put to myself , myself and others , " he said .
" and when i look at that on balance , taking into account the foreign and domestic political challenges facing us , i arrived at the conclusion : i will stay on .

german foreign minister fischer , engulfed in a tourist visa row , saw first-hand the vast number of people flocking to the country 's embassy in ukraine years ago , according to a newspaper report . the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said that fischer had witnessed during a visit to kiev in june 2000 how the german embassy there was overwhelmed by people seeking travel visas . " my goodness , did they all come to see me ? " he joked at the time , according to the respected weekly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german embassy in kiev fischer has been accused of indirectly allowing thousands of clandestine immigrants from the former soviet bloc - ukraine in particular - to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed . the allegations , by the conservative opposition , include claims that his lack of vigilance fostered organized crime , a submerged economy and prostitution . fischer , the country 's most popular politician until the scandal broke , has acknowledged making mistakes but has refused to resign .
he has also received the backing of chancellor gerhard schröder . foreign ministry spokesman walter lindner confirmed fischer 's visit to the kiev embassy but said that it was only to examine staffing issues . " there was no question about the misuse of visas , " lindner said .
the german foreign ministry has until now insisted that fischer only got wind of the visa abuse affair much later . but fischer did order an increase in visa-issuing staff on his return , the newspaper said , which led to the fact that the number of german visas issued by the embassy in kiev between 1999 and 2001 almost doubled to 300,000 . fischer considered stepping down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer " i 've made mistakes , " fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- told a cologne meeting of his party , the greens , junior members of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrat-led government coalition , at the end of last month .
" i did not react with sufficient speed or firmness , or fully enough as the responsible minister , " he said . in an interview with saturday 's frankfurter rundschau , fischer , who is also deputy chancellor , said that he had considered stepping down over the affair .
" it 's a question that i put to myself , myself and others , " he said .

unlike in most former eastern bloc countries , the czech republic 's communists did not transform themselves into a modern left-wing party after the fall of the iron curtain .
now , a campaign is on to outlaw them . maintaining their old name and symbols has not hindered the communists ; in fact , they enjoy the support of almost 20 percent of czech voters and have slowly acquired legitimacy . but not everyone is prepared to sit back and watch the communists go from strength to strength : a new campaign wants to make the propagation of communism illegal . " let 's ban the communists , " is the cry at a demonstration on prague 's old town square , in front of the very balcony where communist leader klement gottwald announced that the party had taken power in 1948 .
now , over 15 years after they were swept from power , a campaign has been launched to make the propagation of communism - like nazism - punishable by up to five years in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of demonstrators in prague helped bring about the fall of communism during the " velvet revolution " of 1989 " what we would like to achieve in fact is to change the focus onto the fact that the communist party never accepted responsibility for the things that happened during the 40 years of communism in this country , " said simon panek , one of the organizers of the campaign and a student leader in 1989 .
" visibly we are asking for the banning of the communist party name and symbols - the same as nazi symbols - because for us these are the symbols of a dictatorship which maybe was less hard in the short term , but the impact of communism was devastating as well . " adapting to a changed reality forcing the czech communist party to adapt to the new system as have others in eastern europe was the reason behind the campaign , said czech senator jaroslav stetina , one of the authors of the new amendment . " our communist party is the last totalitarian , not reformed communist party in central europe , " he said .
" and we want to change it like in hungary , like in poland and other countries . " but even some of those who suffered under the communist regime oppose the ban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 20,000 people stand around st.wenceslas statue , to support a declaration of student leaders of the 1989 velvet revolution , calling on top czech politicians to resign " now it 's too late , " said czech interior minister frantisek bublan , who for years was forced to take menial jobs .
" this campaign should have started 15 years ago , when there was more political will .
if the communist party had been banned after the velvet revolution -lrb- of 1989 -rrb- , its members would have just transformed themselves .
but at least now we would n't have communist symbols or that name .
this new campaign is basically a lot of hullabaloo ; banning the party now would be unconstitutional and it would n't achieve anything positive . " havel 's mistake ? whether the communists should have been banned in the immediate aftermath of the revolution has always been a bone of contention .
at the time , democracy leader vaclav havel opted for a more practical , conciliatory approach . milan paulmer , who fled communist czechoslovakia , said havel - as the first post-1989 president - should have banned the party immediately . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former czech president vaclav havel , right , and his wife dagmar " i think president havel should have done that , " he said .
" he should n't have had so many people around him who were in government during the communist system .
if he had had over there some new blood or some democratically oriented people , it could have been done at that time . " but is n't it to late now ? “ it 's never too late , " paulmer said .
" it will be a little harder but i think it 's not too late . " communists outraged but miloslav ransdorf , a leading member of the communist party , said he was outraged by any attempts to equate communism and nazism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miloslav ransdorf -lrb- far left -rrb- during a meeting to prepare the founding of a united european left party in berlin in 2004 " it is an offensive , offensive argument , " said ransdorf , who is deputy chairman of the united left grouping at the european parliament .
" this comparison can not be valid .
you know from history that communism and nazism were opposite political concepts .
in the struggle against fascism , nazism a third of the members of the communist party in the past died .
so for us it is something incredible . ” the majority of czechs have so far reacted with indifference .
and given the fact no major political parties have backed the ban , debate on the issue looks likely to remain in the realm of the symbolic . ian willoughby -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de czech velvet revolution lives on fifteen years after the velvet revolution of november 1989 rid their country of communist dictatorship , czech students are still demonstrating against the ghosts of the past , whose influence has far from disappeared .

unlike in most former eastern bloc countries , the czech republic 's communists did not transform themselves into a modern left-wing party after the fall of the iron curtain .
now , a campaign is on to outlaw them . maintaining their old name and symbols has not hindered the communists ; in fact , they enjoy the support of almost 20 percent of czech voters and have slowly acquired legitimacy . but not everyone is prepared to sit back and watch the communists go from strength to strength : a new campaign wants to make the propagation of communism illegal . " let 's ban the communists , " is the cry at a demonstration on prague 's old town square , in front of the very balcony where communist leader klement gottwald announced that the party had taken power in 1948 .
now , over 15 years after they were swept from power , a campaign has been launched to make the propagation of communism - like nazism - punishable by up to five years in prison . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of demonstrators in prague helped bring about the fall of communism during the " velvet revolution " of 1989 " what we would like to achieve in fact is to change the focus onto the fact that the communist party never accepted responsibility for the things that happened during the 40 years of communism in this country , " said simon panek , one of the organizers of the campaign and a student leader in 1989 .
" visibly we are asking for the banning of the communist party name and symbols - the same as nazi symbols - because for us these are the symbols of a dictatorship which maybe was less hard in the short term , but the impact of communism was devastating as well . " adapting to a changed reality forcing the czech communist party to adapt to the new system as have others in eastern europe was the reason behind the campaign , said czech senator jaroslav stetina , one of the authors of the new amendment . " our communist party is the last totalitarian , not reformed communist party in central europe , " he said .
" and we want to change it like in hungary , like in poland and other countries . " but even some of those who suffered under the communist regime oppose the ban . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an estimated 20,000 people stand around st.wenceslas statue , to support a declaration of student leaders of the 1989 velvet revolution , calling on top czech politicians to resign " now it 's too late , " said czech interior minister frantisek bublan , who for years was forced to take menial jobs .
" this campaign should have started 15 years ago , when there was more political will .
if the communist party had been banned after the velvet revolution -lrb- of 1989 -rrb- , its members would have just transformed themselves .
but at least now we would n't have communist symbols or that name .
this new campaign is basically a lot of hullabaloo ; banning the party now would be unconstitutional and it would n't achieve anything positive . " havel 's mistake ? whether the communists should have been banned in the immediate aftermath of the revolution has always been a bone of contention .

if he had had over there some new blood or some democratically oriented people , it could have been done at that time . " but is n't it to late now ? “ it 's never too late , " paulmer said .
" it will be a little harder but i think it 's not too late . " communists outraged but miloslav ransdorf , a leading member of the communist party , said he was outraged by any attempts to equate communism and nazism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miloslav ransdorf -lrb- far left -rrb- during a meeting to prepare the founding of a united european left party in berlin in 2004 " it is an offensive , offensive argument , " said ransdorf , who is deputy chairman of the united left grouping at the european parliament .

german foreign minister fischer , engulfed in a tourist visa row , saw first-hand the vast number of people flocking to the country 's embassy in ukraine years ago , according to a newspaper report . the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said that fischer had witnessed during a visit to kiev in june 2000 how the german embassy there was overwhelmed by people seeking travel visas . " my goodness , did they all come to see me ? " he joked at the time , according to the respected weekly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german embassy in kiev fischer has been accused of indirectly allowing thousands of clandestine immigrants from the former soviet bloc - ukraine in particular - to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed . the allegations , by the conservative opposition , include claims that his lack of vigilance fostered organized crime , a submerged economy and prostitution . fischer , the country 's most popular politician until the scandal broke , has acknowledged making mistakes but has refused to resign .
he has also received the backing of chancellor gerhard schröder . foreign ministry spokesman walter lindner confirmed fischer 's visit to the kiev embassy but said that it was only to examine staffing issues . " there was no question about the misuse of visas , " lindner said .
the german foreign ministry has until now insisted that fischer only got wind of the visa abuse affair much later . but fischer did order an increase in visa-issuing staff on his return , the newspaper said , which led to the fact that the number of german visas issued by the embassy in kiev between 1999 and 2001 almost doubled to 300,000 . fischer considered stepping down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer " i 've made mistakes , " fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- told a cologne meeting of his party , the greens , junior members of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrat-led government coalition , at the end of last month .
" i did not react with sufficient speed or firmness , or fully enough as the responsible minister , " he said . in an interview with saturday 's frankfurter rundschau , fischer , who is also deputy chancellor , said that he had considered stepping down over the affair .
" it 's a question that i put to myself , myself and others , " he said .
" and when i look at that on balance , taking into account the foreign and domestic political challenges facing us , i arrived at the conclusion : i will stay on . " germany 's conservative opposition has seized upon the latest allegations as further proof that fischer turned a blind eye to the unfolding abuse in his own department . " it 's very obvious now that fischer 's earlier confession that he did n't have anything to do with the visa policies is simply not true , " wolfgang schäuble , a christian democrat told the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .

the visit comes at a sensitive time when ukraine is at the center of an illegal immigration scandal in germany . it is yushchenko 's first official visit to germany since the " orange revolution " which forced out the pro-russian regime and carried the reformist liberal to power in the former soviet republic . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george w. bush , right , meets ukraine president viktor yushchenko at the nato meeting in brussels in february .
yushchenko begins his visit on tuesday and will meet chancellor gerhard schröder the following day when he will also be granted the rare honor of addressing the bundestag , the lower house of parliament , following in the footsteps of world leaders such as us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin . german business daily handelsblatt reported on thursday that former defense minister volker rühe from the german opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- had expressed reservations about a leader making a speech to the parliament so soon after taking office . but the government opted to give yushchenko a firm boost as a statesman with the offer , setting the tone for strong bilateral ties in the future .
yushchenko 's discussions with schröder will focus on german-ukrainian relations and ukraine 's ties with russia , the european union and the nato military alliance , a german government spokesman said . ukraine a test for schröder-putin relations schröder invited yushchenko to germany immediately after his victory in the re-run presidential election in late december and urged the new leader to steer the country on a " course towards democracy and a market economy under the rule of law " . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin -lrb- right -rrb- speaks with german chancellor gerhard schröder during their walk in the bocharov ruchei presidential residence in sochi at the black sea shore in aug .

the furor over the first ukrainian presidential election , which gave victory to the pro-russia candidate viktor yanukovich but was marred by widespread reports of regularities , was a severe test for schröder 's close relationship with putin . schröder telephoned putin twice during the crisis to encourage him to support a re-run of the poll .
putin had openly backed yanukovich in the first election . german foreign minister joschka fischer said the re-run ukrainian election " was a central principle of the new europe and the end of thinking in blocs " .
" the fallout from it will be widespread , " he said in an interview with the frankfurter rundschau newspaper on saturday . shadow on kiev-berlin ties yushchenko 's visit has added significance because ukraine is currently at the centre of a political scandal over illegal immigration in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer is under increasing pressure for his role in the visa affair .
fischer is under pressure to explain claims from the opposition that hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants from the former soviet bloc - especially ukraine - were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed . the opposition cdu says the revised system was exploited by organized crime groups and encouraged prostitution .

german foreign minister fischer , engulfed in a tourist visa row , saw first-hand the vast number of people flocking to the country 's embassy in ukraine years ago , according to a newspaper report . the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung said that fischer had witnessed during a visit to kiev in june 2000 how the german embassy there was overwhelmed by people seeking travel visas . " my goodness , did they all come to see me ? " he joked at the time , according to the respected weekly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german embassy in kiev fischer has been accused of indirectly allowing thousands of clandestine immigrants from the former soviet bloc - ukraine in particular - to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed . the allegations , by the conservative opposition , include claims that his lack of vigilance fostered organized crime , a submerged economy and prostitution . fischer , the country 's most popular politician until the scandal broke , has acknowledged making mistakes but has refused to resign .
he has also received the backing of chancellor gerhard schröder . foreign ministry spokesman walter lindner confirmed fischer 's visit to the kiev embassy but said that it was only to examine staffing issues . " there was no question about the misuse of visas , " lindner said .
the german foreign ministry has until now insisted that fischer only got wind of the visa abuse affair much later . but fischer did order an increase in visa-issuing staff on his return , the newspaper said , which led to the fact that the number of german visas issued by the embassy in kiev between 1999 and 2001 almost doubled to 300,000 . fischer considered stepping down bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer " i 've made mistakes , " fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- told a cologne meeting of his party , the greens , junior members of chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrat-led government coalition , at the end of last month .
" i did not react with sufficient speed or firmness , or fully enough as the responsible minister , " he said . in an interview with saturday 's frankfurter rundschau , fischer , who is also deputy chancellor , said that he had considered stepping down over the affair .
" it 's a question that i put to myself , myself and others , " he said .
" and when i look at that on balance , taking into account the foreign and domestic political challenges facing us , i arrived at the conclusion : i will stay on . " germany 's conservative opposition has seized upon the latest allegations as further proof that fischer turned a blind eye to the unfolding abuse in his own department .

lord george carey has urged people to " get behind " the happy couple .
he said the forthcoming marriage was good for the monarchy and set a good example to society at large .
" i think it 's good for the country because it 's important that at the heart of the monarchy we have stable relationships , " lord carey explained .
the former head of the church of england - who retired in 2002 - made his remarks on gmtv 's sunday programme as prince charles continued his tour of new zealand .
nose-to-nose the prince received a traditional maori nose-pressing welcome - or hongi - to the otago peninsula by the direct descendants of a chief who signed over governorship of new zealand to the british .
the great-great-great grandfather of maori brothers tawhiri and david karetai was one of the elders who signed the controversial 1840 treaty of waitangi when it came to the headland .
prince charles enjoyed his greeting at the royal albatross centre and went on to make an impassioned plea for the preservation of the birds he used to watch flying for days on end whilst he was at sea with the royal navy .
fulfilling a lifelong ambition , prince charles crouched within three feet of a mother and chick in a nest at the bird sanctuary at taiaroa head .
he suggested that if this majestic member of the albatross family were allowed to become extinct , " we would sacrifice any claim whatsoever to call ourselves civilised beings . "
" will it take the complete dodo-like disappearance of this noble creature to bring us to our sense ? " asked the heir to the british throne .
the migratory birds have a wingspan of three metres and can swoop at speeds of up to 114kph , but they are threatened by a loss of habitat and long line fishing , which is killing 100,000 a year .
the albatross centre on the windswept south island headland is the only mainland breeding colony in the world and human contact with the birds is limited .
an " ecstatic " prince spent 10 minutes at one of the four nests at taiaroa head observing a 20-year-old female northern royal albatross with her month-old chick .
after learning to fly , albatross chicks spend five years soaring over the world , resting only on water and will eventually settle with a partner for life .
pre-nuptial bliss earlier the prince had been reminded of his long-term love at a sunday morning service in dunedin , when younger members of the congregation presented him with framed drawings of himself and camilla .
the wedding with camilla parker bowles is set to take place at the guildhall in windsor - rather than in the grander windsor castle - on 8 april .
several dozen people greeted prince charles when he arrived in new zealand on saturday for his first visit to the commonwealth country in 11 years .
from dunedin airport , he was taken to a reception at corstorphine house , a nearby 19th century mansion .
prime minister helen clark , who wrote congratulating him on his engagement , will meet him during his five-day stay .
ms clark has previously said it is inevitable that new zealand will eventually become a republic , and that the commonwealth country needs to move into the 21st century .
the prince is due to fly out of the northern city of auckland on thursday , and will visit fiji on the last leg of his tour .

nose-to-nose the prince received a traditional maori nose-pressing welcome - or hongi - to the otago peninsula by the direct descendants of a chief who signed over governorship of new zealand to the british .
prince charles performs the hongi with the descendent of a maori chief the great-great-great grandfather of maori brothers tawhiri and david karetai was one of the elders who signed the controversial 1840 treaty of waitangi when it came to the headland .
prince charles enjoyed his greeting at the royal albatross centre and went on to make an impassioned plea for the preservation of the birds he used to watch flying for days on end whilst he was at sea with the royal navy .
fulfilling a lifelong ambition , prince charles crouched within three feet of a mother and chick in a nest at the bird sanctuary at taiaroa head .
he suggested that if this majestic member of the albatross family were allowed to become extinct , " we would sacrifice any claim whatsoever to call ourselves civilised beings . "
" will it take the complete dodo-like disappearance of this noble creature to bring us to our sense ? " asked the heir to the british throne .
the royal albatross spreads its three-metre wings the migratory birds have a wingspan of three metres and can swoop at speeds of up to 114kph , but they are threatened by a loss of habitat and long line fishing , which is killing 100,000 a year .
the albatross centre on the windswept south island headland is the only mainland breeding colony in the world and human contact with the birds is limited .
an " ecstatic " prince spent 10 minutes at one of the four nests at taiaroa head observing a 20-year-old female northern royal albatross with her month-old chick .
after learning to fly , albatross chicks spend five years soaring over the world , resting only on water and will eventually settle with a partner for life .
pre-nuptial bliss earlier the prince had been reminded of his long-term love at a sunday morning service in dunedin , when younger members of the congregation presented him with framed drawings of himself and camilla .
the wedding with camilla parker bowles is set to take place at the guildhall in windsor - rather than in the grander windsor castle - on 8 april .
several dozen people greeted prince charles when he arrived in new zealand on saturday for his first visit to the commonwealth country in 11 years .
from dunedin airport , he was taken to a reception at corstorphine house , a nearby 19th century mansion .
prime minister helen clark , who wrote congratulating him on his engagement , will meet him during his five-day stay .
ms clark has previously said it is inevitable that new zealand will eventually become a republic , and that the commonwealth country needs to move into the 21st century .
the prince is due to fly out of the northern city of auckland on thursday , and will visit fiji on the last leg of his tour .

he encountered angry scenes as he arrived at ninian park on saturday - just a day after his shock decision to sell the club 's captain .
" i have let the fans down , it is my responsibility and i intend to get us out of this problem , " he said .
the club is in financial turmoil , with debts approaching £ 30m .
supporters are worried that more players will have to be sold to keep it afloat , but mr hammam has insisted his club can overcome its financial crisis .
as fans demanded answers from him , he told them : " i feel i have promised certain things that i have not been able to honour at this point in time .
" i 'm personally shattered .
i have to continue fighting for this club until i have got them out of these problems . "
mounting debts forced the sale of captain graham kavanagh to wigan on friday , and fans fear that others may be sold .
mr hammam has not ruled out the possibility of selling more players but said he hoped he would not have to .
the club 's official accounts , released on saturday , showed it was almost £ 30m in debt .
later , as fans arrived for the clash with sheffield united , the game itself was just one of the things on their minds .
' no promises ' they wanted assurances that no more valuable players would be sold to ease the financial pressures .
speaking after a meeting with directors at ninian park on friday , mr hammam said : " i read today that a lot of players could be going - this is not the case .
" some might still go but we hope none go .
we do n't promise one way or another , " he added .
" we , the club and the fans , all have to stand together and we might have to accept to do very , very painful things indeed in the next few days or weeks , " mr hammam said .
auditors have been called in at the club , which is said to be £ 30m in debt .
ninian park players and staff have not been paid this month and it is believed the club 's total wage bill each month is near to £ 750,000 .
ironically the sale of the graham kavanagh comes less than 24 hours after the team 's manager said no player would be sold before saturday 's home game against sheffield united .
lennie lawrence is worried about further sales on friday , bluebirds manager lennie lawrence , also could not rule out more sales after kavanagh , who was cardiff 's first £ 1m purchase in 2001 and was a driving force in the club 's recent rise .
the republic of ireland international had been an integral part of what mr hammam insisted would be a march towards the premiership when they were promoted in 2003 .
mr hammam insists cardiff city 's future will be safe when work begins on the new stadium in july or august , but many cardiff fans have turned against the chairman they once regarded as the club 's saviour .
some fans have voiced deep concerns over the future of the championship side .
vince alm from cardiff city supporters club said : " we 've had some bad chairmen in the past - i 'm not going to name them - and bad times , but never as bad as this . "
but gwyn davies , spokesman for the valley rams supporters club , was more optimistic after meeting mr hammam on friday night .
he told radio wales on saturday : " i was absolutely distraught .
these are tough times , but i feel a lot better than i did yesterday .
" graham kavanagh going is a massive sacrifice , but put in the context of would we rather lose some of our young talent , you 've got to put it into perspective . "
further departures from cardiff could follow , say sports pundits .
nottingham forest have been linked with striker peter thorne , west ham are keen on wales defender james collins , while wing jobi mcanuff is another thought to be in demand .

" we , the club and the fans , all have to stand together and we might have to accept to do very , very painful things indeed in the next few days or weeks , " mr hammam said .
auditors have been called in at the club , which is said to be £ 30m in debt .
ninian park players and staff have not been paid this month and it is believed the club 's total wage bill each month is near to £ 750,000 .
ironically the sale of the graham kavanagh comes less than 24 hours after the team 's manager said no player would be sold before saturday 's home game against sheffield united .
lennie lawrence is worried about further sales on friday , bluebirds manager lennie lawrence , also could not rule out more sales after kavanagh , who was cardiff 's first £ 1m purchase in 2001 and was a driving force in the club 's recent rise .
the republic of ireland international had been an integral part of what mr hammam insisted would be a march towards the premiership when they were promoted in 2003 .
mr hammam insists cardiff city 's future will be safe when work begins on the new stadium in july or august , but many cardiff fans have turned against the chairman they once regarded as the club 's saviour .
some fans have voiced deep concerns over the future of the championship side .
vince alm from cardiff city supporters club said : " we 've had some bad chairmen in the past - i 'm not going to name them - and bad times , but never as bad as this . "
but gwyn davies , spokesman for the valley rams supporters club , was more optimistic after meeting mr hammam on friday night .
he told radio wales on saturday : " i was absolutely distraught .
these are tough times , but i feel a lot better than i did yesterday .
" graham kavanagh going is a massive sacrifice , but put in the context of would we rather lose some of our young talent , you 've got to put it into perspective . "
further departures from cardiff could follow , say sports pundits .
nottingham forest have been linked with striker peter thorne , west ham are keen on wales defender james collins , while wing jobi mcanuff is another thought to be in demand .

he encountered angry scenes as he arrived at ninian park on saturday - just a day after his shock decision to sell the club 's captain .
" i have let the fans down , it is my responsibility and i intend to get us out of this problem , " he said .
the club is in financial turmoil , with debts approaching £ 30m .
supporters are worried that more players will have to be sold to keep it afloat , but mr hammam has insisted his club can overcome its financial crisis .
as fans demanded answers from him , he told them : " i feel i have promised certain things that i have not been able to honour at this point in time .
" i 'm personally shattered .
i have to continue fighting for this club until i have got them out of these problems . "
mounting debts forced the sale of captain graham kavanagh to wigan on friday , and fans fear that others may be sold .
mr hammam has not ruled out the possibility of selling more players but said he hoped he would not have to .
the club 's official accounts , released on saturday , showed it was almost £ 30m in debt .
later , as fans arrived for the clash with sheffield united , the game itself was just one of the things on their minds .
' no promises ' they wanted assurances that no more valuable players would be sold to ease the financial pressures .
speaking after a meeting with directors at ninian park on friday , mr hammam said : " i read today that a lot of players could be going - this is not the case .
" some might still go but we hope none go .
we do n't promise one way or another , " he added .
" we , the club and the fans , all have to stand together and we might have to accept to do very , very painful things indeed in the next few days or weeks , " mr hammam said .

brian bull , who ran the monico in cardiff as well as screens in swansea , barry , and bargoed , was presented with the anthony hopkins award for 2005 .
he is the sixth recipient of the award , organised by sgrîn cymru wales .
sgrîn said mr bull had championed independent cinema and battled the rise of the new multiplexes before the monico closed for good two years ago .
mr bull fell in love with movies at an early age and in his teens ran a mobile cinema in his local village of talgarth , near brecon .
although best known for managing the monico , the last independent cinema in cardiff , he also played a part in building screen 2 at the city 's chapter arts centre .
" the award was a complete surprise .
independent cinemas were run for the love of cinema and that was always my motive , " he said .
" with the multiplexes there is no fun in it anymore . "
looking back to the 1970s and 1980s , when people queued around the block to see the big releases , he said the advent of multi-screen cinemas had brought about a decline in the quality of films and made it more difficult for smaller movies to find an audience .
" the longest run we had in cardiff was crocodile dundee , which played for 29 weeks .
that would never happen now .
" when a big film opens now , like the new star wars coming in may , the multiplexes will have four prints with showings every half hour .
" within three weeks everyone who wants to see will have done so and there will be no audience for it left .
" if a film is allowed to play for longer it gets time to build up a bit of a reputation .
" a lot of films these days are aimed at the 16 to 25 age group and they like the effects stuff . "
but he said they tended to only visit the cinema on weekends and the multiplexes should make a bigger effort to screen more adult films during the week .
as part of the award , presented at the chapter arts centre in front of mr bull 's friends , family and colleagues on friday , he received a framed caricature of hopkins .
the hollywood based welsh actor also sent a personal message of congratulations to mr bull .
" " it 's good to see that your hard work and devotion in running a series of cinemas across south wales has now been recognised , " said hopkins .

mr buffett made the comments in his widely-read annual letter to shareholders of his berkshire hathaway holding company .
he warned that the us trade deficit , which totalled $ 672bn -lrb- £ 484bn -rrb- last year , meant a knock-on over-reliance upon foreign investment into the us .
mr buffett said this foreign investment could become too dominant .
" other countries and their citizens now own a net of about $ 3,000bn of the us , " he said .
' sharecroppers ' using an analogy from the 1930s , mr buffett said this meant the us could be heading towards a " sharecropper 's society " , meaning that a great many americans could have to pay a large proportion of their future incomes to absent , and in this case foreign , landlords .
" but that 's precisely where our trade policies , supported by republicans and democrats alike , are taking us , " said mr buffett .
the billionaire also used his letter to attack large shareholders who lose sight of corporate governance issues .
" the moves made by institutions have been less than awe-inspiring , " he said .
" usually , they 've focused on minutiae and ignored the three questions that truly count .
" first , does the company have the right chief executive ?
second , is he / she over-reaching in terms of compensation ?
third , are proposed acquisitions more likely to create or destroy per-share value ? "
mr buffett also criticised his current performance at berkshire , describing it as " lacklustre " , saying he had n't made enough fresh investments this year .
however he did add that at present there were very few decent investment opportunities available .

herbie lyall , a former safety officer , has said that high level waste was washed down drains and a radioactive particle discovery was covered up .
dounreay is facing prosecution for releasing particles into the open .
site operators , the united kingdom atomic energy authority said there was no record of the particle find .
but it did concede that practices in previous decades were not as stringent as they are now .
this was people 's lives they were playing with .
they were acting like nuclear cowboys herbie lyall former safety officer speaking to the sunday times , mr lyall a health physics surveyor at the north coast plant for 30 years , branded his former employees " nuclear cowboys " .
in the last two decades more than 50 radioactive particles have been recovered from sandside beach , two miles west of the plant .
lat month the scottish environment protection agency -lrb- sepa -rrb- lodged a report with the procurator fiscal into the release of fragments of spent nuclear fuel from the reprocessing plant into the environment in the 1960s and 1970s .
mr lyall accused dounreay bosses of covering up the discovery of a radioactive particle on sandside beach , near the facility , in 1984 .
health concern he claimed high-level nuclear waste was washed down drains intended for low-level waste and that radioactive materials were handled without appropriate protection .
mr lyall , who was at dounreay from 1960 to 1989 , also alleged that effluent samples were collected for analysis using a wellington boot on a piece of string because sampling machinery was " a heap of rust " .
the ukaea insisted that the discovery of a particle on sandside was made public in 1984 and they could find no record to substantiate claims about a second find that year .
monitoring of radioactive particles has been stepped up however , mr lyall said he was a member of a survey team which found a particle on sandside which was not reported .
mr lyall had intended that his account should come to light after his death , but said continuing concerns about the health risks to the public had persuaded him to speak now .
" there have been so many lies said to con the public about dounreay that i fell i must put the record straight , " he told the paper .

they deserve execution , not prosecution .
the question in our minds is why mr lyall took 20 years after retiring to complain ukaea spokesman " this was people 's lives they were playing with .

a ukaea spokesman said the company had already spoken to mr lyall about his concerns .
he said : " it is absolutely true to say that , as with any industry , not all of the processes which were in place in the 1950s , 1960s and 1970s would be acceptable by today 's much more stringent standards .

herbie lyall , a former safety officer , has said that high level waste was washed down drains and a radioactive particle discovery was covered up .
dounreay is facing prosecution for releasing particles into the open .
site operators , the united kingdom atomic energy authority said there was no record of the particle find .
but it did concede that practices in previous decades were not as stringent as they are now .
this was people 's lives they were playing with .
they were acting like nuclear cowboys herbie lyall former safety officer speaking to the sunday times , mr lyall a health physics surveyor at the north coast plant for 30 years , branded his former employees " nuclear cowboys " .
in the last two decades more than 50 radioactive particles have been recovered from sandside beach , two miles west of the plant .
lat month the scottish environment protection agency -lrb- sepa -rrb- lodged a report with the procurator fiscal into the release of fragments of spent nuclear fuel from the reprocessing plant into the environment in the 1960s and 1970s .
mr lyall accused dounreay bosses of covering up the discovery of a radioactive particle on sandside beach , near the facility , in 1984 .
health concern he claimed high-level nuclear waste was washed down drains intended for low-level waste and that radioactive materials were handled without appropriate protection .
mr lyall , who was at dounreay from 1960 to 1989 , also alleged that effluent samples were collected for analysis using a wellington boot on a piece of string because sampling machinery was " a heap of rust " .
the ukaea insisted that the discovery of a particle on sandside was made public in 1984 and they could find no record to substantiate claims about a second find that year .
monitoring of radioactive particles has been stepped up however , mr lyall said he was a member of a survey team which found a particle on sandside which was not reported .
mr lyall had intended that his account should come to light after his death , but said continuing concerns about the health risks to the public had persuaded him to speak now .
" there have been so many lies said to con the public about dounreay that i fell i must put the record straight , " he told the paper .
" this contamination is a legacy being left for my children 's children .
it is an absolute disaster .
" they are talking about prosecuting these people .
they deserve execution , not prosecution .
the question in our minds is why mr lyall took 20 years after retiring to complain ukaea spokesman " this was people 's lives they were playing with .
they were acting like nuclear cowboys . "
a ukaea spokesman said the company had already spoken to mr lyall about his concerns .
he said : " it is absolutely true to say that , as with any industry , not all of the processes which were in place in the 1950s , 1960s and 1970s would be acceptable by today 's much more stringent standards .
" the question in our minds is why mr lyall took 20 years after retiring to complain . "
he added : " however , as regards the particle find in 1984 , one was discovered that year , it was reported to the scottish office and the regulators and made public .
" we spoke to former employees involved in surveying beaches at the time but found no information or record to substantiate claims of a further find that year . "

among the guests at the hotel jerome was actor johnny depp , who portrayed the journalist in the film fear and loathing in las vegas .
the outside of the hotel was decorated with pictures of thompson , who killed himself on 20 february aged 67 .
an eccentric figure , thompson fiercely guarded his private life in aspen .
" i think that 's why he lived here .
he did n't get tons of public exposure .
people had to come find him , " said aspen resident anna bugge .
thompson killed himself at his home in woody creek , colorado photographers and journalists were kept strictly away from the party , in keeping with thompson 's wishes .
inside , the hotel had been adorned with pictures of thompson , including an almost life-size black and white photo of him standing in front of the us flag .
pioneering writer at the doorway was a sign reading " thompson for sheriff " , a reference to his failed bid for office in 1970 .
it was reported he ran his election campaign from the bar at the hotel jerome .
actor john cusack was also at the aspen party , arriving with depp .
thompson 's widow , anita thompson , 32 , has said her husband was on the phone to her when she heard the " clicking of the gun " just before he shot himself .
the writer was later found dead by his son , juan .

for nearly 40 years , the force has run the north east 's regional police dog training centre from its base at harperley hall near crook .
in july the dogs will be made homeless by major re-development proposals for the hall .
the former country mansion , built in 1785 , was sold to durham police authority in 1947 .
insp paul gee , of the force 's training department , said : " we would appeal to any member of the public , particularly the farming community or people living in the countryside , to consider offering us help .
" we need to find a temporary base very quickly but we are also very interested in identifying a more permanent site . "
former factory the home office-approved centre , which enjoys an international reputation , is one of only a dozen in the uk .
the nine-strong team at harperley hall , which includes some of the country 's foremost experts , delivers training to up to 200 handlers and dogs every year .
it had been hoped to include a kennelling facility in a purpose-built public order training complex , planned within a former factory site about three miles south west of durham city .
but , while that project is pressing ahead , the proposal to include accommodation for more than 40 dogs has fallen through because of the site 's close proximity to housing .
