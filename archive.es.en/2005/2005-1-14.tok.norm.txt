" we are very pleased that all of the countries identified by the independent electoral commission of iraq have now agreed to support iraq 's out-of-country voting , allowing as many iraqis as possible to vote , " iom director , peter erben said .
tight security as part of the initiative , for two days at the end of january , the 56,000 iraqi citizens living in germany will be able to cast their ballot in four locations around the country .
security at the polling stations in the cities of berlin , cologne , munich and mannheim will be under tight security .
preparations are already underway at a former airfield in cologne , which will serve as one of the out-of-country voting locations .
in preparation for the event , the whole area has been cordoned off , several buildings have been searched and sealed by explosives experts .
they wo n't be opened again until jan .
17 , when both iraqi citizens and refugees who no longer have a passport , but have retained the right to citizenship will roll up to register as voters .
iraqis residing in nearby belgium will also be allowed to vote at the cologne polling station .
a climate of violence although there are less than 3,000 iraqi citizens resident in berlin , some 12,000 are expected to turn out to cast their ballot at the polling station in the german capital .
security there will be tight too , but a spokeswoman for the interior ministry said there was no concrete danger of attacks during the two days of elections in germany .
in light of the continuing violence in iraq , the european parliament has decided not to send observers to monitor the vote , despite a specific request to do so by the transitional government in baghdad .
in the first official voter turn-out , a member of the election committee in the iraqi capital said they were expecting to see fifty percent of the 15 million strong population cast their ballot .
" that 's not bad .
there are elections in europe with just 40 percent voter turn-out .

a federal court in germany has ruled that secret paternity tests are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit , as such tests hurt the personal rights of the child .
it was the right decision . it 's not the hens , but rather the roosters who 've been clucking and cackling for days now in the great german chicken run . but unfortunately humans do n't live like birds , since everything would be so much easier . either there 'd be a maximum of one rooster per henhouse , meaning paternity could be established without a doubt .
or else the hens would live among themselves .
this would rule out the hatching of any little chicks , but at least the question of paternity would be moot . but no , people are complicated .
and social debates in germany are even more complicated .
on the one hand , germans have been complaining for years about declining birth rates , and moaning that women today neither have the time nor the desire to have kids . on the other hand , those women that do become mothers are accused of being promiscuous and cuckolding their husbands by tricking them into supporting children that are not their own . what is a father ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the background to an essential question : what is a father ?
is he the man that a child grows up with , who shares in the responsibility and joy that comes with raising a child ?
or is a father the man who bears financial responsibility for a child , even against his will ?
we all know there are enough of those around . the number of single mothers supporting their children on welfare because the father wo n't pay - or wo n't pay enough - is rising from year to year .
it 's not without reason that children are often portrayed as a poverty risk in germany , not least because in the case of divorce , the cost of raising a child is mostly borne by just one parent , in most cases , the mother . the legal dispute also raises the question whether a parent 's love - in this case , a father 's love - is determined by genetics ?
does a man love his child only because it carries his genes ?
or does he love the child as a person ? those who answer the first question with " yes " would , by that logic , also have to be against every form of adoption , because , if that were the case , it would be impossible to love an adopted child . numbers impossible to prove there 's also the question of whether the numbers in this debate are correct - whether every fifth child in germany is , in fact , the child of an adulterous relationship .
there 's no real way to verify this - even the federal statistics office would have to pass . so are we really dealing with a modern myth , one that plays on age-old fears ?
men 's fear of being cheated on by their wives seems to have staying-power . but if the numbers are right , then they would imply that endless numbers of " faithful " husbands were fathering babies with women other than their wives .
for this reason alone , you 'd expect men to be a little calmer about the whole issue . calmness is also advisable , because the court 's verdict is , essentially , correct .
if genetic tests conducted without the consent of those affected were admissible in court , then the consequences of such male vanity would be more than widespread . in principle , every employer could then secretly carry out genetic tests on staff members , and make further employment dependent on their risk of illness . insurance firms would have the same right .
the nice insurance salesman who makes house calls to draw up contracts for his customers would only have to politely ask to use the toilet to collect dna samples for every member of the family .

a federal court in germany has ruled that secret paternity tests are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit , as such tests hurt the personal rights of the child .
it was the right decision . it 's not the hens , but rather the roosters who 've been clucking and cackling for days now in the great german chicken run . but unfortunately humans do n't live like birds , since everything would be so much easier . either there 'd be a maximum of one rooster per henhouse , meaning paternity could be established without a doubt .
or else the hens would live among themselves .
this would rule out the hatching of any little chicks , but at least the question of paternity would be moot . but no , people are complicated .
and social debates in germany are even more complicated .
on the one hand , germans have been complaining for years about declining birth rates , and moaning that women today neither have the time nor the desire to have kids . on the other hand , those women that do become mothers are accused of being promiscuous and cuckolding their husbands by tricking them into supporting children that are not their own . what is a father ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the background to an essential question : what is a father ?
is he the man that a child grows up with , who shares in the responsibility and joy that comes with raising a child ?
or is a father the man who bears financial responsibility for a child , even against his will ?
we all know there are enough of those around . the number of single mothers supporting their children on welfare because the father wo n't pay - or wo n't pay enough - is rising from year to year .
it 's not without reason that children are often portrayed as a poverty risk in germany , not least because in the case of divorce , the cost of raising a child is mostly borne by just one parent , in most cases , the mother . the legal dispute also raises the question whether a parent 's love - in this case , a father 's love - is determined by genetics ?
does a man love his child only because it carries his genes ?
or does he love the child as a person ? those who answer the first question with " yes " would , by that logic , also have to be against every form of adoption , because , if that were the case , it would be impossible to love an adopted child . numbers impossible to prove there 's also the question of whether the numbers in this debate are correct - whether every fifth child in germany is , in fact , the child of an adulterous relationship .
there 's no real way to verify this - even the federal statistics office would have to pass . so are we really dealing with a modern myth , one that plays on age-old fears ?
men 's fear of being cheated on by their wives seems to have staying-power . but if the numbers are right , then they would imply that endless numbers of " faithful " husbands were fathering babies with women other than their wives .
for this reason alone , you 'd expect men to be a little calmer about the whole issue . calmness is also advisable , because the court 's verdict is , essentially , correct .
if genetic tests conducted without the consent of those affected were admissible in court , then the consequences of such male vanity would be more than widespread . in principle , every employer could then secretly carry out genetic tests on staff members , and make further employment dependent on their risk of illness . insurance firms would have the same right .

21 condemning inconsistencies in eu customs rules , which are handled differently by different states in the 25-member bloc . lack of uniformity cited " consultations between the us and the eu were held in mid-november , but were unable to resolve the dispute , " said a statement by the us trade representative 's office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 10 eastern states joined the eu on may 1 .
" although the eu is a customs union , there is no single eu customs administration , " it added .
" lack of uniformity , coupled with lack of procedures for prompt eu-wide review , can hinder us exports , particularly for small to mid-size businesses . " wto rules require wto members to administer their customs laws in a uniform , impartial and reasonable manner .
they also require members to provide tribunals for prompt review and correction of administrative action relating to customs matters .
the united states considers that the eu fails to meet either of these requirements . " customs treatment is a longstanding us complaint , but the administration said it was acting now because 10 new members joined the european union on may 1 , 2004 . examining sugar subsidies meanwhile , the european union lodged an appeal on thursday against a wto ruling that branded subsidies for sugar production as illegal , an eu spokesman said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sugar " we have extremely solid foundations to allow our view to prevail in an appeal , " fabian delcros , a spokesman for the eu delegation to the wto , told afp . the eu 's move came one month after the three countries that filed the original complaint against the eu subsidies - australia , brazil and thailand - agreed to extend the deadline for an appeal , which had been due to expire in december . the wto dispute-settlement body had ruled last october that subsidized exports from the eu had been exceeding an agreed 1,273,000 ton-per-year export limit since 1995 . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to lift trade sanctions against us the eu commission acted monday to ease trade tensions with the united states , saying it would lift sanctions after us president george w. bush approved a repeal of illegal corporate tax breaks .

the mission hopes to help unravel the mystery of how life evolved on earth . it is in titan 's soupy nitrogen-heavy atmosphere that huygens will look for clues to uncover the earth 's chemical makeup from over four billion years ago .
the high-profile space exploration mission will also mark the first time an unmanned probe lands on an object in the outer solar system . once the 320-kilogram spacecraft breaks through the atmosphere , scientists at esa mission control in darmstadt , germany , will use its six specialized instruments to gather data .
however , esa can only guess what is waiting for huygens on the surface , which could be anything from icy rock to a boggy mush or even a sea of methane . " the excitement is growing – over seven years of work has gone into this moment , " gerhard schwehm , esa 's head of planetary science , told dw-world .

the mission hopes to help unravel the mystery of how life evolved on earth . it is in titan 's soupy nitrogen-heavy atmosphere that huygens will look for clues to uncover the earth 's chemical makeup from over four billion years ago .
the high-profile space exploration mission will also mark the first time an unmanned probe lands on an object in the outer solar system . once the 320-kilogram spacecraft breaks through the atmosphere , scientists at esa mission control in darmstadt , germany , will use its six specialized instruments to gather data .
however , esa can only guess what is waiting for huygens on the surface , which could be anything from icy rock to a boggy mush or even a sea of methane . " the excitement is growing – over seven years of work has gone into this moment , " gerhard schwehm , esa 's head of planetary science , told dw-world .
" titan is very special .
nobody knows exactly what we 'll find there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : purple haze is seen around the saturn moon titan on tuesday , oct .
26 , 2004 as the nasa / esa cassini-huygens spacecraft makes a fly-by of saturn 's largest moon - the closest ever performed .
the probe got its name from christiaan huygens , the dutch astronomer who discovered titan in 1655 .
larger than either mercury or pluto , the moon is the only one in the solar system to have a thick atmosphere .
it is thought to be home to chemical reactions and carbon-based compounds similar to ones found on earth before life existed . hitching a ride with nasa to get to titan , huygens hitched a ride on nasa 's cassini probe .
costing $ 3.2 billion -lrb- € 2.5 billion -rrb- , the two have hurtled toward saturn since their launch in october 1997 .
but the combined weight of cassini-huygens was more than any direct rocket flight could handle .
so in order to get to saturn , nasa sent the spacecraft on a 2.1-billion-kilometer -lrb- 1.3-billion-mile -rrb- journey , including two trips around venus and one each past the earth and jupiter to make use of the planets ' gravity for a slingshot effect . cassini-huygens reached saturn 's orbit last summer .
half a year later , the two finally parted ways as huygens separated and began its approach towards the planet 's moon on dec .

but the teamwork did n't end there , as the nasa craft will crucially relay any data collected by huygens back to mission control . " we 've had flybys before , but this is taking exploration to the next step , " schwehm said , explaining that huygens ' instruments would be looking for complex " pre-biotic " molecules as it enters titan 's atmosphere around 10 a.m.
cet on friday . a short stay but huygens will not enjoy a gentle end to its lengthy journey .
during its 140-minute descent by parachute , the probe is likely to be buffeted by strong winds and will face freezing temperatures plunging to -180 celsius .
if it even makes it to the surface intact , huygens will then begin to survey what titan is like on the ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of the huygens probe shortly after landing on titan .
the space probe is due to blast off for saturn and its mysterious cloud-covered moon titan monday october 13 1997 , from cape canaveral .
the cassini-huygens mission , a joint venture between nasa and the european space agency , is one of the most ambitious space exploration attempts ever undertaken .
however , esa expects the probe 's batteries will only survive for a matter of hours under the harsh conditions .
and regardless of how long huygens holds out , cassini will no longer be able to receive data from the surface once it disappears beyond the moon 's horizon . " we hope to get the first information around 2 p.m. , 3 p.m.

a majority of dw-world readers said he should publicly apologize for his behavior . a public apology from prince harry should include the following : his utter humility in making the declaration ; a candid display of understanding that his entire life is the exception of privacy legislation and that therefore he has no defense in the context of a private party ; a recognition that he has offended many good people and that a knowledge of history is not a disposable commodity but an essential element of democratic monarchies such as britain .
he should show the world that he understands why associating himself with the national socialist party is repugnant , why wearing its regalia is not without meaning beyond the confines of his socializing .
that said - it is worthwhile to note that so little has been explained why another member of the family would also be going to a " native and colonials " fancy dress party - which sounds somewhat racist to me .
but then , i 'm a canadian , and not so sophisticated . - david woodward , canada he should not merely visit auschwitz , he should undergo a few weeks of living like the prisoners at auschwitz .

a majority of dw-world readers said he should publicly apologize for his behavior . a public apology from prince harry should include the following : his utter humility in making the declaration ; a candid display of understanding that his entire life is the exception of privacy legislation and that therefore he has no defense in the context of a private party ; a recognition that he has offended many good people and that a knowledge of history is not a disposable commodity but an essential element of democratic monarchies such as britain .
he should show the world that he understands why associating himself with the national socialist party is repugnant , why wearing its regalia is not without meaning beyond the confines of his socializing .
that said - it is worthwhile to note that so little has been explained why another member of the family would also be going to a " native and colonials " fancy dress party - which sounds somewhat racist to me .
but then , i 'm a canadian , and not so sophisticated . - david woodward , canada he should not merely visit auschwitz , he should undergo a few weeks of living like the prisoners at auschwitz .
perhaps his life of privilege and excused childish behavior could be turned around by enduring some hardship .
harry 's apology is not enough ; he should face serious consequences for such hateful and insensitive behavior . - d. friberg , us it would be interesting to know some of the other costumes worn to this " native and colonial " party .
the british should not be too proud of how they treated the natives during colonial times .

regardless of his royal status , he should be punished according to the law of the land .
if he is spared from such " stupid " display , it is simply another excurse to protect him .
agree or not , he is still a human being , flesh and blood , and is not any better than other human being .
he should make apology in person if he is man enough .

a majority of dw-world readers said he should publicly apologize for his behavior . a public apology from prince harry should include the following : his utter humility in making the declaration ; a candid display of understanding that his entire life is the exception of privacy legislation and that therefore he has no defense in the context of a private party ; a recognition that he has offended many good people and that a knowledge of history is not a disposable commodity but an essential element of democratic monarchies such as britain .
he should show the world that he understands why associating himself with the national socialist party is repugnant , why wearing its regalia is not without meaning beyond the confines of his socializing .
that said - it is worthwhile to note that so little has been explained why another member of the family would also be going to a " native and colonials " fancy dress party - which sounds somewhat racist to me .
but then , i 'm a canadian , and not so sophisticated . - david woodward , canada he should not merely visit auschwitz , he should undergo a few weeks of living like the prisoners at auschwitz .
perhaps his life of privilege and excused childish behavior could be turned around by enduring some hardship .
harry 's apology is not enough ; he should face serious consequences for such hateful and insensitive behavior . - d. friberg , us it would be interesting to know some of the other costumes worn to this " native and colonial " party .
the british should not be too proud of how they treated the natives during colonial times .
yet , i did not hear any africans or indians complaining about this party theme or how they , doubtlessly , were ridiculed at this party .

regardless of his royal status , he should be punished according to the law of the land .
if he is spared from such " stupid " display , it is simply another excurse to protect him .
agree or not , he is still a human being , flesh and blood , and is not any better than other human being .
he should make apology in person if he is man enough .
i challenge him to do so .
if he dares to do it , he should be brave enough to accept the consequence .
the excuse of " poor " choice is quite lame .

i live in the us , was born in the netherlands , and lived under the dreadful nazi regime from 1940-1945 .
no one who has any idea of the horrors inflicted by hitler and his supporters would do what harry did .
stupid , ignorant and arrogant - that 's what it is ! - walter g. bruinsma , us not only should harry apologize to both the british people and german people via television and radio immediately , he should be sent to germany by his father , prince charles , for a one-year german immersion course .

i am not a moralist and do not shock easily but this was in such bad taste that it goes beyond the pale .
nothing he does in the future will ever eradicate this stupidity , even if he worked in calcutta with the poor for the next 20 years .

one can not deny that nazism existed ... and this was simply a costume .
he was not necessarily glorifying nazism nor the much hated swastika .
people should quit focusing their attention on the young prince ... he is just a person like anybody else .

he should know better .
he offended all decent people including modern germans , jews , members of the resistance and all those who died to eradicate that hated symbol .
i am not a moralist and do not shock easily but this was in such bad taste that it goes beyond the pale .
nothing he does in the future will ever eradicate this stupidity , even if he worked in calcutta with the poor for the next 20 years .
i do n't care in the least how many drugs he takes , how much he drinks or how many women or men he sleeps with .
this is just youthful normality .

a spoiled rich boy who wanted to have some fun , and instead ended up offending people .
yes he should apologize in public .
he may be a prince but he is also suppose to be a symbol of status and education , human compassion , and of leadership .
he does not deserve special breaks in life , he 's only human . - a. katzenberg a tempest in a teacup .
prince harry is a young man who in the eyes of some did a foolish thing and did not anticipate that media hyenas would get on his tail .

i do n't think one can force him to do this . - t. bjhattacharya it is well-known that there were many nazi sympathizers among the british nobility and upper class and harry should be aware of this .

a federal court in germany has ruled that secret paternity tests are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit , as such tests hurt the personal rights of the child .
it was the right decision . it 's not the hens , but rather the roosters who 've been clucking and cackling for days now in the great german chicken run . but unfortunately humans do n't live like birds , since everything would be so much easier . either there 'd be a maximum of one rooster per henhouse , meaning paternity could be established without a doubt .
or else the hens would live among themselves .
this would rule out the hatching of any little chicks , but at least the question of paternity would be moot . but no , people are complicated .
and social debates in germany are even more complicated .
on the one hand , germans have been complaining for years about declining birth rates , and moaning that women today neither have the time nor the desire to have kids . on the other hand , those women that do become mothers are accused of being promiscuous and cuckolding their husbands by tricking them into supporting children that are not their own . what is a father ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the background to an essential question : what is a father ?
is he the man that a child grows up with , who shares in the responsibility and joy that comes with raising a child ?
or is a father the man who bears financial responsibility for a child , even against his will ?
we all know there are enough of those around . the number of single mothers supporting their children on welfare because the father wo n't pay - or wo n't pay enough - is rising from year to year .
it 's not without reason that children are often portrayed as a poverty risk in germany , not least because in the case of divorce , the cost of raising a child is mostly borne by just one parent , in most cases , the mother . the legal dispute also raises the question whether a parent 's love - in this case , a father 's love - is determined by genetics ?
does a man love his child only because it carries his genes ?
or does he love the child as a person ? those who answer the first question with " yes " would , by that logic , also have to be against every form of adoption , because , if that were the case , it would be impossible to love an adopted child . numbers impossible to prove there 's also the question of whether the numbers in this debate are correct - whether every fifth child in germany is , in fact , the child of an adulterous relationship .
there 's no real way to verify this - even the federal statistics office would have to pass . so are we really dealing with a modern myth , one that plays on age-old fears ?
men 's fear of being cheated on by their wives seems to have staying-power . but if the numbers are right , then they would imply that endless numbers of " faithful " husbands were fathering babies with women other than their wives .
for this reason alone , you 'd expect men to be a little calmer about the whole issue . calmness is also advisable , because the court 's verdict is , essentially , correct .
if genetic tests conducted without the consent of those affected were admissible in court , then the consequences of such male vanity would be more than widespread . in principle , every employer could then secretly carry out genetic tests on staff members , and make further employment dependent on their risk of illness . insurance firms would have the same right .
the nice insurance salesman who makes house calls to draw up contracts for his customers would only have to politely ask to use the toilet to collect dna samples for every member of the family .

a federal court in germany has ruled that secret paternity tests are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit , as such tests hurt the personal rights of the child .
it was the right decision . it 's not the hens , but rather the roosters who 've been clucking and cackling for days now in the great german chicken run . but unfortunately humans do n't live like birds , since everything would be so much easier . either there 'd be a maximum of one rooster per henhouse , meaning paternity could be established without a doubt .
or else the hens would live among themselves .
this would rule out the hatching of any little chicks , but at least the question of paternity would be moot . but no , people are complicated .
and social debates in germany are even more complicated .
on the one hand , germans have been complaining for years about declining birth rates , and moaning that women today neither have the time nor the desire to have kids . on the other hand , those women that do become mothers are accused of being promiscuous and cuckolding their husbands by tricking them into supporting children that are not their own . what is a father ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the background to an essential question : what is a father ?
is he the man that a child grows up with , who shares in the responsibility and joy that comes with raising a child ?
or is a father the man who bears financial responsibility for a child , even against his will ?
we all know there are enough of those around . the number of single mothers supporting their children on welfare because the father wo n't pay - or wo n't pay enough - is rising from year to year .
it 's not without reason that children are often portrayed as a poverty risk in germany , not least because in the case of divorce , the cost of raising a child is mostly borne by just one parent , in most cases , the mother . the legal dispute also raises the question whether a parent 's love - in this case , a father 's love - is determined by genetics ?
does a man love his child only because it carries his genes ?
or does he love the child as a person ? those who answer the first question with " yes " would , by that logic , also have to be against every form of adoption , because , if that were the case , it would be impossible to love an adopted child . numbers impossible to prove there 's also the question of whether the numbers in this debate are correct - whether every fifth child in germany is , in fact , the child of an adulterous relationship .
there 's no real way to verify this - even the federal statistics office would have to pass . so are we really dealing with a modern myth , one that plays on age-old fears ?
men 's fear of being cheated on by their wives seems to have staying-power . but if the numbers are right , then they would imply that endless numbers of " faithful " husbands were fathering babies with women other than their wives .
for this reason alone , you 'd expect men to be a little calmer about the whole issue . calmness is also advisable , because the court 's verdict is , essentially , correct .
if genetic tests conducted without the consent of those affected were admissible in court , then the consequences of such male vanity would be more than widespread . in principle , every employer could then secretly carry out genetic tests on staff members , and make further employment dependent on their risk of illness . insurance firms would have the same right .
the nice insurance salesman who makes house calls to draw up contracts for his customers would only have to politely ask to use the toilet to collect dna samples for every member of the family .
insurance premiums according to our genetic disposition would become the norm - and certainly , no one wants that . helle jeppesen -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fathers ' rights suffer setback german politicians seeking to outlaw secret paternity tests won a first battle on wednesday , much to the disappointment of fathers ' rights groups hoping for greater justice in the areas of alimony and child support .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 14.01.2005 should harry apologize ?
back to first page back 2/2 his apology should be in public and then the incident should be closed .
but the furor certainly indicates continued world opinion that refuses to acccept that germans -lrb- or at least most germans -rrb- have moved on from the nazi era and are part of a free and democratic society . - channing dichter i feel so sorry for harry .
he needs to grow up and show some respect .
he most certianly does need to apologize in person and yes , make him go to auschwitz and see what went on . - mario delosada , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harry helped pack emergency supplies for victims of the asian tsunamis earlier in january harry should apologize in person and go to visit the death camps .
he should know better .
he offended all decent people including modern germans , jews , members of the resistance and all those who died to eradicate that hated symbol .
i am not a moralist and do not shock easily but this was in such bad taste that it goes beyond the pale .
nothing he does in the future will ever eradicate this stupidity , even if he worked in calcutta with the poor for the next 20 years .
i do n't care in the least how many drugs he takes , how much he drinks or how many women or men he sleeps with .
this is just youthful normality .
however , this latest incident shows something twisted and sick in his character which he will never live down . - alan smith , australia why should prince harry have to bend over backwards to appease the mandarins of " political correctness " - this item made a welcome change on the sun 's front page from seeing the recent rubbish about the tsunami - a media frenzy of pretended " caring " and false sympathy if there ever was one .
it 's all about selling newspapers , is n't it - just like the picture of harry .
these media hypocrites offend me more than harry in his armband . - dave clifton harry knew what he was doing when he thought of wearing it .
and then decided to parade around in it .
a spoiled rich boy who wanted to have some fun , and instead ended up offending people .
yes he should apologize in public .
he may be a prince but he is also suppose to be a symbol of status and education , human compassion , and of leadership .
he does not deserve special breaks in life , he 's only human . - a. katzenberg a tempest in a teacup .
prince harry is a young man who in the eyes of some did a foolish thing and did not anticipate that media hyenas would get on his tail .
our own former prime minister , pierre trudeau , as a young man wore a german wwii helmet with a swastika on it when riding his motorcycle .
foolish ?
yes .
criminal ?
no . - anthony chernushenko , canada yes , he should apologize in public , but this step should come from within himself .
i do n't think one can force him to do this . - t. bjhattacharya it is well-known that there were many nazi sympathizers among the british nobility and upper class and harry should be aware of this .
furthermore , with the upsurge in anti-semitism in europe , such a stupid stunt gives aid and comfort to the self-declared enemies of western civilization .
i hope for the sake of the brits that harry , given his evident stupidity and lack of comon sense , never gets the chance to be king ! - amy , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harry 's brother william -lrb- right -rrb- was reportedly present when harry picked the costume .
william went as a wild cat .
one can not deny that nazism existed ... and this was simply a costume .
he was not necessarily glorifying nazism nor the much hated swastika .
people should quit focusing their attention on the young prince ... he is just a person like anybody else .
had someone else dressed in this matter , it would not have made front page news . - heidi van der muller i must tell of a personal experience .
it was in the 70s in the us .
a friend wore his father 's uniform shirt -lrb- waffen ss -rrb- to a party we both attended .
i took him aside , told him how offensive the shirt was calmly and asked him never to do it again .
he was surpised that it caused offense , did apologize and as far as i know never did wear it again . - sandra levy , us back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prince harry offends with nazi gaffe britain 's prince harry has made many gaffes in his public life - smoking cannabis , underage drinking , scuffling with photographers .

but the furor certainly indicates continued world opinion that refuses to acccept that germans -lrb- or at least most germans -rrb- have moved on from the nazi era and are part of a free and democratic society . - channing dichter i feel so sorry for harry .
he needs to grow up and show some respect .
he most certianly does need to apologize in person and yes , make him go to auschwitz and see what went on . - mario delosada , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harry helped pack emergency supplies for victims of the asian tsunamis earlier in january harry should apologize in person and go to visit the death camps .
he should know better .
he offended all decent people including modern germans , jews , members of the resistance and all those who died to eradicate that hated symbol .
i am not a moralist and do not shock easily but this was in such bad taste that it goes beyond the pale .
nothing he does in the future will ever eradicate this stupidity , even if he worked in calcutta with the poor for the next 20 years .
i do n't care in the least how many drugs he takes , how much he drinks or how many women or men he sleeps with .
this is just youthful normality .
however , this latest incident shows something twisted and sick in his character which he will never live down . - alan smith , australia why should prince harry have to bend over backwards to appease the mandarins of " political correctness " - this item made a welcome change on the sun 's front page from seeing the recent rubbish about the tsunami - a media frenzy of pretended " caring " and false sympathy if there ever was one .

a spoiled rich boy who wanted to have some fun , and instead ended up offending people .
yes he should apologize in public .
he may be a prince but he is also suppose to be a symbol of status and education , human compassion , and of leadership .
he does not deserve special breaks in life , he 's only human . - a. katzenberg a tempest in a teacup .
prince harry is a young man who in the eyes of some did a foolish thing and did not anticipate that media hyenas would get on his tail .

furthermore , with the upsurge in anti-semitism in europe , such a stupid stunt gives aid and comfort to the self-declared enemies of western civilization .

one can not deny that nazism existed ... and this was simply a costume .

he most certianly does need to apologize in person and yes , make him go to auschwitz and see what went on . - mario delosada , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harry helped pack emergency supplies for victims of the asian tsunamis earlier in january harry should apologize in person and go to visit the death camps .
he should know better .
he offended all decent people including modern germans , jews , members of the resistance and all those who died to eradicate that hated symbol .
i am not a moralist and do not shock easily but this was in such bad taste that it goes beyond the pale .
nothing he does in the future will ever eradicate this stupidity , even if he worked in calcutta with the poor for the next 20 years .
i do n't care in the least how many drugs he takes , how much he drinks or how many women or men he sleeps with .
this is just youthful normality .
however , this latest incident shows something twisted and sick in his character which he will never live down . - alan smith , australia why should prince harry have to bend over backwards to appease the mandarins of " political correctness " - this item made a welcome change on the sun 's front page from seeing the recent rubbish about the tsunami - a media frenzy of pretended " caring " and false sympathy if there ever was one .
it 's all about selling newspapers , is n't it - just like the picture of harry .
these media hypocrites offend me more than harry in his armband . - dave clifton harry knew what he was doing when he thought of wearing it .
and then decided to parade around in it .
a spoiled rich boy who wanted to have some fun , and instead ended up offending people .
yes he should apologize in public .
he may be a prince but he is also suppose to be a symbol of status and education , human compassion , and of leadership .
he does not deserve special breaks in life , he 's only human . - a. katzenberg a tempest in a teacup .
prince harry is a young man who in the eyes of some did a foolish thing and did not anticipate that media hyenas would get on his tail .
our own former prime minister , pierre trudeau , as a young man wore a german wwii helmet with a swastika on it when riding his motorcycle .
foolish ?
yes .
criminal ?
no . - anthony chernushenko , canada yes , he should apologize in public , but this step should come from within himself .
i do n't think one can force him to do this . - t. bjhattacharya it is well-known that there were many nazi sympathizers among the british nobility and upper class and harry should be aware of this .
furthermore , with the upsurge in anti-semitism in europe , such a stupid stunt gives aid and comfort to the self-declared enemies of western civilization .
i hope for the sake of the brits that harry , given his evident stupidity and lack of comon sense , never gets the chance to be king ! - amy , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harry 's brother william -lrb- right -rrb- was reportedly present when harry picked the costume .
william went as a wild cat .
one can not deny that nazism existed ... and this was simply a costume .
he was not necessarily glorifying nazism nor the much hated swastika .
people should quit focusing their attention on the young prince ... he is just a person like anybody else .
had someone else dressed in this matter , it would not have made front page news . - heidi van der muller i must tell of a personal experience .
it was in the 70s in the us .
a friend wore his father 's uniform shirt -lrb- waffen ss -rrb- to a party we both attended .
i took him aside , told him how offensive the shirt was calmly and asked him never to do it again .
he was surpised that it caused offense , did apologize and as far as i know never did wear it again . - sandra levy , us back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prince harry offends with nazi gaffe britain 's prince harry has made many gaffes in his public life - smoking cannabis , underage drinking , scuffling with photographers .

a majority of dw-world readers said he should publicly apologize for his behavior . a public apology from prince harry should include the following : his utter humility in making the declaration ; a candid display of understanding that his entire life is the exception of privacy legislation and that therefore he has no defense in the context of a private party ; a recognition that he has offended many good people and that a knowledge of history is not a disposable commodity but an essential element of democratic monarchies such as britain .
he should show the world that he understands why associating himself with the national socialist party is repugnant , why wearing its regalia is not without meaning beyond the confines of his socializing .
that said - it is worthwhile to note that so little has been explained why another member of the family would also be going to a " native and colonials " fancy dress party - which sounds somewhat racist to me .

a majority of dw-world readers said he should publicly apologize for his behavior . a public apology from prince harry should include the following : his utter humility in making the declaration ; a candid display of understanding that his entire life is the exception of privacy legislation and that therefore he has no defense in the context of a private party ; a recognition that he has offended many good people and that a knowledge of history is not a disposable commodity but an essential element of democratic monarchies such as britain .
he should show the world that he understands why associating himself with the national socialist party is repugnant , why wearing its regalia is not without meaning beyond the confines of his socializing .
that said - it is worthwhile to note that so little has been explained why another member of the family would also be going to a " native and colonials " fancy dress party - which sounds somewhat racist to me .
but then , i 'm a canadian , and not so sophisticated . - david woodward , canada he should not merely visit auschwitz , he should undergo a few weeks of living like the prisoners at auschwitz .
perhaps his life of privilege and excused childish behavior could be turned around by enduring some hardship .
harry 's apology is not enough ; he should face serious consequences for such hateful and insensitive behavior . - d. friberg , us it would be interesting to know some of the other costumes worn to this " native and colonial " party .
the british should not be too proud of how they treated the natives during colonial times .

regardless of his royal status , he should be punished according to the law of the land .
if he is spared from such " stupid " display , it is simply another excurse to protect him .
agree or not , he is still a human being , flesh and blood , and is not any better than other human being .
he should make apology in person if he is man enough .
i challenge him to do so .
if he dares to do it , he should be brave enough to accept the consequence .

i live in the us , was born in the netherlands , and lived under the dreadful nazi regime from 1940-1945 .
no one who has any idea of the horrors inflicted by hitler and his supporters would do what harry did .

a majority of dw-world readers said he should publicly apologize for his behavior . a public apology from prince harry should include the following : his utter humility in making the declaration ; a candid display of understanding that his entire life is the exception of privacy legislation and that therefore he has no defense in the context of a private party ; a recognition that he has offended many good people and that a knowledge of history is not a disposable commodity but an essential element of democratic monarchies such as britain .
he should show the world that he understands why associating himself with the national socialist party is repugnant , why wearing its regalia is not without meaning beyond the confines of his socializing .
that said - it is worthwhile to note that so little has been explained why another member of the family would also be going to a " native and colonials " fancy dress party - which sounds somewhat racist to me .
but then , i 'm a canadian , and not so sophisticated . - david woodward , canada he should not merely visit auschwitz , he should undergo a few weeks of living like the prisoners at auschwitz .
perhaps his life of privilege and excused childish behavior could be turned around by enduring some hardship .
harry 's apology is not enough ; he should face serious consequences for such hateful and insensitive behavior . - d. friberg , us it would be interesting to know some of the other costumes worn to this " native and colonial " party .
the british should not be too proud of how they treated the natives during colonial times .
yet , i did not hear any africans or indians complaining about this party theme or how they , doubtlessly , were ridiculed at this party .

regardless of his royal status , he should be punished according to the law of the land .
if he is spared from such " stupid " display , it is simply another excurse to protect him .
agree or not , he is still a human being , flesh and blood , and is not any better than other human being .
he should make apology in person if he is man enough .
i challenge him to do so .
if he dares to do it , he should be brave enough to accept the consequence .
the excuse of " poor " choice is quite lame .
to be a man , you have to prove it , harry . - chhan d. touch , us harry should apologize in person .
i live in the us , was born in the netherlands , and lived under the dreadful nazi regime from 1940-1945 .
no one who has any idea of the horrors inflicted by hitler and his supporters would do what harry did .
stupid , ignorant and arrogant - that 's what it is ! - walter g. bruinsma , us not only should harry apologize to both the british people and german people via television and radio immediately , he should be sent to germany by his father , prince charles , for a one-year german immersion course .

however , esa can only guess what is waiting for huygens on the surface , which could be anything from icy rock to a boggy mush or even a sea of methane . " the excitement is growing – over seven years of work has gone into this moment , " gerhard schwehm , esa 's head of planetary science , told dw-world .

the mission hopes to help unravel the mystery of how life evolved on earth . it is in titan 's soupy nitrogen-heavy atmosphere that huygens will look for clues to uncover the earth 's chemical makeup from over four billion years ago .
the high-profile space exploration mission will also mark the first time an unmanned probe lands on an object in the outer solar system . once the 320-kilogram spacecraft breaks through the atmosphere , scientists at esa mission control in darmstadt , germany , will use its six specialized instruments to gather data .
however , esa can only guess what is waiting for huygens on the surface , which could be anything from icy rock to a boggy mush or even a sea of methane . " the excitement is growing – over seven years of work has gone into this moment , " gerhard schwehm , esa 's head of planetary science , told dw-world .

but the combined weight of cassini-huygens was more than any direct rocket flight could handle .
so in order to get to saturn , nasa sent the spacecraft on a 2.1-billion-kilometer -lrb- 1.3-billion-mile -rrb- journey , including two trips around venus and one each past the earth and jupiter to make use of the planets ' gravity for a slingshot effect . cassini-huygens reached saturn 's orbit last summer .

during its 140-minute descent by parachute , the probe is likely to be buffeted by strong winds and will face freezing temperatures plunging to -180 celsius .

the cassini-huygens mission , a joint venture between nasa and the european space agency , is one of the most ambitious space exploration attempts ever undertaken .

" we are very pleased that all of the countries identified by the independent electoral commission of iraq have now agreed to support iraq 's out-of-country voting , allowing as many iraqis as possible to vote , " iom director , peter erben said .
tight security as part of the initiative , for two days at the end of january , the 56,000 iraqi citizens living in germany will be able to cast their ballot in four locations around the country .
security at the polling stations in the cities of berlin , cologne , munich and mannheim will be under tight security .
preparations are already underway at a former airfield in cologne , which will serve as one of the out-of-country voting locations .
in preparation for the event , the whole area has been cordoned off , several buildings have been searched and sealed by explosives experts .
they wo n't be opened again until jan .
17 , when both iraqi citizens and refugees who no longer have a passport , but have retained the right to citizenship will roll up to register as voters .
iraqis residing in nearby belgium will also be allowed to vote at the cologne polling station .
a climate of violence although there are less than 3,000 iraqi citizens resident in berlin , some 12,000 are expected to turn out to cast their ballot at the polling station in the german capital .
security there will be tight too , but a spokeswoman for the interior ministry said there was no concrete danger of attacks during the two days of elections in germany .
in light of the continuing violence in iraq , the european parliament has decided not to send observers to monitor the vote , despite a specific request to do so by the transitional government in baghdad .
in the first official voter turn-out , a member of the election committee in the iraqi capital said they were expecting to see fifty percent of the 15 million strong population cast their ballot .
" that 's not bad .

janssen did not comment on his resignation himself and his local party chapter simply stated that he resigned because he did not want to burden his family and his spd party with speculations about his income any longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jann-peter janssen a backbencher from the germany 's north sea coast , janssen -lrb- photo -rrb- entered parliament in 1994 .
before his election , he had worked as a workers ' council representative at vw . five other social democrats were also listed by vw officials as paid employees . undisclosed payments and perks paid by german industry to members of parliament have outraged the public and prompted a hectic search among mps for a way to keep all politicians from being tainted by the scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurenz meyer after announcing his resignation on dec .

cdu general secretary laurenz meyer -lrb- photo -rrb- and the party ’ s labor affairs spokesman , herman-josef arendtz , were forced to step down a month ago after they admitted they had received undeclared payments from the energy giant rwe . vw wants to halt payments on thursday it was the social democrats turn to eat humble pie , after german automaker volkwagen disclosed that two spd members of parliament , four regional assembly lawmakers and more than 300 minor local politicians were on its payroll . vw chief executive bernd pischetsrieder admitted that the payments had been made in violation of the companies own rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pischetsrieder " as a matter of fact , our rules allow such payments only if politicians are still actively working for the company and if it helps to facilitate the future re-integration into volkswagen , " he said . volkswagen is now planning to halt all payments to politicians and toughen its stipulations .
vw workers , however , are outraged by the fact that politicians are handed perks while the company staff will have to endure a two-year freeze on salaries to cut costs at vw . " i can not accept that , " one vw employee told dw-radio .
" if i were going to moonlight in other jobs , i would face punishment , but politicians , i assume , will be off the hook . " another worker agreed and added it was unbelievable that politicians could earn a second salary without doing anything . rwe comes clean in an apparent effort to prevent further revelations , germany ’ s top energy company rwe has now also come clean on its secret payments to politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe headquarters on friday it said that it pays more than € 600,000 -lrb- $ 786,500 -rrb- each year for lobbying activities , but mostly to local politicians .
german politicians are allowed to moonlight in other jobs , but they are obliged to declare any outside employment to avoid conflicts of interest . looking for safeguards wolfgang thierse , the social democratic speaker of parliament and in charge of overseeing the bundestag 's code of conduct , said the cases that have become known so far are all in violation of the rules .
he demands stiffer penalties as a more effective deterrent . " in my view it is important now that germany eventually adopts the international anti-corruption charter , " he said .
" a draft bill to this end has long been put before parliament and it provides for sanctions mechanisms that could have prevented exactly those violations we are experiencing now .

but he has rejected the idea of requiring all parliamentarians to publicize all of their income , saying that this would harm self-employed entrepreneurs or lawyers , who might suffer competitive disadvantages . in the meantime , german shareholders have vowed to put stern questions to company heads at upcoming annual meetings .

janssen did not comment on his resignation himself and his local party chapter simply stated that he resigned because he did not want to burden his family and his spd party with speculations about his income any longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jann-peter janssen a backbencher from the germany 's north sea coast , janssen -lrb- photo -rrb- entered parliament in 1994 .
before his election , he had worked as a workers ' council representative at vw . five other social democrats were also listed by vw officials as paid employees . undisclosed payments and perks paid by german industry to members of parliament have outraged the public and prompted a hectic search among mps for a way to keep all politicians from being tainted by the scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurenz meyer after announcing his resignation on dec .
22 but it has already claimed the careers of two prominent conservative politicians .
cdu general secretary laurenz meyer -lrb- photo -rrb- and the party ’ s labor affairs spokesman , herman-josef arendtz , were forced to step down a month ago after they admitted they had received undeclared payments from the energy giant rwe . vw wants to halt payments on thursday it was the social democrats turn to eat humble pie , after german automaker volkwagen disclosed that two spd members of parliament , four regional assembly lawmakers and more than 300 minor local politicians were on its payroll . vw chief executive bernd pischetsrieder admitted that the payments had been made in violation of the companies own rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pischetsrieder " as a matter of fact , our rules allow such payments only if politicians are still actively working for the company and if it helps to facilitate the future re-integration into volkswagen , " he said . volkswagen is now planning to halt all payments to politicians and toughen its stipulations .
vw workers , however , are outraged by the fact that politicians are handed perks while the company staff will have to endure a two-year freeze on salaries to cut costs at vw . " i can not accept that , " one vw employee told dw-radio .
" if i were going to moonlight in other jobs , i would face punishment , but politicians , i assume , will be off the hook . " another worker agreed and added it was unbelievable that politicians could earn a second salary without doing anything . rwe comes clean in an apparent effort to prevent further revelations , germany ’ s top energy company rwe has now also come clean on its secret payments to politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe headquarters on friday it said that it pays more than € 600,000 -lrb- $ 786,500 -rrb- each year for lobbying activities , but mostly to local politicians .
german politicians are allowed to moonlight in other jobs , but they are obliged to declare any outside employment to avoid conflicts of interest . looking for safeguards wolfgang thierse , the social democratic speaker of parliament and in charge of overseeing the bundestag 's code of conduct , said the cases that have become known so far are all in violation of the rules .
he demands stiffer penalties as a more effective deterrent . " in my view it is important now that germany eventually adopts the international anti-corruption charter , " he said .
" a draft bill to this end has long been put before parliament and it provides for sanctions mechanisms that could have prevented exactly those violations we are experiencing now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse in a recent interview with dw-world 's ibrahim mohamad thierse -lrb- photo , right -rrb- will meet senior members of germany ‘ s main parties next week to discuss legislative measures against corruption .
but he has rejected the idea of requiring all parliamentarians to publicize all of their income , saying that this would harm self-employed entrepreneurs or lawyers , who might suffer competitive disadvantages . in the meantime , german shareholders have vowed to put stern questions to company heads at upcoming annual meetings .

scientists and space chiefs have bet more than $ 3 billion dollars on the cassini-huygens project and some have spent a quarter-century of their lives planning it and carrying it out . huygens is " a scientific success ... and a fantastic success as well for international cooperation , " the director-general of the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , jean-jacques dordain , declared the probe headed to titan 's surface carrying half a dozen instruments within a clam-like shell to film and measure the moon 's weather system and methane-rich atmosphere during a two-and-a-half-hour descent .
its sensors were designed to continue working for just three minutes after it landed on the bone-freezing titan surface . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa workers watch the huygens landing in the mission control room in darmstadt germany .
but delighted scientists said the instruments probably continued to function for at least half an hour after touchdown , possibly providing vital clues as to whether titan is covered by rock , methane ice or an ocean of chemicals . " i am sure we have at least 30 minutes of surface science , " said jean-pierre lebreton , head of the huygens mission at esa . titan a mystery titan , the largest satellite of saturn , was chosen for the $ 3.2-billion -lrb- € 2.46-billion -rrb- transatlantic venture as , intriguingly , it is the only moon in the solar system that has a substantial atmosphere .

that process eventually provided the conditions for life on our planet . " titan is a time machine .
it will especially provide us with the opportunity to know about the conditions on our early earth , " alphonso diaz , nasa science assistant administrator , said . huygen 's descent , on a moon 1.5 billion kilometers -lrb- 940 million miles -rrb- from home , was the farthest landing from earth ever attempted .
the operation was fraught with potential hitches , including the risk of a crash or catastrophic malfunction when the 319-kilo -lrb- 702-pound -rrb- craft entered titan 's roiling atmosphere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cassini-huygens spacecraft returned this image of saturn on sunday , may 16 , 2004 , taken with its imaging science subsystem narrow-angle camera .

scientists and space chiefs have bet more than $ 3 billion dollars on the cassini-huygens project and some have spent a quarter-century of their lives planning it and carrying it out . huygens is " a scientific success ... and a fantastic success as well for international cooperation , " the director-general of the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , jean-jacques dordain , declared the probe headed to titan 's surface carrying half a dozen instruments within a clam-like shell to film and measure the moon 's weather system and methane-rich atmosphere during a two-and-a-half-hour descent .
its sensors were designed to continue working for just three minutes after it landed on the bone-freezing titan surface . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa workers watch the huygens landing in the mission control room in darmstadt germany .
but delighted scientists said the instruments probably continued to function for at least half an hour after touchdown , possibly providing vital clues as to whether titan is covered by rock , methane ice or an ocean of chemicals . " i am sure we have at least 30 minutes of surface science , " said jean-pierre lebreton , head of the huygens mission at esa . titan a mystery titan , the largest satellite of saturn , was chosen for the $ 3.2-billion -lrb- € 2.46-billion -rrb- transatlantic venture as , intriguingly , it is the only moon in the solar system that has a substantial atmosphere .
its thick mix of nitrogen and methane is suspected to be undergoing chemical reactions similar to those that unfolded on earth billions of years ago .
that process eventually provided the conditions for life on our planet . " titan is a time machine .
it will especially provide us with the opportunity to know about the conditions on our early earth , " alphonso diaz , nasa science assistant administrator , said . huygen 's descent , on a moon 1.5 billion kilometers -lrb- 940 million miles -rrb- from home , was the farthest landing from earth ever attempted .
the operation was fraught with potential hitches , including the risk of a crash or catastrophic malfunction when the 319-kilo -lrb- 702-pound -rrb- craft entered titan 's roiling atmosphere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cassini-huygens spacecraft returned this image of saturn on sunday , may 16 , 2004 , taken with its imaging science subsystem narrow-angle camera .

it worked beautifully with six scientific instruments , in a very harsh environment in order to break the secret of titan . " but it was also " a fantastic success as well for international cooperation , " said dordain .

but the furor certainly indicates continued world opinion that refuses to acccept that germans -lrb- or at least most germans -rrb- have moved on from the nazi era and are part of a free and democratic society . - channing dichter i feel so sorry for harry .
he needs to grow up and show some respect .
he most certianly does need to apologize in person and yes , make him go to auschwitz and see what went on . - mario delosada , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harry helped pack emergency supplies for victims of the asian tsunamis earlier in january harry should apologize in person and go to visit the death camps .
he should know better .
he offended all decent people including modern germans , jews , members of the resistance and all those who died to eradicate that hated symbol .
i am not a moralist and do not shock easily but this was in such bad taste that it goes beyond the pale .
nothing he does in the future will ever eradicate this stupidity , even if he worked in calcutta with the poor for the next 20 years .
i do n't care in the least how many drugs he takes , how much he drinks or how many women or men he sleeps with .
this is just youthful normality .
however , this latest incident shows something twisted and sick in his character which he will never live down . - alan smith , australia why should prince harry have to bend over backwards to appease the mandarins of " political correctness " - this item made a welcome change on the sun 's front page from seeing the recent rubbish about the tsunami - a media frenzy of pretended " caring " and false sympathy if there ever was one .

and then decided to parade around in it .
a spoiled rich boy who wanted to have some fun , and instead ended up offending people .
yes he should apologize in public .
he may be a prince but he is also suppose to be a symbol of status and education , human compassion , and of leadership .
he does not deserve special breaks in life , he 's only human . - a. katzenberg a tempest in a teacup .
prince harry is a young man who in the eyes of some did a foolish thing and did not anticipate that media hyenas would get on his tail .
our own former prime minister , pierre trudeau , as a young man wore a german wwii helmet with a swastika on it when riding his motorcycle .

furthermore , with the upsurge in anti-semitism in europe , such a stupid stunt gives aid and comfort to the self-declared enemies of western civilization .

a majority of dw-world readers said he should publicly apologize for his behavior . a public apology from prince harry should include the following : his utter humility in making the declaration ; a candid display of understanding that his entire life is the exception of privacy legislation and that therefore he has no defense in the context of a private party ; a recognition that he has offended many good people and that a knowledge of history is not a disposable commodity but an essential element of democratic monarchies such as britain .
he should show the world that he understands why associating himself with the national socialist party is repugnant , why wearing its regalia is not without meaning beyond the confines of his socializing .
that said - it is worthwhile to note that so little has been explained why another member of the family would also be going to a " native and colonials " fancy dress party - which sounds somewhat racist to me .
but then , i 'm a canadian , and not so sophisticated . - david woodward , canada he should not merely visit auschwitz , he should undergo a few weeks of living like the prisoners at auschwitz .
perhaps his life of privilege and excused childish behavior could be turned around by enduring some hardship .
harry 's apology is not enough ; he should face serious consequences for such hateful and insensitive behavior . - d. friberg , us it would be interesting to know some of the other costumes worn to this " native and colonial " party .
the british should not be too proud of how they treated the natives during colonial times .
yet , i did not hear any africans or indians complaining about this party theme or how they , doubtlessly , were ridiculed at this party .

regardless of his royal status , he should be punished according to the law of the land .
if he is spared from such " stupid " display , it is simply another excurse to protect him .
agree or not , he is still a human being , flesh and blood , and is not any better than other human being .
he should make apology in person if he is man enough .
i challenge him to do so .
if he dares to do it , he should be brave enough to accept the consequence .
the excuse of " poor " choice is quite lame .
to be a man , you have to prove it , harry . - chhan d. touch , us harry should apologize in person .
i live in the us , was born in the netherlands , and lived under the dreadful nazi regime from 1940-1945 .
no one who has any idea of the horrors inflicted by hitler and his supporters would do what harry did .
stupid , ignorant and arrogant - that 's what it is ! - walter g. bruinsma , us not only should harry apologize to both the british people and german people via television and radio immediately , he should be sent to germany by his father , prince charles , for a one-year german immersion course .
he should also be advised by the authorities at sandhurst that his application to attend is no longer acceptable or wanted .

a majority of dw-world readers said he should publicly apologize for his behavior . a public apology from prince harry should include the following : his utter humility in making the declaration ; a candid display of understanding that his entire life is the exception of privacy legislation and that therefore he has no defense in the context of a private party ; a recognition that he has offended many good people and that a knowledge of history is not a disposable commodity but an essential element of democratic monarchies such as britain .
he should show the world that he understands why associating himself with the national socialist party is repugnant , why wearing its regalia is not without meaning beyond the confines of his socializing .
that said - it is worthwhile to note that so little has been explained why another member of the family would also be going to a " native and colonials " fancy dress party - which sounds somewhat racist to me .
but then , i 'm a canadian , and not so sophisticated . - david woodward , canada he should not merely visit auschwitz , he should undergo a few weeks of living like the prisoners at auschwitz .
perhaps his life of privilege and excused childish behavior could be turned around by enduring some hardship .
harry 's apology is not enough ; he should face serious consequences for such hateful and insensitive behavior . - d. friberg , us it would be interesting to know some of the other costumes worn to this " native and colonial " party .
the british should not be too proud of how they treated the natives during colonial times .
yet , i did not hear any africans or indians complaining about this party theme or how they , doubtlessly , were ridiculed at this party .

regardless of his royal status , he should be punished according to the law of the land .
if he is spared from such " stupid " display , it is simply another excurse to protect him .
agree or not , he is still a human being , flesh and blood , and is not any better than other human being .
he should make apology in person if he is man enough .
i challenge him to do so .
if he dares to do it , he should be brave enough to accept the consequence .
the excuse of " poor " choice is quite lame .

i live in the us , was born in the netherlands , and lived under the dreadful nazi regime from 1940-1945 .
no one who has any idea of the horrors inflicted by hitler and his supporters would do what harry did .
stupid , ignorant and arrogant - that 's what it is ! - walter g. bruinsma , us not only should harry apologize to both the british people and german people via television and radio immediately , he should be sent to germany by his father , prince charles , for a one-year german immersion course .

a majority of dw-world readers said he should publicly apologize for his behavior . a public apology from prince harry should include the following : his utter humility in making the declaration ; a candid display of understanding that his entire life is the exception of privacy legislation and that therefore he has no defense in the context of a private party ; a recognition that he has offended many good people and that a knowledge of history is not a disposable commodity but an essential element of democratic monarchies such as britain .
he should show the world that he understands why associating himself with the national socialist party is repugnant , why wearing its regalia is not without meaning beyond the confines of his socializing .
that said - it is worthwhile to note that so little has been explained why another member of the family would also be going to a " native and colonials " fancy dress party - which sounds somewhat racist to me .
but then , i 'm a canadian , and not so sophisticated . - david woodward , canada he should not merely visit auschwitz , he should undergo a few weeks of living like the prisoners at auschwitz .
perhaps his life of privilege and excused childish behavior could be turned around by enduring some hardship .
harry 's apology is not enough ; he should face serious consequences for such hateful and insensitive behavior . - d. friberg , us it would be interesting to know some of the other costumes worn to this " native and colonial " party .
the british should not be too proud of how they treated the natives during colonial times .
yet , i did not hear any africans or indians complaining about this party theme or how they , doubtlessly , were ridiculed at this party .
it 's just possible , is n't it , that harry was trying to tell his countrymen something ! - heike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : news agent roy ottoway reads a copy of tabloid ' the sun ' , whose front page shows a picture of britain 's prince harry wearing a nazi soldier 's uniform to a fancy dress party it is a disgrace for the royal member to display such insensivity toward the past suffering of others .
regardless of his royal status , he should be punished according to the law of the land .
if he is spared from such " stupid " display , it is simply another excurse to protect him .
agree or not , he is still a human being , flesh and blood , and is not any better than other human being .
he should make apology in person if he is man enough .
i challenge him to do so .
if he dares to do it , he should be brave enough to accept the consequence .
the excuse of " poor " choice is quite lame .
to be a man , you have to prove it , harry . - chhan d. touch , us harry should apologize in person .
i live in the us , was born in the netherlands , and lived under the dreadful nazi regime from 1940-1945 .
no one who has any idea of the horrors inflicted by hitler and his supporters would do what harry did .
stupid , ignorant and arrogant - that 's what it is ! - walter g. bruinsma , us not only should harry apologize to both the british people and german people via television and radio immediately , he should be sent to germany by his father , prince charles , for a one-year german immersion course .
he should also be advised by the authorities at sandhurst that his application to attend is no longer acceptable or wanted .
he is an absolute disgrace and embarrassment to both the queen , his grandmother , and to his father . - john a. brown , canada please click on the second page to read more comments . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prince harry offends with nazi gaffe britain 's prince harry has made many gaffes in his public life - smoking cannabis , underage drinking , scuffling with photographers .
but his latest caper - dressing as a nazi at a costume party , tops them all .

but it is n't easy : iran is still suspected of developing nuclear weapons . at the start of a meeting in brussels between the eu and iran this week , officials from both countries had to feel each other out , to see what , if anything , could be salvaged from trade talks broken off in june 2002 . the result of this week 's meeting was an agreement to come together again in two months ' time .
a potential trade accord is seen by the eu as a reward for tehran , should the country keep the reins of its nuclear weapons development program pulled tightly in . meanwhile , iranian officials on thursday only allowed un weapons inspectors restricted access to a military compound the united states suspects of being connected to a secret program for developing atomic weapons . mutual threats in late november , after much high-profile discussion and debate , the un international atomic energy commission -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna determined that iran was complying with an agreement to stop enriching uranium , which could be used for developing nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. nuclear inspectors at the headquarters of the international atomic energy agency in vienna " as long as iran does not pursue its atomic weapons program , it can count on improved relations with the eu , " said eu commisioner for foreign relations benita ferrero waldner on tuesday in brussels . in december , iranian foreign minister kamal charrasi had said the atomic program would only be suspended as long as trade talks with the eu showed progress . restricted access nonetheless , on thursday iranian officials limited the access of weapons inspectors to a military compound in parchin , iran .
iran accused the un weapons inspectors of spying during the inspection , reuters news service reported . " we are vigilant " the head of the atomic program talks , hussein musawian , told the iranian news agency mehr .
inspectors were allowed onto the grounds of the compound but not into any buildings . in terms of the eu-tehran trade talks , one of the goals is to eventually lay down a legal basis for a relationship between teheran and brussels , which has not existed since the shah fell from power in 1979 .
iran is one of the few countries in the world that has no cooperation agreement with the eu . the trade agreement is aimed at encouraging iran to undertake reforms , with the eventual integration of iran into the world trade organization an ultimate goal .
on a purely economic basis , the country is well capable of wto entry , eu officials say .
but until now , the united states had blocked that entry on political grounds . trade accord as part of the trade accords , already low import duties from iran into the eu should be made permanent , and if possible lowered .
for its part , the eu expects tariff reductions and the granting of more legal security to investors . because of its relatively strong economic growth and need for investment , iran is an interesting market for the european union , experts say .
european firms currently deliver machinery , vehicles and chemicals to iran .
oil companies are interested in exploiting iranian oil and gas fields .
volkswagen is bringing a small car out on the iranian market ; the parts will be made in brazil but assembled in iran . the united states is distrustful of the trade talks ; washington has repeatedly expressed doubts that iran has permanently stopped its atomic weapons program .
and teheran has already broken promises made during talks in the autumn of 2003 . moderate course after iran 's islamic revolution , the united states broke ties with iran ; us president george w. bush named it as part of the " axis of evil " due to its support of terrorist groups and the suspected atomic weapons development .
the european union , on the other hand , has long taken a more moderate course with teheran , claiming the 70 million iranians are needed for geostrategic stability in the turbulent region . in parallel talks with the eu commission , great britain , france and germany have been talking with iran since mid-december , over an agreement to stop uranium enrichment .
should the iaeo atomic energy commission agree that iran has been secretly working on closed-circuit atomic energy , the eu said the talks will come to a halt . but for now , eu officials said , the plan is to continue talks at bimonthly meetings . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear freeze temporary , iran warns iran warned that it is not prepared to permanently freeze its controversial nuclear fuel work and that it expected quick results from crucial talks on monday with britain , france and germany .

the mission hopes to help unravel the mystery of how life evolved on earth . it is in titan 's soupy nitrogen-heavy atmosphere that huygens will look for clues to uncover the earth 's chemical makeup from over four billion years ago .
the high-profile space exploration mission will also mark the first time an unmanned probe lands on an object in the outer solar system . once the 320-kilogram spacecraft breaks through the atmosphere , scientists at esa mission control in darmstadt , germany , will use its six specialized instruments to gather data .
however , esa can only guess what is waiting for huygens on the surface , which could be anything from icy rock to a boggy mush or even a sea of methane . " the excitement is growing – over seven years of work has gone into this moment , " gerhard schwehm , esa 's head of planetary science , told dw-world .
" titan is very special .
nobody knows exactly what we 'll find there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : purple haze is seen around the saturn moon titan on tuesday , oct .
26 , 2004 as the nasa / esa cassini-huygens spacecraft makes a fly-by of saturn 's largest moon - the closest ever performed .
the probe got its name from christiaan huygens , the dutch astronomer who discovered titan in 1655 .
larger than either mercury or pluto , the moon is the only one in the solar system to have a thick atmosphere .
it is thought to be home to chemical reactions and carbon-based compounds similar to ones found on earth before life existed . hitching a ride with nasa to get to titan , huygens hitched a ride on nasa 's cassini probe .
costing $ 3.2 billion -lrb- € 2.5 billion -rrb- , the two have hurtled toward saturn since their launch in october 1997 .
but the combined weight of cassini-huygens was more than any direct rocket flight could handle .
so in order to get to saturn , nasa sent the spacecraft on a 2.1-billion-kilometer -lrb- 1.3-billion-mile -rrb- journey , including two trips around venus and one each past the earth and jupiter to make use of the planets ' gravity for a slingshot effect . cassini-huygens reached saturn 's orbit last summer .
half a year later , the two finally parted ways as huygens separated and began its approach towards the planet 's moon on dec .

but the teamwork did n't end there , as the nasa craft will crucially relay any data collected by huygens back to mission control .

cet on friday . a short stay but huygens will not enjoy a gentle end to its lengthy journey .
during its 140-minute descent by parachute , the probe is likely to be buffeted by strong winds and will face freezing temperatures plunging to -180 celsius .
if it even makes it to the surface intact , huygens will then begin to survey what titan is like on the ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of the huygens probe shortly after landing on titan .
the space probe is due to blast off for saturn and its mysterious cloud-covered moon titan monday october 13 1997 , from cape canaveral .
the cassini-huygens mission , a joint venture between nasa and the european space agency , is one of the most ambitious space exploration attempts ever undertaken .
however , esa expects the probe 's batteries will only survive for a matter of hours under the harsh conditions .
and regardless of how long huygens holds out , cassini will no longer be able to receive data from the surface once it disappears beyond the moon 's horizon . " we hope to get the first information around 2 p.m. , 3 p.m.
-lrb- cet -rrb- , " huygens project manager jean-pierre lebreton told the news agency afp .
esa is hoping for better reception for huygens on titan than its last planetary exploration mission .

the mission hopes to help unravel the mystery of how life evolved on earth . it is in titan 's soupy nitrogen-heavy atmosphere that huygens will look for clues to uncover the earth 's chemical makeup from over four billion years ago .
the high-profile space exploration mission will also mark the first time an unmanned probe lands on an object in the outer solar system . once the 320-kilogram spacecraft breaks through the atmosphere , scientists at esa mission control in darmstadt , germany , will use its six specialized instruments to gather data .
however , esa can only guess what is waiting for huygens on the surface , which could be anything from icy rock to a boggy mush or even a sea of methane .

the mission hopes to help unravel the mystery of how life evolved on earth . it is in titan 's soupy nitrogen-heavy atmosphere that huygens will look for clues to uncover the earth 's chemical makeup from over four billion years ago .
the high-profile space exploration mission will also mark the first time an unmanned probe lands on an object in the outer solar system . once the 320-kilogram spacecraft breaks through the atmosphere , scientists at esa mission control in darmstadt , germany , will use its six specialized instruments to gather data .
however , esa can only guess what is waiting for huygens on the surface , which could be anything from icy rock to a boggy mush or even a sea of methane . " the excitement is growing – over seven years of work has gone into this moment , " gerhard schwehm , esa 's head of planetary science , told dw-world .

a federal court in germany has ruled that secret paternity tests are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit , as such tests hurt the personal rights of the child .
it was the right decision . it 's not the hens , but rather the roosters who 've been clucking and cackling for days now in the great german chicken run . but unfortunately humans do n't live like birds , since everything would be so much easier . either there 'd be a maximum of one rooster per henhouse , meaning paternity could be established without a doubt .
or else the hens would live among themselves .
this would rule out the hatching of any little chicks , but at least the question of paternity would be moot . but no , people are complicated .
and social debates in germany are even more complicated .
on the one hand , germans have been complaining for years about declining birth rates , and moaning that women today neither have the time nor the desire to have kids . on the other hand , those women that do become mothers are accused of being promiscuous and cuckolding their husbands by tricking them into supporting children that are not their own . what is a father ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the background to an essential question : what is a father ?
is he the man that a child grows up with , who shares in the responsibility and joy that comes with raising a child ?
or is a father the man who bears financial responsibility for a child , even against his will ?
we all know there are enough of those around . the number of single mothers supporting their children on welfare because the father wo n't pay - or wo n't pay enough - is rising from year to year .
it 's not without reason that children are often portrayed as a poverty risk in germany , not least because in the case of divorce , the cost of raising a child is mostly borne by just one parent , in most cases , the mother . the legal dispute also raises the question whether a parent 's love - in this case , a father 's love - is determined by genetics ?
does a man love his child only because it carries his genes ?
or does he love the child as a person ? those who answer the first question with " yes " would , by that logic , also have to be against every form of adoption , because , if that were the case , it would be impossible to love an adopted child . numbers impossible to prove there 's also the question of whether the numbers in this debate are correct - whether every fifth child in germany is , in fact , the child of an adulterous relationship .
there 's no real way to verify this - even the federal statistics office would have to pass . so are we really dealing with a modern myth , one that plays on age-old fears ?
men 's fear of being cheated on by their wives seems to have staying-power . but if the numbers are right , then they would imply that endless numbers of " faithful " husbands were fathering babies with women other than their wives .
for this reason alone , you 'd expect men to be a little calmer about the whole issue . calmness is also advisable , because the court 's verdict is , essentially , correct .
if genetic tests conducted without the consent of those affected were admissible in court , then the consequences of such male vanity would be more than widespread . in principle , every employer could then secretly carry out genetic tests on staff members , and make further employment dependent on their risk of illness . insurance firms would have the same right .
the nice insurance salesman who makes house calls to draw up contracts for his customers would only have to politely ask to use the toilet to collect dna samples for every member of the family .
insurance premiums according to our genetic disposition would become the norm - and certainly , no one wants that . helle jeppesen -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fathers ' rights suffer setback german politicians seeking to outlaw secret paternity tests won a first battle on wednesday , much to the disappointment of fathers ' rights groups hoping for greater justice in the areas of alimony and child support .

a federal court in germany has ruled that secret paternity tests are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit , as such tests hurt the personal rights of the child .
it was the right decision . it 's not the hens , but rather the roosters who 've been clucking and cackling for days now in the great german chicken run . but unfortunately humans do n't live like birds , since everything would be so much easier . either there 'd be a maximum of one rooster per henhouse , meaning paternity could be established without a doubt .
or else the hens would live among themselves .
this would rule out the hatching of any little chicks , but at least the question of paternity would be moot . but no , people are complicated .
and social debates in germany are even more complicated .
on the one hand , germans have been complaining for years about declining birth rates , and moaning that women today neither have the time nor the desire to have kids . on the other hand , those women that do become mothers are accused of being promiscuous and cuckolding their husbands by tricking them into supporting children that are not their own . what is a father ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the background to an essential question : what is a father ?
is he the man that a child grows up with , who shares in the responsibility and joy that comes with raising a child ?
or is a father the man who bears financial responsibility for a child , even against his will ?
we all know there are enough of those around . the number of single mothers supporting their children on welfare because the father wo n't pay - or wo n't pay enough - is rising from year to year .
it 's not without reason that children are often portrayed as a poverty risk in germany , not least because in the case of divorce , the cost of raising a child is mostly borne by just one parent , in most cases , the mother . the legal dispute also raises the question whether a parent 's love - in this case , a father 's love - is determined by genetics ?
does a man love his child only because it carries his genes ?
or does he love the child as a person ? those who answer the first question with " yes " would , by that logic , also have to be against every form of adoption , because , if that were the case , it would be impossible to love an adopted child . numbers impossible to prove there 's also the question of whether the numbers in this debate are correct - whether every fifth child in germany is , in fact , the child of an adulterous relationship .
there 's no real way to verify this - even the federal statistics office would have to pass . so are we really dealing with a modern myth , one that plays on age-old fears ?
men 's fear of being cheated on by their wives seems to have staying-power . but if the numbers are right , then they would imply that endless numbers of " faithful " husbands were fathering babies with women other than their wives .
for this reason alone , you 'd expect men to be a little calmer about the whole issue . calmness is also advisable , because the court 's verdict is , essentially , correct .
if genetic tests conducted without the consent of those affected were admissible in court , then the consequences of such male vanity would be more than widespread . in principle , every employer could then secretly carry out genetic tests on staff members , and make further employment dependent on their risk of illness . insurance firms would have the same right .

a federal court in germany has ruled that secret paternity tests are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit , as such tests hurt the personal rights of the child .
it was the right decision . it 's not the hens , but rather the roosters who 've been clucking and cackling for days now in the great german chicken run . but unfortunately humans do n't live like birds , since everything would be so much easier . either there 'd be a maximum of one rooster per henhouse , meaning paternity could be established without a doubt .
or else the hens would live among themselves .
this would rule out the hatching of any little chicks , but at least the question of paternity would be moot . but no , people are complicated .
and social debates in germany are even more complicated .
on the one hand , germans have been complaining for years about declining birth rates , and moaning that women today neither have the time nor the desire to have kids . on the other hand , those women that do become mothers are accused of being promiscuous and cuckolding their husbands by tricking them into supporting children that are not their own . what is a father ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the background to an essential question : what is a father ?
is he the man that a child grows up with , who shares in the responsibility and joy that comes with raising a child ?
or is a father the man who bears financial responsibility for a child , even against his will ?
we all know there are enough of those around . the number of single mothers supporting their children on welfare because the father wo n't pay - or wo n't pay enough - is rising from year to year .
it 's not without reason that children are often portrayed as a poverty risk in germany , not least because in the case of divorce , the cost of raising a child is mostly borne by just one parent , in most cases , the mother . the legal dispute also raises the question whether a parent 's love - in this case , a father 's love - is determined by genetics ?
does a man love his child only because it carries his genes ?
or does he love the child as a person ? those who answer the first question with " yes " would , by that logic , also have to be against every form of adoption , because , if that were the case , it would be impossible to love an adopted child . numbers impossible to prove there 's also the question of whether the numbers in this debate are correct - whether every fifth child in germany is , in fact , the child of an adulterous relationship .
there 's no real way to verify this - even the federal statistics office would have to pass . so are we really dealing with a modern myth , one that plays on age-old fears ?
men 's fear of being cheated on by their wives seems to have staying-power . but if the numbers are right , then they would imply that endless numbers of " faithful " husbands were fathering babies with women other than their wives .
for this reason alone , you 'd expect men to be a little calmer about the whole issue . calmness is also advisable , because the court 's verdict is , essentially , correct .
if genetic tests conducted without the consent of those affected were admissible in court , then the consequences of such male vanity would be more than widespread . in principle , every employer could then secretly carry out genetic tests on staff members , and make further employment dependent on their risk of illness . insurance firms would have the same right .
the nice insurance salesman who makes house calls to draw up contracts for his customers would only have to politely ask to use the toilet to collect dna samples for every member of the family .
insurance premiums according to our genetic disposition would become the norm - and certainly , no one wants that . helle jeppesen -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fathers ' rights suffer setback german politicians seeking to outlaw secret paternity tests won a first battle on wednesday , much to the disappointment of fathers ' rights groups hoping for greater justice in the areas of alimony and child support .

however , esa can only guess what is waiting for huygens on the surface , which could be anything from icy rock to a boggy mush or even a sea of methane .

the mission hopes to help unravel the mystery of how life evolved on earth . it is in titan 's soupy nitrogen-heavy atmosphere that huygens will look for clues to uncover the earth 's chemical makeup from over four billion years ago .
the high-profile space exploration mission will also mark the first time an unmanned probe lands on an object in the outer solar system . once the 320-kilogram spacecraft breaks through the atmosphere , scientists at esa mission control in darmstadt , germany , will use its six specialized instruments to gather data .
however , esa can only guess what is waiting for huygens on the surface , which could be anything from icy rock to a boggy mush or even a sea of methane . " the excitement is growing – over seven years of work has gone into this moment , " gerhard schwehm , esa 's head of planetary science , told dw-world .

the mission hopes to help unravel the mystery of how life evolved on earth . it is in titan 's soupy nitrogen-heavy atmosphere that huygens will look for clues to uncover the earth 's chemical makeup from over four billion years ago .
the high-profile space exploration mission will also mark the first time an unmanned probe lands on an object in the outer solar system . once the 320-kilogram spacecraft breaks through the atmosphere , scientists at esa mission control in darmstadt , germany , will use its six specialized instruments to gather data .
however , esa can only guess what is waiting for huygens on the surface , which could be anything from icy rock to a boggy mush or even a sea of methane . " the excitement is growing – over seven years of work has gone into this moment , " gerhard schwehm , esa 's head of planetary science , told dw-world .
" titan is very special .
nobody knows exactly what we 'll find there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : purple haze is seen around the saturn moon titan on tuesday , oct .
26 , 2004 as the nasa / esa cassini-huygens spacecraft makes a fly-by of saturn 's largest moon - the closest ever performed .
the probe got its name from christiaan huygens , the dutch astronomer who discovered titan in 1655 .

costing $ 3.2 billion -lrb- € 2.5 billion -rrb- , the two have hurtled toward saturn since their launch in october 1997 .
but the combined weight of cassini-huygens was more than any direct rocket flight could handle .
so in order to get to saturn , nasa sent the spacecraft on a 2.1-billion-kilometer -lrb- 1.3-billion-mile -rrb- journey , including two trips around venus and one each past the earth and jupiter to make use of the planets ' gravity for a slingshot effect . cassini-huygens reached saturn 's orbit last summer .

during its 140-minute descent by parachute , the probe is likely to be buffeted by strong winds and will face freezing temperatures plunging to -180 celsius .
if it even makes it to the surface intact , huygens will then begin to survey what titan is like on the ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of the huygens probe shortly after landing on titan .
the space probe is due to blast off for saturn and its mysterious cloud-covered moon titan monday october 13 1997 , from cape canaveral .
the cassini-huygens mission , a joint venture between nasa and the european space agency , is one of the most ambitious space exploration attempts ever undertaken .
however , esa expects the probe 's batteries will only survive for a matter of hours under the harsh conditions .
and regardless of how long huygens holds out , cassini will no longer be able to receive data from the surface once it disappears beyond the moon 's horizon . " we hope to get the first information around 2 p.m. , 3 p.m.

esa is hoping for better reception for huygens on titan than its last planetary exploration mission .

a majority of dw-world readers said he should publicly apologize for his behavior . a public apology from prince harry should include the following : his utter humility in making the declaration ; a candid display of understanding that his entire life is the exception of privacy legislation and that therefore he has no defense in the context of a private party ; a recognition that he has offended many good people and that a knowledge of history is not a disposable commodity but an essential element of democratic monarchies such as britain .
he should show the world that he understands why associating himself with the national socialist party is repugnant , why wearing its regalia is not without meaning beyond the confines of his socializing .
that said - it is worthwhile to note that so little has been explained why another member of the family would also be going to a " native and colonials " fancy dress party - which sounds somewhat racist to me .
but then , i 'm a canadian , and not so sophisticated . - david woodward , canada he should not merely visit auschwitz , he should undergo a few weeks of living like the prisoners at auschwitz .
perhaps his life of privilege and excused childish behavior could be turned around by enduring some hardship .
harry 's apology is not enough ; he should face serious consequences for such hateful and insensitive behavior . - d. friberg , us it would be interesting to know some of the other costumes worn to this " native and colonial " party .
the british should not be too proud of how they treated the natives during colonial times .
yet , i did not hear any africans or indians complaining about this party theme or how they , doubtlessly , were ridiculed at this party .
it 's just possible , is n't it , that harry was trying to tell his countrymen something ! - heike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : news agent roy ottoway reads a copy of tabloid ' the sun ' , whose front page shows a picture of britain 's prince harry wearing a nazi soldier 's uniform to a fancy dress party it is a disgrace for the royal member to display such insensivity toward the past suffering of others .
regardless of his royal status , he should be punished according to the law of the land .
if he is spared from such " stupid " display , it is simply another excurse to protect him .
agree or not , he is still a human being , flesh and blood , and is not any better than other human being .
he should make apology in person if he is man enough .
i challenge him to do so .
if he dares to do it , he should be brave enough to accept the consequence .
the excuse of " poor " choice is quite lame .
to be a man , you have to prove it , harry . - chhan d. touch , us harry should apologize in person .
i live in the us , was born in the netherlands , and lived under the dreadful nazi regime from 1940-1945 .
no one who has any idea of the horrors inflicted by hitler and his supporters would do what harry did .
stupid , ignorant and arrogant - that 's what it is ! - walter g. bruinsma , us not only should harry apologize to both the british people and german people via television and radio immediately , he should be sent to germany by his father , prince charles , for a one-year german immersion course .
he should also be advised by the authorities at sandhurst that his application to attend is no longer acceptable or wanted .

a majority of dw-world readers said he should publicly apologize for his behavior . a public apology from prince harry should include the following : his utter humility in making the declaration ; a candid display of understanding that his entire life is the exception of privacy legislation and that therefore he has no defense in the context of a private party ; a recognition that he has offended many good people and that a knowledge of history is not a disposable commodity but an essential element of democratic monarchies such as britain .
he should show the world that he understands why associating himself with the national socialist party is repugnant , why wearing its regalia is not without meaning beyond the confines of his socializing .
that said - it is worthwhile to note that so little has been explained why another member of the family would also be going to a " native and colonials " fancy dress party - which sounds somewhat racist to me .
but then , i 'm a canadian , and not so sophisticated . - david woodward , canada he should not merely visit auschwitz , he should undergo a few weeks of living like the prisoners at auschwitz .
perhaps his life of privilege and excused childish behavior could be turned around by enduring some hardship .
harry 's apology is not enough ; he should face serious consequences for such hateful and insensitive behavior . - d. friberg , us it would be interesting to know some of the other costumes worn to this " native and colonial " party .

if he is spared from such " stupid " display , it is simply another excurse to protect him .
agree or not , he is still a human being , flesh and blood , and is not any better than other human being .
he should make apology in person if he is man enough .

i live in the us , was born in the netherlands , and lived under the dreadful nazi regime from 1940-1945 .

a majority of dw-world readers said he should publicly apologize for his behavior . a public apology from prince harry should include the following : his utter humility in making the declaration ; a candid display of understanding that his entire life is the exception of privacy legislation and that therefore he has no defense in the context of a private party ; a recognition that he has offended many good people and that a knowledge of history is not a disposable commodity but an essential element of democratic monarchies such as britain .
he should show the world that he understands why associating himself with the national socialist party is repugnant , why wearing its regalia is not without meaning beyond the confines of his socializing .
that said - it is worthwhile to note that so little has been explained why another member of the family would also be going to a " native and colonials " fancy dress party - which sounds somewhat racist to me .
but then , i 'm a canadian , and not so sophisticated . - david woodward , canada he should not merely visit auschwitz , he should undergo a few weeks of living like the prisoners at auschwitz .
perhaps his life of privilege and excused childish behavior could be turned around by enduring some hardship .
harry 's apology is not enough ; he should face serious consequences for such hateful and insensitive behavior . - d. friberg , us it would be interesting to know some of the other costumes worn to this " native and colonial " party .
the british should not be too proud of how they treated the natives during colonial times .
yet , i did not hear any africans or indians complaining about this party theme or how they , doubtlessly , were ridiculed at this party .

regardless of his royal status , he should be punished according to the law of the land .
if he is spared from such " stupid " display , it is simply another excurse to protect him .
agree or not , he is still a human being , flesh and blood , and is not any better than other human being .
he should make apology in person if he is man enough .
i challenge him to do so .
if he dares to do it , he should be brave enough to accept the consequence .
the excuse of " poor " choice is quite lame .

i live in the us , was born in the netherlands , and lived under the dreadful nazi regime from 1940-1945 .

stupid , ignorant and arrogant - that 's what it is ! - walter g. bruinsma , us not only should harry apologize to both the british people and german people via television and radio immediately , he should be sent to germany by his father , prince charles , for a one-year german immersion course .

he should know better .
he offended all decent people including modern germans , jews , members of the resistance and all those who died to eradicate that hated symbol .
i am not a moralist and do not shock easily but this was in such bad taste that it goes beyond the pale .
nothing he does in the future will ever eradicate this stupidity , even if he worked in calcutta with the poor for the next 20 years .

prince harry is a young man who in the eyes of some did a foolish thing and did not anticipate that media hyenas would get on his tail .

a majority of dw-world readers said he should publicly apologize for his behavior . a public apology from prince harry should include the following : his utter humility in making the declaration ; a candid display of understanding that his entire life is the exception of privacy legislation and that therefore he has no defense in the context of a private party ; a recognition that he has offended many good people and that a knowledge of history is not a disposable commodity but an essential element of democratic monarchies such as britain .
he should show the world that he understands why associating himself with the national socialist party is repugnant , why wearing its regalia is not without meaning beyond the confines of his socializing .
that said - it is worthwhile to note that so little has been explained why another member of the family would also be going to a " native and colonials " fancy dress party - which sounds somewhat racist to me .
but then , i 'm a canadian , and not so sophisticated . - david woodward , canada he should not merely visit auschwitz , he should undergo a few weeks of living like the prisoners at auschwitz .
perhaps his life of privilege and excused childish behavior could be turned around by enduring some hardship .
harry 's apology is not enough ; he should face serious consequences for such hateful and insensitive behavior . - d. friberg , us it would be interesting to know some of the other costumes worn to this " native and colonial " party .
the british should not be too proud of how they treated the natives during colonial times .
yet , i did not hear any africans or indians complaining about this party theme or how they , doubtlessly , were ridiculed at this party .
it 's just possible , is n't it , that harry was trying to tell his countrymen something ! - heike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : news agent roy ottoway reads a copy of tabloid ' the sun ' , whose front page shows a picture of britain 's prince harry wearing a nazi soldier 's uniform to a fancy dress party it is a disgrace for the royal member to display such insensivity toward the past suffering of others .
regardless of his royal status , he should be punished according to the law of the land .
if he is spared from such " stupid " display , it is simply another excurse to protect him .
agree or not , he is still a human being , flesh and blood , and is not any better than other human being .
he should make apology in person if he is man enough .
i challenge him to do so .
if he dares to do it , he should be brave enough to accept the consequence .
the excuse of " poor " choice is quite lame .
to be a man , you have to prove it , harry . - chhan d. touch , us harry should apologize in person .
i live in the us , was born in the netherlands , and lived under the dreadful nazi regime from 1940-1945 .
no one who has any idea of the horrors inflicted by hitler and his supporters would do what harry did .
stupid , ignorant and arrogant - that 's what it is ! - walter g. bruinsma , us not only should harry apologize to both the british people and german people via television and radio immediately , he should be sent to germany by his father , prince charles , for a one-year german immersion course .

21 condemning inconsistencies in eu customs rules , which are handled differently by different states in the 25-member bloc . lack of uniformity cited " consultations between the us and the eu were held in mid-november , but were unable to resolve the dispute , " said a statement by the us trade representative 's office . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : 10 eastern states joined the eu on may 1 .
" although the eu is a customs union , there is no single eu customs administration , " it added .
" lack of uniformity , coupled with lack of procedures for prompt eu-wide review , can hinder us exports , particularly for small to mid-size businesses . " wto rules require wto members to administer their customs laws in a uniform , impartial and reasonable manner .
they also require members to provide tribunals for prompt review and correction of administrative action relating to customs matters .
the united states considers that the eu fails to meet either of these requirements . " customs treatment is a longstanding us complaint , but the administration said it was acting now because 10 new members joined the european union on may 1 , 2004 . examining sugar subsidies meanwhile , the european union lodged an appeal on thursday against a wto ruling that branded subsidies for sugar production as illegal , an eu spokesman said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sugar " we have extremely solid foundations to allow our view to prevail in an appeal , " fabian delcros , a spokesman for the eu delegation to the wto , told afp . the eu 's move came one month after the three countries that filed the original complaint against the eu subsidies - australia , brazil and thailand - agreed to extend the deadline for an appeal , which had been due to expire in december . the wto dispute-settlement body had ruled last october that subsidized exports from the eu had been exceeding an agreed 1,273,000 ton-per-year export limit since 1995 . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to lift trade sanctions against us the eu commission acted monday to ease trade tensions with the united states , saying it would lift sanctions after us president george w. bush approved a repeal of illegal corporate tax breaks .

the mission hopes to help unravel the mystery of how life evolved on earth . it is in titan 's soupy nitrogen-heavy atmosphere that huygens will look for clues to uncover the earth 's chemical makeup from over four billion years ago .
the high-profile space exploration mission will also mark the first time an unmanned probe lands on an object in the outer solar system . once the 320-kilogram spacecraft breaks through the atmosphere , scientists at esa mission control in darmstadt , germany , will use its six specialized instruments to gather data .
however , esa can only guess what is waiting for huygens on the surface , which could be anything from icy rock to a boggy mush or even a sea of methane .

but it is n't easy : iran is still suspected of developing nuclear weapons . at the start of a meeting in brussels between the eu and iran this week , officials from both countries had to feel each other out , to see what , if anything , could be salvaged from trade talks broken off in june 2002 . the result of this week 's meeting was an agreement to come together again in two months ' time .
a potential trade accord is seen by the eu as a reward for tehran , should the country keep the reins of its nuclear weapons development program pulled tightly in . meanwhile , iranian officials on thursday only allowed un weapons inspectors restricted access to a military compound the united states suspects of being connected to a secret program for developing atomic weapons . mutual threats in late november , after much high-profile discussion and debate , the un international atomic energy commission -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna determined that iran was complying with an agreement to stop enriching uranium , which could be used for developing nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. nuclear inspectors at the headquarters of the international atomic energy agency in vienna " as long as iran does not pursue its atomic weapons program , it can count on improved relations with the eu , " said eu commisioner for foreign relations benita ferrero waldner on tuesday in brussels . in december , iranian foreign minister kamal charrasi had said the atomic program would only be suspended as long as trade talks with the eu showed progress . restricted access nonetheless , on thursday iranian officials limited the access of weapons inspectors to a military compound in parchin , iran .
iran accused the un weapons inspectors of spying during the inspection , reuters news service reported . " we are vigilant " the head of the atomic program talks , hussein musawian , told the iranian news agency mehr .
inspectors were allowed onto the grounds of the compound but not into any buildings . in terms of the eu-tehran trade talks , one of the goals is to eventually lay down a legal basis for a relationship between teheran and brussels , which has not existed since the shah fell from power in 1979 .
iran is one of the few countries in the world that has no cooperation agreement with the eu . the trade agreement is aimed at encouraging iran to undertake reforms , with the eventual integration of iran into the world trade organization an ultimate goal .
on a purely economic basis , the country is well capable of wto entry , eu officials say .
but until now , the united states had blocked that entry on political grounds . trade accord as part of the trade accords , already low import duties from iran into the eu should be made permanent , and if possible lowered .
for its part , the eu expects tariff reductions and the granting of more legal security to investors . because of its relatively strong economic growth and need for investment , iran is an interesting market for the european union , experts say .
european firms currently deliver machinery , vehicles and chemicals to iran .
oil companies are interested in exploiting iranian oil and gas fields .
volkswagen is bringing a small car out on the iranian market ; the parts will be made in brazil but assembled in iran . the united states is distrustful of the trade talks ; washington has repeatedly expressed doubts that iran has permanently stopped its atomic weapons program .
and teheran has already broken promises made during talks in the autumn of 2003 . moderate course after iran 's islamic revolution , the united states broke ties with iran ; us president george w. bush named it as part of the " axis of evil " due to its support of terrorist groups and the suspected atomic weapons development .
the european union , on the other hand , has long taken a more moderate course with teheran , claiming the 70 million iranians are needed for geostrategic stability in the turbulent region . in parallel talks with the eu commission , great britain , france and germany have been talking with iran since mid-december , over an agreement to stop uranium enrichment .
should the iaeo atomic energy commission agree that iran has been secretly working on closed-circuit atomic energy , the eu said the talks will come to a halt . but for now , eu officials said , the plan is to continue talks at bimonthly meetings . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear freeze temporary , iran warns iran warned that it is not prepared to permanently freeze its controversial nuclear fuel work and that it expected quick results from crucial talks on monday with britain , france and germany .

a majority of dw-world readers said he should publicly apologize for his behavior . a public apology from prince harry should include the following : his utter humility in making the declaration ; a candid display of understanding that his entire life is the exception of privacy legislation and that therefore he has no defense in the context of a private party ; a recognition that he has offended many good people and that a knowledge of history is not a disposable commodity but an essential element of democratic monarchies such as britain .
he should show the world that he understands why associating himself with the national socialist party is repugnant , why wearing its regalia is not without meaning beyond the confines of his socializing .
that said - it is worthwhile to note that so little has been explained why another member of the family would also be going to a " native and colonials " fancy dress party - which sounds somewhat racist to me .
but then , i 'm a canadian , and not so sophisticated . - david woodward , canada he should not merely visit auschwitz , he should undergo a few weeks of living like the prisoners at auschwitz .
perhaps his life of privilege and excused childish behavior could be turned around by enduring some hardship .
harry 's apology is not enough ; he should face serious consequences for such hateful and insensitive behavior . - d. friberg , us it would be interesting to know some of the other costumes worn to this " native and colonial " party .
the british should not be too proud of how they treated the natives during colonial times .
yet , i did not hear any africans or indians complaining about this party theme or how they , doubtlessly , were ridiculed at this party .
it 's just possible , is n't it , that harry was trying to tell his countrymen something ! - heike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : news agent roy ottoway reads a copy of tabloid ' the sun ' , whose front page shows a picture of britain 's prince harry wearing a nazi soldier 's uniform to a fancy dress party it is a disgrace for the royal member to display such insensivity toward the past suffering of others .
regardless of his royal status , he should be punished according to the law of the land .
if he is spared from such " stupid " display , it is simply another excurse to protect him .
agree or not , he is still a human being , flesh and blood , and is not any better than other human being .
he should make apology in person if he is man enough .
i challenge him to do so .
if he dares to do it , he should be brave enough to accept the consequence .
the excuse of " poor " choice is quite lame .
to be a man , you have to prove it , harry . - chhan d. touch , us harry should apologize in person .
i live in the us , was born in the netherlands , and lived under the dreadful nazi regime from 1940-1945 .
no one who has any idea of the horrors inflicted by hitler and his supporters would do what harry did .
stupid , ignorant and arrogant - that 's what it is ! - walter g. bruinsma , us not only should harry apologize to both the british people and german people via television and radio immediately , he should be sent to germany by his father , prince charles , for a one-year german immersion course .
he should also be advised by the authorities at sandhurst that his application to attend is no longer acceptable or wanted .
he is an absolute disgrace and embarrassment to both the queen , his grandmother , and to his father . - john a. brown , canada please click on the second page to read more comments . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prince harry offends with nazi gaffe britain 's prince harry has made many gaffes in his public life - smoking cannabis , underage drinking , scuffling with photographers .

but it is n't easy : iran is still suspected of developing nuclear weapons . at the start of a meeting in brussels between the eu and iran this week , officials from both countries had to feel each other out , to see what , if anything , could be salvaged from trade talks broken off in june 2002 . the result of this week 's meeting was an agreement to come together again in two months ' time .
a potential trade accord is seen by the eu as a reward for tehran , should the country keep the reins of its nuclear weapons development program pulled tightly in . meanwhile , iranian officials on thursday only allowed un weapons inspectors restricted access to a military compound the united states suspects of being connected to a secret program for developing atomic weapons . mutual threats in late november , after much high-profile discussion and debate , the un international atomic energy commission -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna determined that iran was complying with an agreement to stop enriching uranium , which could be used for developing nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. nuclear inspectors at the headquarters of the international atomic energy agency in vienna " as long as iran does not pursue its atomic weapons program , it can count on improved relations with the eu , " said eu commisioner for foreign relations benita ferrero waldner on tuesday in brussels . in december , iranian foreign minister kamal charrasi had said the atomic program would only be suspended as long as trade talks with the eu showed progress . restricted access nonetheless , on thursday iranian officials limited the access of weapons inspectors to a military compound in parchin , iran .
iran accused the un weapons inspectors of spying during the inspection , reuters news service reported . " we are vigilant " the head of the atomic program talks , hussein musawian , told the iranian news agency mehr .
inspectors were allowed onto the grounds of the compound but not into any buildings . in terms of the eu-tehran trade talks , one of the goals is to eventually lay down a legal basis for a relationship between teheran and brussels , which has not existed since the shah fell from power in 1979 .
iran is one of the few countries in the world that has no cooperation agreement with the eu . the trade agreement is aimed at encouraging iran to undertake reforms , with the eventual integration of iran into the world trade organization an ultimate goal .
on a purely economic basis , the country is well capable of wto entry , eu officials say .
but until now , the united states had blocked that entry on political grounds . trade accord as part of the trade accords , already low import duties from iran into the eu should be made permanent , and if possible lowered .
for its part , the eu expects tariff reductions and the granting of more legal security to investors . because of its relatively strong economic growth and need for investment , iran is an interesting market for the european union , experts say .
european firms currently deliver machinery , vehicles and chemicals to iran .
oil companies are interested in exploiting iranian oil and gas fields .
volkswagen is bringing a small car out on the iranian market ; the parts will be made in brazil but assembled in iran . the united states is distrustful of the trade talks ; washington has repeatedly expressed doubts that iran has permanently stopped its atomic weapons program .
and teheran has already broken promises made during talks in the autumn of 2003 . moderate course after iran 's islamic revolution , the united states broke ties with iran ; us president george w. bush named it as part of the " axis of evil " due to its support of terrorist groups and the suspected atomic weapons development .
the european union , on the other hand , has long taken a more moderate course with teheran , claiming the 70 million iranians are needed for geostrategic stability in the turbulent region . in parallel talks with the eu commission , great britain , france and germany have been talking with iran since mid-december , over an agreement to stop uranium enrichment .
should the iaeo atomic energy commission agree that iran has been secretly working on closed-circuit atomic energy , the eu said the talks will come to a halt . but for now , eu officials said , the plan is to continue talks at bimonthly meetings . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear freeze temporary , iran warns iran warned that it is not prepared to permanently freeze its controversial nuclear fuel work and that it expected quick results from crucial talks on monday with britain , france and germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.01.2005 opinion : courts right to bar secret testing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secret paternity tests : just the tip of the iceberg ?
a federal court in germany has ruled that secret paternity tests are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit , as such tests hurt the personal rights of the child .
it was the right decision . it 's not the hens , but rather the roosters who 've been clucking and cackling for days now in the great german chicken run . but unfortunately humans do n't live like birds , since everything would be so much easier . either there 'd be a maximum of one rooster per henhouse , meaning paternity could be established without a doubt .
or else the hens would live among themselves .
this would rule out the hatching of any little chicks , but at least the question of paternity would be moot . but no , people are complicated .
and social debates in germany are even more complicated .
on the one hand , germans have been complaining for years about declining birth rates , and moaning that women today neither have the time nor the desire to have kids . on the other hand , those women that do become mothers are accused of being promiscuous and cuckolding their husbands by tricking them into supporting children that are not their own . what is a father ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the background to an essential question : what is a father ?
is he the man that a child grows up with , who shares in the responsibility and joy that comes with raising a child ?
or is a father the man who bears financial responsibility for a child , even against his will ?
we all know there are enough of those around . the number of single mothers supporting their children on welfare because the father wo n't pay - or wo n't pay enough - is rising from year to year .
it 's not without reason that children are often portrayed as a poverty risk in germany , not least because in the case of divorce , the cost of raising a child is mostly borne by just one parent , in most cases , the mother . the legal dispute also raises the question whether a parent 's love - in this case , a father 's love - is determined by genetics ?
does a man love his child only because it carries his genes ?
or does he love the child as a person ? those who answer the first question with " yes " would , by that logic , also have to be against every form of adoption , because , if that were the case , it would be impossible to love an adopted child . numbers impossible to prove there 's also the question of whether the numbers in this debate are correct - whether every fifth child in germany is , in fact , the child of an adulterous relationship .
there 's no real way to verify this - even the federal statistics office would have to pass . so are we really dealing with a modern myth , one that plays on age-old fears ?
men 's fear of being cheated on by their wives seems to have staying-power . but if the numbers are right , then they would imply that endless numbers of " faithful " husbands were fathering babies with women other than their wives .
for this reason alone , you 'd expect men to be a little calmer about the whole issue . calmness is also advisable , because the court 's verdict is , essentially , correct .
if genetic tests conducted without the consent of those affected were admissible in court , then the consequences of such male vanity would be more than widespread . in principle , every employer could then secretly carry out genetic tests on staff members , and make further employment dependent on their risk of illness . insurance firms would have the same right .
the nice insurance salesman who makes house calls to draw up contracts for his customers would only have to politely ask to use the toilet to collect dna samples for every member of the family .

a federal court in germany has ruled that secret paternity tests are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit , as such tests hurt the personal rights of the child .
it was the right decision . it 's not the hens , but rather the roosters who 've been clucking and cackling for days now in the great german chicken run . but unfortunately humans do n't live like birds , since everything would be so much easier . either there 'd be a maximum of one rooster per henhouse , meaning paternity could be established without a doubt .
or else the hens would live among themselves .
this would rule out the hatching of any little chicks , but at least the question of paternity would be moot . but no , people are complicated .
and social debates in germany are even more complicated .
on the one hand , germans have been complaining for years about declining birth rates , and moaning that women today neither have the time nor the desire to have kids . on the other hand , those women that do become mothers are accused of being promiscuous and cuckolding their husbands by tricking them into supporting children that are not their own . what is a father ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the background to an essential question : what is a father ?
is he the man that a child grows up with , who shares in the responsibility and joy that comes with raising a child ?
or is a father the man who bears financial responsibility for a child , even against his will ?
we all know there are enough of those around . the number of single mothers supporting their children on welfare because the father wo n't pay - or wo n't pay enough - is rising from year to year .
it 's not without reason that children are often portrayed as a poverty risk in germany , not least because in the case of divorce , the cost of raising a child is mostly borne by just one parent , in most cases , the mother . the legal dispute also raises the question whether a parent 's love - in this case , a father 's love - is determined by genetics ?
does a man love his child only because it carries his genes ?
or does he love the child as a person ? those who answer the first question with " yes " would , by that logic , also have to be against every form of adoption , because , if that were the case , it would be impossible to love an adopted child . numbers impossible to prove there 's also the question of whether the numbers in this debate are correct - whether every fifth child in germany is , in fact , the child of an adulterous relationship .
there 's no real way to verify this - even the federal statistics office would have to pass . so are we really dealing with a modern myth , one that plays on age-old fears ?
men 's fear of being cheated on by their wives seems to have staying-power . but if the numbers are right , then they would imply that endless numbers of " faithful " husbands were fathering babies with women other than their wives .
for this reason alone , you 'd expect men to be a little calmer about the whole issue . calmness is also advisable , because the court 's verdict is , essentially , correct .
if genetic tests conducted without the consent of those affected were admissible in court , then the consequences of such male vanity would be more than widespread . in principle , every employer could then secretly carry out genetic tests on staff members , and make further employment dependent on their risk of illness . insurance firms would have the same right .
the nice insurance salesman who makes house calls to draw up contracts for his customers would only have to politely ask to use the toilet to collect dna samples for every member of the family .
insurance premiums according to our genetic disposition would become the norm - and certainly , no one wants that . helle jeppesen -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fathers ' rights suffer setback german politicians seeking to outlaw secret paternity tests won a first battle on wednesday , much to the disappointment of fathers ' rights groups hoping for greater justice in the areas of alimony and child support .

a potential trade accord is seen by the eu as a reward for tehran , should the country keep the reins of its nuclear weapons development program pulled tightly in . meanwhile , iranian officials on thursday only allowed un weapons inspectors restricted access to a military compound the united states suspects of being connected to a secret program for developing atomic weapons . mutual threats in late november , after much high-profile discussion and debate , the un international atomic energy commission -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna determined that iran was complying with an agreement to stop enriching uranium , which could be used for developing nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. nuclear inspectors at the headquarters of the international atomic energy agency in vienna " as long as iran does not pursue its atomic weapons program , it can count on improved relations with the eu , " said eu commisioner for foreign relations benita ferrero waldner on tuesday in brussels . in december , iranian foreign minister kamal charrasi had said the atomic program would only be suspended as long as trade talks with the eu showed progress . restricted access nonetheless , on thursday iranian officials limited the access of weapons inspectors to a military compound in parchin , iran .
iran accused the un weapons inspectors of spying during the inspection , reuters news service reported . " we are vigilant " the head of the atomic program talks , hussein musawian , told the iranian news agency mehr .
inspectors were allowed onto the grounds of the compound but not into any buildings . in terms of the eu-tehran trade talks , one of the goals is to eventually lay down a legal basis for a relationship between teheran and brussels , which has not existed since the shah fell from power in 1979 .
iran is one of the few countries in the world that has no cooperation agreement with the eu . the trade agreement is aimed at encouraging iran to undertake reforms , with the eventual integration of iran into the world trade organization an ultimate goal .
on a purely economic basis , the country is well capable of wto entry , eu officials say .
but until now , the united states had blocked that entry on political grounds . trade accord as part of the trade accords , already low import duties from iran into the eu should be made permanent , and if possible lowered .
for its part , the eu expects tariff reductions and the granting of more legal security to investors . because of its relatively strong economic growth and need for investment , iran is an interesting market for the european union , experts say .
european firms currently deliver machinery , vehicles and chemicals to iran .
oil companies are interested in exploiting iranian oil and gas fields .
volkswagen is bringing a small car out on the iranian market ; the parts will be made in brazil but assembled in iran . the united states is distrustful of the trade talks ; washington has repeatedly expressed doubts that iran has permanently stopped its atomic weapons program .
and teheran has already broken promises made during talks in the autumn of 2003 . moderate course after iran 's islamic revolution , the united states broke ties with iran ; us president george w. bush named it as part of the " axis of evil " due to its support of terrorist groups and the suspected atomic weapons development .
the european union , on the other hand , has long taken a more moderate course with teheran , claiming the 70 million iranians are needed for geostrategic stability in the turbulent region . in parallel talks with the eu commission , great britain , france and germany have been talking with iran since mid-december , over an agreement to stop uranium enrichment .
should the iaeo atomic energy commission agree that iran has been secretly working on closed-circuit atomic energy , the eu said the talks will come to a halt . but for now , eu officials said , the plan is to continue talks at bimonthly meetings . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear freeze temporary , iran warns iran warned that it is not prepared to permanently freeze its controversial nuclear fuel work and that it expected quick results from crucial talks on monday with britain , france and germany .

a federal court in germany has ruled that secret paternity tests are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit , as such tests hurt the personal rights of the child .
it was the right decision . it 's not the hens , but rather the roosters who 've been clucking and cackling for days now in the great german chicken run . but unfortunately humans do n't live like birds , since everything would be so much easier . either there 'd be a maximum of one rooster per henhouse , meaning paternity could be established without a doubt .
or else the hens would live among themselves .
this would rule out the hatching of any little chicks , but at least the question of paternity would be moot . but no , people are complicated .
and social debates in germany are even more complicated .
on the one hand , germans have been complaining for years about declining birth rates , and moaning that women today neither have the time nor the desire to have kids . on the other hand , those women that do become mothers are accused of being promiscuous and cuckolding their husbands by tricking them into supporting children that are not their own . what is a father ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the background to an essential question : what is a father ?
is he the man that a child grows up with , who shares in the responsibility and joy that comes with raising a child ?
or is a father the man who bears financial responsibility for a child , even against his will ?
we all know there are enough of those around . the number of single mothers supporting their children on welfare because the father wo n't pay - or wo n't pay enough - is rising from year to year .
it 's not without reason that children are often portrayed as a poverty risk in germany , not least because in the case of divorce , the cost of raising a child is mostly borne by just one parent , in most cases , the mother . the legal dispute also raises the question whether a parent 's love - in this case , a father 's love - is determined by genetics ?
does a man love his child only because it carries his genes ?
or does he love the child as a person ? those who answer the first question with " yes " would , by that logic , also have to be against every form of adoption , because , if that were the case , it would be impossible to love an adopted child . numbers impossible to prove there 's also the question of whether the numbers in this debate are correct - whether every fifth child in germany is , in fact , the child of an adulterous relationship .
there 's no real way to verify this - even the federal statistics office would have to pass . so are we really dealing with a modern myth , one that plays on age-old fears ?
men 's fear of being cheated on by their wives seems to have staying-power . but if the numbers are right , then they would imply that endless numbers of " faithful " husbands were fathering babies with women other than their wives .
for this reason alone , you 'd expect men to be a little calmer about the whole issue . calmness is also advisable , because the court 's verdict is , essentially , correct .
if genetic tests conducted without the consent of those affected were admissible in court , then the consequences of such male vanity would be more than widespread . in principle , every employer could then secretly carry out genetic tests on staff members , and make further employment dependent on their risk of illness . insurance firms would have the same right .
the nice insurance salesman who makes house calls to draw up contracts for his customers would only have to politely ask to use the toilet to collect dna samples for every member of the family .
insurance premiums according to our genetic disposition would become the norm - and certainly , no one wants that . helle jeppesen -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fathers ' rights suffer setback german politicians seeking to outlaw secret paternity tests won a first battle on wednesday , much to the disappointment of fathers ' rights groups hoping for greater justice in the areas of alimony and child support .

janssen did not comment on his resignation himself and his local party chapter simply stated that he resigned because he did not want to burden his family and his spd party with speculations about his income any longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jann-peter janssen a backbencher from the germany 's north sea coast , janssen -lrb- photo -rrb- entered parliament in 1994 .
before his election , he had worked as a workers ' council representative at vw . five other social democrats were also listed by vw officials as paid employees . undisclosed payments and perks paid by german industry to members of parliament have outraged the public and prompted a hectic search among mps for a way to keep all politicians from being tainted by the scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurenz meyer after announcing his resignation on dec .
22 but it has already claimed the careers of two prominent conservative politicians .
cdu general secretary laurenz meyer -lrb- photo -rrb- and the party ’ s labor affairs spokesman , herman-josef arendtz , were forced to step down a month ago after they admitted they had received undeclared payments from the energy giant rwe . vw wants to halt payments on thursday it was the social democrats turn to eat humble pie , after german automaker volkwagen disclosed that two spd members of parliament , four regional assembly lawmakers and more than 300 minor local politicians were on its payroll . vw chief executive bernd pischetsrieder admitted that the payments had been made in violation of the companies own rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pischetsrieder " as a matter of fact , our rules allow such payments only if politicians are still actively working for the company and if it helps to facilitate the future re-integration into volkswagen , " he said . volkswagen is now planning to halt all payments to politicians and toughen its stipulations .
vw workers , however , are outraged by the fact that politicians are handed perks while the company staff will have to endure a two-year freeze on salaries to cut costs at vw . " i can not accept that , " one vw employee told dw-radio .
" if i were going to moonlight in other jobs , i would face punishment , but politicians , i assume , will be off the hook . " another worker agreed and added it was unbelievable that politicians could earn a second salary without doing anything . rwe comes clean in an apparent effort to prevent further revelations , germany ’ s top energy company rwe has now also come clean on its secret payments to politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe headquarters on friday it said that it pays more than € 600,000 -lrb- $ 786,500 -rrb- each year for lobbying activities , but mostly to local politicians .
german politicians are allowed to moonlight in other jobs , but they are obliged to declare any outside employment to avoid conflicts of interest . looking for safeguards wolfgang thierse , the social democratic speaker of parliament and in charge of overseeing the bundestag 's code of conduct , said the cases that have become known so far are all in violation of the rules .
he demands stiffer penalties as a more effective deterrent . " in my view it is important now that germany eventually adopts the international anti-corruption charter , " he said .
" a draft bill to this end has long been put before parliament and it provides for sanctions mechanisms that could have prevented exactly those violations we are experiencing now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse in a recent interview with dw-world 's ibrahim mohamad thierse -lrb- photo , right -rrb- will meet senior members of germany ‘ s main parties next week to discuss legislative measures against corruption .
but he has rejected the idea of requiring all parliamentarians to publicize all of their income , saying that this would harm self-employed entrepreneurs or lawyers , who might suffer competitive disadvantages . in the meantime , german shareholders have vowed to put stern questions to company heads at upcoming annual meetings .

but it is n't easy : iran is still suspected of developing nuclear weapons . at the start of a meeting in brussels between the eu and iran this week , officials from both countries had to feel each other out , to see what , if anything , could be salvaged from trade talks broken off in june 2002 . the result of this week 's meeting was an agreement to come together again in two months ' time .
a potential trade accord is seen by the eu as a reward for tehran , should the country keep the reins of its nuclear weapons development program pulled tightly in . meanwhile , iranian officials on thursday only allowed un weapons inspectors restricted access to a military compound the united states suspects of being connected to a secret program for developing atomic weapons . mutual threats in late november , after much high-profile discussion and debate , the un international atomic energy commission -lrb- iaea -rrb- in vienna determined that iran was complying with an agreement to stop enriching uranium , which could be used for developing nuclear weapons . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.n. nuclear inspectors at the headquarters of the international atomic energy agency in vienna " as long as iran does not pursue its atomic weapons program , it can count on improved relations with the eu , " said eu commisioner for foreign relations benita ferrero waldner on tuesday in brussels . in december , iranian foreign minister kamal charrasi had said the atomic program would only be suspended as long as trade talks with the eu showed progress . restricted access nonetheless , on thursday iranian officials limited the access of weapons inspectors to a military compound in parchin , iran .
iran accused the un weapons inspectors of spying during the inspection , reuters news service reported . " we are vigilant " the head of the atomic program talks , hussein musawian , told the iranian news agency mehr .
inspectors were allowed onto the grounds of the compound but not into any buildings . in terms of the eu-tehran trade talks , one of the goals is to eventually lay down a legal basis for a relationship between teheran and brussels , which has not existed since the shah fell from power in 1979 .
iran is one of the few countries in the world that has no cooperation agreement with the eu . the trade agreement is aimed at encouraging iran to undertake reforms , with the eventual integration of iran into the world trade organization an ultimate goal .
on a purely economic basis , the country is well capable of wto entry , eu officials say .
but until now , the united states had blocked that entry on political grounds . trade accord as part of the trade accords , already low import duties from iran into the eu should be made permanent , and if possible lowered .
for its part , the eu expects tariff reductions and the granting of more legal security to investors . because of its relatively strong economic growth and need for investment , iran is an interesting market for the european union , experts say .
european firms currently deliver machinery , vehicles and chemicals to iran .
oil companies are interested in exploiting iranian oil and gas fields .
volkswagen is bringing a small car out on the iranian market ; the parts will be made in brazil but assembled in iran . the united states is distrustful of the trade talks ; washington has repeatedly expressed doubts that iran has permanently stopped its atomic weapons program .
and teheran has already broken promises made during talks in the autumn of 2003 . moderate course after iran 's islamic revolution , the united states broke ties with iran ; us president george w. bush named it as part of the " axis of evil " due to its support of terrorist groups and the suspected atomic weapons development .
the european union , on the other hand , has long taken a more moderate course with teheran , claiming the 70 million iranians are needed for geostrategic stability in the turbulent region . in parallel talks with the eu commission , great britain , france and germany have been talking with iran since mid-december , over an agreement to stop uranium enrichment .
should the iaeo atomic energy commission agree that iran has been secretly working on closed-circuit atomic energy , the eu said the talks will come to a halt . but for now , eu officials said , the plan is to continue talks at bimonthly meetings . bernd riegert -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuclear freeze temporary , iran warns iran warned that it is not prepared to permanently freeze its controversial nuclear fuel work and that it expected quick results from crucial talks on monday with britain , france and germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 14.01.2005 should harry apologize ?
back to first page back 2/2 his apology should be in public and then the incident should be closed .
but the furor certainly indicates continued world opinion that refuses to acccept that germans -lrb- or at least most germans -rrb- have moved on from the nazi era and are part of a free and democratic society . - channing dichter i feel so sorry for harry .
he needs to grow up and show some respect .
he most certianly does need to apologize in person and yes , make him go to auschwitz and see what went on . - mario delosada , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harry helped pack emergency supplies for victims of the asian tsunamis earlier in january harry should apologize in person and go to visit the death camps .
he should know better .
he offended all decent people including modern germans , jews , members of the resistance and all those who died to eradicate that hated symbol .
i am not a moralist and do not shock easily but this was in such bad taste that it goes beyond the pale .
nothing he does in the future will ever eradicate this stupidity , even if he worked in calcutta with the poor for the next 20 years .
i do n't care in the least how many drugs he takes , how much he drinks or how many women or men he sleeps with .
this is just youthful normality .
however , this latest incident shows something twisted and sick in his character which he will never live down . - alan smith , australia why should prince harry have to bend over backwards to appease the mandarins of " political correctness " - this item made a welcome change on the sun 's front page from seeing the recent rubbish about the tsunami - a media frenzy of pretended " caring " and false sympathy if there ever was one .
it 's all about selling newspapers , is n't it - just like the picture of harry .
these media hypocrites offend me more than harry in his armband . - dave clifton harry knew what he was doing when he thought of wearing it .
and then decided to parade around in it .
a spoiled rich boy who wanted to have some fun , and instead ended up offending people .
yes he should apologize in public .
he may be a prince but he is also suppose to be a symbol of status and education , human compassion , and of leadership .
he does not deserve special breaks in life , he 's only human . - a. katzenberg a tempest in a teacup .
prince harry is a young man who in the eyes of some did a foolish thing and did not anticipate that media hyenas would get on his tail .
our own former prime minister , pierre trudeau , as a young man wore a german wwii helmet with a swastika on it when riding his motorcycle .
foolish ?
yes .
criminal ?
no . - anthony chernushenko , canada yes , he should apologize in public , but this step should come from within himself .
i do n't think one can force him to do this . - t. bjhattacharya it is well-known that there were many nazi sympathizers among the british nobility and upper class and harry should be aware of this .
furthermore , with the upsurge in anti-semitism in europe , such a stupid stunt gives aid and comfort to the self-declared enemies of western civilization .
i hope for the sake of the brits that harry , given his evident stupidity and lack of comon sense , never gets the chance to be king ! - amy , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harry 's brother william -lrb- right -rrb- was reportedly present when harry picked the costume .
william went as a wild cat .
one can not deny that nazism existed ... and this was simply a costume .
he was not necessarily glorifying nazism nor the much hated swastika .
people should quit focusing their attention on the young prince ... he is just a person like anybody else .
had someone else dressed in this matter , it would not have made front page news . - heidi van der muller i must tell of a personal experience .
it was in the 70s in the us .
a friend wore his father 's uniform shirt -lrb- waffen ss -rrb- to a party we both attended .
i took him aside , told him how offensive the shirt was calmly and asked him never to do it again .
he was surpised that it caused offense , did apologize and as far as i know never did wear it again . - sandra levy , us back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prince harry offends with nazi gaffe britain 's prince harry has made many gaffes in his public life - smoking cannabis , underage drinking , scuffling with photographers .

a majority of dw-world readers said he should publicly apologize for his behavior . a public apology from prince harry should include the following : his utter humility in making the declaration ; a candid display of understanding that his entire life is the exception of privacy legislation and that therefore he has no defense in the context of a private party ; a recognition that he has offended many good people and that a knowledge of history is not a disposable commodity but an essential element of democratic monarchies such as britain .
he should show the world that he understands why associating himself with the national socialist party is repugnant , why wearing its regalia is not without meaning beyond the confines of his socializing .
that said - it is worthwhile to note that so little has been explained why another member of the family would also be going to a " native and colonials " fancy dress party - which sounds somewhat racist to me .
but then , i 'm a canadian , and not so sophisticated . - david woodward , canada he should not merely visit auschwitz , he should undergo a few weeks of living like the prisoners at auschwitz .
perhaps his life of privilege and excused childish behavior could be turned around by enduring some hardship .
harry 's apology is not enough ; he should face serious consequences for such hateful and insensitive behavior . - d. friberg , us it would be interesting to know some of the other costumes worn to this " native and colonial " party .
the british should not be too proud of how they treated the natives during colonial times .
yet , i did not hear any africans or indians complaining about this party theme or how they , doubtlessly , were ridiculed at this party .
it 's just possible , is n't it , that harry was trying to tell his countrymen something ! - heike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : news agent roy ottoway reads a copy of tabloid ' the sun ' , whose front page shows a picture of britain 's prince harry wearing a nazi soldier 's uniform to a fancy dress party it is a disgrace for the royal member to display such insensivity toward the past suffering of others .
regardless of his royal status , he should be punished according to the law of the land .
if he is spared from such " stupid " display , it is simply another excurse to protect him .
agree or not , he is still a human being , flesh and blood , and is not any better than other human being .
he should make apology in person if he is man enough .
i challenge him to do so .
if he dares to do it , he should be brave enough to accept the consequence .
the excuse of " poor " choice is quite lame .
to be a man , you have to prove it , harry . - chhan d. touch , us harry should apologize in person .
i live in the us , was born in the netherlands , and lived under the dreadful nazi regime from 1940-1945 .
no one who has any idea of the horrors inflicted by hitler and his supporters would do what harry did .
stupid , ignorant and arrogant - that 's what it is ! - walter g. bruinsma , us not only should harry apologize to both the british people and german people via television and radio immediately , he should be sent to germany by his father , prince charles , for a one-year german immersion course .
he should also be advised by the authorities at sandhurst that his application to attend is no longer acceptable or wanted .

the mission hopes to help unravel the mystery of how life evolved on earth . it is in titan 's soupy nitrogen-heavy atmosphere that huygens will look for clues to uncover the earth 's chemical makeup from over four billion years ago .
the high-profile space exploration mission will also mark the first time an unmanned probe lands on an object in the outer solar system . once the 320-kilogram spacecraft breaks through the atmosphere , scientists at esa mission control in darmstadt , germany , will use its six specialized instruments to gather data .
however , esa can only guess what is waiting for huygens on the surface , which could be anything from icy rock to a boggy mush or even a sea of methane . " the excitement is growing – over seven years of work has gone into this moment , " gerhard schwehm , esa 's head of planetary science , told dw-world .
" titan is very special .
nobody knows exactly what we 'll find there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : purple haze is seen around the saturn moon titan on tuesday , oct .
26 , 2004 as the nasa / esa cassini-huygens spacecraft makes a fly-by of saturn 's largest moon - the closest ever performed .
the probe got its name from christiaan huygens , the dutch astronomer who discovered titan in 1655 .
larger than either mercury or pluto , the moon is the only one in the solar system to have a thick atmosphere .
it is thought to be home to chemical reactions and carbon-based compounds similar to ones found on earth before life existed . hitching a ride with nasa to get to titan , huygens hitched a ride on nasa 's cassini probe .
costing $ 3.2 billion -lrb- € 2.5 billion -rrb- , the two have hurtled toward saturn since their launch in october 1997 .
but the combined weight of cassini-huygens was more than any direct rocket flight could handle .
so in order to get to saturn , nasa sent the spacecraft on a 2.1-billion-kilometer -lrb- 1.3-billion-mile -rrb- journey , including two trips around venus and one each past the earth and jupiter to make use of the planets ' gravity for a slingshot effect . cassini-huygens reached saturn 's orbit last summer .
half a year later , the two finally parted ways as huygens separated and began its approach towards the planet 's moon on dec .
25 .
but the teamwork did n't end there , as the nasa craft will crucially relay any data collected by huygens back to mission control . " we 've had flybys before , but this is taking exploration to the next step , " schwehm said , explaining that huygens ' instruments would be looking for complex " pre-biotic " molecules as it enters titan 's atmosphere around 10 a.m.
cet on friday . a short stay but huygens will not enjoy a gentle end to its lengthy journey .
during its 140-minute descent by parachute , the probe is likely to be buffeted by strong winds and will face freezing temperatures plunging to -180 celsius .
if it even makes it to the surface intact , huygens will then begin to survey what titan is like on the ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of the huygens probe shortly after landing on titan .
the space probe is due to blast off for saturn and its mysterious cloud-covered moon titan monday october 13 1997 , from cape canaveral .
the cassini-huygens mission , a joint venture between nasa and the european space agency , is one of the most ambitious space exploration attempts ever undertaken .
however , esa expects the probe 's batteries will only survive for a matter of hours under the harsh conditions .
and regardless of how long huygens holds out , cassini will no longer be able to receive data from the surface once it disappears beyond the moon 's horizon . " we hope to get the first information around 2 p.m. , 3 p.m.
-lrb- cet -rrb- , " huygens project manager jean-pierre lebreton told the news agency afp .
esa is hoping for better reception for huygens on titan than its last planetary exploration mission .
in december 2003 , esa 's beagle 2 lander failed to send back any information after separating from the mars express orbiter and touching down on the surface of the red planet . marc young , dw-world send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing space tech down to earth given the serious social and environmental problems on the planet , some wonder why precious resources are being spent on space research .

scientists and space chiefs have bet more than $ 3 billion dollars on the cassini-huygens project and some have spent a quarter-century of their lives planning it and carrying it out . huygens is " a scientific success ... and a fantastic success as well for international cooperation , " the director-general of the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , jean-jacques dordain , declared the probe headed to titan 's surface carrying half a dozen instruments within a clam-like shell to film and measure the moon 's weather system and methane-rich atmosphere during a two-and-a-half-hour descent .
its sensors were designed to continue working for just three minutes after it landed on the bone-freezing titan surface . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa workers watch the huygens landing in the mission control room in darmstadt germany .
but delighted scientists said the instruments probably continued to function for at least half an hour after touchdown , possibly providing vital clues as to whether titan is covered by rock , methane ice or an ocean of chemicals . " i am sure we have at least 30 minutes of surface science , " said jean-pierre lebreton , head of the huygens mission at esa . titan a mystery titan , the largest satellite of saturn , was chosen for the $ 3.2-billion -lrb- € 2.46-billion -rrb- transatlantic venture as , intriguingly , it is the only moon in the solar system that has a substantial atmosphere .
its thick mix of nitrogen and methane is suspected to be undergoing chemical reactions similar to those that unfolded on earth billions of years ago .
that process eventually provided the conditions for life on our planet . " titan is a time machine .
it will especially provide us with the opportunity to know about the conditions on our early earth , " alphonso diaz , nasa science assistant administrator , said . huygen 's descent , on a moon 1.5 billion kilometers -lrb- 940 million miles -rrb- from home , was the farthest landing from earth ever attempted .
the operation was fraught with potential hitches , including the risk of a crash or catastrophic malfunction when the 319-kilo -lrb- 702-pound -rrb- craft entered titan 's roiling atmosphere . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cassini-huygens spacecraft returned this image of saturn on sunday , may 16 , 2004 , taken with its imaging science subsystem narrow-angle camera .

after a seven-year , 2.2 billion-mile journey , the cassini spacecraft will fire its engine wednesday night , june 30 , 2004 , to slow down , allowing itself to be captured by saturn 's gravity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 14.01.2005 should harry apologize ?
back to first page back 2/2 his apology should be in public and then the incident should be closed .
but the furor certainly indicates continued world opinion that refuses to acccept that germans -lrb- or at least most germans -rrb- have moved on from the nazi era and are part of a free and democratic society . - channing dichter i feel so sorry for harry .
he needs to grow up and show some respect .
he most certianly does need to apologize in person and yes , make him go to auschwitz and see what went on . - mario delosada , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harry helped pack emergency supplies for victims of the asian tsunamis earlier in january harry should apologize in person and go to visit the death camps .
he should know better .
he offended all decent people including modern germans , jews , members of the resistance and all those who died to eradicate that hated symbol .
i am not a moralist and do not shock easily but this was in such bad taste that it goes beyond the pale .
nothing he does in the future will ever eradicate this stupidity , even if he worked in calcutta with the poor for the next 20 years .
i do n't care in the least how many drugs he takes , how much he drinks or how many women or men he sleeps with .
this is just youthful normality .
however , this latest incident shows something twisted and sick in his character which he will never live down . - alan smith , australia why should prince harry have to bend over backwards to appease the mandarins of " political correctness " - this item made a welcome change on the sun 's front page from seeing the recent rubbish about the tsunami - a media frenzy of pretended " caring " and false sympathy if there ever was one .
it 's all about selling newspapers , is n't it - just like the picture of harry .
these media hypocrites offend me more than harry in his armband . - dave clifton harry knew what he was doing when he thought of wearing it .
and then decided to parade around in it .
a spoiled rich boy who wanted to have some fun , and instead ended up offending people .
yes he should apologize in public .
he may be a prince but he is also suppose to be a symbol of status and education , human compassion , and of leadership .
he does not deserve special breaks in life , he 's only human . - a. katzenberg a tempest in a teacup .
prince harry is a young man who in the eyes of some did a foolish thing and did not anticipate that media hyenas would get on his tail .
our own former prime minister , pierre trudeau , as a young man wore a german wwii helmet with a swastika on it when riding his motorcycle .
foolish ?
yes .
criminal ?
no . - anthony chernushenko , canada yes , he should apologize in public , but this step should come from within himself .
i do n't think one can force him to do this . - t. bjhattacharya it is well-known that there were many nazi sympathizers among the british nobility and upper class and harry should be aware of this .
furthermore , with the upsurge in anti-semitism in europe , such a stupid stunt gives aid and comfort to the self-declared enemies of western civilization .
i hope for the sake of the brits that harry , given his evident stupidity and lack of comon sense , never gets the chance to be king ! - amy , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harry 's brother william -lrb- right -rrb- was reportedly present when harry picked the costume .
william went as a wild cat .
one can not deny that nazism existed ... and this was simply a costume .
he was not necessarily glorifying nazism nor the much hated swastika .
people should quit focusing their attention on the young prince ... he is just a person like anybody else .
had someone else dressed in this matter , it would not have made front page news . - heidi van der muller i must tell of a personal experience .
it was in the 70s in the us .
a friend wore his father 's uniform shirt -lrb- waffen ss -rrb- to a party we both attended .
i took him aside , told him how offensive the shirt was calmly and asked him never to do it again .
he was surpised that it caused offense , did apologize and as far as i know never did wear it again . - sandra levy , us back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prince harry offends with nazi gaffe britain 's prince harry has made many gaffes in his public life - smoking cannabis , underage drinking , scuffling with photographers .

13 , 2005 -rrb- just do n't mention the war ahead of the queen ’ s visit to germany , foreign minister fischer accused the british of clinging to antiquated stereotypes of germans .

" we are very pleased that all of the countries identified by the independent electoral commission of iraq have now agreed to support iraq 's out-of-country voting , allowing as many iraqis as possible to vote , " iom director , peter erben said .
tight security as part of the initiative , for two days at the end of january , the 56,000 iraqi citizens living in germany will be able to cast their ballot in four locations around the country .
security at the polling stations in the cities of berlin , cologne , munich and mannheim will be under tight security .
preparations are already underway at a former airfield in cologne , which will serve as one of the out-of-country voting locations .

janssen did not comment on his resignation himself and his local party chapter simply stated that he resigned because he did not want to burden his family and his spd party with speculations about his income any longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jann-peter janssen a backbencher from the germany 's north sea coast , janssen -lrb- photo -rrb- entered parliament in 1994 .
before his election , he had worked as a workers ' council representative at vw . five other social democrats were also listed by vw officials as paid employees . undisclosed payments and perks paid by german industry to members of parliament have outraged the public and prompted a hectic search among mps for a way to keep all politicians from being tainted by the scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurenz meyer after announcing his resignation on dec .

a federal court in germany has ruled that secret paternity tests are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit , as such tests hurt the personal rights of the child .
it was the right decision . it 's not the hens , but rather the roosters who 've been clucking and cackling for days now in the great german chicken run . but unfortunately humans do n't live like birds , since everything would be so much easier . either there 'd be a maximum of one rooster per henhouse , meaning paternity could be established without a doubt .
or else the hens would live among themselves .
this would rule out the hatching of any little chicks , but at least the question of paternity would be moot . but no , people are complicated .
and social debates in germany are even more complicated .
on the one hand , germans have been complaining for years about declining birth rates , and moaning that women today neither have the time nor the desire to have kids . on the other hand , those women that do become mothers are accused of being promiscuous and cuckolding their husbands by tricking them into supporting children that are not their own . what is a father ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the background to an essential question : what is a father ?
is he the man that a child grows up with , who shares in the responsibility and joy that comes with raising a child ?
or is a father the man who bears financial responsibility for a child , even against his will ?
we all know there are enough of those around . the number of single mothers supporting their children on welfare because the father wo n't pay - or wo n't pay enough - is rising from year to year .
it 's not without reason that children are often portrayed as a poverty risk in germany , not least because in the case of divorce , the cost of raising a child is mostly borne by just one parent , in most cases , the mother . the legal dispute also raises the question whether a parent 's love - in this case , a father 's love - is determined by genetics ?
does a man love his child only because it carries his genes ?
or does he love the child as a person ? those who answer the first question with " yes " would , by that logic , also have to be against every form of adoption , because , if that were the case , it would be impossible to love an adopted child . numbers impossible to prove there 's also the question of whether the numbers in this debate are correct - whether every fifth child in germany is , in fact , the child of an adulterous relationship .

men 's fear of being cheated on by their wives seems to have staying-power . but if the numbers are right , then they would imply that endless numbers of " faithful " husbands were fathering babies with women other than their wives .

a federal court in germany has ruled that secret paternity tests are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit , as such tests hurt the personal rights of the child .
it was the right decision . it 's not the hens , but rather the roosters who 've been clucking and cackling for days now in the great german chicken run . but unfortunately humans do n't live like birds , since everything would be so much easier . either there 'd be a maximum of one rooster per henhouse , meaning paternity could be established without a doubt .

" we are very pleased that all of the countries identified by the independent electoral commission of iraq have now agreed to support iraq 's out-of-country voting , allowing as many iraqis as possible to vote , " iom director , peter erben said .
tight security as part of the initiative , for two days at the end of january , the 56,000 iraqi citizens living in germany will be able to cast their ballot in four locations around the country .
security at the polling stations in the cities of berlin , cologne , munich and mannheim will be under tight security .
preparations are already underway at a former airfield in cologne , which will serve as one of the out-of-country voting locations .
in preparation for the event , the whole area has been cordoned off , several buildings have been searched and sealed by explosives experts .
they wo n't be opened again until jan .
17 , when both iraqi citizens and refugees who no longer have a passport , but have retained the right to citizenship will roll up to register as voters .
iraqis residing in nearby belgium will also be allowed to vote at the cologne polling station .
a climate of violence although there are less than 3,000 iraqi citizens resident in berlin , some 12,000 are expected to turn out to cast their ballot at the polling station in the german capital .
security there will be tight too , but a spokeswoman for the interior ministry said there was no concrete danger of attacks during the two days of elections in germany .
in light of the continuing violence in iraq , the european parliament has decided not to send observers to monitor the vote , despite a specific request to do so by the transitional government in baghdad .
in the first official voter turn-out , a member of the election committee in the iraqi capital said they were expecting to see fifty percent of the 15 million strong population cast their ballot .
" that 's not bad .
there are elections in europe with just 40 percent voter turn-out .

scientists and space chiefs have bet more than $ 3 billion dollars on the cassini-huygens project and some have spent a quarter-century of their lives planning it and carrying it out . huygens is " a scientific success ... and a fantastic success as well for international cooperation , " the director-general of the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , jean-jacques dordain , declared the probe headed to titan 's surface carrying half a dozen instruments within a clam-like shell to film and measure the moon 's weather system and methane-rich atmosphere during a two-and-a-half-hour descent .
its sensors were designed to continue working for just three minutes after it landed on the bone-freezing titan surface . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa workers watch the huygens landing in the mission control room in darmstadt germany .
but delighted scientists said the instruments probably continued to function for at least half an hour after touchdown , possibly providing vital clues as to whether titan is covered by rock , methane ice or an ocean of chemicals . " i am sure we have at least 30 minutes of surface science , " said jean-pierre lebreton , head of the huygens mission at esa . titan a mystery titan , the largest satellite of saturn , was chosen for the $ 3.2-billion -lrb- € 2.46-billion -rrb- transatlantic venture as , intriguingly , it is the only moon in the solar system that has a substantial atmosphere .

back to first page back 2/2 his apology should be in public and then the incident should be closed .
but the furor certainly indicates continued world opinion that refuses to acccept that germans -lrb- or at least most germans -rrb- have moved on from the nazi era and are part of a free and democratic society . - channing dichter i feel so sorry for harry .
he needs to grow up and show some respect .
he most certianly does need to apologize in person and yes , make him go to auschwitz and see what went on . - mario delosada , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harry helped pack emergency supplies for victims of the asian tsunamis earlier in january harry should apologize in person and go to visit the death camps .
he should know better .
he offended all decent people including modern germans , jews , members of the resistance and all those who died to eradicate that hated symbol .
i am not a moralist and do not shock easily but this was in such bad taste that it goes beyond the pale .
nothing he does in the future will ever eradicate this stupidity , even if he worked in calcutta with the poor for the next 20 years .
i do n't care in the least how many drugs he takes , how much he drinks or how many women or men he sleeps with .
this is just youthful normality .
however , this latest incident shows something twisted and sick in his character which he will never live down . - alan smith , australia why should prince harry have to bend over backwards to appease the mandarins of " political correctness " - this item made a welcome change on the sun 's front page from seeing the recent rubbish about the tsunami - a media frenzy of pretended " caring " and false sympathy if there ever was one .

and then decided to parade around in it .
a spoiled rich boy who wanted to have some fun , and instead ended up offending people .
yes he should apologize in public .
he may be a prince but he is also suppose to be a symbol of status and education , human compassion , and of leadership .
he does not deserve special breaks in life , he 's only human . - a. katzenberg a tempest in a teacup .
prince harry is a young man who in the eyes of some did a foolish thing and did not anticipate that media hyenas would get on his tail .

furthermore , with the upsurge in anti-semitism in europe , such a stupid stunt gives aid and comfort to the self-declared enemies of western civilization .
i hope for the sake of the brits that harry , given his evident stupidity and lack of comon sense , never gets the chance to be king ! - amy , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harry 's brother william -lrb- right -rrb- was reportedly present when harry picked the costume .
william went as a wild cat .
one can not deny that nazism existed ... and this was simply a costume .

a majority of dw-world readers said he should publicly apologize for his behavior . a public apology from prince harry should include the following : his utter humility in making the declaration ; a candid display of understanding that his entire life is the exception of privacy legislation and that therefore he has no defense in the context of a private party ; a recognition that he has offended many good people and that a knowledge of history is not a disposable commodity but an essential element of democratic monarchies such as britain .
he should show the world that he understands why associating himself with the national socialist party is repugnant , why wearing its regalia is not without meaning beyond the confines of his socializing .
that said - it is worthwhile to note that so little has been explained why another member of the family would also be going to a " native and colonials " fancy dress party - which sounds somewhat racist to me .
but then , i 'm a canadian , and not so sophisticated . - david woodward , canada he should not merely visit auschwitz , he should undergo a few weeks of living like the prisoners at auschwitz .
perhaps his life of privilege and excused childish behavior could be turned around by enduring some hardship .
harry 's apology is not enough ; he should face serious consequences for such hateful and insensitive behavior . - d. friberg , us it would be interesting to know some of the other costumes worn to this " native and colonial " party .
the british should not be too proud of how they treated the natives during colonial times .
yet , i did not hear any africans or indians complaining about this party theme or how they , doubtlessly , were ridiculed at this party .
it 's just possible , is n't it , that harry was trying to tell his countrymen something ! - heike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : news agent roy ottoway reads a copy of tabloid ' the sun ' , whose front page shows a picture of britain 's prince harry wearing a nazi soldier 's uniform to a fancy dress party it is a disgrace for the royal member to display such insensivity toward the past suffering of others .
regardless of his royal status , he should be punished according to the law of the land .
if he is spared from such " stupid " display , it is simply another excurse to protect him .
agree or not , he is still a human being , flesh and blood , and is not any better than other human being .
he should make apology in person if he is man enough .
i challenge him to do so .
if he dares to do it , he should be brave enough to accept the consequence .
the excuse of " poor " choice is quite lame .
to be a man , you have to prove it , harry . - chhan d. touch , us harry should apologize in person .
i live in the us , was born in the netherlands , and lived under the dreadful nazi regime from 1940-1945 .
no one who has any idea of the horrors inflicted by hitler and his supporters would do what harry did .
stupid , ignorant and arrogant - that 's what it is ! - walter g. bruinsma , us not only should harry apologize to both the british people and german people via television and radio immediately , he should be sent to germany by his father , prince charles , for a one-year german immersion course .
he should also be advised by the authorities at sandhurst that his application to attend is no longer acceptable or wanted .

a federal court in germany has ruled that secret paternity tests are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit , as such tests hurt the personal rights of the child .
it was the right decision . it 's not the hens , but rather the roosters who 've been clucking and cackling for days now in the great german chicken run . but unfortunately humans do n't live like birds , since everything would be so much easier . either there 'd be a maximum of one rooster per henhouse , meaning paternity could be established without a doubt .
or else the hens would live among themselves .
this would rule out the hatching of any little chicks , but at least the question of paternity would be moot . but no , people are complicated .
and social debates in germany are even more complicated .
on the one hand , germans have been complaining for years about declining birth rates , and moaning that women today neither have the time nor the desire to have kids . on the other hand , those women that do become mothers are accused of being promiscuous and cuckolding their husbands by tricking them into supporting children that are not their own . what is a father ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the background to an essential question : what is a father ?
is he the man that a child grows up with , who shares in the responsibility and joy that comes with raising a child ?
or is a father the man who bears financial responsibility for a child , even against his will ?
we all know there are enough of those around . the number of single mothers supporting their children on welfare because the father wo n't pay - or wo n't pay enough - is rising from year to year .
it 's not without reason that children are often portrayed as a poverty risk in germany , not least because in the case of divorce , the cost of raising a child is mostly borne by just one parent , in most cases , the mother . the legal dispute also raises the question whether a parent 's love - in this case , a father 's love - is determined by genetics ?
does a man love his child only because it carries his genes ?
or does he love the child as a person ? those who answer the first question with " yes " would , by that logic , also have to be against every form of adoption , because , if that were the case , it would be impossible to love an adopted child . numbers impossible to prove there 's also the question of whether the numbers in this debate are correct - whether every fifth child in germany is , in fact , the child of an adulterous relationship .
there 's no real way to verify this - even the federal statistics office would have to pass . so are we really dealing with a modern myth , one that plays on age-old fears ?
men 's fear of being cheated on by their wives seems to have staying-power . but if the numbers are right , then they would imply that endless numbers of " faithful " husbands were fathering babies with women other than their wives .
for this reason alone , you 'd expect men to be a little calmer about the whole issue . calmness is also advisable , because the court 's verdict is , essentially , correct .
if genetic tests conducted without the consent of those affected were admissible in court , then the consequences of such male vanity would be more than widespread . in principle , every employer could then secretly carry out genetic tests on staff members , and make further employment dependent on their risk of illness . insurance firms would have the same right .
the nice insurance salesman who makes house calls to draw up contracts for his customers would only have to politely ask to use the toilet to collect dna samples for every member of the family .
insurance premiums according to our genetic disposition would become the norm - and certainly , no one wants that . helle jeppesen -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fathers ' rights suffer setback german politicians seeking to outlaw secret paternity tests won a first battle on wednesday , much to the disappointment of fathers ' rights groups hoping for greater justice in the areas of alimony and child support .

" we are very pleased that all of the countries identified by the independent electoral commission of iraq have now agreed to support iraq 's out-of-country voting , allowing as many iraqis as possible to vote , " iom director , peter erben said .
tight security as part of the initiative , for two days at the end of january , the 56,000 iraqi citizens living in germany will be able to cast their ballot in four locations around the country .
security at the polling stations in the cities of berlin , cologne , munich and mannheim will be under tight security .
preparations are already underway at a former airfield in cologne , which will serve as one of the out-of-country voting locations .
in preparation for the event , the whole area has been cordoned off , several buildings have been searched and sealed by explosives experts .
they wo n't be opened again until jan .
17 , when both iraqi citizens and refugees who no longer have a passport , but have retained the right to citizenship will roll up to register as voters .
iraqis residing in nearby belgium will also be allowed to vote at the cologne polling station .
a climate of violence although there are less than 3,000 iraqi citizens resident in berlin , some 12,000 are expected to turn out to cast their ballot at the polling station in the german capital .
security there will be tight too , but a spokeswoman for the interior ministry said there was no concrete danger of attacks during the two days of elections in germany .
in light of the continuing violence in iraq , the european parliament has decided not to send observers to monitor the vote , despite a specific request to do so by the transitional government in baghdad .
in the first official voter turn-out , a member of the election committee in the iraqi capital said they were expecting to see fifty percent of the 15 million strong population cast their ballot .
" that 's not bad .

a majority of dw-world readers said he should publicly apologize for his behavior . a public apology from prince harry should include the following : his utter humility in making the declaration ; a candid display of understanding that his entire life is the exception of privacy legislation and that therefore he has no defense in the context of a private party ; a recognition that he has offended many good people and that a knowledge of history is not a disposable commodity but an essential element of democratic monarchies such as britain .
he should show the world that he understands why associating himself with the national socialist party is repugnant , why wearing its regalia is not without meaning beyond the confines of his socializing .
that said - it is worthwhile to note that so little has been explained why another member of the family would also be going to a " native and colonials " fancy dress party - which sounds somewhat racist to me .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.01.2005 german mp quits over undisclosed income großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw paid salaries to several state and federal legislators amid an ongoing scandal about german politicians who receive extra income from companies , a social democratic parliamentarian resigned friday after german carmaker volkswagen revealed he was still on their payroll . on thursday , jann-peter janssen had still denied that he had received money from volkswagen while holding public office even after company officials revealed that he had remained on vw 's payroll until the end of 2004 . but on friday , janssen announced he would give up his seat in the german federal legislature .
janssen did not comment on his resignation himself and his local party chapter simply stated that he resigned because he did not want to burden his family and his spd party with speculations about his income any longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jann-peter janssen a backbencher from the germany 's north sea coast , janssen -lrb- photo -rrb- entered parliament in 1994 .
before his election , he had worked as a workers ' council representative at vw . five other social democrats were also listed by vw officials as paid employees . undisclosed payments and perks paid by german industry to members of parliament have outraged the public and prompted a hectic search among mps for a way to keep all politicians from being tainted by the scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurenz meyer after announcing his resignation on dec .
22 but it has already claimed the careers of two prominent conservative politicians .
cdu general secretary laurenz meyer -lrb- photo -rrb- and the party ’ s labor affairs spokesman , herman-josef arendtz , were forced to step down a month ago after they admitted they had received undeclared payments from the energy giant rwe . vw wants to halt payments on thursday it was the social democrats turn to eat humble pie , after german automaker volkwagen disclosed that two spd members of parliament , four regional assembly lawmakers and more than 300 minor local politicians were on its payroll . vw chief executive bernd pischetsrieder admitted that the payments had been made in violation of the companies own rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pischetsrieder " as a matter of fact , our rules allow such payments only if politicians are still actively working for the company and if it helps to facilitate the future re-integration into volkswagen , " he said . volkswagen is now planning to halt all payments to politicians and toughen its stipulations .
vw workers , however , are outraged by the fact that politicians are handed perks while the company staff will have to endure a two-year freeze on salaries to cut costs at vw . " i can not accept that , " one vw employee told dw-radio .
" if i were going to moonlight in other jobs , i would face punishment , but politicians , i assume , will be off the hook . " another worker agreed and added it was unbelievable that politicians could earn a second salary without doing anything . rwe comes clean in an apparent effort to prevent further revelations , germany ’ s top energy company rwe has now also come clean on its secret payments to politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe headquarters on friday it said that it pays more than € 600,000 -lrb- $ 786,500 -rrb- each year for lobbying activities , but mostly to local politicians .
german politicians are allowed to moonlight in other jobs , but they are obliged to declare any outside employment to avoid conflicts of interest . looking for safeguards wolfgang thierse , the social democratic speaker of parliament and in charge of overseeing the bundestag 's code of conduct , said the cases that have become known so far are all in violation of the rules .
he demands stiffer penalties as a more effective deterrent . " in my view it is important now that germany eventually adopts the international anti-corruption charter , " he said .
" a draft bill to this end has long been put before parliament and it provides for sanctions mechanisms that could have prevented exactly those violations we are experiencing now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse in a recent interview with dw-world 's ibrahim mohamad thierse -lrb- photo , right -rrb- will meet senior members of germany ‘ s main parties next week to discuss legislative measures against corruption .
but he has rejected the idea of requiring all parliamentarians to publicize all of their income , saying that this would harm self-employed entrepreneurs or lawyers , who might suffer competitive disadvantages . in the meantime , german shareholders have vowed to put stern questions to company heads at upcoming annual meetings .

a federal court in germany has ruled that secret paternity tests are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit , as such tests hurt the personal rights of the child .
it was the right decision . it 's not the hens , but rather the roosters who 've been clucking and cackling for days now in the great german chicken run . but unfortunately humans do n't live like birds , since everything would be so much easier . either there 'd be a maximum of one rooster per henhouse , meaning paternity could be established without a doubt .
or else the hens would live among themselves .
this would rule out the hatching of any little chicks , but at least the question of paternity would be moot . but no , people are complicated .
and social debates in germany are even more complicated .
on the one hand , germans have been complaining for years about declining birth rates , and moaning that women today neither have the time nor the desire to have kids . on the other hand , those women that do become mothers are accused of being promiscuous and cuckolding their husbands by tricking them into supporting children that are not their own . what is a father ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the background to an essential question : what is a father ?
is he the man that a child grows up with , who shares in the responsibility and joy that comes with raising a child ?
or is a father the man who bears financial responsibility for a child , even against his will ?
we all know there are enough of those around . the number of single mothers supporting their children on welfare because the father wo n't pay - or wo n't pay enough - is rising from year to year .
it 's not without reason that children are often portrayed as a poverty risk in germany , not least because in the case of divorce , the cost of raising a child is mostly borne by just one parent , in most cases , the mother . the legal dispute also raises the question whether a parent 's love - in this case , a father 's love - is determined by genetics ?
does a man love his child only because it carries his genes ?
or does he love the child as a person ? those who answer the first question with " yes " would , by that logic , also have to be against every form of adoption , because , if that were the case , it would be impossible to love an adopted child . numbers impossible to prove there 's also the question of whether the numbers in this debate are correct - whether every fifth child in germany is , in fact , the child of an adulterous relationship .
there 's no real way to verify this - even the federal statistics office would have to pass . so are we really dealing with a modern myth , one that plays on age-old fears ?
men 's fear of being cheated on by their wives seems to have staying-power . but if the numbers are right , then they would imply that endless numbers of " faithful " husbands were fathering babies with women other than their wives .
for this reason alone , you 'd expect men to be a little calmer about the whole issue . calmness is also advisable , because the court 's verdict is , essentially , correct .
if genetic tests conducted without the consent of those affected were admissible in court , then the consequences of such male vanity would be more than widespread . in principle , every employer could then secretly carry out genetic tests on staff members , and make further employment dependent on their risk of illness . insurance firms would have the same right .
the nice insurance salesman who makes house calls to draw up contracts for his customers would only have to politely ask to use the toilet to collect dna samples for every member of the family .

a federal court in germany has ruled that secret paternity tests are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit , as such tests hurt the personal rights of the child .
it was the right decision . it 's not the hens , but rather the roosters who 've been clucking and cackling for days now in the great german chicken run . but unfortunately humans do n't live like birds , since everything would be so much easier . either there 'd be a maximum of one rooster per henhouse , meaning paternity could be established without a doubt .
or else the hens would live among themselves .
this would rule out the hatching of any little chicks , but at least the question of paternity would be moot . but no , people are complicated .
and social debates in germany are even more complicated .
on the one hand , germans have been complaining for years about declining birth rates , and moaning that women today neither have the time nor the desire to have kids . on the other hand , those women that do become mothers are accused of being promiscuous and cuckolding their husbands by tricking them into supporting children that are not their own . what is a father ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the background to an essential question : what is a father ?
is he the man that a child grows up with , who shares in the responsibility and joy that comes with raising a child ?
or is a father the man who bears financial responsibility for a child , even against his will ?
we all know there are enough of those around . the number of single mothers supporting their children on welfare because the father wo n't pay - or wo n't pay enough - is rising from year to year .
it 's not without reason that children are often portrayed as a poverty risk in germany , not least because in the case of divorce , the cost of raising a child is mostly borne by just one parent , in most cases , the mother . the legal dispute also raises the question whether a parent 's love - in this case , a father 's love - is determined by genetics ?
does a man love his child only because it carries his genes ?
or does he love the child as a person ? those who answer the first question with " yes " would , by that logic , also have to be against every form of adoption , because , if that were the case , it would be impossible to love an adopted child . numbers impossible to prove there 's also the question of whether the numbers in this debate are correct - whether every fifth child in germany is , in fact , the child of an adulterous relationship .
there 's no real way to verify this - even the federal statistics office would have to pass . so are we really dealing with a modern myth , one that plays on age-old fears ?
men 's fear of being cheated on by their wives seems to have staying-power . but if the numbers are right , then they would imply that endless numbers of " faithful " husbands were fathering babies with women other than their wives .
for this reason alone , you 'd expect men to be a little calmer about the whole issue . calmness is also advisable , because the court 's verdict is , essentially , correct .
if genetic tests conducted without the consent of those affected were admissible in court , then the consequences of such male vanity would be more than widespread . in principle , every employer could then secretly carry out genetic tests on staff members , and make further employment dependent on their risk of illness . insurance firms would have the same right .
the nice insurance salesman who makes house calls to draw up contracts for his customers would only have to politely ask to use the toilet to collect dna samples for every member of the family .

the mission hopes to help unravel the mystery of how life evolved on earth . it is in titan 's soupy nitrogen-heavy atmosphere that huygens will look for clues to uncover the earth 's chemical makeup from over four billion years ago .
the high-profile space exploration mission will also mark the first time an unmanned probe lands on an object in the outer solar system . once the 320-kilogram spacecraft breaks through the atmosphere , scientists at esa mission control in darmstadt , germany , will use its six specialized instruments to gather data .
however , esa can only guess what is waiting for huygens on the surface , which could be anything from icy rock to a boggy mush or even a sea of methane . " the excitement is growing – over seven years of work has gone into this moment , " gerhard schwehm , esa 's head of planetary science , told dw-world .
" titan is very special .
nobody knows exactly what we 'll find there . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : purple haze is seen around the saturn moon titan on tuesday , oct .
26 , 2004 as the nasa / esa cassini-huygens spacecraft makes a fly-by of saturn 's largest moon - the closest ever performed .
the probe got its name from christiaan huygens , the dutch astronomer who discovered titan in 1655 .
larger than either mercury or pluto , the moon is the only one in the solar system to have a thick atmosphere .
it is thought to be home to chemical reactions and carbon-based compounds similar to ones found on earth before life existed . hitching a ride with nasa to get to titan , huygens hitched a ride on nasa 's cassini probe .
costing $ 3.2 billion -lrb- € 2.5 billion -rrb- , the two have hurtled toward saturn since their launch in october 1997 .
but the combined weight of cassini-huygens was more than any direct rocket flight could handle .
so in order to get to saturn , nasa sent the spacecraft on a 2.1-billion-kilometer -lrb- 1.3-billion-mile -rrb- journey , including two trips around venus and one each past the earth and jupiter to make use of the planets ' gravity for a slingshot effect . cassini-huygens reached saturn 's orbit last summer .
half a year later , the two finally parted ways as huygens separated and began its approach towards the planet 's moon on dec .

but the teamwork did n't end there , as the nasa craft will crucially relay any data collected by huygens back to mission control .

cet on friday . a short stay but huygens will not enjoy a gentle end to its lengthy journey .
during its 140-minute descent by parachute , the probe is likely to be buffeted by strong winds and will face freezing temperatures plunging to -180 celsius .
if it even makes it to the surface intact , huygens will then begin to survey what titan is like on the ground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of the huygens probe shortly after landing on titan .
the space probe is due to blast off for saturn and its mysterious cloud-covered moon titan monday october 13 1997 , from cape canaveral .
the cassini-huygens mission , a joint venture between nasa and the european space agency , is one of the most ambitious space exploration attempts ever undertaken .
however , esa expects the probe 's batteries will only survive for a matter of hours under the harsh conditions .
and regardless of how long huygens holds out , cassini will no longer be able to receive data from the surface once it disappears beyond the moon 's horizon . " we hope to get the first information around 2 p.m. , 3 p.m.
-lrb- cet -rrb- , " huygens project manager jean-pierre lebreton told the news agency afp .
esa is hoping for better reception for huygens on titan than its last planetary exploration mission .

the mission hopes to help unravel the mystery of how life evolved on earth . it is in titan 's soupy nitrogen-heavy atmosphere that huygens will look for clues to uncover the earth 's chemical makeup from over four billion years ago .
the high-profile space exploration mission will also mark the first time an unmanned probe lands on an object in the outer solar system . once the 320-kilogram spacecraft breaks through the atmosphere , scientists at esa mission control in darmstadt , germany , will use its six specialized instruments to gather data .
however , esa can only guess what is waiting for huygens on the surface , which could be anything from icy rock to a boggy mush or even a sea of methane .

a federal court in germany has ruled that secret paternity tests are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit , as such tests hurt the personal rights of the child .
it was the right decision . it 's not the hens , but rather the roosters who 've been clucking and cackling for days now in the great german chicken run . but unfortunately humans do n't live like birds , since everything would be so much easier . either there 'd be a maximum of one rooster per henhouse , meaning paternity could be established without a doubt .
or else the hens would live among themselves .
this would rule out the hatching of any little chicks , but at least the question of paternity would be moot . but no , people are complicated .
and social debates in germany are even more complicated .
on the one hand , germans have been complaining for years about declining birth rates , and moaning that women today neither have the time nor the desire to have kids . on the other hand , those women that do become mothers are accused of being promiscuous and cuckolding their husbands by tricking them into supporting children that are not their own . what is a father ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the background to an essential question : what is a father ?
is he the man that a child grows up with , who shares in the responsibility and joy that comes with raising a child ?
or is a father the man who bears financial responsibility for a child , even against his will ?
we all know there are enough of those around . the number of single mothers supporting their children on welfare because the father wo n't pay - or wo n't pay enough - is rising from year to year .
it 's not without reason that children are often portrayed as a poverty risk in germany , not least because in the case of divorce , the cost of raising a child is mostly borne by just one parent , in most cases , the mother . the legal dispute also raises the question whether a parent 's love - in this case , a father 's love - is determined by genetics ?
does a man love his child only because it carries his genes ?
or does he love the child as a person ? those who answer the first question with " yes " would , by that logic , also have to be against every form of adoption , because , if that were the case , it would be impossible to love an adopted child . numbers impossible to prove there 's also the question of whether the numbers in this debate are correct - whether every fifth child in germany is , in fact , the child of an adulterous relationship .
there 's no real way to verify this - even the federal statistics office would have to pass . so are we really dealing with a modern myth , one that plays on age-old fears ?
men 's fear of being cheated on by their wives seems to have staying-power . but if the numbers are right , then they would imply that endless numbers of " faithful " husbands were fathering babies with women other than their wives .
for this reason alone , you 'd expect men to be a little calmer about the whole issue . calmness is also advisable , because the court 's verdict is , essentially , correct .
if genetic tests conducted without the consent of those affected were admissible in court , then the consequences of such male vanity would be more than widespread . in principle , every employer could then secretly carry out genetic tests on staff members , and make further employment dependent on their risk of illness . insurance firms would have the same right .
the nice insurance salesman who makes house calls to draw up contracts for his customers would only have to politely ask to use the toilet to collect dna samples for every member of the family .
insurance premiums according to our genetic disposition would become the norm - and certainly , no one wants that . helle jeppesen -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fathers ' rights suffer setback german politicians seeking to outlaw secret paternity tests won a first battle on wednesday , much to the disappointment of fathers ' rights groups hoping for greater justice in the areas of alimony and child support .

" we are very pleased that all of the countries identified by the independent electoral commission of iraq have now agreed to support iraq 's out-of-country voting , allowing as many iraqis as possible to vote , " iom director , peter erben said .
tight security as part of the initiative , for two days at the end of january , the 56,000 iraqi citizens living in germany will be able to cast their ballot in four locations around the country .
security at the polling stations in the cities of berlin , cologne , munich and mannheim will be under tight security .
preparations are already underway at a former airfield in cologne , which will serve as one of the out-of-country voting locations .
in preparation for the event , the whole area has been cordoned off , several buildings have been searched and sealed by explosives experts .
they wo n't be opened again until jan .
17 , when both iraqi citizens and refugees who no longer have a passport , but have retained the right to citizenship will roll up to register as voters .
iraqis residing in nearby belgium will also be allowed to vote at the cologne polling station .
a climate of violence although there are less than 3,000 iraqi citizens resident in berlin , some 12,000 are expected to turn out to cast their ballot at the polling station in the german capital .
security there will be tight too , but a spokeswoman for the interior ministry said there was no concrete danger of attacks during the two days of elections in germany .
in light of the continuing violence in iraq , the european parliament has decided not to send observers to monitor the vote , despite a specific request to do so by the transitional government in baghdad .
in the first official voter turn-out , a member of the election committee in the iraqi capital said they were expecting to see fifty percent of the 15 million strong population cast their ballot .
" that 's not bad .
there are elections in europe with just 40 percent voter turn-out .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 14.01.2005 should harry apologize ?
back to first page back 2/2 his apology should be in public and then the incident should be closed .
but the furor certainly indicates continued world opinion that refuses to acccept that germans -lrb- or at least most germans -rrb- have moved on from the nazi era and are part of a free and democratic society . - channing dichter i feel so sorry for harry .
he needs to grow up and show some respect .
he most certianly does need to apologize in person and yes , make him go to auschwitz and see what went on . - mario delosada , canada bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harry helped pack emergency supplies for victims of the asian tsunamis earlier in january harry should apologize in person and go to visit the death camps .
he should know better .
he offended all decent people including modern germans , jews , members of the resistance and all those who died to eradicate that hated symbol .
i am not a moralist and do not shock easily but this was in such bad taste that it goes beyond the pale .
nothing he does in the future will ever eradicate this stupidity , even if he worked in calcutta with the poor for the next 20 years .
i do n't care in the least how many drugs he takes , how much he drinks or how many women or men he sleeps with .
this is just youthful normality .
however , this latest incident shows something twisted and sick in his character which he will never live down . - alan smith , australia why should prince harry have to bend over backwards to appease the mandarins of " political correctness " - this item made a welcome change on the sun 's front page from seeing the recent rubbish about the tsunami - a media frenzy of pretended " caring " and false sympathy if there ever was one .
it 's all about selling newspapers , is n't it - just like the picture of harry .
these media hypocrites offend me more than harry in his armband . - dave clifton harry knew what he was doing when he thought of wearing it .
and then decided to parade around in it .
a spoiled rich boy who wanted to have some fun , and instead ended up offending people .
yes he should apologize in public .
he may be a prince but he is also suppose to be a symbol of status and education , human compassion , and of leadership .
he does not deserve special breaks in life , he 's only human . - a. katzenberg a tempest in a teacup .
prince harry is a young man who in the eyes of some did a foolish thing and did not anticipate that media hyenas would get on his tail .
our own former prime minister , pierre trudeau , as a young man wore a german wwii helmet with a swastika on it when riding his motorcycle .
foolish ?
yes .
criminal ?
no . - anthony chernushenko , canada yes , he should apologize in public , but this step should come from within himself .
i do n't think one can force him to do this . - t. bjhattacharya it is well-known that there were many nazi sympathizers among the british nobility and upper class and harry should be aware of this .
furthermore , with the upsurge in anti-semitism in europe , such a stupid stunt gives aid and comfort to the self-declared enemies of western civilization .
i hope for the sake of the brits that harry , given his evident stupidity and lack of comon sense , never gets the chance to be king ! - amy , us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harry 's brother william -lrb- right -rrb- was reportedly present when harry picked the costume .
william went as a wild cat .
one can not deny that nazism existed ... and this was simply a costume .
he was not necessarily glorifying nazism nor the much hated swastika .
people should quit focusing their attention on the young prince ... he is just a person like anybody else .
had someone else dressed in this matter , it would not have made front page news . - heidi van der muller i must tell of a personal experience .
it was in the 70s in the us .
a friend wore his father 's uniform shirt -lrb- waffen ss -rrb- to a party we both attended .
i took him aside , told him how offensive the shirt was calmly and asked him never to do it again .
he was surpised that it caused offense , did apologize and as far as i know never did wear it again . - sandra levy , us back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prince harry offends with nazi gaffe britain 's prince harry has made many gaffes in his public life - smoking cannabis , underage drinking , scuffling with photographers .
but his latest caper - dressing as a nazi at a costume party , tops them all .
-lrb- jan .
13 , 2005 -rrb- just do n't mention the war ahead of the queen ’ s visit to germany , foreign minister fischer accused the british of clinging to antiquated stereotypes of germans .

a majority of dw-world readers said he should publicly apologize for his behavior . a public apology from prince harry should include the following : his utter humility in making the declaration ; a candid display of understanding that his entire life is the exception of privacy legislation and that therefore he has no defense in the context of a private party ; a recognition that he has offended many good people and that a knowledge of history is not a disposable commodity but an essential element of democratic monarchies such as britain .
he should show the world that he understands why associating himself with the national socialist party is repugnant , why wearing its regalia is not without meaning beyond the confines of his socializing .
that said - it is worthwhile to note that so little has been explained why another member of the family would also be going to a " native and colonials " fancy dress party - which sounds somewhat racist to me .
but then , i 'm a canadian , and not so sophisticated . - david woodward , canada he should not merely visit auschwitz , he should undergo a few weeks of living like the prisoners at auschwitz .
perhaps his life of privilege and excused childish behavior could be turned around by enduring some hardship .
harry 's apology is not enough ; he should face serious consequences for such hateful and insensitive behavior . - d. friberg , us it would be interesting to know some of the other costumes worn to this " native and colonial " party .
the british should not be too proud of how they treated the natives during colonial times .
yet , i did not hear any africans or indians complaining about this party theme or how they , doubtlessly , were ridiculed at this party .

regardless of his royal status , he should be punished according to the law of the land .
if he is spared from such " stupid " display , it is simply another excurse to protect him .
agree or not , he is still a human being , flesh and blood , and is not any better than other human being .
he should make apology in person if he is man enough .
i challenge him to do so .
if he dares to do it , he should be brave enough to accept the consequence .
the excuse of " poor " choice is quite lame .
to be a man , you have to prove it , harry . - chhan d. touch , us harry should apologize in person .
i live in the us , was born in the netherlands , and lived under the dreadful nazi regime from 1940-1945 .
no one who has any idea of the horrors inflicted by hitler and his supporters would do what harry did .
stupid , ignorant and arrogant - that 's what it is ! - walter g. bruinsma , us not only should harry apologize to both the british people and german people via television and radio immediately , he should be sent to germany by his father , prince charles , for a one-year german immersion course .

a majority of dw-world readers said he should publicly apologize for his behavior . a public apology from prince harry should include the following : his utter humility in making the declaration ; a candid display of understanding that his entire life is the exception of privacy legislation and that therefore he has no defense in the context of a private party ; a recognition that he has offended many good people and that a knowledge of history is not a disposable commodity but an essential element of democratic monarchies such as britain .
he should show the world that he understands why associating himself with the national socialist party is repugnant , why wearing its regalia is not without meaning beyond the confines of his socializing .
that said - it is worthwhile to note that so little has been explained why another member of the family would also be going to a " native and colonials " fancy dress party - which sounds somewhat racist to me .
but then , i 'm a canadian , and not so sophisticated . - david woodward , canada he should not merely visit auschwitz , he should undergo a few weeks of living like the prisoners at auschwitz .
perhaps his life of privilege and excused childish behavior could be turned around by enduring some hardship .
harry 's apology is not enough ; he should face serious consequences for such hateful and insensitive behavior . - d. friberg , us it would be interesting to know some of the other costumes worn to this " native and colonial " party .

he should make apology in person if he is man enough .

janssen did not comment on his resignation himself and his local party chapter simply stated that he resigned because he did not want to burden his family and his spd party with speculations about his income any longer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jann-peter janssen a backbencher from the germany 's north sea coast , janssen -lrb- photo -rrb- entered parliament in 1994 .
before his election , he had worked as a workers ' council representative at vw . five other social democrats were also listed by vw officials as paid employees . undisclosed payments and perks paid by german industry to members of parliament have outraged the public and prompted a hectic search among mps for a way to keep all politicians from being tainted by the scandal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : laurenz meyer after announcing his resignation on dec .
22 but it has already claimed the careers of two prominent conservative politicians .
cdu general secretary laurenz meyer -lrb- photo -rrb- and the party ’ s labor affairs spokesman , herman-josef arendtz , were forced to step down a month ago after they admitted they had received undeclared payments from the energy giant rwe . vw wants to halt payments on thursday it was the social democrats turn to eat humble pie , after german automaker volkwagen disclosed that two spd members of parliament , four regional assembly lawmakers and more than 300 minor local politicians were on its payroll . vw chief executive bernd pischetsrieder admitted that the payments had been made in violation of the companies own rules .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd pischetsrieder " as a matter of fact , our rules allow such payments only if politicians are still actively working for the company and if it helps to facilitate the future re-integration into volkswagen , " he said . volkswagen is now planning to halt all payments to politicians and toughen its stipulations .
vw workers , however , are outraged by the fact that politicians are handed perks while the company staff will have to endure a two-year freeze on salaries to cut costs at vw . " i can not accept that , " one vw employee told dw-radio .
" if i were going to moonlight in other jobs , i would face punishment , but politicians , i assume , will be off the hook . " another worker agreed and added it was unbelievable that politicians could earn a second salary without doing anything . rwe comes clean in an apparent effort to prevent further revelations , germany ’ s top energy company rwe has now also come clean on its secret payments to politicians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe headquarters on friday it said that it pays more than € 600,000 -lrb- $ 786,500 -rrb- each year for lobbying activities , but mostly to local politicians .
german politicians are allowed to moonlight in other jobs , but they are obliged to declare any outside employment to avoid conflicts of interest . looking for safeguards wolfgang thierse , the social democratic speaker of parliament and in charge of overseeing the bundestag 's code of conduct , said the cases that have become known so far are all in violation of the rules .
he demands stiffer penalties as a more effective deterrent . " in my view it is important now that germany eventually adopts the international anti-corruption charter , " he said .
" a draft bill to this end has long been put before parliament and it provides for sanctions mechanisms that could have prevented exactly those violations we are experiencing now . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse in a recent interview with dw-world 's ibrahim mohamad thierse -lrb- photo , right -rrb- will meet senior members of germany ‘ s main parties next week to discuss legislative measures against corruption .
but he has rejected the idea of requiring all parliamentarians to publicize all of their income , saying that this would harm self-employed entrepreneurs or lawyers , who might suffer competitive disadvantages . in the meantime , german shareholders have vowed to put stern questions to company heads at upcoming annual meetings .
the two largest stockholder pressure groups said on friday that utmost transparency about industry perks and payments must become standard operating procedure . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de conservatives face kickback scandal christian democratic union leader angela merkel is reportedly considering replacing the party 's secretary general , who 's come under fire for accepting money from utility giant rwe .

a federal court in germany has ruled that secret paternity tests are inadmissible as evidence in a lawsuit , as such tests hurt the personal rights of the child .
it was the right decision . it 's not the hens , but rather the roosters who 've been clucking and cackling for days now in the great german chicken run . but unfortunately humans do n't live like birds , since everything would be so much easier . either there 'd be a maximum of one rooster per henhouse , meaning paternity could be established without a doubt .
or else the hens would live among themselves .
this would rule out the hatching of any little chicks , but at least the question of paternity would be moot . but no , people are complicated .
and social debates in germany are even more complicated .
on the one hand , germans have been complaining for years about declining birth rates , and moaning that women today neither have the time nor the desire to have kids . on the other hand , those women that do become mothers are accused of being promiscuous and cuckolding their husbands by tricking them into supporting children that are not their own . what is a father ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this is the background to an essential question : what is a father ?
is he the man that a child grows up with , who shares in the responsibility and joy that comes with raising a child ?
or is a father the man who bears financial responsibility for a child , even against his will ?
we all know there are enough of those around . the number of single mothers supporting their children on welfare because the father wo n't pay - or wo n't pay enough - is rising from year to year .
it 's not without reason that children are often portrayed as a poverty risk in germany , not least because in the case of divorce , the cost of raising a child is mostly borne by just one parent , in most cases , the mother . the legal dispute also raises the question whether a parent 's love - in this case , a father 's love - is determined by genetics ?
does a man love his child only because it carries his genes ?
or does he love the child as a person ? those who answer the first question with " yes " would , by that logic , also have to be against every form of adoption , because , if that were the case , it would be impossible to love an adopted child . numbers impossible to prove there 's also the question of whether the numbers in this debate are correct - whether every fifth child in germany is , in fact , the child of an adulterous relationship .
there 's no real way to verify this - even the federal statistics office would have to pass . so are we really dealing with a modern myth , one that plays on age-old fears ?
men 's fear of being cheated on by their wives seems to have staying-power . but if the numbers are right , then they would imply that endless numbers of " faithful " husbands were fathering babies with women other than their wives .
for this reason alone , you 'd expect men to be a little calmer about the whole issue . calmness is also advisable , because the court 's verdict is , essentially , correct .
if genetic tests conducted without the consent of those affected were admissible in court , then the consequences of such male vanity would be more than widespread . in principle , every employer could then secretly carry out genetic tests on staff members , and make further employment dependent on their risk of illness . insurance firms would have the same right .
the nice insurance salesman who makes house calls to draw up contracts for his customers would only have to politely ask to use the toilet to collect dna samples for every member of the family .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 14.01.2005 should harry apologize ? 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he 's had more than one gaffe lately britain 's prince harry has caused public outrage by attending a custome party dressed in a nazi uniform .
a majority of dw-world readers said he should publicly apologize for his behavior . a public apology from prince harry should include the following : his utter humility in making the declaration ; a candid display of understanding that his entire life is the exception of privacy legislation and that therefore he has no defense in the context of a private party ; a recognition that he has offended many good people and that a knowledge of history is not a disposable commodity but an essential element of democratic monarchies such as britain .
he should show the world that he understands why associating himself with the national socialist party is repugnant , why wearing its regalia is not without meaning beyond the confines of his socializing .
that said - it is worthwhile to note that so little has been explained why another member of the family would also be going to a " native and colonials " fancy dress party - which sounds somewhat racist to me .
but then , i 'm a canadian , and not so sophisticated . - david woodward , canada he should not merely visit auschwitz , he should undergo a few weeks of living like the prisoners at auschwitz .
perhaps his life of privilege and excused childish behavior could be turned around by enduring some hardship .
harry 's apology is not enough ; he should face serious consequences for such hateful and insensitive behavior . - d. friberg , us it would be interesting to know some of the other costumes worn to this " native and colonial " party .
the british should not be too proud of how they treated the natives during colonial times .
yet , i did not hear any africans or indians complaining about this party theme or how they , doubtlessly , were ridiculed at this party .
it 's just possible , is n't it , that harry was trying to tell his countrymen something ! - heike bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : news agent roy ottoway reads a copy of tabloid ' the sun ' , whose front page shows a picture of britain 's prince harry wearing a nazi soldier 's uniform to a fancy dress party it is a disgrace for the royal member to display such insensivity toward the past suffering of others .
regardless of his royal status , he should be punished according to the law of the land .
if he is spared from such " stupid " display , it is simply another excurse to protect him .
agree or not , he is still a human being , flesh and blood , and is not any better than other human being .
he should make apology in person if he is man enough .
i challenge him to do so .
if he dares to do it , he should be brave enough to accept the consequence .
the excuse of " poor " choice is quite lame .
to be a man , you have to prove it , harry . - chhan d. touch , us harry should apologize in person .

a leaked 2004 report on care standards at whitchurch hospital in cardiff has questioned the safety of patients .
experts called in by hospital managers were told by staff that lessons had not been learnt from serious incidents involving patients ' welfare .
cardiff and vale nhs trust said it had since developed an action plan to tackle the issues raised by the report .
however , the bbc news website has spoken to a number of people who remain concerned about patient care .
the other patients were just left to wander - there were some good caring nurses there but they were in a minority pat erickson the report , commissioned by the trust and published in march 2004 , was a review of the services for elderly mentally ill patients at whitchurch .
it said staff had admitted there had been a " high level " of " serious adverse incidents " and there had been a lack of management accountability .
it found that due process had not been followed in two serious investigations .
the report did not identify these incidents but in september 2003 the bbc reported that a patient had lain dead in bed for almost 10 hours before her death was discovered .
the alzheimer 's society has set up a group for carers of patients more recently , the bbc understands that a nurse was suspended under the hospital 's disciplinary procedure after a claim that a patient had been left lying overnight on the floor of a television room .
a source who works at the hospital and who asked not to be identified told the bbc of personal concerns over patients ' care , although the nhs trust has given the bbc details of what it has done to improve the situation on the wards .
however , continued concerns about the care and management of elderly patients at whitchurch hospital has led the local branch of the alzheimer 's society to form a new group specifically for people who have a relative receiving treatment at the unit .
co-ordinator dawn john said that although relatives were reluctant to complain directly to the hospital , there were a number of concerns that had come to the society 's attention in the past 12 months .
these included patients suffering unexplained scratches and bruises ; being left to sit in their own urine or faeces ; being thirsty ; and not being washed regularly .
the hospital is run by the largest nhs trust in wales pat erickson , of penylan , cardiff , whose mother has dementia , said she had been distressed at the care her mother had received during a month-long stay at whitchurch early in 2004 .
mrs erickson , who is herself a nurse , said : " i asked where her clothes were and they did not know .
" i told them it was like going back to pre-historic times .
i had to leave the ward , i was so distressed .
" the other patients were just left to wander .
there were some good caring nurses there but they were in a minority . "
mrs erickson said she later received a letter from the hospital which said training had been instigated for staff on how to deal with relatives and the other issues she had raised .
whitchurch hospital is run by cardiff and vale nhs trust , the largest such trust in wales and the third largest in england and wales .
in a statement , the trust said the report had raised a number of issues , including standards of care , roles and accountabilities and clinical staff development .
' new equipment for wards ' the trust said the report had been " very helpful " and , as a result , it had introduced an action plan to address the issues concerned and that improvements had been made .
a spokesman said the trust was recruiting extra staff to " ensure appropriate staff-patient ratios " .
he said : " ward managers are now on specific development courses designed to improve their managerial and clinical leadership skills .

a leaked 2004 report on care standards at whitchurch hospital in cardiff has questioned the safety of patients .
experts called in by hospital managers were told by staff that lessons had not been learnt from serious incidents involving patients ' welfare .
cardiff and vale nhs trust said it had since developed an action plan to tackle the issues raised by the report .
however , the bbc news website has spoken to a number of people who remain concerned about patient care .
the other patients were just left to wander - there were some good caring nurses there but they were in a minority pat erickson the report , commissioned by the trust and published in march 2004 , was a review of the services for elderly mentally ill patients at whitchurch .
it said staff had admitted there had been a " high level " of " serious adverse incidents " and there had been a lack of management accountability .
it found that due process had not been followed in two serious investigations .
the report did not identify these incidents but in september 2003 the bbc reported that a patient had lain dead in bed for almost 10 hours before her death was discovered .
the alzheimer 's society has set up a group for carers of patients more recently , the bbc understands that a nurse was suspended under the hospital 's disciplinary procedure after a claim that a patient had been left lying overnight on the floor of a television room .
a source who works at the hospital and who asked not to be identified told the bbc of personal concerns over patients ' care , although the nhs trust has given the bbc details of what it has done to improve the situation on the wards .
however , continued concerns about the care and management of elderly patients at whitchurch hospital has led the local branch of the alzheimer 's society to form a new group specifically for people who have a relative receiving treatment at the unit .
co-ordinator dawn john said that although relatives were reluctant to complain directly to the hospital , there were a number of concerns that had come to the society 's attention in the past 12 months .
these included patients suffering unexplained scratches and bruises ; being left to sit in their own urine or faeces ; being thirsty ; and not being washed regularly .
the hospital is run by the largest nhs trust in wales pat erickson , of penylan , cardiff , whose mother has dementia , said she had been distressed at the care her mother had received during a month-long stay at whitchurch early in 2004 .
mrs erickson , who is herself a nurse , said : " i asked where her clothes were and they did not know .
" i told them it was like going back to pre-historic times .
i had to leave the ward , i was so distressed .
" the other patients were just left to wander .
there were some good caring nurses there but they were in a minority . "
mrs erickson said she later received a letter from the hospital which said training had been instigated for staff on how to deal with relatives and the other issues she had raised .
whitchurch hospital is run by cardiff and vale nhs trust , the largest such trust in wales and the third largest in england and wales .
in a statement , the trust said the report had raised a number of issues , including standards of care , roles and accountabilities and clinical staff development .
' new equipment for wards ' the trust said the report had been " very helpful " and , as a result , it had introduced an action plan to address the issues concerned and that improvements had been made .
a spokesman said the trust was recruiting extra staff to " ensure appropriate staff-patient ratios " .
he said : " ward managers are now on specific development courses designed to improve their managerial and clinical leadership skills .
" regular audits of care are carried out on wards and improvements required are actioned .
" ward environments have been reviewed and further improvements planned , including new equipment . "

the auditor general for wales said nhs waiting times must be driven down but there was no clear strategy to do so .
his report is published the same week that jane hutt was sacked after five-and-a-half years as , the welsh assembly 's first health minister .
her successor brian gibbons said waiting times fell in the past year .
the failure to reduce waiting times in wales had been a repeated criticism of ms hutt towards the end of her tenure as health minister .
opposition parties in the assembly said the report must mean a change of policy as well as minister .
the report describes a welsh health service where waiting time targets are higher than those in england and scotland , but it concludes that it is a service that had generally failed to meet them .
ms hutt had faced criticism from opposition ams and labour mps although there has been some success in reducing the longest waits , the report finds that success still depends on where patients live in wales .
between 2002 and 2004 , welsh assembly government initiatives cut waiting times by funding extra operations .
under them they treated 40,000 patients at a cost of £ 36m .
but the auditor general 's report says the initiatives have not resulted in an any sustainable reduction in waiting times .
it says the assembly government has not produced a clear strategy to reduced waiting times , and its statements of targets have not been consistent .
there is , however , some praise for the second offer scheme which guarantees all patients on inpatient waiting lists an offer of alternative treatment if they are likely to wait over 18 months , or 12 months by the end of march 2005 .
the report says the scheme has the potential to reduce waiting times , but will " need to be managed carefully " .
' devastating critique ' dr gibbons had already admitted lessons needed to be learned from reforms in the english nhs and , in a statement , said waiting lists in wales had fallen significantly over the last year .
" by october last year we had seen a reduction of 38 % in the number of people waiting over 12 months for an operation and a drop of 86 % in those having to wait over 18 months , " dr gibbons said .
" two thirds of people currently waiting for treatment have also been waiting less than six months . "
dr gibbons added : " if we can implement -lrb- the report 's -rrb- points effectively then patients ' experience will improve .
" it 's a very important document - there are lessons to be learned . "
plaid cymru said the report was " the most devastating critique of the assembly government 's health policy so far " .
the conservatives said the report 's findings were " horrific " while the liberal democrats described it as " shocking " and demanded a change in health policy .
the chairman of the british medical association 's welsh council , dr tony calland , said : " inexperienced local health boards have been unable to assess the demands on hospital services coming from general practice and the community . "
he added : " it is the shortcomings of these management systems and of the commissioning of services that make a substantial contribution to the appalling state of affairs described in this report . "

big pit in blaenavon is one of 10 attractions short listed for the £ 100,000 gulbenkian prize for museum of the year .
a working pit until 1980 , the underground museum reopened last february after a £ 7.1m facelift .
it pulled in a record 141,000 visitors in 2004 , up from 112,000 in 2003 .
contenders for the prize were announced on friday .
they include a railway museum , an art gallery and a stone island cairn .
big pit is one of six sites operated by the national museums and galleries of wales -lrb- nmgw -rrb- and is the only welsh entry in the gulbenkian shortlist .
gulbenkian prize shortlist museum of barnstaple & north devon big pit , national mining museum of wales , blaenavon national trust west midlands for back to backs , birmingham the fitzwilliam museum , university of cambridge for its courtyard development , compton verney , warwickshire coventry transport museum time and tide , museum of great yarmouth life , great yarmouth , norfolk taigh chearsabhagh museum & art gallery , lochmaddy , north uist for its carn chearsabhagh project the foundling museum , london locomotion : the national railway museum at shildon , co durham " this is not only excellent news for big pit and blaenavon , but also for wales as a whole , " said nmgw 's deputy director eurwyn william .
reaching the shortlist for the award , whose winner will be unveiled in may , is another boost for the blaenavon area , which was made a world heritage site five years ago , ranking it alongside international icons like the taj mahal .
at the height of its working life a century ago , big pit employed 1,300 miners but the last shift was worked there in 1980 .
even before its revamp , the museum had tried to make visitors ' experience interactive , allowing them to descend 300 feet down a mine shaft accompanied by former miners who now act as guides .
since the work , more of the mine 's former working areas have been opened up with the pit head baths on view as well as the fan-house on top of the mine shaft .
former miners act as guides for visitors mine manager peter walker said : " there are lots of fine museums in there -lrb- the short list -rrb- so competition will be tough .
" big pit has been nominated for what it 's always been - a real coal mine with real miners . "
welsh culture minister alun pugh , himself a coalminer 's son , said : " to be short listed for the gulbenkian prize is a remarkable accolade , but one that big pit fully deserves . "
last year 's extensive redevelopment work has transformed the site into a " truly world-class attraction " , he added .
last year , a travelling exhibition that brought pembrokeshire 's romany heritage to life made it to the final four in the race for the prize which was won by the scottish national gallery of modern art , edinburgh , for its landform exhibition .

reaching the shortlist for the award , whose winner will be unveiled in may , is another boost for the blaenavon area , which was made a world heritage site five years ago , ranking it alongside international icons like the taj mahal .
at the height of its working life a century ago , big pit employed 1,300 miners but the last shift was worked there in 1980 .
even before its revamp , the museum had tried to make visitors ' experience interactive , allowing them to descend 300 feet down a mine shaft accompanied by former miners who now act as guides .
since the work , more of the mine 's former working areas have been opened up with the pit head baths on view as well as the fan-house on top of the mine shaft .
former miners act as guides for visitors mine manager peter walker said : " there are lots of fine museums in there -lrb- the short list -rrb- so competition will be tough .
" big pit has been nominated for what it 's always been - a real coal mine with real miners . "
welsh culture minister alun pugh , himself a coalminer 's son , said : " to be short listed for the gulbenkian prize is a remarkable accolade , but one that big pit fully deserves . "
last year 's extensive redevelopment work has transformed the site into a " truly world-class attraction " , he added .
last year , a travelling exhibition that brought pembrokeshire 's romany heritage to life made it to the final four in the race for the prize which was won by the scottish national gallery of modern art , edinburgh , for its landform exhibition .
