german health authorities , reacting to an alarming rise in new hiv infections from 2003 to 2004 , have resolved to intensify their pro-condom campaign .
can heath educators instil " safer sex " attitudes in today 's youth ? in relation to its european neighbors , germany has a fairly low rate of hiv / aids infection .
in 2004 , according to the robert koch institute , 45,000 people living in germany were infected , in a country of over 82 million .
only norway , sweden , and finland , among western european nations , had a lower percentage of cases .
on the face of it , this would seem to be a statistic elisabeth pott , director of the federal center for health education , could be proud of . but pott is not particularly proud of germany 's current position in the battle against aids .
the statistics on condom use are alarming for epidemiologists , as they tell a story of increasing disregard for safer sex practices that were encouraged by intensive campaigns in the late 1980s . in 1987 germany began a 50 million deutschmark nationwide anti-aids program .
the program was so successful in cutting down the number of new infections that it was itself whittled down annually until in 1998 , the budget was some 18 million deutschmarks -lrb- around nine million euros -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids prevention posters critics say the effect of this scaling down can be seen in the changing attitudes of germany 's youth towards the epidemic today .

" in 2003 , 78 percent of those engaging in sex with a new partner used condoms , while in 2004 it was only 70 percent , " she reported .
" we are seeing that even though we are still below 2,000 new infections per year , we had a six percent climb in new infections from 2003 to 2004 .

this picture , said pott , is not only far from the truth , it is dangerous as well . help from insurers the limited financial resources of the federal center for health education make it difficult to reach the more people more effectively .
however , private health insurers have offered to step in to join the fight and help expand aids prevention programs .
with their help , the prevention budget will be increased to 12 million euros .

german health authorities , reacting to an alarming rise in new hiv infections from 2003 to 2004 , have resolved to intensify their pro-condom campaign .
can heath educators instil " safer sex " attitudes in today 's youth ? in relation to its european neighbors , germany has a fairly low rate of hiv / aids infection .
in 2004 , according to the robert koch institute , 45,000 people living in germany were infected , in a country of over 82 million .
only norway , sweden , and finland , among western european nations , had a lower percentage of cases .
on the face of it , this would seem to be a statistic elisabeth pott , director of the federal center for health education , could be proud of . but pott is not particularly proud of germany 's current position in the battle against aids .
the statistics on condom use are alarming for epidemiologists , as they tell a story of increasing disregard for safer sex practices that were encouraged by intensive campaigns in the late 1980s . in 1987 germany began a 50 million deutschmark nationwide anti-aids program .
the program was so successful in cutting down the number of new infections that it was itself whittled down annually until in 1998 , the budget was some 18 million deutschmarks -lrb- around nine million euros -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids prevention posters critics say the effect of this scaling down can be seen in the changing attitudes of germany 's youth towards the epidemic today .
whereas two in three 16-year-olds ranked aids among the most dangerous diseases in the late eighties , today only one third do . false sense of security the lack of concern over aids has also led to a marked decrease in condom use , especially among 16 to 44-year-old single people , reported pott . " in 2003 , 78 percent of those engaging in sex with a new partner used condoms , while in 2004 it was only 70 percent , " she reported .
" we are seeing that even though we are still below 2,000 new infections per year , we had a six percent climb in new infections from 2003 to 2004 .

german health authorities , reacting to an alarming rise in new hiv infections from 2003 to 2004 , have resolved to intensify their pro-condom campaign .
can heath educators instil " safer sex " attitudes in today 's youth ? in relation to its european neighbors , germany has a fairly low rate of hiv / aids infection .
in 2004 , according to the robert koch institute , 45,000 people living in germany were infected , in a country of over 82 million .
only norway , sweden , and finland , among western european nations , had a lower percentage of cases .
on the face of it , this would seem to be a statistic elisabeth pott , director of the federal center for health education , could be proud of . but pott is not particularly proud of germany 's current position in the battle against aids .
the statistics on condom use are alarming for epidemiologists , as they tell a story of increasing disregard for safer sex practices that were encouraged by intensive campaigns in the late 1980s . in 1987 germany began a 50 million deutschmark nationwide anti-aids program .
the program was so successful in cutting down the number of new infections that it was itself whittled down annually until in 1998 , the budget was some 18 million deutschmarks -lrb- around nine million euros -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids prevention posters critics say the effect of this scaling down can be seen in the changing attitudes of germany 's youth towards the epidemic today .
whereas two in three 16-year-olds ranked aids among the most dangerous diseases in the late eighties , today only one third do . false sense of security the lack of concern over aids has also led to a marked decrease in condom use , especially among 16 to 44-year-old single people , reported pott . " in 2003 , 78 percent of those engaging in sex with a new partner used condoms , while in 2004 it was only 70 percent , " she reported .
" we are seeing that even though we are still below 2,000 new infections per year , we had a six percent climb in new infections from 2003 to 2004 .
this is clearly a sign that tells us more has to be done to reach people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an hiv-positive sex worker at a counseling center in madras , india as reports in the media on aids , especially in industrialized countries , have declined , many people now believe that aids has been vanquished in the first world and relegated to the third .

" cousin farewell , we 're freezing .

he also said the pilots would have had their own oxygen supply . another expert said that in the case of sudden depressurization because of structural damage , for example the blowing out of a window , the internal temperature would plummet and the plane would crash .

german health authorities , reacting to an alarming rise in new hiv infections from 2003 to 2004 , have resolved to intensify their pro-condom campaign .
can heath educators instil " safer sex " attitudes in today 's youth ? in relation to its european neighbors , germany has a fairly low rate of hiv / aids infection .
in 2004 , according to the robert koch institute , 45,000 people living in germany were infected , in a country of over 82 million .
only norway , sweden , and finland , among western european nations , had a lower percentage of cases .
on the face of it , this would seem to be a statistic elisabeth pott , director of the federal center for health education , could be proud of . but pott is not particularly proud of germany 's current position in the battle against aids .
the statistics on condom use are alarming for epidemiologists , as they tell a story of increasing disregard for safer sex practices that were encouraged by intensive campaigns in the late 1980s . in 1987 germany began a 50 million deutschmark nationwide anti-aids program .
the program was so successful in cutting down the number of new infections that it was itself whittled down annually until in 1998 , the budget was some 18 million deutschmarks -lrb- around nine million euros -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids prevention posters critics say the effect of this scaling down can be seen in the changing attitudes of germany 's youth towards the epidemic today .
whereas two in three 16-year-olds ranked aids among the most dangerous diseases in the late eighties , today only one third do . false sense of security the lack of concern over aids has also led to a marked decrease in condom use , especially among 16 to 44-year-old single people , reported pott . " in 2003 , 78 percent of those engaging in sex with a new partner used condoms , while in 2004 it was only 70 percent , " she reported .
" we are seeing that even though we are still below 2,000 new infections per year , we had a six percent climb in new infections from 2003 to 2004 .
this is clearly a sign that tells us more has to be done to reach people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an hiv-positive sex worker at a counseling center in madras , india as reports in the media on aids , especially in industrialized countries , have declined , many people now believe that aids has been vanquished in the first world and relegated to the third .
this picture , said pott , is not only far from the truth , it is dangerous as well . help from insurers the limited financial resources of the federal center for health education make it difficult to reach the more people more effectively .
however , private health insurers have offered to step in to join the fight and help expand aids prevention programs .
with their help , the prevention budget will be increased to 12 million euros . " as views about safer sex have become more lax , especially among the younger groups , we have realized the importance of giving an added push for prevention , " said volker leienbach , director of the association of private health insurers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein fahrradfahrer fährt an einem werbeplakat-plakat zur verhütung von aids vorbei -lrb- foto vom 08.01.2005 zur illustration des themas jugend und aids -rrb- .
obwohl die krankheit nach wie vor tödlich sei , wird nach aussagen von brandenburgs gesundheitsministerin dagmar ziegler vor allem unter jugendlichen ein immer sorgloserer umgang mit hiv und aids beobachtet .
offensichtlich habe die verharmlosung etwas mit den medizinischen fortschritten auf diesem gebiet und verschiedenen therapien zu tun , die den ausbruch von aids oft über jahre hinauszögern könnten .
dass die krankheit heilbar wäre , sei jedoch ein inzwischen weit verbreiteter irrglaube .
aufgabe der gesellschaft sei es deshalb , sie dafür zu sensibilisieren , für den eigenen schutz zu sorgen .

there is a billboard campaign planned around world aids day on december 1 . the private insurers are the only health insurance group so far involved in the new condom campaigns .
pott said organizations across the spectrum need to get involved , since it is estimated that 30,000 new infections have been prevented through the prevention campaigns so far . " treating that many people can cost 450 million euros annually , " she said .
" this number should give us pause to consider that , on top of the immense human costs caused by aids , we need to consider the benefits that preventive action offers for avoiding the financial costs as well .

now a new fast-food restaurant in paris allows devout muslims to snack on burgers in accordance with the koran . long limited in their choice of eating-out options to kebab shops and halal meat outlets in the country , france 's large muslim population got a new alternative in the french capital last month . " buerger king muslim " or bkm , a new fast-food restaurant in the eastern paris suburb of clichy-sous-bois , offers the standard fast-food fare : burgers , fries , sundaes and doughnuts .
the difference is that the beef and chicken burgers here are halal - meat slaughtered in accordance with islamic dietary laws . the name of the new restaurant is a play on the french word " beur , " meaning a second-generation north african living in france . bildunterschrift : the interior is bright and colorful , not unlike the popular us chains mcdonald 's and burger king .
there is even a play corner for children and the prices are comparable .
the waitresses at bkm however , wear traditional islamic head scarves . in keeping with the koran the concept of a fast-food restaurant catering to france 's large muslim population sounds like a business idea whose time has come .
after the success of mecca cola , a soft drink marketed to french muslims , it was only a matter of time before a muslim-themed restaurant opened in the country with western europe 's largest muslim population . it seems to be working . " i like that i can now eat a hamburger - that was n't possible earlier , " said one muslim teenager at bkm .
his mother added that she was very satisfied because traditional fast-food chains had very limited choices for muslims .
the fish filet was the only food that observant muslims could order and still stay within dietary strictures . rachid bekhti , manager of bkm , said that great care was taken to ensure that the food was in accordance with the koran . " we check the meat very carefully , even the ingredients of the sauces - no animal fat or anything similar can be in it .
everything has to be halal . " that also means that bkm ensures there is no alcohol in any of the drinks on offer . bekhti 's sister leila said that the restaurant had the potential for becoming a popular haunt for young people - but not just muslims , she added : " everyone 's welcome here . " business booming , but challenges loom the restaurant was set up by three muslim friends who took their inspiration from similar chains abroad .
looking to offer a clean , family-oriented alternative to non-halal chains , it took almost two years to convince french backers to finance the undertaking . " people really like the restaurant , " morad benhamida told the associated press , adding that the restaurant 's stock price had tripled in one month .
" it seems like magic . " bildunterschrift : initial business may be booming , but in the long-run the owners of bkm admit there are challenges . clichy-sous-bouis , the paris suburb where bkm is located , is crowded with immigrants from former french colonies .
unemployment is high and many are housed in dilapidated social apartments . " we 've created 28 jobs and that 's important .
but now we have to make enough profits so that we can also pay people , " said hakim badaoui , a financial consultant for bkm . the plan is to expand and open branches in other french cities and provide young jobless people with a perspective , according to badaoui , and , he added , to provide competition to the established fast-food chains . monika lohmüller -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de muslim-friendly cola arrives in germany mecca cola , the muslim world 's answer to coca-cola , is coming to germany .

in 2004 , according to the robert koch institute , 45,000 people living in germany were infected , in a country of over 82 million .
only norway , sweden , and finland , among western european nations , had a lower percentage of cases .
on the face of it , this would seem to be a statistic elisabeth pott , director of the federal center for health education , could be proud of . but pott is not particularly proud of germany 's current position in the battle against aids .
the statistics on condom use are alarming for epidemiologists , as they tell a story of increasing disregard for safer sex practices that were encouraged by intensive campaigns in the late 1980s . in 1987 germany began a 50 million deutschmark nationwide anti-aids program .
the program was so successful in cutting down the number of new infections that it was itself whittled down annually until in 1998 , the budget was some 18 million deutschmarks -lrb- around nine million euros -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids prevention posters critics say the effect of this scaling down can be seen in the changing attitudes of germany 's youth towards the epidemic today .
whereas two in three 16-year-olds ranked aids among the most dangerous diseases in the late eighties , today only one third do . false sense of security the lack of concern over aids has also led to a marked decrease in condom use , especially among 16 to 44-year-old single people , reported pott . " in 2003 , 78 percent of those engaging in sex with a new partner used condoms , while in 2004 it was only 70 percent , " she reported .
" we are seeing that even though we are still below 2,000 new infections per year , we had a six percent climb in new infections from 2003 to 2004 .
this is clearly a sign that tells us more has to be done to reach people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an hiv-positive sex worker at a counseling center in madras , india as reports in the media on aids , especially in industrialized countries , have declined , many people now believe that aids has been vanquished in the first world and relegated to the third .
this picture , said pott , is not only far from the truth , it is dangerous as well . help from insurers the limited financial resources of the federal center for health education make it difficult to reach the more people more effectively .
however , private health insurers have offered to step in to join the fight and help expand aids prevention programs .
with their help , the prevention budget will be increased to 12 million euros . " as views about safer sex have become more lax , especially among the younger groups , we have realized the importance of giving an added push for prevention , " said volker leienbach , director of the association of private health insurers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein fahrradfahrer fährt an einem werbeplakat-plakat zur verhütung von aids vorbei -lrb- foto vom 08.01.2005 zur illustration des themas jugend und aids -rrb- .
obwohl die krankheit nach wie vor tödlich sei , wird nach aussagen von brandenburgs gesundheitsministerin dagmar ziegler vor allem unter jugendlichen ein immer sorgloserer umgang mit hiv und aids beobachtet .
offensichtlich habe die verharmlosung etwas mit den medizinischen fortschritten auf diesem gebiet und verschiedenen therapien zu tun , die den ausbruch von aids oft über jahre hinauszögern könnten .
dass die krankheit heilbar wäre , sei jedoch ein inzwischen weit verbreiteter irrglaube .
aufgabe der gesellschaft sei es deshalb , sie dafür zu sensibilisieren , für den eigenen schutz zu sorgen .

there is a billboard campaign planned around world aids day on december 1 . the private insurers are the only health insurance group so far involved in the new condom campaigns .
pott said organizations across the spectrum need to get involved , since it is estimated that 30,000 new infections have been prevented through the prevention campaigns so far . " treating that many people can cost 450 million euros annually , " she said .
" this number should give us pause to consider that , on top of the immense human costs caused by aids , we need to consider the benefits that preventive action offers for avoiding the financial costs as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.08.2005 rising aids cases spur new campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : declining condom use is leading to a rise in aids infections .
german health authorities , reacting to an alarming rise in new hiv infections from 2003 to 2004 , have resolved to intensify their pro-condom campaign .
can heath educators instil " safer sex " attitudes in today 's youth ? in relation to its european neighbors , germany has a fairly low rate of hiv / aids infection .
in 2004 , according to the robert koch institute , 45,000 people living in germany were infected , in a country of over 82 million .
only norway , sweden , and finland , among western european nations , had a lower percentage of cases .
on the face of it , this would seem to be a statistic elisabeth pott , director of the federal center for health education , could be proud of . but pott is not particularly proud of germany 's current position in the battle against aids .
the statistics on condom use are alarming for epidemiologists , as they tell a story of increasing disregard for safer sex practices that were encouraged by intensive campaigns in the late 1980s . in 1987 germany began a 50 million deutschmark nationwide anti-aids program .
the program was so successful in cutting down the number of new infections that it was itself whittled down annually until in 1998 , the budget was some 18 million deutschmarks -lrb- around nine million euros -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids prevention posters critics say the effect of this scaling down can be seen in the changing attitudes of germany 's youth towards the epidemic today .
whereas two in three 16-year-olds ranked aids among the most dangerous diseases in the late eighties , today only one third do . false sense of security the lack of concern over aids has also led to a marked decrease in condom use , especially among 16 to 44-year-old single people , reported pott . " in 2003 , 78 percent of those engaging in sex with a new partner used condoms , while in 2004 it was only 70 percent , " she reported .
" we are seeing that even though we are still below 2,000 new infections per year , we had a six percent climb in new infections from 2003 to 2004 .
this is clearly a sign that tells us more has to be done to reach people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an hiv-positive sex worker at a counseling center in madras , india as reports in the media on aids , especially in industrialized countries , have declined , many people now believe that aids has been vanquished in the first world and relegated to the third .
this picture , said pott , is not only far from the truth , it is dangerous as well . help from insurers the limited financial resources of the federal center for health education make it difficult to reach the more people more effectively .
however , private health insurers have offered to step in to join the fight and help expand aids prevention programs .
with their help , the prevention budget will be increased to 12 million euros . " as views about safer sex have become more lax , especially among the younger groups , we have realized the importance of giving an added push for prevention , " said volker leienbach , director of the association of private health insurers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein fahrradfahrer fährt an einem werbeplakat-plakat zur verhütung von aids vorbei -lrb- foto vom 08.01.2005 zur illustration des themas jugend und aids -rrb- .
obwohl die krankheit nach wie vor tödlich sei , wird nach aussagen von brandenburgs gesundheitsministerin dagmar ziegler vor allem unter jugendlichen ein immer sorgloserer umgang mit hiv und aids beobachtet .
offensichtlich habe die verharmlosung etwas mit den medizinischen fortschritten auf diesem gebiet und verschiedenen therapien zu tun , die den ausbruch von aids oft über jahre hinauszögern könnten .
dass die krankheit heilbar wäre , sei jedoch ein inzwischen weit verbreiteter irrglaube .
aufgabe der gesellschaft sei es deshalb , sie dafür zu sensibilisieren , für den eigenen schutz zu sorgen .
foto : soeren stache + + + -lrb- c -rrb- dpa - report + + + the increased funding will go toward television and movie spots , as well as newspaper ads .
there is a billboard campaign planned around world aids day on december 1 . the private insurers are the only health insurance group so far involved in the new condom campaigns .
pott said organizations across the spectrum need to get involved , since it is estimated that 30,000 new infections have been prevented through the prevention campaigns so far . " treating that many people can cost 450 million euros annually , " she said .
" this number should give us pause to consider that , on top of the immense human costs caused by aids , we need to consider the benefits that preventive action offers for avoiding the financial costs as well .

the search for bodies from sunday 's crash had gone on throughout the night under powerful arc lights . the interior ministry said identifiable bodies would be taken to an establishment at goudi , near athens city centre , where relatives could begin identifying them . remains which were not identifiable would be dna tested at the morgue in the port of pireus , where all the bodies had been taken initially , interior minister prokopiis pavlopoulos said after a meeting during the night with cypriot officials . relatives of the victims were expected to arrive in greece early monday on a specially-chartered flight . second black box found bildunterschrift : rescuers walk by the tail of a cypriot helios airways jet near the coastal town of grammatikos the head of the investigation into the crash , akrivos tsolakis , confirmed the discovery of the plane 's second " black box , " containing recordings of the pilots ' cockpit conversations , but said it was in a " very bad state . " " we do n't know if we will be able to get something from it , " he said . that and the other black box , the flight data recorder , would be sent to paris for analysis , under agreement between france and greece , tsolakis said . children on board the helios airways boeing 737 was about to land at athens airport for a stopover on its journey from larnaca in cyprus to the czech capital prague when it crashed at varnava , a largely uninhabited area 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- northeast of athens . helios said most of the passengers on the airliner were greek cypriots .
of those aboard , 59 adults and eight children were heading to athens ; 48 were continuing on to prague . a cypriot official said that the first indications of the greek authorities were that the crash was not the result of a terrorist attack . causes unknown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pieces of a helios airways jet litter a roadside near the coastal greek town of grammatikos the cause remains as yet unknown , although there have been harrowing accounts of an apparent crisis in the cockpit in the plane 's last minutes with greek officials saying one of the pilots was slumped in his seat .
pilots of two f16 fighters sent up to escort the airliner before the crash " saw a situation that was not normal in the pilots ' cabin . " one of the f-16 pilots reported that he could not see the captain in the cockpit and his co-pilot appeared to be slumped in his seat , a defence ministry official told reporters . greek police suspect the cause was a sudden drop in the cabin pressure , a senior official at the greek public order ministry said .
the pilots of the plane , one of whom was german , had mentioned a problem with the aircraft 's systems when he spoke to the athens control tower before contact was lost , said the official . " the pilot has turned blue , " one passenger said in a mobile text message to his cousin .
" cousin farewell , we 're freezing . " but in paris , accident investigator francois grangier told afp that a sudden loss of pressurization would not have caused the plane to crash , nor would it have made the pilots immediately lose consciousness . the plane would have been at fairly low altitude as it approached athens airport , and grangier said loss of pressurization would not have had any effect on the aircraft 's structure .
he also said the pilots would have had their own oxygen supply . another expert said that in the case of sudden depressurization because of structural damage , for example the blowing out of a window , the internal temperature would plummet and the plane would crash .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : world youth day 2005 german visas for the faithful germany prepares for world youth day prayer , and environmental protection tight security for pope 's youth gathering culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.08.2005 traditional piety rare among german youth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are mass gatherings a reflection of deeper religious faith ?
the catholic world youth day , set to hit cologne this week with a mammoth influx of devout adolescents , is a chance for german catholics to show their faith to the world .
but just how religious are german youth today ? pope john paul ii consecrated the first world youth day in 1985 , hoping to spur an upsurge in evangelical energy among catholic youth around the world .
at the 20th anniversary event , held this week in cologne , nearly one million young faithful from all over the world are expected to converge on the rhenish metropolis and its famous cathedral .
but some are calling into question whether the institution represented by pope benedict xvi , the first german pope in nearly 500 years , is in touch with the german youth of today . statistically speaking , the answer would seem to be negative .
a study of youth by shell in 2000 found that religious knowledge is a rarity among today 's youth .
a majority of german adolescents have only vague ideas about the fundamentals of christianity .
while 65 percent of german citizens officially belong to a church , only four to six percent of young germans attend sunday services , and then only occasionally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : near to the people ?
" i believe the institution of the church lives in an ivory tower , " said katrin , a young woman from cologne .
" they go about their business without really concerning themselves with the people .
they are far removed from the actual people . " values gap the reasons the institutional church does not resonate with many young people are varied .
some blame the church for not reaching out enough or in the right ways to the youth .
others say young people are simply more distracted today , having an unparalleled range of activities , interests , and ideologies - from environmental activism to video games - to choose from .
katrin thinks one reason is that the church 's stances are often not in line with the values of today 's youth , especially when it comes to sexual issues . " why should n't we use condoms when they protect us from diseases ?
why should n't we have protected sex , when we do n't want to get pregnant ? " she said . on homosexuality , katrin 's views also clash with official church doctrine . " homosexuality exists , has always existed .
you can interpret that to mean that god created it himself .
homosexuality will always exist ; it is not something that can be banned , " she said . when the church takes an official stance against contraception , as it has in cologne , for example , this serves to alienate many young people .
many would seem to echo katrin in saying yes to religion in general but no to certain aspects of church doctrine . lack of expertise whereas many youths recoil from the church 's sexual conservatism , there is also a group of christian teenagers that find the church 's stance on a variety of issues too ambivalent .
they may share the core christian values of social engagement and a strong family life , but turn to other organizations when it comes to environmental or human rights issues .
here , for many youths , the church lacks expertise .
they tend to direct their activism to organizations that are strongly oriented towards specific issues and attempt to influence the here and now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gemälde von martin luther german youth of today are not necessarily becoming less religious ; they are simply less interested in experiencing god through the mediation of the church .

the catholic world youth day , set to hit cologne this week with a mammoth influx of devout adolescents , is a chance for german catholics to show their faith to the world .
but just how religious are german youth today ? pope john paul ii consecrated the first world youth day in 1985 , hoping to spur an upsurge in evangelical energy among catholic youth around the world .
at the 20th anniversary event , held this week in cologne , nearly one million young faithful from all over the world are expected to converge on the rhenish metropolis and its famous cathedral .
but some are calling into question whether the institution represented by pope benedict xvi , the first german pope in nearly 500 years , is in touch with the german youth of today . statistically speaking , the answer would seem to be negative .
a study of youth by shell in 2000 found that religious knowledge is a rarity among today 's youth .
a majority of german adolescents have only vague ideas about the fundamentals of christianity .
while 65 percent of german citizens officially belong to a church , only four to six percent of young germans attend sunday services , and then only occasionally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : near to the people ?
" i believe the institution of the church lives in an ivory tower , " said katrin , a young woman from cologne .
" they go about their business without really concerning themselves with the people .
they are far removed from the actual people . " values gap the reasons the institutional church does not resonate with many young people are varied .
some blame the church for not reaching out enough or in the right ways to the youth .
others say young people are simply more distracted today , having an unparalleled range of activities , interests , and ideologies - from environmental activism to video games - to choose from .
katrin thinks one reason is that the church 's stances are often not in line with the values of today 's youth , especially when it comes to sexual issues . " why should n't we use condoms when they protect us from diseases ?
why should n't we have protected sex , when we do n't want to get pregnant ? " she said . on homosexuality , katrin 's views also clash with official church doctrine . " homosexuality exists , has always existed .
you can interpret that to mean that god created it himself .
homosexuality will always exist ; it is not something that can be banned , " she said . when the church takes an official stance against contraception , as it has in cologne , for example , this serves to alienate many young people .
many would seem to echo katrin in saying yes to religion in general but no to certain aspects of church doctrine . lack of expertise whereas many youths recoil from the church 's sexual conservatism , there is also a group of christian teenagers that find the church 's stance on a variety of issues too ambivalent .
they may share the core christian values of social engagement and a strong family life , but turn to other organizations when it comes to environmental or human rights issues .
here , for many youths , the church lacks expertise .
they tend to direct their activism to organizations that are strongly oriented towards specific issues and attempt to influence the here and now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gemälde von martin luther german youth of today are not necessarily becoming less religious ; they are simply less interested in experiencing god through the mediation of the church .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.08.2005 fast-food joint caters to france 's muslims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims can eat the halal burgers without a worry islamic dietary laws have long kept many muslims away from mcdonald 's and burger king .
now a new fast-food restaurant in paris allows devout muslims to snack on burgers in accordance with the koran . long limited in their choice of eating-out options to kebab shops and halal meat outlets in the country , france 's large muslim population got a new alternative in the french capital last month . " buerger king muslim " or bkm , a new fast-food restaurant in the eastern paris suburb of clichy-sous-bois , offers the standard fast-food fare : burgers , fries , sundaes and doughnuts .
the difference is that the beef and chicken burgers here are halal - meat slaughtered in accordance with islamic dietary laws . the name of the new restaurant is a play on the french word " beur , " meaning a second-generation north african living in france . bildunterschrift : the interior is bright and colorful , not unlike the popular us chains mcdonald 's and burger king .
there is even a play corner for children and the prices are comparable .
the waitresses at bkm however , wear traditional islamic head scarves . in keeping with the koran the concept of a fast-food restaurant catering to france 's large muslim population sounds like a business idea whose time has come .
after the success of mecca cola , a soft drink marketed to french muslims , it was only a matter of time before a muslim-themed restaurant opened in the country with western europe 's largest muslim population . it seems to be working . " i like that i can now eat a hamburger - that was n't possible earlier , " said one muslim teenager at bkm .
his mother added that she was very satisfied because traditional fast-food chains had very limited choices for muslims .
the fish filet was the only food that observant muslims could order and still stay within dietary strictures . rachid bekhti , manager of bkm , said that great care was taken to ensure that the food was in accordance with the koran . " we check the meat very carefully , even the ingredients of the sauces - no animal fat or anything similar can be in it .
everything has to be halal . " that also means that bkm ensures there is no alcohol in any of the drinks on offer . bekhti 's sister leila said that the restaurant had the potential for becoming a popular haunt for young people - but not just muslims , she added : " everyone 's welcome here . " business booming , but challenges loom the restaurant was set up by three muslim friends who took their inspiration from similar chains abroad .
looking to offer a clean , family-oriented alternative to non-halal chains , it took almost two years to convince french backers to finance the undertaking . " people really like the restaurant , " morad benhamida told the associated press , adding that the restaurant 's stock price had tripled in one month .
" it seems like magic . " bildunterschrift : initial business may be booming , but in the long-run the owners of bkm admit there are challenges . clichy-sous-bouis , the paris suburb where bkm is located , is crowded with immigrants from former french colonies .
unemployment is high and many are housed in dilapidated social apartments . " we 've created 28 jobs and that 's important .
but now we have to make enough profits so that we can also pay people , " said hakim badaoui , a financial consultant for bkm . the plan is to expand and open branches in other french cities and provide young jobless people with a perspective , according to badaoui , and , he added , to provide competition to the established fast-food chains . monika lohmüller -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de muslim-friendly cola arrives in germany mecca cola , the muslim world 's answer to coca-cola , is coming to germany .

now a new fast-food restaurant in paris allows devout muslims to snack on burgers in accordance with the koran . long limited in their choice of eating-out options to kebab shops and halal meat outlets in the country , france 's large muslim population got a new alternative in the french capital last month . " buerger king muslim " or bkm , a new fast-food restaurant in the eastern paris suburb of clichy-sous-bois , offers the standard fast-food fare : burgers , fries , sundaes and doughnuts .
the difference is that the beef and chicken burgers here are halal - meat slaughtered in accordance with islamic dietary laws . the name of the new restaurant is a play on the french word " beur , " meaning a second-generation north african living in france . bildunterschrift : the interior is bright and colorful , not unlike the popular us chains mcdonald 's and burger king .
there is even a play corner for children and the prices are comparable .
the waitresses at bkm however , wear traditional islamic head scarves . in keeping with the koran the concept of a fast-food restaurant catering to france 's large muslim population sounds like a business idea whose time has come .
after the success of mecca cola , a soft drink marketed to french muslims , it was only a matter of time before a muslim-themed restaurant opened in the country with western europe 's largest muslim population . it seems to be working . " i like that i can now eat a hamburger - that was n't possible earlier , " said one muslim teenager at bkm .
his mother added that she was very satisfied because traditional fast-food chains had very limited choices for muslims .
the fish filet was the only food that observant muslims could order and still stay within dietary strictures . rachid bekhti , manager of bkm , said that great care was taken to ensure that the food was in accordance with the koran . " we check the meat very carefully , even the ingredients of the sauces - no animal fat or anything similar can be in it .
everything has to be halal . " that also means that bkm ensures there is no alcohol in any of the drinks on offer . bekhti 's sister leila said that the restaurant had the potential for becoming a popular haunt for young people - but not just muslims , she added : " everyone 's welcome here . " business booming , but challenges loom the restaurant was set up by three muslim friends who took their inspiration from similar chains abroad .
looking to offer a clean , family-oriented alternative to non-halal chains , it took almost two years to convince french backers to finance the undertaking . " people really like the restaurant , " morad benhamida told the associated press , adding that the restaurant 's stock price had tripled in one month .
" it seems like magic . " bildunterschrift : initial business may be booming , but in the long-run the owners of bkm admit there are challenges . clichy-sous-bouis , the paris suburb where bkm is located , is crowded with immigrants from former french colonies .
unemployment is high and many are housed in dilapidated social apartments . " we 've created 28 jobs and that 's important .
but now we have to make enough profits so that we can also pay people , " said hakim badaoui , a financial consultant for bkm . the plan is to expand and open branches in other french cities and provide young jobless people with a perspective , according to badaoui , and , he added , to provide competition to the established fast-food chains . monika lohmüller -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de muslim-friendly cola arrives in germany mecca cola , the muslim world 's answer to coca-cola , is coming to germany .

" let 's leave military options aside , we have already seen that they do n't amount to anything , " schröder said during an electoral meeting in the northern city of hanover . the chancellor 's statement followed an interview aired friday on israeli public television in which us president george w. bush said that " all options are on the table " when asked if the use of force was an alternative to faltering diplomacy with iran . in an interview to be published sunday in the german weekly bild am sonntag , schröder said he considered any military option " extremely dangerous . " " this is why i can with certainty exclude any participation by the german government under my direction , " he said . schröder " very concerned " the social democrat chancellor - who in polls leading up to early legislative elections on september 18 is lagging behind his christian democrat challenger angela merkel - added that he was " very concerned " by the situation in iran . tehran must not be allowed to manufacture nuclear weapons , he said , adding that numerous european propositions had been made " in order to induce iran to change its position .

the search for bodies from sunday 's crash had gone on throughout the night under powerful arc lights . the interior ministry said identifiable bodies would be taken to an establishment at goudi , near athens city centre , where relatives could begin identifying them . remains which were not identifiable would be dna tested at the morgue in the port of pireus , where all the bodies had been taken initially , interior minister prokopiis pavlopoulos said after a meeting during the night with cypriot officials . relatives of the victims were expected to arrive in greece early monday on a specially-chartered flight . second black box found bildunterschrift : rescuers walk by the tail of a cypriot helios airways jet near the coastal town of grammatikos the head of the investigation into the crash , akrivos tsolakis , confirmed the discovery of the plane 's second " black box , " containing recordings of the pilots ' cockpit conversations , but said it was in a " very bad state . " " we do n't know if we will be able to get something from it , " he said . that and the other black box , the flight data recorder , would be sent to paris for analysis , under agreement between france and greece , tsolakis said . children on board the helios airways boeing 737 was about to land at athens airport for a stopover on its journey from larnaca in cyprus to the czech capital prague when it crashed at varnava , a largely uninhabited area 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- northeast of athens . helios said most of the passengers on the airliner were greek cypriots .
of those aboard , 59 adults and eight children were heading to athens ; 48 were continuing on to prague . a cypriot official said that the first indications of the greek authorities were that the crash was not the result of a terrorist attack . causes unknown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pieces of a helios airways jet litter a roadside near the coastal greek town of grammatikos the cause remains as yet unknown , although there have been harrowing accounts of an apparent crisis in the cockpit in the plane 's last minutes with greek officials saying one of the pilots was slumped in his seat .
pilots of two f16 fighters sent up to escort the airliner before the crash " saw a situation that was not normal in the pilots ' cabin . " one of the f-16 pilots reported that he could not see the captain in the cockpit and his co-pilot appeared to be slumped in his seat , a defence ministry official told reporters . greek police suspect the cause was a sudden drop in the cabin pressure , a senior official at the greek public order ministry said .
the pilots of the plane , one of whom was german , had mentioned a problem with the aircraft 's systems when he spoke to the athens control tower before contact was lost , said the official . " the pilot has turned blue , " one passenger said in a mobile text message to his cousin .
" cousin farewell , we 're freezing . " but in paris , accident investigator francois grangier told afp that a sudden loss of pressurization would not have caused the plane to crash , nor would it have made the pilots immediately lose consciousness . the plane would have been at fairly low altitude as it approached athens airport , and grangier said loss of pressurization would not have had any effect on the aircraft 's structure .
he also said the pilots would have had their own oxygen supply . another expert said that in the case of sudden depressurization because of structural damage , for example the blowing out of a window , the internal temperature would plummet and the plane would crash .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.08.2005 rising aids cases spur new campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : declining condom use is leading to a rise in aids infections .
german health authorities , reacting to an alarming rise in new hiv infections from 2003 to 2004 , have resolved to intensify their pro-condom campaign .
can heath educators instil " safer sex " attitudes in today 's youth ? in relation to its european neighbors , germany has a fairly low rate of hiv / aids infection .
in 2004 , according to the robert koch institute , 45,000 people living in germany were infected , in a country of over 82 million .
only norway , sweden , and finland , among western european nations , had a lower percentage of cases .
on the face of it , this would seem to be a statistic elisabeth pott , director of the federal center for health education , could be proud of . but pott is not particularly proud of germany 's current position in the battle against aids .
the statistics on condom use are alarming for epidemiologists , as they tell a story of increasing disregard for safer sex practices that were encouraged by intensive campaigns in the late 1980s . in 1987 germany began a 50 million deutschmark nationwide anti-aids program .
the program was so successful in cutting down the number of new infections that it was itself whittled down annually until in 1998 , the budget was some 18 million deutschmarks -lrb- around nine million euros -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids prevention posters critics say the effect of this scaling down can be seen in the changing attitudes of germany 's youth towards the epidemic today .
whereas two in three 16-year-olds ranked aids among the most dangerous diseases in the late eighties , today only one third do . false sense of security the lack of concern over aids has also led to a marked decrease in condom use , especially among 16 to 44-year-old single people , reported pott . " in 2003 , 78 percent of those engaging in sex with a new partner used condoms , while in 2004 it was only 70 percent , " she reported .
" we are seeing that even though we are still below 2,000 new infections per year , we had a six percent climb in new infections from 2003 to 2004 .
this is clearly a sign that tells us more has to be done to reach people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an hiv-positive sex worker at a counseling center in madras , india as reports in the media on aids , especially in industrialized countries , have declined , many people now believe that aids has been vanquished in the first world and relegated to the third .
this picture , said pott , is not only far from the truth , it is dangerous as well . help from insurers the limited financial resources of the federal center for health education make it difficult to reach the more people more effectively .
however , private health insurers have offered to step in to join the fight and help expand aids prevention programs .
with their help , the prevention budget will be increased to 12 million euros . " as views about safer sex have become more lax , especially among the younger groups , we have realized the importance of giving an added push for prevention , " said volker leienbach , director of the association of private health insurers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein fahrradfahrer fährt an einem werbeplakat-plakat zur verhütung von aids vorbei -lrb- foto vom 08.01.2005 zur illustration des themas jugend und aids -rrb- .
obwohl die krankheit nach wie vor tödlich sei , wird nach aussagen von brandenburgs gesundheitsministerin dagmar ziegler vor allem unter jugendlichen ein immer sorgloserer umgang mit hiv und aids beobachtet .
offensichtlich habe die verharmlosung etwas mit den medizinischen fortschritten auf diesem gebiet und verschiedenen therapien zu tun , die den ausbruch von aids oft über jahre hinauszögern könnten .
dass die krankheit heilbar wäre , sei jedoch ein inzwischen weit verbreiteter irrglaube .
aufgabe der gesellschaft sei es deshalb , sie dafür zu sensibilisieren , für den eigenen schutz zu sorgen .

the catholic world youth day , set to hit cologne this week with a mammoth influx of devout adolescents , is a chance for german catholics to show their faith to the world .
but just how religious are german youth today ? pope john paul ii consecrated the first world youth day in 1985 , hoping to spur an upsurge in evangelical energy among catholic youth around the world .
at the 20th anniversary event , held this week in cologne , nearly one million young faithful from all over the world are expected to converge on the rhenish metropolis and its famous cathedral .
but some are calling into question whether the institution represented by pope benedict xvi , the first german pope in nearly 500 years , is in touch with the german youth of today . statistically speaking , the answer would seem to be negative .
a study of youth by shell in 2000 found that religious knowledge is a rarity among today 's youth .
a majority of german adolescents have only vague ideas about the fundamentals of christianity .
while 65 percent of german citizens officially belong to a church , only four to six percent of young germans attend sunday services , and then only occasionally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : near to the people ?
" i believe the institution of the church lives in an ivory tower , " said katrin , a young woman from cologne .
" they go about their business without really concerning themselves with the people .
they are far removed from the actual people . " values gap the reasons the institutional church does not resonate with many young people are varied .
some blame the church for not reaching out enough or in the right ways to the youth .
others say young people are simply more distracted today , having an unparalleled range of activities , interests , and ideologies - from environmental activism to video games - to choose from .
katrin thinks one reason is that the church 's stances are often not in line with the values of today 's youth , especially when it comes to sexual issues . " why should n't we use condoms when they protect us from diseases ?
why should n't we have protected sex , when we do n't want to get pregnant ? " she said . on homosexuality , katrin 's views also clash with official church doctrine . " homosexuality exists , has always existed .
you can interpret that to mean that god created it himself .
homosexuality will always exist ; it is not something that can be banned , " she said . when the church takes an official stance against contraception , as it has in cologne , for example , this serves to alienate many young people .
many would seem to echo katrin in saying yes to religion in general but no to certain aspects of church doctrine . lack of expertise whereas many youths recoil from the church 's sexual conservatism , there is also a group of christian teenagers that find the church 's stance on a variety of issues too ambivalent .
they may share the core christian values of social engagement and a strong family life , but turn to other organizations when it comes to environmental or human rights issues .
here , for many youths , the church lacks expertise .
they tend to direct their activism to organizations that are strongly oriented towards specific issues and attempt to influence the here and now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gemälde von martin luther german youth of today are not necessarily becoming less religious ; they are simply less interested in experiencing god through the mediation of the church .
and this should come as no surprise .
after all , it was the great german theologian martin luther who , at the start of the sixteenth century , initiated a rebellion from official church doctrine which was focused on the individual 's capacity to reach salvation through prayer , apart from the corrupt apparatus in rome . luther thus ushered in the modern age , the focus on the individual , and the loss in power for the catholic church , at least in northern europe .
germany 's youth of today , who do n't feel all that connected to the conservative doctrines of the church , and wish to focus on a personal , individual relationship to a higher power , are following in the footsteps of that german spirit of reform . editor 's note : deutsche welle is an official media partner of world youth day . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de condom plans cancelled at youth fest as 400,000 catholic young people from around the world prepare to make their way to cologne for world youth day , a spat over condom distribution has erupted .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.08.2005 rising aids cases spur new campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : declining condom use is leading to a rise in aids infections .
german health authorities , reacting to an alarming rise in new hiv infections from 2003 to 2004 , have resolved to intensify their pro-condom campaign .
can heath educators instil " safer sex " attitudes in today 's youth ? in relation to its european neighbors , germany has a fairly low rate of hiv / aids infection .
in 2004 , according to the robert koch institute , 45,000 people living in germany were infected , in a country of over 82 million .
only norway , sweden , and finland , among western european nations , had a lower percentage of cases .
on the face of it , this would seem to be a statistic elisabeth pott , director of the federal center for health education , could be proud of . but pott is not particularly proud of germany 's current position in the battle against aids .
the statistics on condom use are alarming for epidemiologists , as they tell a story of increasing disregard for safer sex practices that were encouraged by intensive campaigns in the late 1980s . in 1987 germany began a 50 million deutschmark nationwide anti-aids program .
the program was so successful in cutting down the number of new infections that it was itself whittled down annually until in 1998 , the budget was some 18 million deutschmarks -lrb- around nine million euros -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids prevention posters critics say the effect of this scaling down can be seen in the changing attitudes of germany 's youth towards the epidemic today .
whereas two in three 16-year-olds ranked aids among the most dangerous diseases in the late eighties , today only one third do . false sense of security the lack of concern over aids has also led to a marked decrease in condom use , especially among 16 to 44-year-old single people , reported pott . " in 2003 , 78 percent of those engaging in sex with a new partner used condoms , while in 2004 it was only 70 percent , " she reported .
" we are seeing that even though we are still below 2,000 new infections per year , we had a six percent climb in new infections from 2003 to 2004 .
this is clearly a sign that tells us more has to be done to reach people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an hiv-positive sex worker at a counseling center in madras , india as reports in the media on aids , especially in industrialized countries , have declined , many people now believe that aids has been vanquished in the first world and relegated to the third .
this picture , said pott , is not only far from the truth , it is dangerous as well . help from insurers the limited financial resources of the federal center for health education make it difficult to reach the more people more effectively .
however , private health insurers have offered to step in to join the fight and help expand aids prevention programs .
with their help , the prevention budget will be increased to 12 million euros . " as views about safer sex have become more lax , especially among the younger groups , we have realized the importance of giving an added push for prevention , " said volker leienbach , director of the association of private health insurers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein fahrradfahrer fährt an einem werbeplakat-plakat zur verhütung von aids vorbei -lrb- foto vom 08.01.2005 zur illustration des themas jugend und aids -rrb- .
obwohl die krankheit nach wie vor tödlich sei , wird nach aussagen von brandenburgs gesundheitsministerin dagmar ziegler vor allem unter jugendlichen ein immer sorgloserer umgang mit hiv und aids beobachtet .
offensichtlich habe die verharmlosung etwas mit den medizinischen fortschritten auf diesem gebiet und verschiedenen therapien zu tun , die den ausbruch von aids oft über jahre hinauszögern könnten .
dass die krankheit heilbar wäre , sei jedoch ein inzwischen weit verbreiteter irrglaube .
aufgabe der gesellschaft sei es deshalb , sie dafür zu sensibilisieren , für den eigenen schutz zu sorgen .

german health authorities , reacting to an alarming rise in new hiv infections from 2003 to 2004 , have resolved to intensify their pro-condom campaign .
can heath educators instil " safer sex " attitudes in today 's youth ? in relation to its european neighbors , germany has a fairly low rate of hiv / aids infection .
in 2004 , according to the robert koch institute , 45,000 people living in germany were infected , in a country of over 82 million .
only norway , sweden , and finland , among western european nations , had a lower percentage of cases .
on the face of it , this would seem to be a statistic elisabeth pott , director of the federal center for health education , could be proud of . but pott is not particularly proud of germany 's current position in the battle against aids .
the statistics on condom use are alarming for epidemiologists , as they tell a story of increasing disregard for safer sex practices that were encouraged by intensive campaigns in the late 1980s . in 1987 germany began a 50 million deutschmark nationwide anti-aids program .
the program was so successful in cutting down the number of new infections that it was itself whittled down annually until in 1998 , the budget was some 18 million deutschmarks -lrb- around nine million euros -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids prevention posters critics say the effect of this scaling down can be seen in the changing attitudes of germany 's youth towards the epidemic today .
whereas two in three 16-year-olds ranked aids among the most dangerous diseases in the late eighties , today only one third do . false sense of security the lack of concern over aids has also led to a marked decrease in condom use , especially among 16 to 44-year-old single people , reported pott . " in 2003 , 78 percent of those engaging in sex with a new partner used condoms , while in 2004 it was only 70 percent , " she reported .
" we are seeing that even though we are still below 2,000 new infections per year , we had a six percent climb in new infections from 2003 to 2004 .
this is clearly a sign that tells us more has to be done to reach people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an hiv-positive sex worker at a counseling center in madras , india as reports in the media on aids , especially in industrialized countries , have declined , many people now believe that aids has been vanquished in the first world and relegated to the third .
this picture , said pott , is not only far from the truth , it is dangerous as well . help from insurers the limited financial resources of the federal center for health education make it difficult to reach the more people more effectively .
however , private health insurers have offered to step in to join the fight and help expand aids prevention programs .
with their help , the prevention budget will be increased to 12 million euros . " as views about safer sex have become more lax , especially among the younger groups , we have realized the importance of giving an added push for prevention , " said volker leienbach , director of the association of private health insurers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein fahrradfahrer fährt an einem werbeplakat-plakat zur verhütung von aids vorbei -lrb- foto vom 08.01.2005 zur illustration des themas jugend und aids -rrb- .
obwohl die krankheit nach wie vor tödlich sei , wird nach aussagen von brandenburgs gesundheitsministerin dagmar ziegler vor allem unter jugendlichen ein immer sorgloserer umgang mit hiv und aids beobachtet .
offensichtlich habe die verharmlosung etwas mit den medizinischen fortschritten auf diesem gebiet und verschiedenen therapien zu tun , die den ausbruch von aids oft über jahre hinauszögern könnten .

pott said organizations across the spectrum need to get involved , since it is estimated that 30,000 new infections have been prevented through the prevention campaigns so far . " treating that many people can cost 450 million euros annually , " she said .
" this number should give us pause to consider that , on top of the immense human costs caused by aids , we need to consider the benefits that preventive action offers for avoiding the financial costs as well .

german health authorities , reacting to an alarming rise in new hiv infections from 2003 to 2004 , have resolved to intensify their pro-condom campaign .
can heath educators instil " safer sex " attitudes in today 's youth ? in relation to its european neighbors , germany has a fairly low rate of hiv / aids infection .
in 2004 , according to the robert koch institute , 45,000 people living in germany were infected , in a country of over 82 million .
only norway , sweden , and finland , among western european nations , had a lower percentage of cases .
on the face of it , this would seem to be a statistic elisabeth pott , director of the federal center for health education , could be proud of . but pott is not particularly proud of germany 's current position in the battle against aids .
the statistics on condom use are alarming for epidemiologists , as they tell a story of increasing disregard for safer sex practices that were encouraged by intensive campaigns in the late 1980s . in 1987 germany began a 50 million deutschmark nationwide anti-aids program .
the program was so successful in cutting down the number of new infections that it was itself whittled down annually until in 1998 , the budget was some 18 million deutschmarks -lrb- around nine million euros -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids prevention posters critics say the effect of this scaling down can be seen in the changing attitudes of germany 's youth towards the epidemic today .
whereas two in three 16-year-olds ranked aids among the most dangerous diseases in the late eighties , today only one third do . false sense of security the lack of concern over aids has also led to a marked decrease in condom use , especially among 16 to 44-year-old single people , reported pott . " in 2003 , 78 percent of those engaging in sex with a new partner used condoms , while in 2004 it was only 70 percent , " she reported .
" we are seeing that even though we are still below 2,000 new infections per year , we had a six percent climb in new infections from 2003 to 2004 .
this is clearly a sign that tells us more has to be done to reach people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an hiv-positive sex worker at a counseling center in madras , india as reports in the media on aids , especially in industrialized countries , have declined , many people now believe that aids has been vanquished in the first world and relegated to the third .
this picture , said pott , is not only far from the truth , it is dangerous as well . help from insurers the limited financial resources of the federal center for health education make it difficult to reach the more people more effectively .
however , private health insurers have offered to step in to join the fight and help expand aids prevention programs .
with their help , the prevention budget will be increased to 12 million euros . " as views about safer sex have become more lax , especially among the younger groups , we have realized the importance of giving an added push for prevention , " said volker leienbach , director of the association of private health insurers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein fahrradfahrer fährt an einem werbeplakat-plakat zur verhütung von aids vorbei -lrb- foto vom 08.01.2005 zur illustration des themas jugend und aids -rrb- .
obwohl die krankheit nach wie vor tödlich sei , wird nach aussagen von brandenburgs gesundheitsministerin dagmar ziegler vor allem unter jugendlichen ein immer sorgloserer umgang mit hiv und aids beobachtet .
offensichtlich habe die verharmlosung etwas mit den medizinischen fortschritten auf diesem gebiet und verschiedenen therapien zu tun , die den ausbruch von aids oft über jahre hinauszögern könnten .
dass die krankheit heilbar wäre , sei jedoch ein inzwischen weit verbreiteter irrglaube .

there is a billboard campaign planned around world aids day on december 1 . the private insurers are the only health insurance group so far involved in the new condom campaigns .
pott said organizations across the spectrum need to get involved , since it is estimated that 30,000 new infections have been prevented through the prevention campaigns so far . " treating that many people can cost 450 million euros annually , " she said .
" this number should give us pause to consider that , on top of the immense human costs caused by aids , we need to consider the benefits that preventive action offers for avoiding the financial costs as well .

the catholic world youth day , set to hit cologne this week with a mammoth influx of devout adolescents , is a chance for german catholics to show their faith to the world .
but just how religious are german youth today ? pope john paul ii consecrated the first world youth day in 1985 , hoping to spur an upsurge in evangelical energy among catholic youth around the world .
at the 20th anniversary event , held this week in cologne , nearly one million young faithful from all over the world are expected to converge on the rhenish metropolis and its famous cathedral .
but some are calling into question whether the institution represented by pope benedict xvi , the first german pope in nearly 500 years , is in touch with the german youth of today . statistically speaking , the answer would seem to be negative .
a study of youth by shell in 2000 found that religious knowledge is a rarity among today 's youth .
a majority of german adolescents have only vague ideas about the fundamentals of christianity .
while 65 percent of german citizens officially belong to a church , only four to six percent of young germans attend sunday services , and then only occasionally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : near to the people ?
" i believe the institution of the church lives in an ivory tower , " said katrin , a young woman from cologne .
" they go about their business without really concerning themselves with the people .
they are far removed from the actual people . " values gap the reasons the institutional church does not resonate with many young people are varied .
some blame the church for not reaching out enough or in the right ways to the youth .
others say young people are simply more distracted today , having an unparalleled range of activities , interests , and ideologies - from environmental activism to video games - to choose from .
katrin thinks one reason is that the church 's stances are often not in line with the values of today 's youth , especially when it comes to sexual issues . " why should n't we use condoms when they protect us from diseases ?
why should n't we have protected sex , when we do n't want to get pregnant ? " she said . on homosexuality , katrin 's views also clash with official church doctrine . " homosexuality exists , has always existed .
you can interpret that to mean that god created it himself .
homosexuality will always exist ; it is not something that can be banned , " she said . when the church takes an official stance against contraception , as it has in cologne , for example , this serves to alienate many young people .
many would seem to echo katrin in saying yes to religion in general but no to certain aspects of church doctrine . lack of expertise whereas many youths recoil from the church 's sexual conservatism , there is also a group of christian teenagers that find the church 's stance on a variety of issues too ambivalent .
they may share the core christian values of social engagement and a strong family life , but turn to other organizations when it comes to environmental or human rights issues .
here , for many youths , the church lacks expertise .
they tend to direct their activism to organizations that are strongly oriented towards specific issues and attempt to influence the here and now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gemälde von martin luther german youth of today are not necessarily becoming less religious ; they are simply less interested in experiencing god through the mediation of the church .
and this should come as no surprise .
after all , it was the great german theologian martin luther who , at the start of the sixteenth century , initiated a rebellion from official church doctrine which was focused on the individual 's capacity to reach salvation through prayer , apart from the corrupt apparatus in rome . luther thus ushered in the modern age , the focus on the individual , and the loss in power for the catholic church , at least in northern europe .
germany 's youth of today , who do n't feel all that connected to the conservative doctrines of the church , and wish to focus on a personal , individual relationship to a higher power , are following in the footsteps of that german spirit of reform . editor 's note : deutsche welle is an official media partner of world youth day . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de condom plans cancelled at youth fest as 400,000 catholic young people from around the world prepare to make their way to cologne for world youth day , a spat over condom distribution has erupted .

the catholic world youth day , set to hit cologne this week with a mammoth influx of devout adolescents , is a chance for german catholics to show their faith to the world .
but just how religious are german youth today ? pope john paul ii consecrated the first world youth day in 1985 , hoping to spur an upsurge in evangelical energy among catholic youth around the world .
at the 20th anniversary event , held this week in cologne , nearly one million young faithful from all over the world are expected to converge on the rhenish metropolis and its famous cathedral .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.08.2005 fast-food joint caters to france 's muslims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims can eat the halal burgers without a worry islamic dietary laws have long kept many muslims away from mcdonald 's and burger king .
now a new fast-food restaurant in paris allows devout muslims to snack on burgers in accordance with the koran . long limited in their choice of eating-out options to kebab shops and halal meat outlets in the country , france 's large muslim population got a new alternative in the french capital last month . " buerger king muslim " or bkm , a new fast-food restaurant in the eastern paris suburb of clichy-sous-bois , offers the standard fast-food fare : burgers , fries , sundaes and doughnuts .
the difference is that the beef and chicken burgers here are halal - meat slaughtered in accordance with islamic dietary laws . the name of the new restaurant is a play on the french word " beur , " meaning a second-generation north african living in france . bildunterschrift : the interior is bright and colorful , not unlike the popular us chains mcdonald 's and burger king .
there is even a play corner for children and the prices are comparable .
the waitresses at bkm however , wear traditional islamic head scarves . in keeping with the koran the concept of a fast-food restaurant catering to france 's large muslim population sounds like a business idea whose time has come .
after the success of mecca cola , a soft drink marketed to french muslims , it was only a matter of time before a muslim-themed restaurant opened in the country with western europe 's largest muslim population . it seems to be working . " i like that i can now eat a hamburger - that was n't possible earlier , " said one muslim teenager at bkm .
his mother added that she was very satisfied because traditional fast-food chains had very limited choices for muslims .
the fish filet was the only food that observant muslims could order and still stay within dietary strictures . rachid bekhti , manager of bkm , said that great care was taken to ensure that the food was in accordance with the koran . " we check the meat very carefully , even the ingredients of the sauces - no animal fat or anything similar can be in it .
everything has to be halal . " that also means that bkm ensures there is no alcohol in any of the drinks on offer . bekhti 's sister leila said that the restaurant had the potential for becoming a popular haunt for young people - but not just muslims , she added : " everyone 's welcome here . " business booming , but challenges loom the restaurant was set up by three muslim friends who took their inspiration from similar chains abroad .
looking to offer a clean , family-oriented alternative to non-halal chains , it took almost two years to convince french backers to finance the undertaking . " people really like the restaurant , " morad benhamida told the associated press , adding that the restaurant 's stock price had tripled in one month .
" it seems like magic . " bildunterschrift : initial business may be booming , but in the long-run the owners of bkm admit there are challenges . clichy-sous-bouis , the paris suburb where bkm is located , is crowded with immigrants from former french colonies .
unemployment is high and many are housed in dilapidated social apartments . " we 've created 28 jobs and that 's important .
but now we have to make enough profits so that we can also pay people , " said hakim badaoui , a financial consultant for bkm . the plan is to expand and open branches in other french cities and provide young jobless people with a perspective , according to badaoui , and , he added , to provide competition to the established fast-food chains . monika lohmüller -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de muslim-friendly cola arrives in germany mecca cola , the muslim world 's answer to coca-cola , is coming to germany .

the catholic world youth day , set to hit cologne this week with a mammoth influx of devout adolescents , is a chance for german catholics to show their faith to the world .
but just how religious are german youth today ? pope john paul ii consecrated the first world youth day in 1985 , hoping to spur an upsurge in evangelical energy among catholic youth around the world .
at the 20th anniversary event , held this week in cologne , nearly one million young faithful from all over the world are expected to converge on the rhenish metropolis and its famous cathedral .
but some are calling into question whether the institution represented by pope benedict xvi , the first german pope in nearly 500 years , is in touch with the german youth of today . statistically speaking , the answer would seem to be negative .
a study of youth by shell in 2000 found that religious knowledge is a rarity among today 's youth .
a majority of german adolescents have only vague ideas about the fundamentals of christianity .
while 65 percent of german citizens officially belong to a church , only four to six percent of young germans attend sunday services , and then only occasionally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : near to the people ?
" i believe the institution of the church lives in an ivory tower , " said katrin , a young woman from cologne .
" they go about their business without really concerning themselves with the people .
they are far removed from the actual people . " values gap the reasons the institutional church does not resonate with many young people are varied .
some blame the church for not reaching out enough or in the right ways to the youth .
others say young people are simply more distracted today , having an unparalleled range of activities , interests , and ideologies - from environmental activism to video games - to choose from .
katrin thinks one reason is that the church 's stances are often not in line with the values of today 's youth , especially when it comes to sexual issues . " why should n't we use condoms when they protect us from diseases ?
why should n't we have protected sex , when we do n't want to get pregnant ? " she said . on homosexuality , katrin 's views also clash with official church doctrine . " homosexuality exists , has always existed .
you can interpret that to mean that god created it himself .
homosexuality will always exist ; it is not something that can be banned , " she said . when the church takes an official stance against contraception , as it has in cologne , for example , this serves to alienate many young people .
many would seem to echo katrin in saying yes to religion in general but no to certain aspects of church doctrine . lack of expertise whereas many youths recoil from the church 's sexual conservatism , there is also a group of christian teenagers that find the church 's stance on a variety of issues too ambivalent .
they may share the core christian values of social engagement and a strong family life , but turn to other organizations when it comes to environmental or human rights issues .
here , for many youths , the church lacks expertise .
they tend to direct their activism to organizations that are strongly oriented towards specific issues and attempt to influence the here and now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gemälde von martin luther german youth of today are not necessarily becoming less religious ; they are simply less interested in experiencing god through the mediation of the church .
and this should come as no surprise .
after all , it was the great german theologian martin luther who , at the start of the sixteenth century , initiated a rebellion from official church doctrine which was focused on the individual 's capacity to reach salvation through prayer , apart from the corrupt apparatus in rome . luther thus ushered in the modern age , the focus on the individual , and the loss in power for the catholic church , at least in northern europe .
germany 's youth of today , who do n't feel all that connected to the conservative doctrines of the church , and wish to focus on a personal , individual relationship to a higher power , are following in the footsteps of that german spirit of reform . editor 's note : deutsche welle is an official media partner of world youth day . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de condom plans cancelled at youth fest as 400,000 catholic young people from around the world prepare to make their way to cologne for world youth day , a spat over condom distribution has erupted .

now a new fast-food restaurant in paris allows devout muslims to snack on burgers in accordance with the koran . long limited in their choice of eating-out options to kebab shops and halal meat outlets in the country , france 's large muslim population got a new alternative in the french capital last month . " buerger king muslim " or bkm , a new fast-food restaurant in the eastern paris suburb of clichy-sous-bois , offers the standard fast-food fare : burgers , fries , sundaes and doughnuts .
the difference is that the beef and chicken burgers here are halal - meat slaughtered in accordance with islamic dietary laws . the name of the new restaurant is a play on the french word " beur , " meaning a second-generation north african living in france . bildunterschrift : the interior is bright and colorful , not unlike the popular us chains mcdonald 's and burger king .
there is even a play corner for children and the prices are comparable .
the waitresses at bkm however , wear traditional islamic head scarves . in keeping with the koran the concept of a fast-food restaurant catering to france 's large muslim population sounds like a business idea whose time has come .
after the success of mecca cola , a soft drink marketed to french muslims , it was only a matter of time before a muslim-themed restaurant opened in the country with western europe 's largest muslim population . it seems to be working . " i like that i can now eat a hamburger - that was n't possible earlier , " said one muslim teenager at bkm .
his mother added that she was very satisfied because traditional fast-food chains had very limited choices for muslims .
the fish filet was the only food that observant muslims could order and still stay within dietary strictures . rachid bekhti , manager of bkm , said that great care was taken to ensure that the food was in accordance with the koran . " we check the meat very carefully , even the ingredients of the sauces - no animal fat or anything similar can be in it .
everything has to be halal . " that also means that bkm ensures there is no alcohol in any of the drinks on offer . bekhti 's sister leila said that the restaurant had the potential for becoming a popular haunt for young people - but not just muslims , she added : " everyone 's welcome here . " business booming , but challenges loom the restaurant was set up by three muslim friends who took their inspiration from similar chains abroad .
looking to offer a clean , family-oriented alternative to non-halal chains , it took almost two years to convince french backers to finance the undertaking . " people really like the restaurant , " morad benhamida told the associated press , adding that the restaurant 's stock price had tripled in one month .
" it seems like magic . " bildunterschrift : initial business may be booming , but in the long-run the owners of bkm admit there are challenges . clichy-sous-bouis , the paris suburb where bkm is located , is crowded with immigrants from former french colonies .
unemployment is high and many are housed in dilapidated social apartments . " we 've created 28 jobs and that 's important .
but now we have to make enough profits so that we can also pay people , " said hakim badaoui , a financial consultant for bkm . the plan is to expand and open branches in other french cities and provide young jobless people with a perspective , according to badaoui , and , he added , to provide competition to the established fast-food chains . monika lohmüller -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de muslim-friendly cola arrives in germany mecca cola , the muslim world 's answer to coca-cola , is coming to germany .

" i believe the institution of the church lives in an ivory tower , " said katrin , a young woman from cologne .
" they go about their business without really concerning themselves with the people .
they are far removed from the actual people . " values gap the reasons the institutional church does not resonate with many young people are varied .
some blame the church for not reaching out enough or in the right ways to the youth .
others say young people are simply more distracted today , having an unparalleled range of activities , interests , and ideologies - from environmental activism to video games - to choose from .
katrin thinks one reason is that the church 's stances are often not in line with the values of today 's youth , especially when it comes to sexual issues . " why should n't we use condoms when they protect us from diseases ?
why should n't we have protected sex , when we do n't want to get pregnant ? " she said . on homosexuality , katrin 's views also clash with official church doctrine . " homosexuality exists , has always existed .
you can interpret that to mean that god created it himself .
homosexuality will always exist ; it is not something that can be banned , " she said . when the church takes an official stance against contraception , as it has in cologne , for example , this serves to alienate many young people .
many would seem to echo katrin in saying yes to religion in general but no to certain aspects of church doctrine . lack of expertise whereas many youths recoil from the church 's sexual conservatism , there is also a group of christian teenagers that find the church 's stance on a variety of issues too ambivalent .
they may share the core christian values of social engagement and a strong family life , but turn to other organizations when it comes to environmental or human rights issues .
here , for many youths , the church lacks expertise .
they tend to direct their activism to organizations that are strongly oriented towards specific issues and attempt to influence the here and now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gemälde von martin luther german youth of today are not necessarily becoming less religious ; they are simply less interested in experiencing god through the mediation of the church .
and this should come as no surprise .
after all , it was the great german theologian martin luther who , at the start of the sixteenth century , initiated a rebellion from official church doctrine which was focused on the individual 's capacity to reach salvation through prayer , apart from the corrupt apparatus in rome . luther thus ushered in the modern age , the focus on the individual , and the loss in power for the catholic church , at least in northern europe .
germany 's youth of today , who do n't feel all that connected to the conservative doctrines of the church , and wish to focus on a personal , individual relationship to a higher power , are following in the footsteps of that german spirit of reform . editor 's note : deutsche welle is an official media partner of world youth day . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de condom plans cancelled at youth fest as 400,000 catholic young people from around the world prepare to make their way to cologne for world youth day , a spat over condom distribution has erupted .

now a new fast-food restaurant in paris allows devout muslims to snack on burgers in accordance with the koran . long limited in their choice of eating-out options to kebab shops and halal meat outlets in the country , france 's large muslim population got a new alternative in the french capital last month . " buerger king muslim " or bkm , a new fast-food restaurant in the eastern paris suburb of clichy-sous-bois , offers the standard fast-food fare : burgers , fries , sundaes and doughnuts .
the difference is that the beef and chicken burgers here are halal - meat slaughtered in accordance with islamic dietary laws . the name of the new restaurant is a play on the french word " beur , " meaning a second-generation north african living in france . bildunterschrift : the interior is bright and colorful , not unlike the popular us chains mcdonald 's and burger king .
there is even a play corner for children and the prices are comparable .
the waitresses at bkm however , wear traditional islamic head scarves . in keeping with the koran the concept of a fast-food restaurant catering to france 's large muslim population sounds like a business idea whose time has come .
after the success of mecca cola , a soft drink marketed to french muslims , it was only a matter of time before a muslim-themed restaurant opened in the country with western europe 's largest muslim population . it seems to be working . " i like that i can now eat a hamburger - that was n't possible earlier , " said one muslim teenager at bkm .
his mother added that she was very satisfied because traditional fast-food chains had very limited choices for muslims .
the fish filet was the only food that observant muslims could order and still stay within dietary strictures . rachid bekhti , manager of bkm , said that great care was taken to ensure that the food was in accordance with the koran . " we check the meat very carefully , even the ingredients of the sauces - no animal fat or anything similar can be in it .
everything has to be halal . " that also means that bkm ensures there is no alcohol in any of the drinks on offer . bekhti 's sister leila said that the restaurant had the potential for becoming a popular haunt for young people - but not just muslims , she added : " everyone 's welcome here . " business booming , but challenges loom the restaurant was set up by three muslim friends who took their inspiration from similar chains abroad .
looking to offer a clean , family-oriented alternative to non-halal chains , it took almost two years to convince french backers to finance the undertaking . " people really like the restaurant , " morad benhamida told the associated press , adding that the restaurant 's stock price had tripled in one month .
" it seems like magic . " bildunterschrift : initial business may be booming , but in the long-run the owners of bkm admit there are challenges . clichy-sous-bouis , the paris suburb where bkm is located , is crowded with immigrants from former french colonies .
unemployment is high and many are housed in dilapidated social apartments . " we 've created 28 jobs and that 's important .
but now we have to make enough profits so that we can also pay people , " said hakim badaoui , a financial consultant for bkm . the plan is to expand and open branches in other french cities and provide young jobless people with a perspective , according to badaoui , and , he added , to provide competition to the established fast-food chains . monika lohmüller -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de muslim-friendly cola arrives in germany mecca cola , the muslim world 's answer to coca-cola , is coming to germany .

" buerger king muslim " or bkm , a new fast-food restaurant in the eastern paris suburb of clichy-sous-bois , offers the standard fast-food fare : burgers , fries , sundaes and doughnuts .

his mother added that she was very satisfied because traditional fast-food chains had very limited choices for muslims .
the fish filet was the only food that observant muslims could order and still stay within dietary strictures . rachid bekhti , manager of bkm , said that great care was taken to ensure that the food was in accordance with the koran . " we check the meat very carefully , even the ingredients of the sauces - no animal fat or anything similar can be in it .
everything has to be halal . " that also means that bkm ensures there is no alcohol in any of the drinks on offer . bekhti 's sister leila said that the restaurant had the potential for becoming a popular haunt for young people - but not just muslims , she added : " everyone 's welcome here . " business booming , but challenges loom the restaurant was set up by three muslim friends who took their inspiration from similar chains abroad .
looking to offer a clean , family-oriented alternative to non-halal chains , it took almost two years to convince french backers to finance the undertaking .

in 2004 , according to the robert koch institute , 45,000 people living in germany were infected , in a country of over 82 million .
only norway , sweden , and finland , among western european nations , had a lower percentage of cases .
on the face of it , this would seem to be a statistic elisabeth pott , director of the federal center for health education , could be proud of . but pott is not particularly proud of germany 's current position in the battle against aids .
the statistics on condom use are alarming for epidemiologists , as they tell a story of increasing disregard for safer sex practices that were encouraged by intensive campaigns in the late 1980s . in 1987 germany began a 50 million deutschmark nationwide anti-aids program .
the program was so successful in cutting down the number of new infections that it was itself whittled down annually until in 1998 , the budget was some 18 million deutschmarks -lrb- around nine million euros -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids prevention posters critics say the effect of this scaling down can be seen in the changing attitudes of germany 's youth towards the epidemic today .
whereas two in three 16-year-olds ranked aids among the most dangerous diseases in the late eighties , today only one third do . false sense of security the lack of concern over aids has also led to a marked decrease in condom use , especially among 16 to 44-year-old single people , reported pott . " in 2003 , 78 percent of those engaging in sex with a new partner used condoms , while in 2004 it was only 70 percent , " she reported .
" we are seeing that even though we are still below 2,000 new infections per year , we had a six percent climb in new infections from 2003 to 2004 .
this is clearly a sign that tells us more has to be done to reach people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an hiv-positive sex worker at a counseling center in madras , india as reports in the media on aids , especially in industrialized countries , have declined , many people now believe that aids has been vanquished in the first world and relegated to the third .
this picture , said pott , is not only far from the truth , it is dangerous as well . help from insurers the limited financial resources of the federal center for health education make it difficult to reach the more people more effectively .
however , private health insurers have offered to step in to join the fight and help expand aids prevention programs .
with their help , the prevention budget will be increased to 12 million euros . " as views about safer sex have become more lax , especially among the younger groups , we have realized the importance of giving an added push for prevention , " said volker leienbach , director of the association of private health insurers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein fahrradfahrer fährt an einem werbeplakat-plakat zur verhütung von aids vorbei -lrb- foto vom 08.01.2005 zur illustration des themas jugend und aids -rrb- .
obwohl die krankheit nach wie vor tödlich sei , wird nach aussagen von brandenburgs gesundheitsministerin dagmar ziegler vor allem unter jugendlichen ein immer sorgloserer umgang mit hiv und aids beobachtet .
offensichtlich habe die verharmlosung etwas mit den medizinischen fortschritten auf diesem gebiet und verschiedenen therapien zu tun , die den ausbruch von aids oft über jahre hinauszögern könnten .
dass die krankheit heilbar wäre , sei jedoch ein inzwischen weit verbreiteter irrglaube .
aufgabe der gesellschaft sei es deshalb , sie dafür zu sensibilisieren , für den eigenen schutz zu sorgen .

there is a billboard campaign planned around world aids day on december 1 . the private insurers are the only health insurance group so far involved in the new condom campaigns .
pott said organizations across the spectrum need to get involved , since it is estimated that 30,000 new infections have been prevented through the prevention campaigns so far . " treating that many people can cost 450 million euros annually , " she said .
" this number should give us pause to consider that , on top of the immense human costs caused by aids , we need to consider the benefits that preventive action offers for avoiding the financial costs as well .

the catholic world youth day , set to hit cologne this week with a mammoth influx of devout adolescents , is a chance for german catholics to show their faith to the world .
but just how religious are german youth today ? pope john paul ii consecrated the first world youth day in 1985 , hoping to spur an upsurge in evangelical energy among catholic youth around the world .
at the 20th anniversary event , held this week in cologne , nearly one million young faithful from all over the world are expected to converge on the rhenish metropolis and its famous cathedral .
but some are calling into question whether the institution represented by pope benedict xvi , the first german pope in nearly 500 years , is in touch with the german youth of today . statistically speaking , the answer would seem to be negative .
a study of youth by shell in 2000 found that religious knowledge is a rarity among today 's youth .
a majority of german adolescents have only vague ideas about the fundamentals of christianity .
while 65 percent of german citizens officially belong to a church , only four to six percent of young germans attend sunday services , and then only occasionally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : near to the people ?
" i believe the institution of the church lives in an ivory tower , " said katrin , a young woman from cologne .
" they go about their business without really concerning themselves with the people .
they are far removed from the actual people . " values gap the reasons the institutional church does not resonate with many young people are varied .
some blame the church for not reaching out enough or in the right ways to the youth .
others say young people are simply more distracted today , having an unparalleled range of activities , interests , and ideologies - from environmental activism to video games - to choose from .
katrin thinks one reason is that the church 's stances are often not in line with the values of today 's youth , especially when it comes to sexual issues . " why should n't we use condoms when they protect us from diseases ?
why should n't we have protected sex , when we do n't want to get pregnant ? " she said . on homosexuality , katrin 's views also clash with official church doctrine . " homosexuality exists , has always existed .
you can interpret that to mean that god created it himself .
homosexuality will always exist ; it is not something that can be banned , " she said . when the church takes an official stance against contraception , as it has in cologne , for example , this serves to alienate many young people .
many would seem to echo katrin in saying yes to religion in general but no to certain aspects of church doctrine . lack of expertise whereas many youths recoil from the church 's sexual conservatism , there is also a group of christian teenagers that find the church 's stance on a variety of issues too ambivalent .
they may share the core christian values of social engagement and a strong family life , but turn to other organizations when it comes to environmental or human rights issues .
here , for many youths , the church lacks expertise .
they tend to direct their activism to organizations that are strongly oriented towards specific issues and attempt to influence the here and now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gemälde von martin luther german youth of today are not necessarily becoming less religious ; they are simply less interested in experiencing god through the mediation of the church .
and this should come as no surprise .
after all , it was the great german theologian martin luther who , at the start of the sixteenth century , initiated a rebellion from official church doctrine which was focused on the individual 's capacity to reach salvation through prayer , apart from the corrupt apparatus in rome . luther thus ushered in the modern age , the focus on the individual , and the loss in power for the catholic church , at least in northern europe .
germany 's youth of today , who do n't feel all that connected to the conservative doctrines of the church , and wish to focus on a personal , individual relationship to a higher power , are following in the footsteps of that german spirit of reform . editor 's note : deutsche welle is an official media partner of world youth day . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de condom plans cancelled at youth fest as 400,000 catholic young people from around the world prepare to make their way to cologne for world youth day , a spat over condom distribution has erupted .

the catholic world youth day , set to hit cologne this week with a mammoth influx of devout adolescents , is a chance for german catholics to show their faith to the world .
but just how religious are german youth today ? pope john paul ii consecrated the first world youth day in 1985 , hoping to spur an upsurge in evangelical energy among catholic youth around the world .
at the 20th anniversary event , held this week in cologne , nearly one million young faithful from all over the world are expected to converge on the rhenish metropolis and its famous cathedral .
but some are calling into question whether the institution represented by pope benedict xvi , the first german pope in nearly 500 years , is in touch with the german youth of today . statistically speaking , the answer would seem to be negative .
a study of youth by shell in 2000 found that religious knowledge is a rarity among today 's youth .
a majority of german adolescents have only vague ideas about the fundamentals of christianity .
while 65 percent of german citizens officially belong to a church , only four to six percent of young germans attend sunday services , and then only occasionally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : near to the people ?
" i believe the institution of the church lives in an ivory tower , " said katrin , a young woman from cologne .
" they go about their business without really concerning themselves with the people .
they are far removed from the actual people . " values gap the reasons the institutional church does not resonate with many young people are varied .
some blame the church for not reaching out enough or in the right ways to the youth .
others say young people are simply more distracted today , having an unparalleled range of activities , interests , and ideologies - from environmental activism to video games - to choose from .
katrin thinks one reason is that the church 's stances are often not in line with the values of today 's youth , especially when it comes to sexual issues . " why should n't we use condoms when they protect us from diseases ?
why should n't we have protected sex , when we do n't want to get pregnant ? " she said . on homosexuality , katrin 's views also clash with official church doctrine . " homosexuality exists , has always existed .
you can interpret that to mean that god created it himself .
homosexuality will always exist ; it is not something that can be banned , " she said . when the church takes an official stance against contraception , as it has in cologne , for example , this serves to alienate many young people .
many would seem to echo katrin in saying yes to religion in general but no to certain aspects of church doctrine . lack of expertise whereas many youths recoil from the church 's sexual conservatism , there is also a group of christian teenagers that find the church 's stance on a variety of issues too ambivalent .
they may share the core christian values of social engagement and a strong family life , but turn to other organizations when it comes to environmental or human rights issues .
here , for many youths , the church lacks expertise .
they tend to direct their activism to organizations that are strongly oriented towards specific issues and attempt to influence the here and now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gemälde von martin luther german youth of today are not necessarily becoming less religious ; they are simply less interested in experiencing god through the mediation of the church .

german health authorities , reacting to an alarming rise in new hiv infections from 2003 to 2004 , have resolved to intensify their pro-condom campaign .
can heath educators instil " safer sex " attitudes in today 's youth ? in relation to its european neighbors , germany has a fairly low rate of hiv / aids infection .
in 2004 , according to the robert koch institute , 45,000 people living in germany were infected , in a country of over 82 million .
only norway , sweden , and finland , among western european nations , had a lower percentage of cases .
on the face of it , this would seem to be a statistic elisabeth pott , director of the federal center for health education , could be proud of . but pott is not particularly proud of germany 's current position in the battle against aids .
the statistics on condom use are alarming for epidemiologists , as they tell a story of increasing disregard for safer sex practices that were encouraged by intensive campaigns in the late 1980s . in 1987 germany began a 50 million deutschmark nationwide anti-aids program .
the program was so successful in cutting down the number of new infections that it was itself whittled down annually until in 1998 , the budget was some 18 million deutschmarks -lrb- around nine million euros -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids prevention posters critics say the effect of this scaling down can be seen in the changing attitudes of germany 's youth towards the epidemic today .
whereas two in three 16-year-olds ranked aids among the most dangerous diseases in the late eighties , today only one third do . false sense of security the lack of concern over aids has also led to a marked decrease in condom use , especially among 16 to 44-year-old single people , reported pott . " in 2003 , 78 percent of those engaging in sex with a new partner used condoms , while in 2004 it was only 70 percent , " she reported .
" we are seeing that even though we are still below 2,000 new infections per year , we had a six percent climb in new infections from 2003 to 2004 .
this is clearly a sign that tells us more has to be done to reach people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an hiv-positive sex worker at a counseling center in madras , india as reports in the media on aids , especially in industrialized countries , have declined , many people now believe that aids has been vanquished in the first world and relegated to the third .
this picture , said pott , is not only far from the truth , it is dangerous as well . help from insurers the limited financial resources of the federal center for health education make it difficult to reach the more people more effectively .
however , private health insurers have offered to step in to join the fight and help expand aids prevention programs .
with their help , the prevention budget will be increased to 12 million euros . " as views about safer sex have become more lax , especially among the younger groups , we have realized the importance of giving an added push for prevention , " said volker leienbach , director of the association of private health insurers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein fahrradfahrer fährt an einem werbeplakat-plakat zur verhütung von aids vorbei -lrb- foto vom 08.01.2005 zur illustration des themas jugend und aids -rrb- .
obwohl die krankheit nach wie vor tödlich sei , wird nach aussagen von brandenburgs gesundheitsministerin dagmar ziegler vor allem unter jugendlichen ein immer sorgloserer umgang mit hiv und aids beobachtet .

german health authorities , reacting to an alarming rise in new hiv infections from 2003 to 2004 , have resolved to intensify their pro-condom campaign .
can heath educators instil " safer sex " attitudes in today 's youth ? in relation to its european neighbors , germany has a fairly low rate of hiv / aids infection .
in 2004 , according to the robert koch institute , 45,000 people living in germany were infected , in a country of over 82 million .
only norway , sweden , and finland , among western european nations , had a lower percentage of cases .
on the face of it , this would seem to be a statistic elisabeth pott , director of the federal center for health education , could be proud of . but pott is not particularly proud of germany 's current position in the battle against aids .
the statistics on condom use are alarming for epidemiologists , as they tell a story of increasing disregard for safer sex practices that were encouraged by intensive campaigns in the late 1980s . in 1987 germany began a 50 million deutschmark nationwide anti-aids program .
the program was so successful in cutting down the number of new infections that it was itself whittled down annually until in 1998 , the budget was some 18 million deutschmarks -lrb- around nine million euros -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids prevention posters critics say the effect of this scaling down can be seen in the changing attitudes of germany 's youth towards the epidemic today .
whereas two in three 16-year-olds ranked aids among the most dangerous diseases in the late eighties , today only one third do . false sense of security the lack of concern over aids has also led to a marked decrease in condom use , especially among 16 to 44-year-old single people , reported pott . " in 2003 , 78 percent of those engaging in sex with a new partner used condoms , while in 2004 it was only 70 percent , " she reported .
" we are seeing that even though we are still below 2,000 new infections per year , we had a six percent climb in new infections from 2003 to 2004 .
this is clearly a sign that tells us more has to be done to reach people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an hiv-positive sex worker at a counseling center in madras , india as reports in the media on aids , especially in industrialized countries , have declined , many people now believe that aids has been vanquished in the first world and relegated to the third .
this picture , said pott , is not only far from the truth , it is dangerous as well . help from insurers the limited financial resources of the federal center for health education make it difficult to reach the more people more effectively .
however , private health insurers have offered to step in to join the fight and help expand aids prevention programs .
with their help , the prevention budget will be increased to 12 million euros . " as views about safer sex have become more lax , especially among the younger groups , we have realized the importance of giving an added push for prevention , " said volker leienbach , director of the association of private health insurers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein fahrradfahrer fährt an einem werbeplakat-plakat zur verhütung von aids vorbei -lrb- foto vom 08.01.2005 zur illustration des themas jugend und aids -rrb- .
obwohl die krankheit nach wie vor tödlich sei , wird nach aussagen von brandenburgs gesundheitsministerin dagmar ziegler vor allem unter jugendlichen ein immer sorgloserer umgang mit hiv und aids beobachtet .
offensichtlich habe die verharmlosung etwas mit den medizinischen fortschritten auf diesem gebiet und verschiedenen therapien zu tun , die den ausbruch von aids oft über jahre hinauszögern könnten .
dass die krankheit heilbar wäre , sei jedoch ein inzwischen weit verbreiteter irrglaube .
aufgabe der gesellschaft sei es deshalb , sie dafür zu sensibilisieren , für den eigenen schutz zu sorgen .

now a new fast-food restaurant in paris allows devout muslims to snack on burgers in accordance with the koran . long limited in their choice of eating-out options to kebab shops and halal meat outlets in the country , france 's large muslim population got a new alternative in the french capital last month . " buerger king muslim " or bkm , a new fast-food restaurant in the eastern paris suburb of clichy-sous-bois , offers the standard fast-food fare : burgers , fries , sundaes and doughnuts .

his mother added that she was very satisfied because traditional fast-food chains had very limited choices for muslims .
the fish filet was the only food that observant muslims could order and still stay within dietary strictures . rachid bekhti , manager of bkm , said that great care was taken to ensure that the food was in accordance with the koran . " we check the meat very carefully , even the ingredients of the sauces - no animal fat or anything similar can be in it .
everything has to be halal .

" business booming , but challenges loom the restaurant was set up by three muslim friends who took their inspiration from similar chains abroad .
looking to offer a clean , family-oriented alternative to non-halal chains , it took almost two years to convince french backers to finance the undertaking . " people really like the restaurant , " morad benhamida told the associated press , adding that the restaurant 's stock price had tripled in one month .
" it seems like magic . " bildunterschrift : initial business may be booming , but in the long-run the owners of bkm admit there are challenges . clichy-sous-bouis , the paris suburb where bkm is located , is crowded with immigrants from former french colonies .

but now we have to make enough profits so that we can also pay people , " said hakim badaoui , a financial consultant for bkm . the plan is to expand and open branches in other french cities and provide young jobless people with a perspective , according to badaoui , and , he added , to provide competition to the established fast-food chains . monika lohmüller -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de muslim-friendly cola arrives in germany mecca cola , the muslim world 's answer to coca-cola , is coming to germany .

now a new fast-food restaurant in paris allows devout muslims to snack on burgers in accordance with the koran . long limited in their choice of eating-out options to kebab shops and halal meat outlets in the country , france 's large muslim population got a new alternative in the french capital last month . " buerger king muslim " or bkm , a new fast-food restaurant in the eastern paris suburb of clichy-sous-bois , offers the standard fast-food fare : burgers , fries , sundaes and doughnuts .
the difference is that the beef and chicken burgers here are halal - meat slaughtered in accordance with islamic dietary laws . the name of the new restaurant is a play on the french word " beur , " meaning a second-generation north african living in france . bildunterschrift : the interior is bright and colorful , not unlike the popular us chains mcdonald 's and burger king .
there is even a play corner for children and the prices are comparable .
the waitresses at bkm however , wear traditional islamic head scarves . in keeping with the koran the concept of a fast-food restaurant catering to france 's large muslim population sounds like a business idea whose time has come .
after the success of mecca cola , a soft drink marketed to french muslims , it was only a matter of time before a muslim-themed restaurant opened in the country with western europe 's largest muslim population . it seems to be working . " i like that i can now eat a hamburger - that was n't possible earlier , " said one muslim teenager at bkm .
his mother added that she was very satisfied because traditional fast-food chains had very limited choices for muslims .
the fish filet was the only food that observant muslims could order and still stay within dietary strictures . rachid bekhti , manager of bkm , said that great care was taken to ensure that the food was in accordance with the koran . " we check the meat very carefully , even the ingredients of the sauces - no animal fat or anything similar can be in it .
everything has to be halal . " that also means that bkm ensures there is no alcohol in any of the drinks on offer . bekhti 's sister leila said that the restaurant had the potential for becoming a popular haunt for young people - but not just muslims , she added : " everyone 's welcome here . " business booming , but challenges loom the restaurant was set up by three muslim friends who took their inspiration from similar chains abroad .
looking to offer a clean , family-oriented alternative to non-halal chains , it took almost two years to convince french backers to finance the undertaking . " people really like the restaurant , " morad benhamida told the associated press , adding that the restaurant 's stock price had tripled in one month .
" it seems like magic . " bildunterschrift : initial business may be booming , but in the long-run the owners of bkm admit there are challenges . clichy-sous-bouis , the paris suburb where bkm is located , is crowded with immigrants from former french colonies .
unemployment is high and many are housed in dilapidated social apartments . " we 've created 28 jobs and that 's important .
but now we have to make enough profits so that we can also pay people , " said hakim badaoui , a financial consultant for bkm . the plan is to expand and open branches in other french cities and provide young jobless people with a perspective , according to badaoui , and , he added , to provide competition to the established fast-food chains . monika lohmüller -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de muslim-friendly cola arrives in germany mecca cola , the muslim world 's answer to coca-cola , is coming to germany .

" let 's leave military options aside , we have already seen that they do n't amount to anything , " schröder said during an electoral meeting in the northern city of hanover . the chancellor 's statement followed an interview aired friday on israeli public television in which us president george w. bush said that " all options are on the table " when asked if the use of force was an alternative to faltering diplomacy with iran . in an interview to be published sunday in the german weekly bild am sonntag , schröder said he considered any military option " extremely dangerous . " " this is why i can with certainty exclude any participation by the german government under my direction , " he said . schröder " very concerned " the social democrat chancellor - who in polls leading up to early legislative elections on september 18 is lagging behind his christian democrat challenger angela merkel - added that he was " very concerned " by the situation in iran . tehran must not be allowed to manufacture nuclear weapons , he said , adding that numerous european propositions had been made " in order to induce iran to change its position .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 14.08.2005 fast-food joint caters to france 's muslims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims can eat the halal burgers without a worry islamic dietary laws have long kept many muslims away from mcdonald 's and burger king .
now a new fast-food restaurant in paris allows devout muslims to snack on burgers in accordance with the koran . long limited in their choice of eating-out options to kebab shops and halal meat outlets in the country , france 's large muslim population got a new alternative in the french capital last month . " buerger king muslim " or bkm , a new fast-food restaurant in the eastern paris suburb of clichy-sous-bois , offers the standard fast-food fare : burgers , fries , sundaes and doughnuts .
the difference is that the beef and chicken burgers here are halal - meat slaughtered in accordance with islamic dietary laws . the name of the new restaurant is a play on the french word " beur , " meaning a second-generation north african living in france . bildunterschrift : the interior is bright and colorful , not unlike the popular us chains mcdonald 's and burger king .
there is even a play corner for children and the prices are comparable .
the waitresses at bkm however , wear traditional islamic head scarves . in keeping with the koran the concept of a fast-food restaurant catering to france 's large muslim population sounds like a business idea whose time has come .
after the success of mecca cola , a soft drink marketed to french muslims , it was only a matter of time before a muslim-themed restaurant opened in the country with western europe 's largest muslim population . it seems to be working . " i like that i can now eat a hamburger - that was n't possible earlier , " said one muslim teenager at bkm .
his mother added that she was very satisfied because traditional fast-food chains had very limited choices for muslims .
the fish filet was the only food that observant muslims could order and still stay within dietary strictures . rachid bekhti , manager of bkm , said that great care was taken to ensure that the food was in accordance with the koran . " we check the meat very carefully , even the ingredients of the sauces - no animal fat or anything similar can be in it .
everything has to be halal . " that also means that bkm ensures there is no alcohol in any of the drinks on offer . bekhti 's sister leila said that the restaurant had the potential for becoming a popular haunt for young people - but not just muslims , she added : " everyone 's welcome here . " business booming , but challenges loom the restaurant was set up by three muslim friends who took their inspiration from similar chains abroad .
looking to offer a clean , family-oriented alternative to non-halal chains , it took almost two years to convince french backers to finance the undertaking . " people really like the restaurant , " morad benhamida told the associated press , adding that the restaurant 's stock price had tripled in one month .
" it seems like magic . " bildunterschrift : initial business may be booming , but in the long-run the owners of bkm admit there are challenges . clichy-sous-bouis , the paris suburb where bkm is located , is crowded with immigrants from former french colonies .
unemployment is high and many are housed in dilapidated social apartments . " we 've created 28 jobs and that 's important .
but now we have to make enough profits so that we can also pay people , " said hakim badaoui , a financial consultant for bkm . the plan is to expand and open branches in other french cities and provide young jobless people with a perspective , according to badaoui , and , he added , to provide competition to the established fast-food chains . monika lohmüller -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de muslim-friendly cola arrives in germany mecca cola , the muslim world 's answer to coca-cola , is coming to germany .

the catholic world youth day , set to hit cologne this week with a mammoth influx of devout adolescents , is a chance for german catholics to show their faith to the world .
but just how religious are german youth today ? pope john paul ii consecrated the first world youth day in 1985 , hoping to spur an upsurge in evangelical energy among catholic youth around the world .
at the 20th anniversary event , held this week in cologne , nearly one million young faithful from all over the world are expected to converge on the rhenish metropolis and its famous cathedral .
but some are calling into question whether the institution represented by pope benedict xvi , the first german pope in nearly 500 years , is in touch with the german youth of today . statistically speaking , the answer would seem to be negative .
a study of youth by shell in 2000 found that religious knowledge is a rarity among today 's youth .
a majority of german adolescents have only vague ideas about the fundamentals of christianity .
while 65 percent of german citizens officially belong to a church , only four to six percent of young germans attend sunday services , and then only occasionally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : near to the people ?
" i believe the institution of the church lives in an ivory tower , " said katrin , a young woman from cologne .
" they go about their business without really concerning themselves with the people .
they are far removed from the actual people . " values gap the reasons the institutional church does not resonate with many young people are varied .
some blame the church for not reaching out enough or in the right ways to the youth .
others say young people are simply more distracted today , having an unparalleled range of activities , interests , and ideologies - from environmental activism to video games - to choose from .
katrin thinks one reason is that the church 's stances are often not in line with the values of today 's youth , especially when it comes to sexual issues . " why should n't we use condoms when they protect us from diseases ?
why should n't we have protected sex , when we do n't want to get pregnant ? " she said . on homosexuality , katrin 's views also clash with official church doctrine . " homosexuality exists , has always existed .
you can interpret that to mean that god created it himself .
homosexuality will always exist ; it is not something that can be banned , " she said . when the church takes an official stance against contraception , as it has in cologne , for example , this serves to alienate many young people .
many would seem to echo katrin in saying yes to religion in general but no to certain aspects of church doctrine . lack of expertise whereas many youths recoil from the church 's sexual conservatism , there is also a group of christian teenagers that find the church 's stance on a variety of issues too ambivalent .
they may share the core christian values of social engagement and a strong family life , but turn to other organizations when it comes to environmental or human rights issues .
here , for many youths , the church lacks expertise .
they tend to direct their activism to organizations that are strongly oriented towards specific issues and attempt to influence the here and now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gemälde von martin luther german youth of today are not necessarily becoming less religious ; they are simply less interested in experiencing god through the mediation of the church .
and this should come as no surprise .
after all , it was the great german theologian martin luther who , at the start of the sixteenth century , initiated a rebellion from official church doctrine which was focused on the individual 's capacity to reach salvation through prayer , apart from the corrupt apparatus in rome . luther thus ushered in the modern age , the focus on the individual , and the loss in power for the catholic church , at least in northern europe .
germany 's youth of today , who do n't feel all that connected to the conservative doctrines of the church , and wish to focus on a personal , individual relationship to a higher power , are following in the footsteps of that german spirit of reform . editor 's note : deutsche welle is an official media partner of world youth day . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de condom plans cancelled at youth fest as 400,000 catholic young people from around the world prepare to make their way to cologne for world youth day , a spat over condom distribution has erupted .

they are far removed from the actual people . " values gap the reasons the institutional church does not resonate with many young people are varied .
some blame the church for not reaching out enough or in the right ways to the youth .
others say young people are simply more distracted today , having an unparalleled range of activities , interests , and ideologies - from environmental activism to video games - to choose from .
katrin thinks one reason is that the church 's stances are often not in line with the values of today 's youth , especially when it comes to sexual issues . " why should n't we use condoms when they protect us from diseases ?
why should n't we have protected sex , when we do n't want to get pregnant ? " she said . on homosexuality , katrin 's views also clash with official church doctrine . " homosexuality exists , has always existed .
you can interpret that to mean that god created it himself .
homosexuality will always exist ; it is not something that can be banned , " she said . when the church takes an official stance against contraception , as it has in cologne , for example , this serves to alienate many young people .
many would seem to echo katrin in saying yes to religion in general but no to certain aspects of church doctrine . lack of expertise whereas many youths recoil from the church 's sexual conservatism , there is also a group of christian teenagers that find the church 's stance on a variety of issues too ambivalent .
they may share the core christian values of social engagement and a strong family life , but turn to other organizations when it comes to environmental or human rights issues .
here , for many youths , the church lacks expertise .
they tend to direct their activism to organizations that are strongly oriented towards specific issues and attempt to influence the here and now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gemälde von martin luther german youth of today are not necessarily becoming less religious ; they are simply less interested in experiencing god through the mediation of the church .
and this should come as no surprise .
after all , it was the great german theologian martin luther who , at the start of the sixteenth century , initiated a rebellion from official church doctrine which was focused on the individual 's capacity to reach salvation through prayer , apart from the corrupt apparatus in rome . luther thus ushered in the modern age , the focus on the individual , and the loss in power for the catholic church , at least in northern europe .
germany 's youth of today , who do n't feel all that connected to the conservative doctrines of the church , and wish to focus on a personal , individual relationship to a higher power , are following in the footsteps of that german spirit of reform . editor 's note : deutsche welle is an official media partner of world youth day . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de condom plans cancelled at youth fest as 400,000 catholic young people from around the world prepare to make their way to cologne for world youth day , a spat over condom distribution has erupted .

now a new fast-food restaurant in paris allows devout muslims to snack on burgers in accordance with the koran . long limited in their choice of eating-out options to kebab shops and halal meat outlets in the country , france 's large muslim population got a new alternative in the french capital last month . " buerger king muslim " or bkm , a new fast-food restaurant in the eastern paris suburb of clichy-sous-bois , offers the standard fast-food fare : burgers , fries , sundaes and doughnuts .
the difference is that the beef and chicken burgers here are halal - meat slaughtered in accordance with islamic dietary laws . the name of the new restaurant is a play on the french word " beur , " meaning a second-generation north african living in france . bildunterschrift : the interior is bright and colorful , not unlike the popular us chains mcdonald 's and burger king .
there is even a play corner for children and the prices are comparable .
the waitresses at bkm however , wear traditional islamic head scarves . in keeping with the koran the concept of a fast-food restaurant catering to france 's large muslim population sounds like a business idea whose time has come .
after the success of mecca cola , a soft drink marketed to french muslims , it was only a matter of time before a muslim-themed restaurant opened in the country with western europe 's largest muslim population . it seems to be working . " i like that i can now eat a hamburger - that was n't possible earlier , " said one muslim teenager at bkm .
his mother added that she was very satisfied because traditional fast-food chains had very limited choices for muslims .
the fish filet was the only food that observant muslims could order and still stay within dietary strictures . rachid bekhti , manager of bkm , said that great care was taken to ensure that the food was in accordance with the koran . " we check the meat very carefully , even the ingredients of the sauces - no animal fat or anything similar can be in it .
everything has to be halal . " that also means that bkm ensures there is no alcohol in any of the drinks on offer . bekhti 's sister leila said that the restaurant had the potential for becoming a popular haunt for young people - but not just muslims , she added : " everyone 's welcome here . " business booming , but challenges loom the restaurant was set up by three muslim friends who took their inspiration from similar chains abroad .
looking to offer a clean , family-oriented alternative to non-halal chains , it took almost two years to convince french backers to finance the undertaking . " people really like the restaurant , " morad benhamida told the associated press , adding that the restaurant 's stock price had tripled in one month .
" it seems like magic . " bildunterschrift : initial business may be booming , but in the long-run the owners of bkm admit there are challenges . clichy-sous-bouis , the paris suburb where bkm is located , is crowded with immigrants from former french colonies .
unemployment is high and many are housed in dilapidated social apartments . " we 've created 28 jobs and that 's important .
but now we have to make enough profits so that we can also pay people , " said hakim badaoui , a financial consultant for bkm . the plan is to expand and open branches in other french cities and provide young jobless people with a perspective , according to badaoui , and , he added , to provide competition to the established fast-food chains . monika lohmüller -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de muslim-friendly cola arrives in germany mecca cola , the muslim world 's answer to coca-cola , is coming to germany .

now a new fast-food restaurant in paris allows devout muslims to snack on burgers in accordance with the koran . long limited in their choice of eating-out options to kebab shops and halal meat outlets in the country , france 's large muslim population got a new alternative in the french capital last month . " buerger king muslim " or bkm , a new fast-food restaurant in the eastern paris suburb of clichy-sous-bois , offers the standard fast-food fare : burgers , fries , sundaes and doughnuts .
the difference is that the beef and chicken burgers here are halal - meat slaughtered in accordance with islamic dietary laws . the name of the new restaurant is a play on the french word " beur , " meaning a second-generation north african living in france . bildunterschrift : the interior is bright and colorful , not unlike the popular us chains mcdonald 's and burger king .
there is even a play corner for children and the prices are comparable .
the waitresses at bkm however , wear traditional islamic head scarves . in keeping with the koran the concept of a fast-food restaurant catering to france 's large muslim population sounds like a business idea whose time has come .
after the success of mecca cola , a soft drink marketed to french muslims , it was only a matter of time before a muslim-themed restaurant opened in the country with western europe 's largest muslim population . it seems to be working . " i like that i can now eat a hamburger - that was n't possible earlier , " said one muslim teenager at bkm .
his mother added that she was very satisfied because traditional fast-food chains had very limited choices for muslims .
the fish filet was the only food that observant muslims could order and still stay within dietary strictures . rachid bekhti , manager of bkm , said that great care was taken to ensure that the food was in accordance with the koran . " we check the meat very carefully , even the ingredients of the sauces - no animal fat or anything similar can be in it .
everything has to be halal . " that also means that bkm ensures there is no alcohol in any of the drinks on offer . bekhti 's sister leila said that the restaurant had the potential for becoming a popular haunt for young people - but not just muslims , she added : " everyone 's welcome here . " business booming , but challenges loom the restaurant was set up by three muslim friends who took their inspiration from similar chains abroad .
looking to offer a clean , family-oriented alternative to non-halal chains , it took almost two years to convince french backers to finance the undertaking . " people really like the restaurant , " morad benhamida told the associated press , adding that the restaurant 's stock price had tripled in one month .
" it seems like magic . " bildunterschrift : initial business may be booming , but in the long-run the owners of bkm admit there are challenges . clichy-sous-bouis , the paris suburb where bkm is located , is crowded with immigrants from former french colonies .
unemployment is high and many are housed in dilapidated social apartments . " we 've created 28 jobs and that 's important .
but now we have to make enough profits so that we can also pay people , " said hakim badaoui , a financial consultant for bkm . the plan is to expand and open branches in other french cities and provide young jobless people with a perspective , according to badaoui , and , he added , to provide competition to the established fast-food chains . monika lohmüller -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de muslim-friendly cola arrives in germany mecca cola , the muslim world 's answer to coca-cola , is coming to germany .

the catholic world youth day , set to hit cologne this week with a mammoth influx of devout adolescents , is a chance for german catholics to show their faith to the world .
but just how religious are german youth today ? pope john paul ii consecrated the first world youth day in 1985 , hoping to spur an upsurge in evangelical energy among catholic youth around the world .
at the 20th anniversary event , held this week in cologne , nearly one million young faithful from all over the world are expected to converge on the rhenish metropolis and its famous cathedral .
but some are calling into question whether the institution represented by pope benedict xvi , the first german pope in nearly 500 years , is in touch with the german youth of today . statistically speaking , the answer would seem to be negative .
a study of youth by shell in 2000 found that religious knowledge is a rarity among today 's youth .
a majority of german adolescents have only vague ideas about the fundamentals of christianity .
while 65 percent of german citizens officially belong to a church , only four to six percent of young germans attend sunday services , and then only occasionally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : near to the people ?
" i believe the institution of the church lives in an ivory tower , " said katrin , a young woman from cologne .
" they go about their business without really concerning themselves with the people .
they are far removed from the actual people . " values gap the reasons the institutional church does not resonate with many young people are varied .
some blame the church for not reaching out enough or in the right ways to the youth .
others say young people are simply more distracted today , having an unparalleled range of activities , interests , and ideologies - from environmental activism to video games - to choose from .
katrin thinks one reason is that the church 's stances are often not in line with the values of today 's youth , especially when it comes to sexual issues . " why should n't we use condoms when they protect us from diseases ?
why should n't we have protected sex , when we do n't want to get pregnant ? " she said . on homosexuality , katrin 's views also clash with official church doctrine . " homosexuality exists , has always existed .
you can interpret that to mean that god created it himself .
homosexuality will always exist ; it is not something that can be banned , " she said . when the church takes an official stance against contraception , as it has in cologne , for example , this serves to alienate many young people .
many would seem to echo katrin in saying yes to religion in general but no to certain aspects of church doctrine . lack of expertise whereas many youths recoil from the church 's sexual conservatism , there is also a group of christian teenagers that find the church 's stance on a variety of issues too ambivalent .
they may share the core christian values of social engagement and a strong family life , but turn to other organizations when it comes to environmental or human rights issues .
here , for many youths , the church lacks expertise .
they tend to direct their activism to organizations that are strongly oriented towards specific issues and attempt to influence the here and now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gemälde von martin luther german youth of today are not necessarily becoming less religious ; they are simply less interested in experiencing god through the mediation of the church .
and this should come as no surprise .
after all , it was the great german theologian martin luther who , at the start of the sixteenth century , initiated a rebellion from official church doctrine which was focused on the individual 's capacity to reach salvation through prayer , apart from the corrupt apparatus in rome . luther thus ushered in the modern age , the focus on the individual , and the loss in power for the catholic church , at least in northern europe .
germany 's youth of today , who do n't feel all that connected to the conservative doctrines of the church , and wish to focus on a personal , individual relationship to a higher power , are following in the footsteps of that german spirit of reform . editor 's note : deutsche welle is an official media partner of world youth day . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de condom plans cancelled at youth fest as 400,000 catholic young people from around the world prepare to make their way to cologne for world youth day , a spat over condom distribution has erupted .

the catholic world youth day , set to hit cologne this week with a mammoth influx of devout adolescents , is a chance for german catholics to show their faith to the world .
but just how religious are german youth today ? pope john paul ii consecrated the first world youth day in 1985 , hoping to spur an upsurge in evangelical energy among catholic youth around the world .
at the 20th anniversary event , held this week in cologne , nearly one million young faithful from all over the world are expected to converge on the rhenish metropolis and its famous cathedral .
but some are calling into question whether the institution represented by pope benedict xvi , the first german pope in nearly 500 years , is in touch with the german youth of today . statistically speaking , the answer would seem to be negative .
a study of youth by shell in 2000 found that religious knowledge is a rarity among today 's youth .
a majority of german adolescents have only vague ideas about the fundamentals of christianity .
while 65 percent of german citizens officially belong to a church , only four to six percent of young germans attend sunday services , and then only occasionally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : near to the people ?
" i believe the institution of the church lives in an ivory tower , " said katrin , a young woman from cologne .
" they go about their business without really concerning themselves with the people .
they are far removed from the actual people . " values gap the reasons the institutional church does not resonate with many young people are varied .
some blame the church for not reaching out enough or in the right ways to the youth .
others say young people are simply more distracted today , having an unparalleled range of activities , interests , and ideologies - from environmental activism to video games - to choose from .
katrin thinks one reason is that the church 's stances are often not in line with the values of today 's youth , especially when it comes to sexual issues . " why should n't we use condoms when they protect us from diseases ?
why should n't we have protected sex , when we do n't want to get pregnant ? " she said . on homosexuality , katrin 's views also clash with official church doctrine . " homosexuality exists , has always existed .
you can interpret that to mean that god created it himself .
homosexuality will always exist ; it is not something that can be banned , " she said . when the church takes an official stance against contraception , as it has in cologne , for example , this serves to alienate many young people .
many would seem to echo katrin in saying yes to religion in general but no to certain aspects of church doctrine . lack of expertise whereas many youths recoil from the church 's sexual conservatism , there is also a group of christian teenagers that find the church 's stance on a variety of issues too ambivalent .
they may share the core christian values of social engagement and a strong family life , but turn to other organizations when it comes to environmental or human rights issues .

now a new fast-food restaurant in paris allows devout muslims to snack on burgers in accordance with the koran . long limited in their choice of eating-out options to kebab shops and halal meat outlets in the country , france 's large muslim population got a new alternative in the french capital last month . " buerger king muslim " or bkm , a new fast-food restaurant in the eastern paris suburb of clichy-sous-bois , offers the standard fast-food fare : burgers , fries , sundaes and doughnuts .
the difference is that the beef and chicken burgers here are halal - meat slaughtered in accordance with islamic dietary laws . the name of the new restaurant is a play on the french word " beur , " meaning a second-generation north african living in france . bildunterschrift : the interior is bright and colorful , not unlike the popular us chains mcdonald 's and burger king .
there is even a play corner for children and the prices are comparable .
the waitresses at bkm however , wear traditional islamic head scarves . in keeping with the koran the concept of a fast-food restaurant catering to france 's large muslim population sounds like a business idea whose time has come .
after the success of mecca cola , a soft drink marketed to french muslims , it was only a matter of time before a muslim-themed restaurant opened in the country with western europe 's largest muslim population . it seems to be working . " i like that i can now eat a hamburger - that was n't possible earlier , " said one muslim teenager at bkm .
his mother added that she was very satisfied because traditional fast-food chains had very limited choices for muslims .
the fish filet was the only food that observant muslims could order and still stay within dietary strictures . rachid bekhti , manager of bkm , said that great care was taken to ensure that the food was in accordance with the koran . " we check the meat very carefully , even the ingredients of the sauces - no animal fat or anything similar can be in it .
everything has to be halal . " that also means that bkm ensures there is no alcohol in any of the drinks on offer . bekhti 's sister leila said that the restaurant had the potential for becoming a popular haunt for young people - but not just muslims , she added : " everyone 's welcome here . " business booming , but challenges loom the restaurant was set up by three muslim friends who took their inspiration from similar chains abroad .
looking to offer a clean , family-oriented alternative to non-halal chains , it took almost two years to convince french backers to finance the undertaking . " people really like the restaurant , " morad benhamida told the associated press , adding that the restaurant 's stock price had tripled in one month .
" it seems like magic . " bildunterschrift : initial business may be booming , but in the long-run the owners of bkm admit there are challenges . clichy-sous-bouis , the paris suburb where bkm is located , is crowded with immigrants from former french colonies .

but now we have to make enough profits so that we can also pay people , " said hakim badaoui , a financial consultant for bkm . the plan is to expand and open branches in other french cities and provide young jobless people with a perspective , according to badaoui , and , he added , to provide competition to the established fast-food chains . monika lohmüller -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de muslim-friendly cola arrives in germany mecca cola , the muslim world 's answer to coca-cola , is coming to germany .

now a new fast-food restaurant in paris allows devout muslims to snack on burgers in accordance with the koran . long limited in their choice of eating-out options to kebab shops and halal meat outlets in the country , france 's large muslim population got a new alternative in the french capital last month . " buerger king muslim " or bkm , a new fast-food restaurant in the eastern paris suburb of clichy-sous-bois , offers the standard fast-food fare : burgers , fries , sundaes and doughnuts .
the difference is that the beef and chicken burgers here are halal - meat slaughtered in accordance with islamic dietary laws . the name of the new restaurant is a play on the french word " beur , " meaning a second-generation north african living in france . bildunterschrift : the interior is bright and colorful , not unlike the popular us chains mcdonald 's and burger king .
there is even a play corner for children and the prices are comparable .
the waitresses at bkm however , wear traditional islamic head scarves . in keeping with the koran the concept of a fast-food restaurant catering to france 's large muslim population sounds like a business idea whose time has come .
after the success of mecca cola , a soft drink marketed to french muslims , it was only a matter of time before a muslim-themed restaurant opened in the country with western europe 's largest muslim population . it seems to be working . " i like that i can now eat a hamburger - that was n't possible earlier , " said one muslim teenager at bkm .
his mother added that she was very satisfied because traditional fast-food chains had very limited choices for muslims .
the fish filet was the only food that observant muslims could order and still stay within dietary strictures . rachid bekhti , manager of bkm , said that great care was taken to ensure that the food was in accordance with the koran . " we check the meat very carefully , even the ingredients of the sauces - no animal fat or anything similar can be in it .
everything has to be halal . " that also means that bkm ensures there is no alcohol in any of the drinks on offer . bekhti 's sister leila said that the restaurant had the potential for becoming a popular haunt for young people - but not just muslims , she added : " everyone 's welcome here . " business booming , but challenges loom the restaurant was set up by three muslim friends who took their inspiration from similar chains abroad .
looking to offer a clean , family-oriented alternative to non-halal chains , it took almost two years to convince french backers to finance the undertaking . " people really like the restaurant , " morad benhamida told the associated press , adding that the restaurant 's stock price had tripled in one month .
" it seems like magic . " bildunterschrift : initial business may be booming , but in the long-run the owners of bkm admit there are challenges . clichy-sous-bouis , the paris suburb where bkm is located , is crowded with immigrants from former french colonies .
unemployment is high and many are housed in dilapidated social apartments . " we 've created 28 jobs and that 's important .
but now we have to make enough profits so that we can also pay people , " said hakim badaoui , a financial consultant for bkm . the plan is to expand and open branches in other french cities and provide young jobless people with a perspective , according to badaoui , and , he added , to provide competition to the established fast-food chains . monika lohmüller -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de muslim-friendly cola arrives in germany mecca cola , the muslim world 's answer to coca-cola , is coming to germany .

german health authorities , reacting to an alarming rise in new hiv infections from 2003 to 2004 , have resolved to intensify their pro-condom campaign .
can heath educators instil " safer sex " attitudes in today 's youth ? in relation to its european neighbors , germany has a fairly low rate of hiv / aids infection .
in 2004 , according to the robert koch institute , 45,000 people living in germany were infected , in a country of over 82 million .
only norway , sweden , and finland , among western european nations , had a lower percentage of cases .
on the face of it , this would seem to be a statistic elisabeth pott , director of the federal center for health education , could be proud of . but pott is not particularly proud of germany 's current position in the battle against aids .
the statistics on condom use are alarming for epidemiologists , as they tell a story of increasing disregard for safer sex practices that were encouraged by intensive campaigns in the late 1980s . in 1987 germany began a 50 million deutschmark nationwide anti-aids program .
the program was so successful in cutting down the number of new infections that it was itself whittled down annually until in 1998 , the budget was some 18 million deutschmarks -lrb- around nine million euros -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids prevention posters critics say the effect of this scaling down can be seen in the changing attitudes of germany 's youth towards the epidemic today .
whereas two in three 16-year-olds ranked aids among the most dangerous diseases in the late eighties , today only one third do . false sense of security the lack of concern over aids has also led to a marked decrease in condom use , especially among 16 to 44-year-old single people , reported pott . " in 2003 , 78 percent of those engaging in sex with a new partner used condoms , while in 2004 it was only 70 percent , " she reported .
" we are seeing that even though we are still below 2,000 new infections per year , we had a six percent climb in new infections from 2003 to 2004 .
this is clearly a sign that tells us more has to be done to reach people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an hiv-positive sex worker at a counseling center in madras , india as reports in the media on aids , especially in industrialized countries , have declined , many people now believe that aids has been vanquished in the first world and relegated to the third .
this picture , said pott , is not only far from the truth , it is dangerous as well . help from insurers the limited financial resources of the federal center for health education make it difficult to reach the more people more effectively .
however , private health insurers have offered to step in to join the fight and help expand aids prevention programs .
with their help , the prevention budget will be increased to 12 million euros . " as views about safer sex have become more lax , especially among the younger groups , we have realized the importance of giving an added push for prevention , " said volker leienbach , director of the association of private health insurers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein fahrradfahrer fährt an einem werbeplakat-plakat zur verhütung von aids vorbei -lrb- foto vom 08.01.2005 zur illustration des themas jugend und aids -rrb- .
obwohl die krankheit nach wie vor tödlich sei , wird nach aussagen von brandenburgs gesundheitsministerin dagmar ziegler vor allem unter jugendlichen ein immer sorgloserer umgang mit hiv und aids beobachtet .
offensichtlich habe die verharmlosung etwas mit den medizinischen fortschritten auf diesem gebiet und verschiedenen therapien zu tun , die den ausbruch von aids oft über jahre hinauszögern könnten .

pott said organizations across the spectrum need to get involved , since it is estimated that 30,000 new infections have been prevented through the prevention campaigns so far . " treating that many people can cost 450 million euros annually , " she said .

whereas two in three 16-year-olds ranked aids among the most dangerous diseases in the late eighties , today only one third do . false sense of security the lack of concern over aids has also led to a marked decrease in condom use , especially among 16 to 44-year-old single people , reported pott . " in 2003 , 78 percent of those engaging in sex with a new partner used condoms , while in 2004 it was only 70 percent , " she reported .
" we are seeing that even though we are still below 2,000 new infections per year , we had a six percent climb in new infections from 2003 to 2004 .
this is clearly a sign that tells us more has to be done to reach people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an hiv-positive sex worker at a counseling center in madras , india as reports in the media on aids , especially in industrialized countries , have declined , many people now believe that aids has been vanquished in the first world and relegated to the third .
this picture , said pott , is not only far from the truth , it is dangerous as well . help from insurers the limited financial resources of the federal center for health education make it difficult to reach the more people more effectively .
however , private health insurers have offered to step in to join the fight and help expand aids prevention programs .
with their help , the prevention budget will be increased to 12 million euros . " as views about safer sex have become more lax , especially among the younger groups , we have realized the importance of giving an added push for prevention , " said volker leienbach , director of the association of private health insurers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein fahrradfahrer fährt an einem werbeplakat-plakat zur verhütung von aids vorbei -lrb- foto vom 08.01.2005 zur illustration des themas jugend und aids -rrb- .
obwohl die krankheit nach wie vor tödlich sei , wird nach aussagen von brandenburgs gesundheitsministerin dagmar ziegler vor allem unter jugendlichen ein immer sorgloserer umgang mit hiv und aids beobachtet .
offensichtlich habe die verharmlosung etwas mit den medizinischen fortschritten auf diesem gebiet und verschiedenen therapien zu tun , die den ausbruch von aids oft über jahre hinauszögern könnten .
dass die krankheit heilbar wäre , sei jedoch ein inzwischen weit verbreiteter irrglaube .
aufgabe der gesellschaft sei es deshalb , sie dafür zu sensibilisieren , für den eigenen schutz zu sorgen .

there is a billboard campaign planned around world aids day on december 1 . the private insurers are the only health insurance group so far involved in the new condom campaigns .
pott said organizations across the spectrum need to get involved , since it is estimated that 30,000 new infections have been prevented through the prevention campaigns so far . " treating that many people can cost 450 million euros annually , " she said .
" this number should give us pause to consider that , on top of the immense human costs caused by aids , we need to consider the benefits that preventive action offers for avoiding the financial costs as well .

the search for bodies from sunday 's crash had gone on throughout the night under powerful arc lights . the interior ministry said identifiable bodies would be taken to an establishment at goudi , near athens city centre , where relatives could begin identifying them . remains which were not identifiable would be dna tested at the morgue in the port of pireus , where all the bodies had been taken initially , interior minister prokopiis pavlopoulos said after a meeting during the night with cypriot officials . relatives of the victims were expected to arrive in greece early monday on a specially-chartered flight . second black box found bildunterschrift : rescuers walk by the tail of a cypriot helios airways jet near the coastal town of grammatikos the head of the investigation into the crash , akrivos tsolakis , confirmed the discovery of the plane 's second " black box , " containing recordings of the pilots ' cockpit conversations , but said it was in a " very bad state . " " we do n't know if we will be able to get something from it , " he said . that and the other black box , the flight data recorder , would be sent to paris for analysis , under agreement between france and greece , tsolakis said . children on board the helios airways boeing 737 was about to land at athens airport for a stopover on its journey from larnaca in cyprus to the czech capital prague when it crashed at varnava , a largely uninhabited area 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- northeast of athens . helios said most of the passengers on the airliner were greek cypriots .
of those aboard , 59 adults and eight children were heading to athens ; 48 were continuing on to prague . a cypriot official said that the first indications of the greek authorities were that the crash was not the result of a terrorist attack . causes unknown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pieces of a helios airways jet litter a roadside near the coastal greek town of grammatikos the cause remains as yet unknown , although there have been harrowing accounts of an apparent crisis in the cockpit in the plane 's last minutes with greek officials saying one of the pilots was slumped in his seat .
pilots of two f16 fighters sent up to escort the airliner before the crash " saw a situation that was not normal in the pilots ' cabin . " one of the f-16 pilots reported that he could not see the captain in the cockpit and his co-pilot appeared to be slumped in his seat , a defence ministry official told reporters . greek police suspect the cause was a sudden drop in the cabin pressure , a senior official at the greek public order ministry said .
the pilots of the plane , one of whom was german , had mentioned a problem with the aircraft 's systems when he spoke to the athens control tower before contact was lost , said the official . " the pilot has turned blue , " one passenger said in a mobile text message to his cousin .
" cousin farewell , we 're freezing . " but in paris , accident investigator francois grangier told afp that a sudden loss of pressurization would not have caused the plane to crash , nor would it have made the pilots immediately lose consciousness . the plane would have been at fairly low altitude as it approached athens airport , and grangier said loss of pressurization would not have had any effect on the aircraft 's structure .
he also said the pilots would have had their own oxygen supply . another expert said that in the case of sudden depressurization because of structural damage , for example the blowing out of a window , the internal temperature would plummet and the plane would crash .

german health authorities , reacting to an alarming rise in new hiv infections from 2003 to 2004 , have resolved to intensify their pro-condom campaign .
can heath educators instil " safer sex " attitudes in today 's youth ? in relation to its european neighbors , germany has a fairly low rate of hiv / aids infection .
in 2004 , according to the robert koch institute , 45,000 people living in germany were infected , in a country of over 82 million .
only norway , sweden , and finland , among western european nations , had a lower percentage of cases .
on the face of it , this would seem to be a statistic elisabeth pott , director of the federal center for health education , could be proud of . but pott is not particularly proud of germany 's current position in the battle against aids .
the statistics on condom use are alarming for epidemiologists , as they tell a story of increasing disregard for safer sex practices that were encouraged by intensive campaigns in the late 1980s . in 1987 germany began a 50 million deutschmark nationwide anti-aids program .
the program was so successful in cutting down the number of new infections that it was itself whittled down annually until in 1998 , the budget was some 18 million deutschmarks -lrb- around nine million euros -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids prevention posters critics say the effect of this scaling down can be seen in the changing attitudes of germany 's youth towards the epidemic today .
whereas two in three 16-year-olds ranked aids among the most dangerous diseases in the late eighties , today only one third do . false sense of security the lack of concern over aids has also led to a marked decrease in condom use , especially among 16 to 44-year-old single people , reported pott . " in 2003 , 78 percent of those engaging in sex with a new partner used condoms , while in 2004 it was only 70 percent , " she reported .
" we are seeing that even though we are still below 2,000 new infections per year , we had a six percent climb in new infections from 2003 to 2004 .
this is clearly a sign that tells us more has to be done to reach people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an hiv-positive sex worker at a counseling center in madras , india as reports in the media on aids , especially in industrialized countries , have declined , many people now believe that aids has been vanquished in the first world and relegated to the third .
this picture , said pott , is not only far from the truth , it is dangerous as well . help from insurers the limited financial resources of the federal center for health education make it difficult to reach the more people more effectively .
however , private health insurers have offered to step in to join the fight and help expand aids prevention programs .
with their help , the prevention budget will be increased to 12 million euros . " as views about safer sex have become more lax , especially among the younger groups , we have realized the importance of giving an added push for prevention , " said volker leienbach , director of the association of private health insurers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein fahrradfahrer fährt an einem werbeplakat-plakat zur verhütung von aids vorbei -lrb- foto vom 08.01.2005 zur illustration des themas jugend und aids -rrb- .
obwohl die krankheit nach wie vor tödlich sei , wird nach aussagen von brandenburgs gesundheitsministerin dagmar ziegler vor allem unter jugendlichen ein immer sorgloserer umgang mit hiv und aids beobachtet .
offensichtlich habe die verharmlosung etwas mit den medizinischen fortschritten auf diesem gebiet und verschiedenen therapien zu tun , die den ausbruch von aids oft über jahre hinauszögern könnten .
dass die krankheit heilbar wäre , sei jedoch ein inzwischen weit verbreiteter irrglaube .

pott said organizations across the spectrum need to get involved , since it is estimated that 30,000 new infections have been prevented through the prevention campaigns so far . " treating that many people can cost 450 million euros annually , " she said .

german health authorities , reacting to an alarming rise in new hiv infections from 2003 to 2004 , have resolved to intensify their pro-condom campaign .
can heath educators instil " safer sex " attitudes in today 's youth ? in relation to its european neighbors , germany has a fairly low rate of hiv / aids infection .
in 2004 , according to the robert koch institute , 45,000 people living in germany were infected , in a country of over 82 million .
only norway , sweden , and finland , among western european nations , had a lower percentage of cases .
on the face of it , this would seem to be a statistic elisabeth pott , director of the federal center for health education , could be proud of . but pott is not particularly proud of germany 's current position in the battle against aids .
the statistics on condom use are alarming for epidemiologists , as they tell a story of increasing disregard for safer sex practices that were encouraged by intensive campaigns in the late 1980s . in 1987 germany began a 50 million deutschmark nationwide anti-aids program .
the program was so successful in cutting down the number of new infections that it was itself whittled down annually until in 1998 , the budget was some 18 million deutschmarks -lrb- around nine million euros -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids prevention posters critics say the effect of this scaling down can be seen in the changing attitudes of germany 's youth towards the epidemic today .
whereas two in three 16-year-olds ranked aids among the most dangerous diseases in the late eighties , today only one third do . false sense of security the lack of concern over aids has also led to a marked decrease in condom use , especially among 16 to 44-year-old single people , reported pott . " in 2003 , 78 percent of those engaging in sex with a new partner used condoms , while in 2004 it was only 70 percent , " she reported .
" we are seeing that even though we are still below 2,000 new infections per year , we had a six percent climb in new infections from 2003 to 2004 .
this is clearly a sign that tells us more has to be done to reach people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an hiv-positive sex worker at a counseling center in madras , india as reports in the media on aids , especially in industrialized countries , have declined , many people now believe that aids has been vanquished in the first world and relegated to the third .
this picture , said pott , is not only far from the truth , it is dangerous as well . help from insurers the limited financial resources of the federal center for health education make it difficult to reach the more people more effectively .
however , private health insurers have offered to step in to join the fight and help expand aids prevention programs .
with their help , the prevention budget will be increased to 12 million euros . " as views about safer sex have become more lax , especially among the younger groups , we have realized the importance of giving an added push for prevention , " said volker leienbach , director of the association of private health insurers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein fahrradfahrer fährt an einem werbeplakat-plakat zur verhütung von aids vorbei -lrb- foto vom 08.01.2005 zur illustration des themas jugend und aids -rrb- .
obwohl die krankheit nach wie vor tödlich sei , wird nach aussagen von brandenburgs gesundheitsministerin dagmar ziegler vor allem unter jugendlichen ein immer sorgloserer umgang mit hiv und aids beobachtet .
offensichtlich habe die verharmlosung etwas mit den medizinischen fortschritten auf diesem gebiet und verschiedenen therapien zu tun , die den ausbruch von aids oft über jahre hinauszögern könnten .
dass die krankheit heilbar wäre , sei jedoch ein inzwischen weit verbreiteter irrglaube .
aufgabe der gesellschaft sei es deshalb , sie dafür zu sensibilisieren , für den eigenen schutz zu sorgen .

there is a billboard campaign planned around world aids day on december 1 . the private insurers are the only health insurance group so far involved in the new condom campaigns .
pott said organizations across the spectrum need to get involved , since it is estimated that 30,000 new infections have been prevented through the prevention campaigns so far . " treating that many people can cost 450 million euros annually , " she said .
" this number should give us pause to consider that , on top of the immense human costs caused by aids , we need to consider the benefits that preventive action offers for avoiding the financial costs as well .

the search for bodies from sunday 's crash had gone on throughout the night under powerful arc lights . the interior ministry said identifiable bodies would be taken to an establishment at goudi , near athens city centre , where relatives could begin identifying them . remains which were not identifiable would be dna tested at the morgue in the port of pireus , where all the bodies had been taken initially , interior minister prokopiis pavlopoulos said after a meeting during the night with cypriot officials . relatives of the victims were expected to arrive in greece early monday on a specially-chartered flight . second black box found bildunterschrift : rescuers walk by the tail of a cypriot helios airways jet near the coastal town of grammatikos the head of the investigation into the crash , akrivos tsolakis , confirmed the discovery of the plane 's second " black box , " containing recordings of the pilots ' cockpit conversations , but said it was in a " very bad state . " " we do n't know if we will be able to get something from it , " he said . that and the other black box , the flight data recorder , would be sent to paris for analysis , under agreement between france and greece , tsolakis said . children on board the helios airways boeing 737 was about to land at athens airport for a stopover on its journey from larnaca in cyprus to the czech capital prague when it crashed at varnava , a largely uninhabited area 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- northeast of athens . helios said most of the passengers on the airliner were greek cypriots .
of those aboard , 59 adults and eight children were heading to athens ; 48 were continuing on to prague . a cypriot official said that the first indications of the greek authorities were that the crash was not the result of a terrorist attack . causes unknown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pieces of a helios airways jet litter a roadside near the coastal greek town of grammatikos the cause remains as yet unknown , although there have been harrowing accounts of an apparent crisis in the cockpit in the plane 's last minutes with greek officials saying one of the pilots was slumped in his seat .
pilots of two f16 fighters sent up to escort the airliner before the crash " saw a situation that was not normal in the pilots ' cabin . " one of the f-16 pilots reported that he could not see the captain in the cockpit and his co-pilot appeared to be slumped in his seat , a defence ministry official told reporters . greek police suspect the cause was a sudden drop in the cabin pressure , a senior official at the greek public order ministry said .
the pilots of the plane , one of whom was german , had mentioned a problem with the aircraft 's systems when he spoke to the athens control tower before contact was lost , said the official . " the pilot has turned blue , " one passenger said in a mobile text message to his cousin .
" cousin farewell , we 're freezing . " but in paris , accident investigator francois grangier told afp that a sudden loss of pressurization would not have caused the plane to crash , nor would it have made the pilots immediately lose consciousness . the plane would have been at fairly low altitude as it approached athens airport , and grangier said loss of pressurization would not have had any effect on the aircraft 's structure .
he also said the pilots would have had their own oxygen supply . another expert said that in the case of sudden depressurization because of structural damage , for example the blowing out of a window , the internal temperature would plummet and the plane would crash . " all planes have problems " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wreckage of a plane burns on a hillside near the coastal greek town of grammatikos in this image made from television sunday , aug .

a cypriot airliner carrying 115 passengers and six crew crashed north of athens on sunday , and emergency services and local residents were searching for survivors amid the wreckage , officials said .
-lrb- ap photo / mega tv via aptn -rrb- helios , established in 1999 , is the first private airline in cyprus .
it had a fleet of four boeing 737 jets and operated flights to london , athens , sofia , dublin and strasbourg in france , among other places . the crash was the worst airline disaster in greek history since a 1974 terrorist bomb aboard a twa boeing 707 caused it to crash in the ionian sea with the loss of 88 lives . " all planes have problems from time to time without exception , " said helios managing director demetrios pantazis .

the search for bodies from sunday 's crash had gone on throughout the night under powerful arc lights . the interior ministry said identifiable bodies would be taken to an establishment at goudi , near athens city centre , where relatives could begin identifying them . remains which were not identifiable would be dna tested at the morgue in the port of pireus , where all the bodies had been taken initially , interior minister prokopiis pavlopoulos said after a meeting during the night with cypriot officials . relatives of the victims were expected to arrive in greece early monday on a specially-chartered flight . second black box found bildunterschrift : rescuers walk by the tail of a cypriot helios airways jet near the coastal town of grammatikos the head of the investigation into the crash , akrivos tsolakis , confirmed the discovery of the plane 's second " black box , " containing recordings of the pilots ' cockpit conversations , but said it was in a " very bad state . " " we do n't know if we will be able to get something from it , " he said . that and the other black box , the flight data recorder , would be sent to paris for analysis , under agreement between france and greece , tsolakis said . children on board the helios airways boeing 737 was about to land at athens airport for a stopover on its journey from larnaca in cyprus to the czech capital prague when it crashed at varnava , a largely uninhabited area 40 kilometers -lrb- 25 miles -rrb- northeast of athens . helios said most of the passengers on the airliner were greek cypriots .
of those aboard , 59 adults and eight children were heading to athens ; 48 were continuing on to prague . a cypriot official said that the first indications of the greek authorities were that the crash was not the result of a terrorist attack . causes unknown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pieces of a helios airways jet litter a roadside near the coastal greek town of grammatikos the cause remains as yet unknown , although there have been harrowing accounts of an apparent crisis in the cockpit in the plane 's last minutes with greek officials saying one of the pilots was slumped in his seat .
pilots of two f16 fighters sent up to escort the airliner before the crash " saw a situation that was not normal in the pilots ' cabin . " one of the f-16 pilots reported that he could not see the captain in the cockpit and his co-pilot appeared to be slumped in his seat , a defence ministry official told reporters . greek police suspect the cause was a sudden drop in the cabin pressure , a senior official at the greek public order ministry said .
the pilots of the plane , one of whom was german , had mentioned a problem with the aircraft 's systems when he spoke to the athens control tower before contact was lost , said the official . " the pilot has turned blue , " one passenger said in a mobile text message to his cousin .
" cousin farewell , we 're freezing . " but in paris , accident investigator francois grangier told afp that a sudden loss of pressurization would not have caused the plane to crash , nor would it have made the pilots immediately lose consciousness . the plane would have been at fairly low altitude as it approached athens airport , and grangier said loss of pressurization would not have had any effect on the aircraft 's structure .
he also said the pilots would have had their own oxygen supply . another expert said that in the case of sudden depressurization because of structural damage , for example the blowing out of a window , the internal temperature would plummet and the plane would crash .

it had a fleet of four boeing 737 jets and operated flights to london , athens , sofia , dublin and strasbourg in france , among other places . the crash was the worst airline disaster in greek history since a 1974 terrorist bomb aboard a twa boeing 707 caused it to crash in the ionian sea with the loss of 88 lives . " all planes have problems from time to time without exception , " said helios managing director demetrios pantazis .
helios rejected any suggestion that the aircraft was less than airworthy , saying it had undergone a complete technical check before departure . greece has declared a day of mourning for tuesday , when flags will fly at half-mast and a three-minute silence will be observed in public buildings .

now a new fast-food restaurant in paris allows devout muslims to snack on burgers in accordance with the koran . long limited in their choice of eating-out options to kebab shops and halal meat outlets in the country , france 's large muslim population got a new alternative in the french capital last month . " buerger king muslim " or bkm , a new fast-food restaurant in the eastern paris suburb of clichy-sous-bois , offers the standard fast-food fare : burgers , fries , sundaes and doughnuts .
the difference is that the beef and chicken burgers here are halal - meat slaughtered in accordance with islamic dietary laws . the name of the new restaurant is a play on the french word " beur , " meaning a second-generation north african living in france . bildunterschrift : the interior is bright and colorful , not unlike the popular us chains mcdonald 's and burger king .
there is even a play corner for children and the prices are comparable .
the waitresses at bkm however , wear traditional islamic head scarves . in keeping with the koran the concept of a fast-food restaurant catering to france 's large muslim population sounds like a business idea whose time has come .
after the success of mecca cola , a soft drink marketed to french muslims , it was only a matter of time before a muslim-themed restaurant opened in the country with western europe 's largest muslim population . it seems to be working . " i like that i can now eat a hamburger - that was n't possible earlier , " said one muslim teenager at bkm .
his mother added that she was very satisfied because traditional fast-food chains had very limited choices for muslims .
the fish filet was the only food that observant muslims could order and still stay within dietary strictures . rachid bekhti , manager of bkm , said that great care was taken to ensure that the food was in accordance with the koran . " we check the meat very carefully , even the ingredients of the sauces - no animal fat or anything similar can be in it .
everything has to be halal . " that also means that bkm ensures there is no alcohol in any of the drinks on offer . bekhti 's sister leila said that the restaurant had the potential for becoming a popular haunt for young people - but not just muslims , she added : " everyone 's welcome here . " business booming , but challenges loom the restaurant was set up by three muslim friends who took their inspiration from similar chains abroad .
looking to offer a clean , family-oriented alternative to non-halal chains , it took almost two years to convince french backers to finance the undertaking . " people really like the restaurant , " morad benhamida told the associated press , adding that the restaurant 's stock price had tripled in one month .
" it seems like magic . " bildunterschrift : initial business may be booming , but in the long-run the owners of bkm admit there are challenges . clichy-sous-bouis , the paris suburb where bkm is located , is crowded with immigrants from former french colonies .
unemployment is high and many are housed in dilapidated social apartments . " we 've created 28 jobs and that 's important .
but now we have to make enough profits so that we can also pay people , " said hakim badaoui , a financial consultant for bkm . the plan is to expand and open branches in other french cities and provide young jobless people with a perspective , according to badaoui , and , he added , to provide competition to the established fast-food chains . monika lohmüller -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de muslim-friendly cola arrives in germany mecca cola , the muslim world 's answer to coca-cola , is coming to germany .

the catholic world youth day , set to hit cologne this week with a mammoth influx of devout adolescents , is a chance for german catholics to show their faith to the world .
but just how religious are german youth today ? pope john paul ii consecrated the first world youth day in 1985 , hoping to spur an upsurge in evangelical energy among catholic youth around the world .
at the 20th anniversary event , held this week in cologne , nearly one million young faithful from all over the world are expected to converge on the rhenish metropolis and its famous cathedral .
but some are calling into question whether the institution represented by pope benedict xvi , the first german pope in nearly 500 years , is in touch with the german youth of today . statistically speaking , the answer would seem to be negative .
a study of youth by shell in 2000 found that religious knowledge is a rarity among today 's youth .
a majority of german adolescents have only vague ideas about the fundamentals of christianity .
while 65 percent of german citizens officially belong to a church , only four to six percent of young germans attend sunday services , and then only occasionally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : near to the people ?
" i believe the institution of the church lives in an ivory tower , " said katrin , a young woman from cologne .
" they go about their business without really concerning themselves with the people .
they are far removed from the actual people . " values gap the reasons the institutional church does not resonate with many young people are varied .
some blame the church for not reaching out enough or in the right ways to the youth .
others say young people are simply more distracted today , having an unparalleled range of activities , interests , and ideologies - from environmental activism to video games - to choose from .
katrin thinks one reason is that the church 's stances are often not in line with the values of today 's youth , especially when it comes to sexual issues . " why should n't we use condoms when they protect us from diseases ?
why should n't we have protected sex , when we do n't want to get pregnant ? " she said . on homosexuality , katrin 's views also clash with official church doctrine . " homosexuality exists , has always existed .
you can interpret that to mean that god created it himself .
homosexuality will always exist ; it is not something that can be banned , " she said . when the church takes an official stance against contraception , as it has in cologne , for example , this serves to alienate many young people .
many would seem to echo katrin in saying yes to religion in general but no to certain aspects of church doctrine . lack of expertise whereas many youths recoil from the church 's sexual conservatism , there is also a group of christian teenagers that find the church 's stance on a variety of issues too ambivalent .
they may share the core christian values of social engagement and a strong family life , but turn to other organizations when it comes to environmental or human rights issues .
here , for many youths , the church lacks expertise .
they tend to direct their activism to organizations that are strongly oriented towards specific issues and attempt to influence the here and now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gemälde von martin luther german youth of today are not necessarily becoming less religious ; they are simply less interested in experiencing god through the mediation of the church .
and this should come as no surprise .
after all , it was the great german theologian martin luther who , at the start of the sixteenth century , initiated a rebellion from official church doctrine which was focused on the individual 's capacity to reach salvation through prayer , apart from the corrupt apparatus in rome . luther thus ushered in the modern age , the focus on the individual , and the loss in power for the catholic church , at least in northern europe .
germany 's youth of today , who do n't feel all that connected to the conservative doctrines of the church , and wish to focus on a personal , individual relationship to a higher power , are following in the footsteps of that german spirit of reform . editor 's note : deutsche welle is an official media partner of world youth day . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de condom plans cancelled at youth fest as 400,000 catholic young people from around the world prepare to make their way to cologne for world youth day , a spat over condom distribution has erupted .

others say young people are simply more distracted today , having an unparalleled range of activities , interests , and ideologies - from environmental activism to video games - to choose from .
katrin thinks one reason is that the church 's stances are often not in line with the values of today 's youth , especially when it comes to sexual issues . " why should n't we use condoms when they protect us from diseases ?
why should n't we have protected sex , when we do n't want to get pregnant ? " she said . on homosexuality , katrin 's views also clash with official church doctrine . " homosexuality exists , has always existed .
you can interpret that to mean that god created it himself .
homosexuality will always exist ; it is not something that can be banned , " she said . when the church takes an official stance against contraception , as it has in cologne , for example , this serves to alienate many young people .
many would seem to echo katrin in saying yes to religion in general but no to certain aspects of church doctrine . lack of expertise whereas many youths recoil from the church 's sexual conservatism , there is also a group of christian teenagers that find the church 's stance on a variety of issues too ambivalent .
they may share the core christian values of social engagement and a strong family life , but turn to other organizations when it comes to environmental or human rights issues .
here , for many youths , the church lacks expertise .
they tend to direct their activism to organizations that are strongly oriented towards specific issues and attempt to influence the here and now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gemälde von martin luther german youth of today are not necessarily becoming less religious ; they are simply less interested in experiencing god through the mediation of the church .
and this should come as no surprise .
after all , it was the great german theologian martin luther who , at the start of the sixteenth century , initiated a rebellion from official church doctrine which was focused on the individual 's capacity to reach salvation through prayer , apart from the corrupt apparatus in rome . luther thus ushered in the modern age , the focus on the individual , and the loss in power for the catholic church , at least in northern europe .
germany 's youth of today , who do n't feel all that connected to the conservative doctrines of the church , and wish to focus on a personal , individual relationship to a higher power , are following in the footsteps of that german spirit of reform . editor 's note : deutsche welle is an official media partner of world youth day . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de condom plans cancelled at youth fest as 400,000 catholic young people from around the world prepare to make their way to cologne for world youth day , a spat over condom distribution has erupted .

german health authorities , reacting to an alarming rise in new hiv infections from 2003 to 2004 , have resolved to intensify their pro-condom campaign .
can heath educators instil " safer sex " attitudes in today 's youth ? in relation to its european neighbors , germany has a fairly low rate of hiv / aids infection .
in 2004 , according to the robert koch institute , 45,000 people living in germany were infected , in a country of over 82 million .
only norway , sweden , and finland , among western european nations , had a lower percentage of cases .
on the face of it , this would seem to be a statistic elisabeth pott , director of the federal center for health education , could be proud of . but pott is not particularly proud of germany 's current position in the battle against aids .
the statistics on condom use are alarming for epidemiologists , as they tell a story of increasing disregard for safer sex practices that were encouraged by intensive campaigns in the late 1980s . in 1987 germany began a 50 million deutschmark nationwide anti-aids program .
the program was so successful in cutting down the number of new infections that it was itself whittled down annually until in 1998 , the budget was some 18 million deutschmarks -lrb- around nine million euros -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids prevention posters critics say the effect of this scaling down can be seen in the changing attitudes of germany 's youth towards the epidemic today .
whereas two in three 16-year-olds ranked aids among the most dangerous diseases in the late eighties , today only one third do . false sense of security the lack of concern over aids has also led to a marked decrease in condom use , especially among 16 to 44-year-old single people , reported pott . " in 2003 , 78 percent of those engaging in sex with a new partner used condoms , while in 2004 it was only 70 percent , " she reported .
" we are seeing that even though we are still below 2,000 new infections per year , we had a six percent climb in new infections from 2003 to 2004 .
this is clearly a sign that tells us more has to be done to reach people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an hiv-positive sex worker at a counseling center in madras , india as reports in the media on aids , especially in industrialized countries , have declined , many people now believe that aids has been vanquished in the first world and relegated to the third .
this picture , said pott , is not only far from the truth , it is dangerous as well . help from insurers the limited financial resources of the federal center for health education make it difficult to reach the more people more effectively .
however , private health insurers have offered to step in to join the fight and help expand aids prevention programs .
with their help , the prevention budget will be increased to 12 million euros . " as views about safer sex have become more lax , especially among the younger groups , we have realized the importance of giving an added push for prevention , " said volker leienbach , director of the association of private health insurers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ein fahrradfahrer fährt an einem werbeplakat-plakat zur verhütung von aids vorbei -lrb- foto vom 08.01.2005 zur illustration des themas jugend und aids -rrb- .
obwohl die krankheit nach wie vor tödlich sei , wird nach aussagen von brandenburgs gesundheitsministerin dagmar ziegler vor allem unter jugendlichen ein immer sorgloserer umgang mit hiv und aids beobachtet .
offensichtlich habe die verharmlosung etwas mit den medizinischen fortschritten auf diesem gebiet und verschiedenen therapien zu tun , die den ausbruch von aids oft über jahre hinauszögern könnten .

pott said organizations across the spectrum need to get involved , since it is estimated that 30,000 new infections have been prevented through the prevention campaigns so far . " treating that many people can cost 450 million euros annually , " she said .

german health authorities , reacting to an alarming rise in new hiv infections from 2003 to 2004 , have resolved to intensify their pro-condom campaign .
can heath educators instil " safer sex " attitudes in today 's youth ? in relation to its european neighbors , germany has a fairly low rate of hiv / aids infection .
in 2004 , according to the robert koch institute , 45,000 people living in germany were infected , in a country of over 82 million .
only norway , sweden , and finland , among western european nations , had a lower percentage of cases .
on the face of it , this would seem to be a statistic elisabeth pott , director of the federal center for health education , could be proud of . but pott is not particularly proud of germany 's current position in the battle against aids .
the statistics on condom use are alarming for epidemiologists , as they tell a story of increasing disregard for safer sex practices that were encouraged by intensive campaigns in the late 1980s . in 1987 germany began a 50 million deutschmark nationwide anti-aids program .
the program was so successful in cutting down the number of new infections that it was itself whittled down annually until in 1998 , the budget was some 18 million deutschmarks -lrb- around nine million euros -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aids prevention posters critics say the effect of this scaling down can be seen in the changing attitudes of germany 's youth towards the epidemic today .
whereas two in three 16-year-olds ranked aids among the most dangerous diseases in the late eighties , today only one third do . false sense of security the lack of concern over aids has also led to a marked decrease in condom use , especially among 16 to 44-year-old single people , reported pott . " in 2003 , 78 percent of those engaging in sex with a new partner used condoms , while in 2004 it was only 70 percent , " she reported .
" we are seeing that even though we are still below 2,000 new infections per year , we had a six percent climb in new infections from 2003 to 2004 .
this is clearly a sign that tells us more has to be done to reach people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an hiv-positive sex worker at a counseling center in madras , india as reports in the media on aids , especially in industrialized countries , have declined , many people now believe that aids has been vanquished in the first world and relegated to the third .
this picture , said pott , is not only far from the truth , it is dangerous as well . help from insurers the limited financial resources of the federal center for health education make it difficult to reach the more people more effectively .
however , private health insurers have offered to step in to join the fight and help expand aids prevention programs .

now a new fast-food restaurant in paris allows devout muslims to snack on burgers in accordance with the koran . long limited in their choice of eating-out options to kebab shops and halal meat outlets in the country , france 's large muslim population got a new alternative in the french capital last month . " buerger king muslim " or bkm , a new fast-food restaurant in the eastern paris suburb of clichy-sous-bois , offers the standard fast-food fare : burgers , fries , sundaes and doughnuts .
the difference is that the beef and chicken burgers here are halal - meat slaughtered in accordance with islamic dietary laws . the name of the new restaurant is a play on the french word " beur , " meaning a second-generation north african living in france . bildunterschrift : the interior is bright and colorful , not unlike the popular us chains mcdonald 's and burger king .
there is even a play corner for children and the prices are comparable .
the waitresses at bkm however , wear traditional islamic head scarves . in keeping with the koran the concept of a fast-food restaurant catering to france 's large muslim population sounds like a business idea whose time has come .
after the success of mecca cola , a soft drink marketed to french muslims , it was only a matter of time before a muslim-themed restaurant opened in the country with western europe 's largest muslim population . it seems to be working . " i like that i can now eat a hamburger - that was n't possible earlier , " said one muslim teenager at bkm .
his mother added that she was very satisfied because traditional fast-food chains had very limited choices for muslims .
the fish filet was the only food that observant muslims could order and still stay within dietary strictures . rachid bekhti , manager of bkm , said that great care was taken to ensure that the food was in accordance with the koran . " we check the meat very carefully , even the ingredients of the sauces - no animal fat or anything similar can be in it .
everything has to be halal . " that also means that bkm ensures there is no alcohol in any of the drinks on offer . bekhti 's sister leila said that the restaurant had the potential for becoming a popular haunt for young people - but not just muslims , she added : " everyone 's welcome here . " business booming , but challenges loom the restaurant was set up by three muslim friends who took their inspiration from similar chains abroad .
looking to offer a clean , family-oriented alternative to non-halal chains , it took almost two years to convince french backers to finance the undertaking . " people really like the restaurant , " morad benhamida told the associated press , adding that the restaurant 's stock price had tripled in one month .
" it seems like magic . " bildunterschrift : initial business may be booming , but in the long-run the owners of bkm admit there are challenges . clichy-sous-bouis , the paris suburb where bkm is located , is crowded with immigrants from former french colonies .
unemployment is high and many are housed in dilapidated social apartments . " we 've created 28 jobs and that 's important .
but now we have to make enough profits so that we can also pay people , " said hakim badaoui , a financial consultant for bkm . the plan is to expand and open branches in other french cities and provide young jobless people with a perspective , according to badaoui , and , he added , to provide competition to the established fast-food chains . monika lohmüller -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de muslim-friendly cola arrives in germany mecca cola , the muslim world 's answer to coca-cola , is coming to germany .

lech walesa who won a nobel peace prize and went on to become poland 's president , was speaking on the 25th anniversary of the union 's founding .
in an interview for the bbc 's world this weekend programme , he said belarus should expect no support from the west .
he said the european union should be ready to support a reformed belarus .
iconic figure lech walesa likes to describe himself as a revolutionary .
even 25 years after the founding of solidarity , the trade union movement which eventually toppled communist rule in poland , he is regarded still as an iconic figure by many in central and eastern europe .
now he is turning his attention to poland 's neighbour , belarus , considered to be the most repressive state in europe .

mr walesa says he would support a revolution there , similar to those which have taken place in ukraine and georgia .

mr bakiev scored a landslide victory in the poll , winning 89 % of the votes .
he had been appointed acting president in march , following the downfall of long-serving former leader askar akayev , who fled into exile .
mr bakiev , 55 , who praised the conduct of the july elections , has said his main goal is to eradicate corruption .
he took the oath of office on the country 's constitution in front of dignitaries in bishkek 's central square , following a military parade .
mr bakiev has said he will expect professionalism from members of his government , who he says will serve on the basis of merit rather than connections .
profile : kurmanbek bakiev the president must also seek to improve the economy of a country in which 40 % of people live below the poverty line .
analysts say kyrgyzstan will have to develop industries such as tourism , hydro-electric power and mining if it is to create new jobs for its 5m citizens .
in his first post-election comments , mr bakiev questioned the need for the us to continue to have an airbase in kyrgyzstan .
the pentagon has since been told it can keep its base in kyrgyzstan - but only for as long as it is needed for operations in afghanistan .
us-led forces have been stationed at the site near the capital , bishkek , since 2001 .
ahead of the elections , mr bakiev 's only significant political rival was thought to be felix kulov .
the two men agreed to a power-sharing pact , by which mr kulov would serve as prime minister if mr bakiev became president .

in some places , glacial levels have been falling by 10 metres a year and ultimately contributing to rising sea levels .
travelling to greenland , richard hollingham sees the impact of climate change for himself .
if it reaches the ocean , the glacial water will increase sea levels the gleaming white executive jet taxied to a stop on the cracked concrete apron beside a couple of derelict hangars .
beyond the rusty barbed wire and crude prefabricated buildings surrounding the airport perimeter , cliffs of dark granite rose from the valley to blend with the equally ominous grey of the sky .
no trees , no colour , no signs of life .
the door of the private plane swung down .
onlookers , had there been any , might have caught a glimpse of the deep leather seats and walnut panelling of the interior .
perhaps a group of sharp suited executives would emerge looking dynamic and business-like .
or perhaps some sinister men-in-black types , here on covert government business .
the first person to climb down was wearing oversized shorts , stout walking boots and a hat that looked like it had seen rather more of the world than it was perhaps designed for .
its enormous ice cap , a sea of white stretching seemingly forever , overflows into thousands of glaciers the next man was dressed in a clashing array of outdoor clothing and sported large tortoise-shell glasses and an unkempt beard .
each man muttered something about the landscape being bleak .
i would like to be able to tell you that when the bbc descended from the plane we stood apart with our sartorial elegance .
but if you have ever met any bbc types , particularly radio reporters , you would know that would be a lie .
research we had landed at kangerlussuaq , a community whose existence depends solely on the airstrip .
this used to be a bustling us base , servicing america 's early warning system .
these days it is somewhat self perpetuating .
the airport brings in supplies for the people who live here who mostly work at the airport .
i was tagging along with a group of eminent scientists , funded through the foundation of a billionaire philanthropist , gary comer .
he has devoted his retirement to the science of global warming .
the researchers all make regular visits to the arctic to assess the impact of climate change , not , it should be said , always in such comfort .
retreating glaciers retreat : as air temperatures rise , glacial recession increases greenland is a massive island locked in ice .
and from the air there is little evidence that it is melting .
its enormous ice cap , a sea of white stretching seemingly forever , overflows into thousands of glaciers .
these in turn carve their way through the mountains to the coast .
it is only when you get near to the base of the glaciers that you can see how the landscape is changing .
a few metres above the ice , the rock is totally bare .
a scar running horizontally across the valleys .
it is as if the ice has been drained away , like water in a bath , to leave a tide mark .
which is , in effect , what has happened .
the ice has melted and the glaciers have retreated hundreds of metres over the past 150 years .
new vegetation the weather cleared and with the edge of the glacier , a giant wall of ice behind us , glaciologist richard alley led me across the barren rock .
this land was being exposed for the first time in millions of years as i tripped and stumbled behind him , he bounded through scree and leapt over crevasses .
i have never seen a scientist more in his element as he pointed out deep grooves in the rock where the ice had raked the stone , or the giant boulders lifted by the glacier to balance precariously on top of tiny pebbles .
this land was being exposed for the first time for millions of years .
even a century ago , where i stood would have been solid ice , and i was struck by just how much vegetation there was .
phillip , the biologist on the trip , was every bit as excited as richard , identifying the dark brown lichens on the rocks , the grasses and beautiful purple flowers somehow managing to cling to just a few millimetres of soil .
agricultural return the earth 's climate has warmed before , albeit naturally .
a ruined church on the banks of a fjord marks the remains of a viking farming civilisation .
the sun casts shadows through the arched window to the site of the altar , last used in the 1400s before the area was abandoned when it became too cold to support habitation .
today , the farmers are back .
sheep once again graze the surrounding hillside and shiny new tractors work the fields near the southern coast .
greenland is turning green , something the rest of us should be very worried about indeed .

in some places , glacial levels have been falling by 10 metres a year and ultimately contributing to rising sea levels .
travelling to greenland , richard hollingham sees the impact of climate change for himself .
the gleaming white executive jet taxied to a stop on the cracked concrete apron beside a couple of derelict hangars .
beyond the rusty barbed wire and crude prefabricated buildings surrounding the airport perimeter , cliffs of dark granite rose from the valley to blend with the equally ominous grey of the sky .
no trees , no colour , no signs of life .
the door of the private plane swung down .
onlookers , had there been any , might have caught a glimpse of the deep leather seats and walnut panelling of the interior .
perhaps a group of sharp suited executives would emerge looking dynamic and business-like .
or perhaps some sinister men-in-black types , here on covert government business .
the first person to climb down was wearing oversized shorts , stout walking boots and a hat that looked like it had seen rather more of the world than it was perhaps designed for . "
its enormous ice cap , a sea of white stretching seemingly forever , overflows into thousands of glaciers " the next man was dressed in a clashing array of outdoor clothing and sported large tortoise-shell glasses and an unkempt beard .
each man muttered something about the landscape being bleak .
i would like to be able to tell you that when the bbc descended from the plane we stood apart with our sartorial elegance .
but if you have ever met any bbc types , particularly radio reporters , you would know that would be a lie .
research we had landed at kangerlussuaq , a community whose existence depends solely on the airstrip .
this used to be a bustling us base , servicing america 's early warning system .
these days it is somewhat self perpetuating .
the airport brings in supplies for the people who live here who mostly work at the airport .
i was tagging along with a group of eminent scientists , funded through the foundation of a billionaire philanthropist , gary comer .
he has devoted his retirement to the science of global warming .
the researchers all make regular visits to the arctic to assess the impact of climate change , not , it should be said , always in such comfort .
retreating glaciers greenland is a massive island locked in ice .
and from the air there is little evidence that it is melting .
its enormous ice cap , a sea of white stretching seemingly forever , overflows into thousands of glaciers .
these in turn carve their way through the mountains to the coast .
it is only when you get near to the base of the glaciers that you can see how the landscape is changing .

university of london 's queen mary college researchers put four paintings - two of flowers - beneath bees ' flight paths , and tracked where they landed .
the bees landed on the two most floral .
van gogh 's sunflowers was favourite .
the study , made on three colonies raised in captivity and which had never seen flowers , was reported in the journal optics and laser technology .
these features are recognised by bees that have never been exposed to flowers before professor lars chittka about 11 % of approaches to the flower paintings ended with a landing , compared to just 4 % with the other paintings , the study found .
as well as sunflowers , the team showed the bees paul gauguin 's a vase of flowers , patrick caulfield 's pottery , and fernand leger 's still life with a beer mug .
the bees flew towards the van gogh picture 146 times and landed on it 15 times .
a vase of flowers produced 81 approaches and 11 landings .
caulfield 's pottery produced 138 approaches but only four landings .
and still life with a beer mug attracted bees on 117 occasions , but again only four landings .
blue appeal professor lars chittka said : " the results show that the flower paintings have captured the essence of floral features from a bee 's point of view , and that these features are recognised by bees that have never been exposed to flowers before .
" flowers contain all the goods that a bee needs to thrive - pollen and nectar - and selection has therefore favoured bees with ' aesthetic preferences ' for those flowers which offer the best bonanzas . "
a bee 's favourite colour is blue , he added , which is associated with high-nectar flowers .
this could be why the bees were strongly drawn to the blue " vincent " signature in van gogh 's painting , as well as the blue blooms in a vase of flowers , and a light blue square in still life with a beer mug .
