but german publishers seem warm to the idea . five major us publishers filed suit in san francisco on wednesday to block google from scanning books without the permission of copyright holders .
the project , already underway but stopped by google in august , is the silicon valley company 's bid to make the world 's books searchable online .
five major libraries are already participating in the project and google sent executive jennifer grant to the frankfurt book fair on wednesday to present the idea to european and german book publishers .
this week google introduced print.google.de , the german version of the search engine google posted online this time last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google is facing a court battle google lets users type in a search term then scans its digitized library for the word or expression and produces a list of books where the term is mentioned .
users can then click on the results and a few pages of the text appear allowing users to read up online .
the idea is to supplement internet users with another source of material .
in contrast to their american colleagues , german publishing houses have reacted well to the database .
some german publishers on board google said that is discussing terms with all major german publishers .
langenscheidt , which publishes a large selection of dictionaries , said they had got on board .
" we are starting with 160 books , " hubert haarmann , head of the electronic publishing division and the publisher , told the financial times deutschland .

the company also says that publishers will be able to monitor interest in titles through the search engine , and use the information in deciding whether to reprint certain books .
google has also promised publishers a cut of the advertising that will appear on the site .
not all german publishers are on board .
in fact , the german association representing publishers has announced it will begin its own project where publishers can scan their own books , rather than let someone else do it .
the project is not a competitor to google , but will allow publishers to create their own database , rather than turn it over to the search engine .
if google can , anyone can but american publishers do n't want to even take that step .
they fear a slippery slope if google is allowed to digitize copyrighted material .
" if google can make … copies , then anyone can , " patricia schroeder , president of the association of american publishers , said in a phone interview with reuters .
" anybody could go into a library and start making digital copies of anything . "
at issue is the right of authors and their publishers to their own work versus the " fair use " of their work by the public .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google is facing a court battle google lets users type in a search term then scans its digitized library for the word or expression and produces a list of books where the term is mentioned .
users can then click on the results and a few pages of the text appear allowing users to read up online .
the idea is to supplement internet users with another source of material .
in contrast to their american colleagues , german publishing houses have reacted well to the database .
some german publishers on board google said that is discussing terms with all major german publishers .
langenscheidt , which publishes a large selection of dictionaries , said they had got on board .
" we are starting with 160 books , " hubert haarmann , head of the electronic publishing division and the publisher , told the financial times deutschland .
" we see it as an additional distribution possibility . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : langenscheidt : snippets will soon be available online an increased and more direct reach to the consumer is just one way google is promoting its new project to skeptical publishers .
the company also says that publishers will be able to monitor interest in titles through the search engine , and use the information in deciding whether to reprint certain books .
google has also promised publishers a cut of the advertising that will appear on the site .
not all german publishers are on board .
in fact , the german association representing publishers has announced it will begin its own project where publishers can scan their own books , rather than let someone else do it .
the project is not a competitor to google , but will allow publishers to create their own database , rather than turn it over to the search engine .
if google can , anyone can but american publishers do n't want to even take that step .
they fear a slippery slope if google is allowed to digitize copyrighted material .
" if google can make … copies , then anyone can , " patricia schroeder , president of the association of american publishers , said in a phone interview with reuters .
" anybody could go into a library and start making digital copies of anything . "
at issue is the right of authors and their publishers to their own work versus the " fair use " of their work by the public .
google argues that their search engine will only offer users a " card catalog " function , with a few pages of text .
no one will be able to read the entire book online . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de book publishers still unsure in internet age the impact of the web on the world of the novel remains clouded in uncertainty , industry players at the frankfurt book fair said wednesday as they began discussing ways to weather the change .

do you have an unfulfilled dream ?
" my dream , i suppose , is to have a good health until the end of my life and to have a good energy .
i like my work very much so to have paul smith , the company , obviously to continue to do well and to expand but still have a very down to earth , honest feeling . "
what really drives you bananas ?
" bad manners particularly drive me bananas .
i hate bad manners .
i think even if you are very cool , very young , very hip then you still could have good manners .
so , no bad manners please . "
what would be a perfect day for you ?
" a perfect day would be like most days : i swim .
we are swimming at 06:30 in the morning .
i go for a swim , around 07:30 have breakfast and come here to this building if i 'm in england .
but i 'm travelling for seven months of the year , so i will swim every day , wherever i am , and then start the day at 08:15 , 8:30 and meet lots of people and do lots of interesting things .
when i 'm in england i 'm always home at seven o 'clock and then i spend the evening with my wife .
we might go to the theatre , cinema , have supper with friends ... so it 's a very normal day .
it 's not about jetsetting and meeting very famous people ; it 's a very down-to-earth day and that 's what i like very much . "

but german publishers seem warm to the idea . five major us publishers filed suit in san francisco on wednesday to block google from scanning books without the permission of copyright holders .
the project , already underway but stopped by google in august , is the silicon valley company 's bid to make the world 's books searchable online .
five major libraries are already participating in the project and google sent executive jennifer grant to the frankfurt book fair on wednesday to present the idea to european and german book publishers .
this week google introduced print.google.de , the german version of the search engine google posted online this time last year .

users can then click on the results and a few pages of the text appear allowing users to read up online .
the idea is to supplement internet users with another source of material .
in contrast to their american colleagues , german publishing houses have reacted well to the database .
some german publishers on board google said that is discussing terms with all major german publishers .
langenscheidt , which publishes a large selection of dictionaries , said they had got on board .

the company also says that publishers will be able to monitor interest in titles through the search engine , and use the information in deciding whether to reprint certain books .
google has also promised publishers a cut of the advertising that will appear on the site .
not all german publishers are on board .
in fact , the german association representing publishers has announced it will begin its own project where publishers can scan their own books , rather than let someone else do it .
the project is not a competitor to google , but will allow publishers to create their own database , rather than turn it over to the search engine .
if google can , anyone can but american publishers do n't want to even take that step .
they fear a slippery slope if google is allowed to digitize copyrighted material .
" if google can make … copies , then anyone can , " patricia schroeder , president of the association of american publishers , said in a phone interview with reuters .
" anybody could go into a library and start making digital copies of anything . "
at issue is the right of authors and their publishers to their own work versus the " fair use " of their work by the public .

but german publishers seem warm to the idea . five major us publishers filed suit in san francisco on wednesday to block google from scanning books without the permission of copyright holders .
the project , already underway but stopped by google in august , is the silicon valley company 's bid to make the world 's books searchable online .
five major libraries are already participating in the project and google sent executive jennifer grant to the frankfurt book fair on wednesday to present the idea to european and german book publishers .
this week google introduced print.google.de , the german version of the search engine google posted online this time last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dw-world.de celebrates press freedom is freedom of the press dying out in germany ?
a widening cronfrontation : timeline of cartoon crisis report : fewer reporters die but press freedoms still in danger opinion : the principle of freedom germany -pipe- 20.10.2005 the silver lining in press tampering case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german reporters are on shaky ground the dawn raid on the offices of a german political magazine and one of its journalists prompted a parliamentary hearing and concerns of government tampering with the free press .
the furor is good - for press freedom . whether it ’ s the judy miller case at the new york times , or the recent raid of the offices of the german political magazine cicero , the newsgathering process in the post 9/11 world is on new , shaky territory . miller went to prison for 85 days for refusing to reveal the source who told her the identity of cia agent valerie plame .
two months after miller began serving her sentence in july , german police launched a lengthy investigation into cicero investigative journalist bruno schirra after seizing 12 boxes of files and the hard disk from his computer in a september raid in potsdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram weimer , cicero 's editor in chief , says the raid was part of a strategy to discover the leak prosecutors suspect the journalist of being an " accessory to the divulgence of state secrets " after he authored an article on iraqi-based terrorist abu musab al-zarqawi that cited top-secret police documents . schirra 's publication says the target of the investigation is less the journalist than identifying who in the federal criminal office leaked him the reports . last week , media reported that prosecutors were mulling launching a separate investigation on schirra after the discovery of classified documents on a german bribery scandal in the boxes they seized . german journalism organizations say such investigations are on the rise , and some media analysts consider the cicero case a dangerous precedent .
newspapers and editorial columns have been rife with accusations of a government-engineered attack on press freedom in germany . but bettina peters , director of programs at the european journalism centre in maastricht , said that the case brings with it a silver lining . " the fact that the parliament has acted may hopefully serve as an indication that this is not going to happen in the future , " she said . politicians outraged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily 's colleagues had some harsh criticism for him after interior minister otto schily , who gave federal police the approval to launch the raid , stiffly defended himself and his officers before a parliamentary commission last week , green politician and committee member volker beck called his performance " condescending and authoritarian . "
beck was among several parliamentarians who announced they would consider introducing new legislation to better protect journalists and their reporting work .
even schily 's social democratic party colleague dieter wiefelspütz demanded a " debate beyond the one case . "
evidence collected by the german journalist 's federation -lrb- djv -rrb- over the past decade indicates there might be a need for it .
the djv told the financial times that the frequency of raids on journalists ' homes and offices in the past decade has increased - even though none of the raids led to a conviction . a chilling effect peters , whose organization trains journalists from around europe , says she senses a greater hesitation among journalists post 9/11 when it comes to publishing critical material .
anti-terrorism legislation passed in western countries like the uk , germany and the us since the terrorist attacks in the new york and washington has made the newsgathering process more difficult . " these provisions are vague and have a chilling effect on press freedom , " she said . but as long as people are aware of the violations as they happen , officials can take the proper measures to respond . " the really bad news is if we did n't have cicero cases because everyone keeps quiet , " said peters .

the furor is good - for press freedom . whether it ’ s the judy miller case at the new york times , or the recent raid of the offices of the german political magazine cicero , the newsgathering process in the post 9/11 world is on new , shaky territory . miller went to prison for 85 days for refusing to reveal the source who told her the identity of cia agent valerie plame .
two months after miller began serving her sentence in july , german police launched a lengthy investigation into cicero investigative journalist bruno schirra after seizing 12 boxes of files and the hard disk from his computer in a september raid in potsdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram weimer , cicero 's editor in chief , says the raid was part of a strategy to discover the leak prosecutors suspect the journalist of being an " accessory to the divulgence of state secrets " after he authored an article on iraqi-based terrorist abu musab al-zarqawi that cited top-secret police documents . schirra 's publication says the target of the investigation is less the journalist than identifying who in the federal criminal office leaked him the reports . last week , media reported that prosecutors were mulling launching a separate investigation on schirra after the discovery of classified documents on a german bribery scandal in the boxes they seized . german journalism organizations say such investigations are on the rise , and some media analysts consider the cicero case a dangerous precedent .
newspapers and editorial columns have been rife with accusations of a government-engineered attack on press freedom in germany . but bettina peters , director of programs at the european journalism centre in maastricht , said that the case brings with it a silver lining . " the fact that the parliament has acted may hopefully serve as an indication that this is not going to happen in the future , " she said . politicians outraged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily 's colleagues had some harsh criticism for him after interior minister otto schily , who gave federal police the approval to launch the raid , stiffly defended himself and his officers before a parliamentary commission last week , green politician and committee member volker beck called his performance " condescending and authoritarian . "
beck was among several parliamentarians who announced they would consider introducing new legislation to better protect journalists and their reporting work .
even schily 's social democratic party colleague dieter wiefelspütz demanded a " debate beyond the one case . "
evidence collected by the german journalist 's federation -lrb- djv -rrb- over the past decade indicates there might be a need for it .
the djv told the financial times that the frequency of raids on journalists ' homes and offices in the past decade has increased - even though none of the raids led to a conviction . a chilling effect peters , whose organization trains journalists from around europe , says she senses a greater hesitation among journalists post 9/11 when it comes to publishing critical material .
anti-terrorism legislation passed in western countries like the uk , germany and the us since the terrorist attacks in the new york and washington has made the newsgathering process more difficult . " these provisions are vague and have a chilling effect on press freedom , " she said . but as long as people are aware of the violations as they happen , officials can take the proper measures to respond . " the really bad news is if we did n't have cicero cases because everyone keeps quiet , " said peters .

koch rewarded him with a regional ministerial post in the hessian capital , wiesbaden .
but he resigned over a burgeoning party funding scandal a year later , a move which some local christian democrats say ensured roland koch 's political survival . many german senior politicians cut their teeth in regional politics .

" there must always an opportunity to talk to one another . " new concept jung was a conscript in the bundeswehr himself in the late 1960s , although much has changed in the meantime .
the bundeswehr need no longer ready itself for the threat of a land-based soviet invasion , and it is now transforming itself from a cold war army into a smaller , more flexible force that can be deployed on peacekeeping missions around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restructuring the bundeswehr is on the agenda this means downsizing and has been painful for some .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.10.2005 future defense minister reopens conscription debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : equal-opportunity conscription is what the conservatives want germany 's defense minister-designate , franz-josef jung , wants to introduce general conscription for the armed forces , paving the way for conflict with his spd coalition partners , who are against such a plan . although conscription currently exists in germany , it only applies to young men and does not necessarily affect all of them , since the numbers called to service changes annually depending on the need . the system is however generally considered as being good for the german armed forces and good for german democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz-josef jung but now franz-josef jung , the christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- politician who has been designated germany 's future defense minister , has said a general conscription should be introduced that would apply to all young men and women and would call upon them to serve in either the armed forces or a social institution . jung 's stance has led to friction with the cdu 's grand coalition parters , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the spd parliamentary group 's spokesperson for defense issues , rainer arnold , has called the suggestions " completely off base . " the union bloc of parties has also expressed its desire to allow the armed forces , or bundeswehr , to be deployed in the future within the country in the case of a terrorist threat . germany 's current constitution prohibits such domestic deployments and to institute such a policy , lawmakers would have to amend the country 's " basic law , " something jung and his union colleagues have said they will pursue . from hesse to berlin jung , 56 , is a christian democrat and comes to the federal government in berlin from regional politics in the state of hesse , where he was a close confidante of premier roland koch , a powerful cdu figure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's premier roland koch koch ousted the social democrats and greens from power in hesse in 1999 in an impressive regional triumph for the christian democrats , one year after they had been humiliatingly beaten by chancellor schröder 's social democrats on the national level . koch 's regional victory was due largely to the efforts of jung , a tireless campaigner .
koch rewarded him with a regional ministerial post in the hessian capital , wiesbaden .
but he resigned over a burgeoning party funding scandal a year later , a move which some local christian democrats say ensured roland koch 's political survival . many german senior politicians cut their teeth in regional politics .
as defense minister , franz-josef jung will be expected to translate political objectives into an appropriate military response and also get on well with the troops . " one has to be tough and straightforward , but never personal , " he said in describing his leadership style .
" there must always an opportunity to talk to one another . " new concept jung was a conscript in the bundeswehr himself in the late 1960s , although much has changed in the meantime .
the bundeswehr need no longer ready itself for the threat of a land-based soviet invasion , and it is now transforming itself from a cold war army into a smaller , more flexible force that can be deployed on peacekeeping missions around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restructuring the bundeswehr is on the agenda this means downsizing and has been painful for some .
many bundeswehr bases have been closed , hurting local economies and causing frustration among the troops .
however jung 's predecessor peter struck insists there is no going back .

" as of today , we are introducing an emergency law to keep as many birds as possible locked in stalls .
this decree applies to every german state , " trittin said . at one of germany 's biggest poultry farms , the tiemann family farm near bremen , an eerie quiet reigned after all its birds were forced from their normal outdoor pens into sheds . ' the danger is great ' the bremen area accounts for more than 40 percent of the entire production of poultry in germany .
as long ago as sept .

" we are in favor of birds being shut inside on a national level , " he told afp . " the danger is so great .
we have to do whatever we can to ensure that bird flu does n't get as far as here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not just just germany that 's active : disinfecting a farm in korea normally , the birds at the organic-poultry farm run free all day .
but the fields are now deserted and only the muffled sound of clucking could be heard from within the two sheds where the 30,000 birds are now kept . " the birds do n't really notice the difference , " tiemann said .
" they are not unhappy . " migration warnings the penning up of farm chickens in germany is expected to last until at least dec .
15 , when the migration season for wild birds comes to an end . avian migration is considered to be one of the biggest problems in controlling the spread of the virus .

originally , the informal meeting had been planned to discuss a wide range of health issues .
however , escalating fears about bird flu have forced officials to focus the meeting on this issue . death in thailand currently , the eu has imposed bans on poultry imports from turkey and romania , where there have been cases of bird flu .
and import bans on russian poultry goods are also being considered . thailand confirmed that another person died of bird flu there on thursday , with experts pointing out that the real concern is that bird flu could combine with human influenza strains , and mutate into a virus which may be transmitted from person to person . jane conway -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu urges against pandemic panic european union foreign ministers , who met in luxembourg tuesday , are seeking to allay public fears of an influenza pandemic following the detection of bird flu in three countries in the south of the continent .

" without any leading culture , there can not be any consensus on solving complex social problems , " he said . the " leitkultur " debate was first ignited in 2000 by friedrich merz , former leader of the cdu / csu parliamentary group , who coined the term to describe a way of life that immigrants to germany should aspire to . " we should expect people who want to live here for a long time to speak german and accept our constitution 's norms and values , " he said , citing forced marriages as an example of traditions germany should not have to tolerate from its immigrant community . his comments triggered widespread uproar , with an inevitable resistance to any form of german patriotism pitted against an emerging national self-confidence . reviving a relevant issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert says it 's ok for germans to be patriots " i believe the debate surrounding the term , which was prematurely cut short , was a crucial one in terms of assessing the spirit of the nation , " said lammert , adding that the term had met with a " knee-jerk rejection , " even though it transpired there was " broad support for the argument .

but german publishers seem warm to the idea . five major us publishers filed suit in san francisco on wednesday to block google from scanning books without the permission of copyright holders .
the project , already underway but stopped by google in august , is the silicon valley company 's bid to make the world 's books searchable online .
five major libraries are already participating in the project and google sent executive jennifer grant to the frankfurt book fair on wednesday to present the idea to european and german book publishers .
this week google introduced print.google.de , the german version of the search engine google posted online this time last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google is facing a court battle google lets users type in a search term then scans its digitized library for the word or expression and produces a list of books where the term is mentioned .
users can then click on the results and a few pages of the text appear allowing users to read up online .
the idea is to supplement internet users with another source of material .
in contrast to their american colleagues , german publishing houses have reacted well to the database .
some german publishers on board google said that is discussing terms with all major german publishers .
langenscheidt , which publishes a large selection of dictionaries , said they had got on board .
" we are starting with 160 books , " hubert haarmann , head of the electronic publishing division and the publisher , told the financial times deutschland .
" we see it as an additional distribution possibility . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : langenscheidt : snippets will soon be available online an increased and more direct reach to the consumer is just one way google is promoting its new project to skeptical publishers .
the company also says that publishers will be able to monitor interest in titles through the search engine , and use the information in deciding whether to reprint certain books .
google has also promised publishers a cut of the advertising that will appear on the site .
not all german publishers are on board .
in fact , the german association representing publishers has announced it will begin its own project where publishers can scan their own books , rather than let someone else do it .
the project is not a competitor to google , but will allow publishers to create their own database , rather than turn it over to the search engine .
if google can , anyone can but american publishers do n't want to even take that step .
they fear a slippery slope if google is allowed to digitize copyrighted material .
" if google can make … copies , then anyone can , " patricia schroeder , president of the association of american publishers , said in a phone interview with reuters .
" anybody could go into a library and start making digital copies of anything . "
at issue is the right of authors and their publishers to their own work versus the " fair use " of their work by the public .
google argues that their search engine will only offer users a " card catalog " function , with a few pages of text .

in contrast to their american colleagues , german publishing houses have reacted well to the database .
some german publishers on board google said that is discussing terms with all major german publishers .
langenscheidt , which publishes a large selection of dictionaries , said they had got on board .
" we are starting with 160 books , " hubert haarmann , head of the electronic publishing division and the publisher , told the financial times deutschland .
" we see it as an additional distribution possibility . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : langenscheidt : snippets will soon be available online an increased and more direct reach to the consumer is just one way google is promoting its new project to skeptical publishers .
the company also says that publishers will be able to monitor interest in titles through the search engine , and use the information in deciding whether to reprint certain books .
google has also promised publishers a cut of the advertising that will appear on the site .
not all german publishers are on board .
in fact , the german association representing publishers has announced it will begin its own project where publishers can scan their own books , rather than let someone else do it .
the project is not a competitor to google , but will allow publishers to create their own database , rather than turn it over to the search engine .
if google can , anyone can but american publishers do n't want to even take that step .
they fear a slippery slope if google is allowed to digitize copyrighted material .
" if google can make … copies , then anyone can , " patricia schroeder , president of the association of american publishers , said in a phone interview with reuters .
" anybody could go into a library and start making digital copies of anything . "
at issue is the right of authors and their publishers to their own work versus the " fair use " of their work by the public .
google argues that their search engine will only offer users a " card catalog " function , with a few pages of text .

others in his party agree . in an interview with the weekly newspaper die zeit , lammert said that german society needed to explore questions such as patriotism and national identity , echoing feelings already voiced by a number of christian democrats in recent weeks . " without any leading culture , there can not be any consensus on solving complex social problems , " he said . the " leitkultur " debate was first ignited in 2000 by friedrich merz , former leader of the cdu / csu parliamentary group , who coined the term to describe a way of life that immigrants to germany should aspire to . " we should expect people who want to live here for a long time to speak german and accept our constitution 's norms and values , " he said , citing forced marriages as an example of traditions germany should not have to tolerate from its immigrant community . his comments triggered widespread uproar , with an inevitable resistance to any form of german patriotism pitted against an emerging national self-confidence . reviving a relevant issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert says it 's ok for germans to be patriots " i believe the debate surrounding the term , which was prematurely cut short , was a crucial one in terms of assessing the spirit of the nation , " said lammert , adding that the term had met with a " knee-jerk rejection , " even though it transpired there was " broad support for the argument . " " no political system could uphold its inner legitimacy without a shared set of beliefs , especially in difficult times like these , " he pointed out . " it 's time we started talking about this issue again . " the cdu identity crisis others in the cdu agree .
the party 's disappointing showing in september 's election has prompted some soul-searching among its ranks . " the main reason -lrb- for the election result -rrb- is that the party is increasingly unable to rally together supporters and voters with one defining socio-political agenda , " said the cdu 's deputy leader christoph böhr . saxony 's former science minister matthias rößler -lrb- cdu -rrb- thinks it 's time to take action . " the party needs to revamp its image as a patriotic people 's party rather than a party of cold technocrats , " he said . together with cdu general secretary michael kretschmer , he presented a paper in dresden wednesday designed to kick-start a reappraisal of german patriotism .
it includes 12 principles that the authors hope will usher in a " more open approach " to the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will immigrants have to learn the german national anthem ?
one of their proposals is to put the national anthem on the elementary school curriculum . " singing the national anthem should be a normal part of public events , " says the report .

many bundeswehr bases have been closed , hurting local economies and causing frustration among the troops .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.10.2005 german publishers warm to google library großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google wants to help users mine the world 's libraries google is heading for a legal battle with american publishers over its plan to digitize books from five major libraries .
but german publishers seem warm to the idea . five major us publishers filed suit in san francisco on wednesday to block google from scanning books without the permission of copyright holders .
the project , already underway but stopped by google in august , is the silicon valley company 's bid to make the world 's books searchable online .
five major libraries are already participating in the project and google sent executive jennifer grant to the frankfurt book fair on wednesday to present the idea to european and german book publishers .
this week google introduced print.google.de , the german version of the search engine google posted online this time last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google is facing a court battle google lets users type in a search term then scans its digitized library for the word or expression and produces a list of books where the term is mentioned .
users can then click on the results and a few pages of the text appear allowing users to read up online .
the idea is to supplement internet users with another source of material .
in contrast to their american colleagues , german publishing houses have reacted well to the database .
some german publishers on board google said that is discussing terms with all major german publishers .
langenscheidt , which publishes a large selection of dictionaries , said they had got on board .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.10.2005 german publishers warm to google library großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google wants to help users mine the world 's libraries google is heading for a legal battle with american publishers over its plan to digitize books from five major libraries .
but german publishers seem warm to the idea . five major us publishers filed suit in san francisco on wednesday to block google from scanning books without the permission of copyright holders .
the project , already underway but stopped by google in august , is the silicon valley company 's bid to make the world 's books searchable online .
five major libraries are already participating in the project and google sent executive jennifer grant to the frankfurt book fair on wednesday to present the idea to european and german book publishers .
this week google introduced print.google.de , the german version of the search engine google posted online this time last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google is facing a court battle google lets users type in a search term then scans its digitized library for the word or expression and produces a list of books where the term is mentioned .
users can then click on the results and a few pages of the text appear allowing users to read up online .
the idea is to supplement internet users with another source of material .
in contrast to their american colleagues , german publishing houses have reacted well to the database .
some german publishers on board google said that is discussing terms with all major german publishers .
langenscheidt , which publishes a large selection of dictionaries , said they had got on board .
" we are starting with 160 books , " hubert haarmann , head of the electronic publishing division and the publisher , told the financial times deutschland .
" we see it as an additional distribution possibility . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : langenscheidt : snippets will soon be available online an increased and more direct reach to the consumer is just one way google is promoting its new project to skeptical publishers .
the company also says that publishers will be able to monitor interest in titles through the search engine , and use the information in deciding whether to reprint certain books .
google has also promised publishers a cut of the advertising that will appear on the site .
not all german publishers are on board .
in fact , the german association representing publishers has announced it will begin its own project where publishers can scan their own books , rather than let someone else do it .
the project is not a competitor to google , but will allow publishers to create their own database , rather than turn it over to the search engine .
if google can , anyone can but american publishers do n't want to even take that step .
they fear a slippery slope if google is allowed to digitize copyrighted material .
" if google can make … copies , then anyone can , " patricia schroeder , president of the association of american publishers , said in a phone interview with reuters .
" anybody could go into a library and start making digital copies of anything . "
at issue is the right of authors and their publishers to their own work versus the " fair use " of their work by the public .
google argues that their search engine will only offer users a " card catalog " function , with a few pages of text .

a widening cronfrontation : timeline of cartoon crisis report : fewer reporters die but press freedoms still in danger opinion : the principle of freedom germany -pipe- 20.10.2005 the silver lining in press tampering case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german reporters are on shaky ground the dawn raid on the offices of a german political magazine and one of its journalists prompted a parliamentary hearing and concerns of government tampering with the free press .
the furor is good - for press freedom . whether it ’ s the judy miller case at the new york times , or the recent raid of the offices of the german political magazine cicero , the newsgathering process in the post 9/11 world is on new , shaky territory . miller went to prison for 85 days for refusing to reveal the source who told her the identity of cia agent valerie plame .
two months after miller began serving her sentence in july , german police launched a lengthy investigation into cicero investigative journalist bruno schirra after seizing 12 boxes of files and the hard disk from his computer in a september raid in potsdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram weimer , cicero 's editor in chief , says the raid was part of a strategy to discover the leak prosecutors suspect the journalist of being an " accessory to the divulgence of state secrets " after he authored an article on iraqi-based terrorist abu musab al-zarqawi that cited top-secret police documents . schirra 's publication says the target of the investigation is less the journalist than identifying who in the federal criminal office leaked him the reports . last week , media reported that prosecutors were mulling launching a separate investigation on schirra after the discovery of classified documents on a german bribery scandal in the boxes they seized . german journalism organizations say such investigations are on the rise , and some media analysts consider the cicero case a dangerous precedent .
newspapers and editorial columns have been rife with accusations of a government-engineered attack on press freedom in germany . but bettina peters , director of programs at the european journalism centre in maastricht , said that the case brings with it a silver lining . " the fact that the parliament has acted may hopefully serve as an indication that this is not going to happen in the future , " she said . politicians outraged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily 's colleagues had some harsh criticism for him after interior minister otto schily , who gave federal police the approval to launch the raid , stiffly defended himself and his officers before a parliamentary commission last week , green politician and committee member volker beck called his performance " condescending and authoritarian . "
beck was among several parliamentarians who announced they would consider introducing new legislation to better protect journalists and their reporting work .
even schily 's social democratic party colleague dieter wiefelspütz demanded a " debate beyond the one case . "
evidence collected by the german journalist 's federation -lrb- djv -rrb- over the past decade indicates there might be a need for it .
the djv told the financial times that the frequency of raids on journalists ' homes and offices in the past decade has increased - even though none of the raids led to a conviction . a chilling effect peters , whose organization trains journalists from around europe , says she senses a greater hesitation among journalists post 9/11 when it comes to publishing critical material .
anti-terrorism legislation passed in western countries like the uk , germany and the us since the terrorist attacks in the new york and washington has made the newsgathering process more difficult . " these provisions are vague and have a chilling effect on press freedom , " she said . but as long as people are aware of the violations as they happen , officials can take the proper measures to respond . " the really bad news is if we did n't have cicero cases because everyone keeps quiet , " said peters .

the furor is good - for press freedom . whether it ’ s the judy miller case at the new york times , or the recent raid of the offices of the german political magazine cicero , the newsgathering process in the post 9/11 world is on new , shaky territory . miller went to prison for 85 days for refusing to reveal the source who told her the identity of cia agent valerie plame .
two months after miller began serving her sentence in july , german police launched a lengthy investigation into cicero investigative journalist bruno schirra after seizing 12 boxes of files and the hard disk from his computer in a september raid in potsdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram weimer , cicero 's editor in chief , says the raid was part of a strategy to discover the leak prosecutors suspect the journalist of being an " accessory to the divulgence of state secrets " after he authored an article on iraqi-based terrorist abu musab al-zarqawi that cited top-secret police documents . schirra 's publication says the target of the investigation is less the journalist than identifying who in the federal criminal office leaked him the reports . last week , media reported that prosecutors were mulling launching a separate investigation on schirra after the discovery of classified documents on a german bribery scandal in the boxes they seized . german journalism organizations say such investigations are on the rise , and some media analysts consider the cicero case a dangerous precedent .
newspapers and editorial columns have been rife with accusations of a government-engineered attack on press freedom in germany . but bettina peters , director of programs at the european journalism centre in maastricht , said that the case brings with it a silver lining .

others in his party agree . in an interview with the weekly newspaper die zeit , lammert said that german society needed to explore questions such as patriotism and national identity , echoing feelings already voiced by a number of christian democrats in recent weeks . " without any leading culture , there can not be any consensus on solving complex social problems , " he said . the " leitkultur " debate was first ignited in 2000 by friedrich merz , former leader of the cdu / csu parliamentary group , who coined the term to describe a way of life that immigrants to germany should aspire to . " we should expect people who want to live here for a long time to speak german and accept our constitution 's norms and values , " he said , citing forced marriages as an example of traditions germany should not have to tolerate from its immigrant community . his comments triggered widespread uproar , with an inevitable resistance to any form of german patriotism pitted against an emerging national self-confidence . reviving a relevant issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert says it 's ok for germans to be patriots " i believe the debate surrounding the term , which was prematurely cut short , was a crucial one in terms of assessing the spirit of the nation , " said lammert , adding that the term had met with a " knee-jerk rejection , " even though it transpired there was " broad support for the argument . " " no political system could uphold its inner legitimacy without a shared set of beliefs , especially in difficult times like these , " he pointed out . " it 's time we started talking about this issue again . " the cdu identity crisis others in the cdu agree .
the party 's disappointing showing in september 's election has prompted some soul-searching among its ranks . " the main reason -lrb- for the election result -rrb- is that the party is increasingly unable to rally together supporters and voters with one defining socio-political agenda , " said the cdu 's deputy leader christoph böhr . saxony 's former science minister matthias rößler -lrb- cdu -rrb- thinks it 's time to take action . " the party needs to revamp its image as a patriotic people 's party rather than a party of cold technocrats , " he said . together with cdu general secretary michael kretschmer , he presented a paper in dresden wednesday designed to kick-start a reappraisal of german patriotism .
it includes 12 principles that the authors hope will usher in a " more open approach " to the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will immigrants have to learn the german national anthem ?
one of their proposals is to put the national anthem on the elementary school curriculum . " singing the national anthem should be a normal part of public events , " says the report .

a widening cronfrontation : timeline of cartoon crisis report : fewer reporters die but press freedoms still in danger opinion : the principle of freedom germany -pipe- 20.10.2005 the silver lining in press tampering case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german reporters are on shaky ground the dawn raid on the offices of a german political magazine and one of its journalists prompted a parliamentary hearing and concerns of government tampering with the free press .
the furor is good - for press freedom . whether it ’ s the judy miller case at the new york times , or the recent raid of the offices of the german political magazine cicero , the newsgathering process in the post 9/11 world is on new , shaky territory . miller went to prison for 85 days for refusing to reveal the source who told her the identity of cia agent valerie plame .
two months after miller began serving her sentence in july , german police launched a lengthy investigation into cicero investigative journalist bruno schirra after seizing 12 boxes of files and the hard disk from his computer in a september raid in potsdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram weimer , cicero 's editor in chief , says the raid was part of a strategy to discover the leak prosecutors suspect the journalist of being an " accessory to the divulgence of state secrets " after he authored an article on iraqi-based terrorist abu musab al-zarqawi that cited top-secret police documents . schirra 's publication says the target of the investigation is less the journalist than identifying who in the federal criminal office leaked him the reports . last week , media reported that prosecutors were mulling launching a separate investigation on schirra after the discovery of classified documents on a german bribery scandal in the boxes they seized . german journalism organizations say such investigations are on the rise , and some media analysts consider the cicero case a dangerous precedent .
newspapers and editorial columns have been rife with accusations of a government-engineered attack on press freedom in germany . but bettina peters , director of programs at the european journalism centre in maastricht , said that the case brings with it a silver lining . " the fact that the parliament has acted may hopefully serve as an indication that this is not going to happen in the future , " she said . politicians outraged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily 's colleagues had some harsh criticism for him after interior minister otto schily , who gave federal police the approval to launch the raid , stiffly defended himself and his officers before a parliamentary commission last week , green politician and committee member volker beck called his performance " condescending and authoritarian . "
beck was among several parliamentarians who announced they would consider introducing new legislation to better protect journalists and their reporting work .
even schily 's social democratic party colleague dieter wiefelspütz demanded a " debate beyond the one case . "
evidence collected by the german journalist 's federation -lrb- djv -rrb- over the past decade indicates there might be a need for it .
the djv told the financial times that the frequency of raids on journalists ' homes and offices in the past decade has increased - even though none of the raids led to a conviction . a chilling effect peters , whose organization trains journalists from around europe , says she senses a greater hesitation among journalists post 9/11 when it comes to publishing critical material .
anti-terrorism legislation passed in western countries like the uk , germany and the us since the terrorist attacks in the new york and washington has made the newsgathering process more difficult . " these provisions are vague and have a chilling effect on press freedom , " she said . but as long as people are aware of the violations as they happen , officials can take the proper measures to respond . " the really bad news is if we did n't have cicero cases because everyone keeps quiet , " said peters .
" i think there is a danger that we 're moving towards people being overly cautious . " andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schily on the defensive in cicero affair outgoing interior minister otto schily appeared before a bundestag committee thursday to answer questions on last month 's controversial raid on the offices of a potsdam-based magazine and the home of one of its staff .

koch rewarded him with a regional ministerial post in the hessian capital , wiesbaden .
but he resigned over a burgeoning party funding scandal a year later , a move which some local christian democrats say ensured roland koch 's political survival . many german senior politicians cut their teeth in regional politics .
as defense minister , franz-josef jung will be expected to translate political objectives into an appropriate military response and also get on well with the troops . " one has to be tough and straightforward , but never personal , " he said in describing his leadership style .
" there must always an opportunity to talk to one another . " new concept jung was a conscript in the bundeswehr himself in the late 1960s , although much has changed in the meantime .
the bundeswehr need no longer ready itself for the threat of a land-based soviet invasion , and it is now transforming itself from a cold war army into a smaller , more flexible force that can be deployed on peacekeeping missions around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restructuring the bundeswehr is on the agenda this means downsizing and has been painful for some .
many bundeswehr bases have been closed , hurting local economies and causing frustration among the troops .

the spd parliamentary group 's spokesperson for defense issues , rainer arnold , has called the suggestions " completely off base . " the union bloc of parties has also expressed its desire to allow the armed forces , or bundeswehr , to be deployed in the future within the country in the case of a terrorist threat . germany 's current constitution prohibits such domestic deployments and to institute such a policy , lawmakers would have to amend the country 's " basic law , " something jung and his union colleagues have said they will pursue . from hesse to berlin jung , 56 , is a christian democrat and comes to the federal government in berlin from regional politics in the state of hesse , where he was a close confidante of premier roland koch , a powerful cdu figure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's premier roland koch koch ousted the social democrats and greens from power in hesse in 1999 in an impressive regional triumph for the christian democrats , one year after they had been humiliatingly beaten by chancellor schröder 's social democrats on the national level . koch 's regional victory was due largely to the efforts of jung , a tireless campaigner .
koch rewarded him with a regional ministerial post in the hessian capital , wiesbaden .
but he resigned over a burgeoning party funding scandal a year later , a move which some local christian democrats say ensured roland koch 's political survival . many german senior politicians cut their teeth in regional politics .
as defense minister , franz-josef jung will be expected to translate political objectives into an appropriate military response and also get on well with the troops . " one has to be tough and straightforward , but never personal , " he said in describing his leadership style .
" there must always an opportunity to talk to one another . " new concept jung was a conscript in the bundeswehr himself in the late 1960s , although much has changed in the meantime .
the bundeswehr need no longer ready itself for the threat of a land-based soviet invasion , and it is now transforming itself from a cold war army into a smaller , more flexible force that can be deployed on peacekeeping missions around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restructuring the bundeswehr is on the agenda this means downsizing and has been painful for some .
many bundeswehr bases have been closed , hurting local economies and causing frustration among the troops .
however jung 's predecessor peter struck insists there is no going back . " one word of advice , it would be a fatal mistake to reverse any decision on the closure of military bases , " struck said . mark caldwell / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler : debate needed on army 's future at a high-level meeting of military officials in bonn , president horst köhler honored the german armed forces ' 50 years of service to the cause of freedom and security , and called for a debate on the bundeswehr 's future .

" without any leading culture , there can not be any consensus on solving complex social problems , " he said . the " leitkultur " debate was first ignited in 2000 by friedrich merz , former leader of the cdu / csu parliamentary group , who coined the term to describe a way of life that immigrants to germany should aspire to . " we should expect people who want to live here for a long time to speak german and accept our constitution 's norms and values , " he said , citing forced marriages as an example of traditions germany should not have to tolerate from its immigrant community . his comments triggered widespread uproar , with an inevitable resistance to any form of german patriotism pitted against an emerging national self-confidence . reviving a relevant issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert says it 's ok for germans to be patriots " i believe the debate surrounding the term , which was prematurely cut short , was a crucial one in terms of assessing the spirit of the nation , " said lammert , adding that the term had met with a " knee-jerk rejection , " even though it transpired there was " broad support for the argument . " " no political system could uphold its inner legitimacy without a shared set of beliefs , especially in difficult times like these , " he pointed out . " it 's time we started talking about this issue again . " the cdu identity crisis others in the cdu agree .
the party 's disappointing showing in september 's election has prompted some soul-searching among its ranks . " the main reason -lrb- for the election result -rrb- is that the party is increasingly unable to rally together supporters and voters with one defining socio-political agenda , " said the cdu 's deputy leader christoph böhr . saxony 's former science minister matthias rößler -lrb- cdu -rrb- thinks it 's time to take action . " the party needs to revamp its image as a patriotic people 's party rather than a party of cold technocrats , " he said . together with cdu general secretary michael kretschmer , he presented a paper in dresden wednesday designed to kick-start a reappraisal of german patriotism .
it includes 12 principles that the authors hope will usher in a " more open approach " to the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will immigrants have to learn the german national anthem ?
one of their proposals is to put the national anthem on the elementary school curriculum . " singing the national anthem should be a normal part of public events , " says the report .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.10.2005 german publishers warm to google library großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google wants to help users mine the world 's libraries google is heading for a legal battle with american publishers over its plan to digitize books from five major libraries .
but german publishers seem warm to the idea . five major us publishers filed suit in san francisco on wednesday to block google from scanning books without the permission of copyright holders .
the project , already underway but stopped by google in august , is the silicon valley company 's bid to make the world 's books searchable online .
five major libraries are already participating in the project and google sent executive jennifer grant to the frankfurt book fair on wednesday to present the idea to european and german book publishers .
this week google introduced print.google.de , the german version of the search engine google posted online this time last year .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google is facing a court battle google lets users type in a search term then scans its digitized library for the word or expression and produces a list of books where the term is mentioned .
users can then click on the results and a few pages of the text appear allowing users to read up online .
the idea is to supplement internet users with another source of material .
in contrast to their american colleagues , german publishing houses have reacted well to the database .
some german publishers on board google said that is discussing terms with all major german publishers .
langenscheidt , which publishes a large selection of dictionaries , said they had got on board .
" we are starting with 160 books , " hubert haarmann , head of the electronic publishing division and the publisher , told the financial times deutschland .
" we see it as an additional distribution possibility . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dw-world.de celebrates press freedom is freedom of the press dying out in germany ?
a widening cronfrontation : timeline of cartoon crisis report : fewer reporters die but press freedoms still in danger opinion : the principle of freedom germany -pipe- 20.10.2005 the silver lining in press tampering case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german reporters are on shaky ground the dawn raid on the offices of a german political magazine and one of its journalists prompted a parliamentary hearing and concerns of government tampering with the free press .
the furor is good - for press freedom . whether it ’ s the judy miller case at the new york times , or the recent raid of the offices of the german political magazine cicero , the newsgathering process in the post 9/11 world is on new , shaky territory . miller went to prison for 85 days for refusing to reveal the source who told her the identity of cia agent valerie plame .
two months after miller began serving her sentence in july , german police launched a lengthy investigation into cicero investigative journalist bruno schirra after seizing 12 boxes of files and the hard disk from his computer in a september raid in potsdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram weimer , cicero 's editor in chief , says the raid was part of a strategy to discover the leak prosecutors suspect the journalist of being an " accessory to the divulgence of state secrets " after he authored an article on iraqi-based terrorist abu musab al-zarqawi that cited top-secret police documents . schirra 's publication says the target of the investigation is less the journalist than identifying who in the federal criminal office leaked him the reports . last week , media reported that prosecutors were mulling launching a separate investigation on schirra after the discovery of classified documents on a german bribery scandal in the boxes they seized . german journalism organizations say such investigations are on the rise , and some media analysts consider the cicero case a dangerous precedent .
newspapers and editorial columns have been rife with accusations of a government-engineered attack on press freedom in germany . but bettina peters , director of programs at the european journalism centre in maastricht , said that the case brings with it a silver lining . " the fact that the parliament has acted may hopefully serve as an indication that this is not going to happen in the future , " she said . politicians outraged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily 's colleagues had some harsh criticism for him after interior minister otto schily , who gave federal police the approval to launch the raid , stiffly defended himself and his officers before a parliamentary commission last week , green politician and committee member volker beck called his performance " condescending and authoritarian . "
beck was among several parliamentarians who announced they would consider introducing new legislation to better protect journalists and their reporting work .
even schily 's social democratic party colleague dieter wiefelspütz demanded a " debate beyond the one case . "
evidence collected by the german journalist 's federation -lrb- djv -rrb- over the past decade indicates there might be a need for it .
the djv told the financial times that the frequency of raids on journalists ' homes and offices in the past decade has increased - even though none of the raids led to a conviction . a chilling effect peters , whose organization trains journalists from around europe , says she senses a greater hesitation among journalists post 9/11 when it comes to publishing critical material .

beck was among several parliamentarians who announced they would consider introducing new legislation to better protect journalists and their reporting work .

newspapers and editorial columns have been rife with accusations of a government-engineered attack on press freedom in germany . but bettina peters , director of programs at the european journalism centre in maastricht , said that the case brings with it a silver lining .

beck was among several parliamentarians who announced they would consider introducing new legislation to better protect journalists and their reporting work .

evidence collected by the german journalist 's federation -lrb- djv -rrb- over the past decade indicates there might be a need for it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 20.10.2005 future defense minister reopens conscription debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : equal-opportunity conscription is what the conservatives want germany 's defense minister-designate , franz-josef jung , wants to introduce general conscription for the armed forces , paving the way for conflict with his spd coalition partners , who are against such a plan . although conscription currently exists in germany , it only applies to young men and does not necessarily affect all of them , since the numbers called to service changes annually depending on the need . the system is however generally considered as being good for the german armed forces and good for german democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz-josef jung but now franz-josef jung , the christian democratic -lrb- cdu -rrb- politician who has been designated germany 's future defense minister , has said a general conscription should be introduced that would apply to all young men and women and would call upon them to serve in either the armed forces or a social institution . jung 's stance has led to friction with the cdu 's grand coalition parters , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the spd parliamentary group 's spokesperson for defense issues , rainer arnold , has called the suggestions " completely off base . " the union bloc of parties has also expressed its desire to allow the armed forces , or bundeswehr , to be deployed in the future within the country in the case of a terrorist threat . germany 's current constitution prohibits such domestic deployments and to institute such a policy , lawmakers would have to amend the country 's " basic law , " something jung and his union colleagues have said they will pursue . from hesse to berlin jung , 56 , is a christian democrat and comes to the federal government in berlin from regional politics in the state of hesse , where he was a close confidante of premier roland koch , a powerful cdu figure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hesse 's premier roland koch koch ousted the social democrats and greens from power in hesse in 1999 in an impressive regional triumph for the christian democrats , one year after they had been humiliatingly beaten by chancellor schröder 's social democrats on the national level . koch 's regional victory was due largely to the efforts of jung , a tireless campaigner .
koch rewarded him with a regional ministerial post in the hessian capital , wiesbaden .
but he resigned over a burgeoning party funding scandal a year later , a move which some local christian democrats say ensured roland koch 's political survival . many german senior politicians cut their teeth in regional politics .
as defense minister , franz-josef jung will be expected to translate political objectives into an appropriate military response and also get on well with the troops . " one has to be tough and straightforward , but never personal , " he said in describing his leadership style .
" there must always an opportunity to talk to one another . " new concept jung was a conscript in the bundeswehr himself in the late 1960s , although much has changed in the meantime .
the bundeswehr need no longer ready itself for the threat of a land-based soviet invasion , and it is now transforming itself from a cold war army into a smaller , more flexible force that can be deployed on peacekeeping missions around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restructuring the bundeswehr is on the agenda this means downsizing and has been painful for some .
many bundeswehr bases have been closed , hurting local economies and causing frustration among the troops .
however jung 's predecessor peter struck insists there is no going back . " one word of advice , it would be a fatal mistake to reverse any decision on the closure of military bases , " struck said . mark caldwell / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de köhler : debate needed on army 's future at a high-level meeting of military officials in bonn , president horst köhler honored the german armed forces ' 50 years of service to the cause of freedom and security , and called for a debate on the bundeswehr 's future .

koch rewarded him with a regional ministerial post in the hessian capital , wiesbaden .
but he resigned over a burgeoning party funding scandal a year later , a move which some local christian democrats say ensured roland koch 's political survival . many german senior politicians cut their teeth in regional politics .
as defense minister , franz-josef jung will be expected to translate political objectives into an appropriate military response and also get on well with the troops . " one has to be tough and straightforward , but never personal , " he said in describing his leadership style .
" there must always an opportunity to talk to one another . " new concept jung was a conscript in the bundeswehr himself in the late 1960s , although much has changed in the meantime .
the bundeswehr need no longer ready itself for the threat of a land-based soviet invasion , and it is now transforming itself from a cold war army into a smaller , more flexible force that can be deployed on peacekeeping missions around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restructuring the bundeswehr is on the agenda this means downsizing and has been painful for some .

a widening cronfrontation : timeline of cartoon crisis report : fewer reporters die but press freedoms still in danger opinion : the principle of freedom germany -pipe- 20.10.2005 the silver lining in press tampering case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german reporters are on shaky ground the dawn raid on the offices of a german political magazine and one of its journalists prompted a parliamentary hearing and concerns of government tampering with the free press .
the furor is good - for press freedom . whether it ’ s the judy miller case at the new york times , or the recent raid of the offices of the german political magazine cicero , the newsgathering process in the post 9/11 world is on new , shaky territory . miller went to prison for 85 days for refusing to reveal the source who told her the identity of cia agent valerie plame .
two months after miller began serving her sentence in july , german police launched a lengthy investigation into cicero investigative journalist bruno schirra after seizing 12 boxes of files and the hard disk from his computer in a september raid in potsdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram weimer , cicero 's editor in chief , says the raid was part of a strategy to discover the leak prosecutors suspect the journalist of being an " accessory to the divulgence of state secrets " after he authored an article on iraqi-based terrorist abu musab al-zarqawi that cited top-secret police documents . schirra 's publication says the target of the investigation is less the journalist than identifying who in the federal criminal office leaked him the reports . last week , media reported that prosecutors were mulling launching a separate investigation on schirra after the discovery of classified documents on a german bribery scandal in the boxes they seized . german journalism organizations say such investigations are on the rise , and some media analysts consider the cicero case a dangerous precedent .
newspapers and editorial columns have been rife with accusations of a government-engineered attack on press freedom in germany . but bettina peters , director of programs at the european journalism centre in maastricht , said that the case brings with it a silver lining . " the fact that the parliament has acted may hopefully serve as an indication that this is not going to happen in the future , " she said . politicians outraged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily 's colleagues had some harsh criticism for him after interior minister otto schily , who gave federal police the approval to launch the raid , stiffly defended himself and his officers before a parliamentary commission last week , green politician and committee member volker beck called his performance " condescending and authoritarian . "
beck was among several parliamentarians who announced they would consider introducing new legislation to better protect journalists and their reporting work .
even schily 's social democratic party colleague dieter wiefelspütz demanded a " debate beyond the one case . "
evidence collected by the german journalist 's federation -lrb- djv -rrb- over the past decade indicates there might be a need for it .
the djv told the financial times that the frequency of raids on journalists ' homes and offices in the past decade has increased - even though none of the raids led to a conviction . a chilling effect peters , whose organization trains journalists from around europe , says she senses a greater hesitation among journalists post 9/11 when it comes to publishing critical material .
anti-terrorism legislation passed in western countries like the uk , germany and the us since the terrorist attacks in the new york and washington has made the newsgathering process more difficult . " these provisions are vague and have a chilling effect on press freedom , " she said . but as long as people are aware of the violations as they happen , officials can take the proper measures to respond . " the really bad news is if we did n't have cicero cases because everyone keeps quiet , " said peters .

others in his party agree . in an interview with the weekly newspaper die zeit , lammert said that german society needed to explore questions such as patriotism and national identity , echoing feelings already voiced by a number of christian democrats in recent weeks . " without any leading culture , there can not be any consensus on solving complex social problems , " he said . the " leitkultur " debate was first ignited in 2000 by friedrich merz , former leader of the cdu / csu parliamentary group , who coined the term to describe a way of life that immigrants to germany should aspire to . " we should expect people who want to live here for a long time to speak german and accept our constitution 's norms and values , " he said , citing forced marriages as an example of traditions germany should not have to tolerate from its immigrant community . his comments triggered widespread uproar , with an inevitable resistance to any form of german patriotism pitted against an emerging national self-confidence . reviving a relevant issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert says it 's ok for germans to be patriots " i believe the debate surrounding the term , which was prematurely cut short , was a crucial one in terms of assessing the spirit of the nation , " said lammert , adding that the term had met with a " knee-jerk rejection , " even though it transpired there was " broad support for the argument . " " no political system could uphold its inner legitimacy without a shared set of beliefs , especially in difficult times like these , " he pointed out . " it 's time we started talking about this issue again . " the cdu identity crisis others in the cdu agree .
the party 's disappointing showing in september 's election has prompted some soul-searching among its ranks . " the main reason -lrb- for the election result -rrb- is that the party is increasingly unable to rally together supporters and voters with one defining socio-political agenda , " said the cdu 's deputy leader christoph böhr . saxony 's former science minister matthias rößler -lrb- cdu -rrb- thinks it 's time to take action . " the party needs to revamp its image as a patriotic people 's party rather than a party of cold technocrats , " he said . together with cdu general secretary michael kretschmer , he presented a paper in dresden wednesday designed to kick-start a reappraisal of german patriotism .
it includes 12 principles that the authors hope will usher in a " more open approach " to the matter . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will immigrants have to learn the german national anthem ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dw-world.de celebrates press freedom is freedom of the press dying out in germany ?
a widening cronfrontation : timeline of cartoon crisis report : fewer reporters die but press freedoms still in danger opinion : the principle of freedom germany -pipe- 20.10.2005 the silver lining in press tampering case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german reporters are on shaky ground the dawn raid on the offices of a german political magazine and one of its journalists prompted a parliamentary hearing and concerns of government tampering with the free press .
the furor is good - for press freedom . whether it ’ s the judy miller case at the new york times , or the recent raid of the offices of the german political magazine cicero , the newsgathering process in the post 9/11 world is on new , shaky territory . miller went to prison for 85 days for refusing to reveal the source who told her the identity of cia agent valerie plame .
two months after miller began serving her sentence in july , german police launched a lengthy investigation into cicero investigative journalist bruno schirra after seizing 12 boxes of files and the hard disk from his computer in a september raid in potsdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram weimer , cicero 's editor in chief , says the raid was part of a strategy to discover the leak prosecutors suspect the journalist of being an " accessory to the divulgence of state secrets " after he authored an article on iraqi-based terrorist abu musab al-zarqawi that cited top-secret police documents . schirra 's publication says the target of the investigation is less the journalist than identifying who in the federal criminal office leaked him the reports . last week , media reported that prosecutors were mulling launching a separate investigation on schirra after the discovery of classified documents on a german bribery scandal in the boxes they seized . german journalism organizations say such investigations are on the rise , and some media analysts consider the cicero case a dangerous precedent .
newspapers and editorial columns have been rife with accusations of a government-engineered attack on press freedom in germany . but bettina peters , director of programs at the european journalism centre in maastricht , said that the case brings with it a silver lining .

two months after miller began serving her sentence in july , german police launched a lengthy investigation into cicero investigative journalist bruno schirra after seizing 12 boxes of files and the hard disk from his computer in a september raid in potsdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram weimer , cicero 's editor in chief , says the raid was part of a strategy to discover the leak prosecutors suspect the journalist of being an " accessory to the divulgence of state secrets " after he authored an article on iraqi-based terrorist abu musab al-zarqawi that cited top-secret police documents . schirra 's publication says the target of the investigation is less the journalist than identifying who in the federal criminal office leaked him the reports . last week , media reported that prosecutors were mulling launching a separate investigation on schirra after the discovery of classified documents on a german bribery scandal in the boxes they seized . german journalism organizations say such investigations are on the rise , and some media analysts consider the cicero case a dangerous precedent .
newspapers and editorial columns have been rife with accusations of a government-engineered attack on press freedom in germany . but bettina peters , director of programs at the european journalism centre in maastricht , said that the case brings with it a silver lining . " the fact that the parliament has acted may hopefully serve as an indication that this is not going to happen in the future , " she said . politicians outraged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily 's colleagues had some harsh criticism for him after interior minister otto schily , who gave federal police the approval to launch the raid , stiffly defended himself and his officers before a parliamentary commission last week , green politician and committee member volker beck called his performance " condescending and authoritarian . "
beck was among several parliamentarians who announced they would consider introducing new legislation to better protect journalists and their reporting work .
even schily 's social democratic party colleague dieter wiefelspütz demanded a " debate beyond the one case . "
evidence collected by the german journalist 's federation -lrb- djv -rrb- over the past decade indicates there might be a need for it .
the djv told the financial times that the frequency of raids on journalists ' homes and offices in the past decade has increased - even though none of the raids led to a conviction . a chilling effect peters , whose organization trains journalists from around europe , says she senses a greater hesitation among journalists post 9/11 when it comes to publishing critical material .
anti-terrorism legislation passed in western countries like the uk , germany and the us since the terrorist attacks in the new york and washington has made the newsgathering process more difficult . " these provisions are vague and have a chilling effect on press freedom , " she said . but as long as people are aware of the violations as they happen , officials can take the proper measures to respond . " the really bad news is if we did n't have cicero cases because everyone keeps quiet , " said peters .

" questions remain over fund 's feasibility the document , which was obtained by afp , provides no figures on how much money should be ploughed into the fund , although german newspaper handelsblatt reported wednesday that it could be in the double-digit billions of euros . the idea for such an eu fund has long been mooted in brussels , although member states , who would have to cough up the money for it , have so far shown little interest in making it become real . the document also says the eu-level response to globalisation should include bolstering the eu 's internal market , especially in services , telecommunications , energy and financial services .
it calls for better application of competition and state aid rules , cutting red tape , boosting free-trade abroad and agreeing on the eu 's long-term budget , an issue which member states are currently arguing over . eu not doing enough to ease pain the commission has come under fire recently for not doing enough to ease the pain caused by big restructurings as companies shift labour to countries outside of europe with cheaper employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac argued that the eu needs to do more to keep jobs in europe french president jacques chirac in particular chied the commission for not doing enough in the case of a big restructuring of the european operations of us computer maker hewlett packard 's european operations that will result in the loss of thousands of jobs across europe , including at least 1,200 in france . the commission responded by noting its authority to intervene in the matter is legally limited . investements could lower unemployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : improved infrastructure would help attract private investors even if the fund is approved , the eu " should not expect any miracles if we can not stimulate internal demand , " european employment commissioner vladimir spidla told reporters on wednesday . as a way of making the deal more enticing to the countries that would have to foot the bill , spidla said the massive fund could also curb unemployment across the 25-nation bloc .
the eu endured 9 percent unemployment with some 19 billion people out of work across the bloc , according to a report presented wednesday . " since 1998 the eu employment policy has created 12 million jobs , " spidla said . " we need to make another 20 million to reach full employment .

but german publishers seem warm to the idea . five major us publishers filed suit in san francisco on wednesday to block google from scanning books without the permission of copyright holders .
the project , already underway but stopped by google in august , is the silicon valley company 's bid to make the world 's books searchable online .
five major libraries are already participating in the project and google sent executive jennifer grant to the frankfurt book fair on wednesday to present the idea to european and german book publishers .

a widening cronfrontation : timeline of cartoon crisis report : fewer reporters die but press freedoms still in danger opinion : the principle of freedom germany -pipe- 20.10.2005 the silver lining in press tampering case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german reporters are on shaky ground the dawn raid on the offices of a german political magazine and one of its journalists prompted a parliamentary hearing and concerns of government tampering with the free press .
the furor is good - for press freedom . whether it ’ s the judy miller case at the new york times , or the recent raid of the offices of the german political magazine cicero , the newsgathering process in the post 9/11 world is on new , shaky territory . miller went to prison for 85 days for refusing to reveal the source who told her the identity of cia agent valerie plame .
two months after miller began serving her sentence in july , german police launched a lengthy investigation into cicero investigative journalist bruno schirra after seizing 12 boxes of files and the hard disk from his computer in a september raid in potsdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram weimer , cicero 's editor in chief , says the raid was part of a strategy to discover the leak prosecutors suspect the journalist of being an " accessory to the divulgence of state secrets " after he authored an article on iraqi-based terrorist abu musab al-zarqawi that cited top-secret police documents . schirra 's publication says the target of the investigation is less the journalist than identifying who in the federal criminal office leaked him the reports . last week , media reported that prosecutors were mulling launching a separate investigation on schirra after the discovery of classified documents on a german bribery scandal in the boxes they seized . german journalism organizations say such investigations are on the rise , and some media analysts consider the cicero case a dangerous precedent .
newspapers and editorial columns have been rife with accusations of a government-engineered attack on press freedom in germany . but bettina peters , director of programs at the european journalism centre in maastricht , said that the case brings with it a silver lining . " the fact that the parliament has acted may hopefully serve as an indication that this is not going to happen in the future , " she said . politicians outraged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily 's colleagues had some harsh criticism for him after interior minister otto schily , who gave federal police the approval to launch the raid , stiffly defended himself and his officers before a parliamentary commission last week , green politician and committee member volker beck called his performance " condescending and authoritarian . "
beck was among several parliamentarians who announced they would consider introducing new legislation to better protect journalists and their reporting work .
even schily 's social democratic party colleague dieter wiefelspütz demanded a " debate beyond the one case . "
evidence collected by the german journalist 's federation -lrb- djv -rrb- over the past decade indicates there might be a need for it .
the djv told the financial times that the frequency of raids on journalists ' homes and offices in the past decade has increased - even though none of the raids led to a conviction . a chilling effect peters , whose organization trains journalists from around europe , says she senses a greater hesitation among journalists post 9/11 when it comes to publishing critical material .
anti-terrorism legislation passed in western countries like the uk , germany and the us since the terrorist attacks in the new york and washington has made the newsgathering process more difficult . " these provisions are vague and have a chilling effect on press freedom , " she said . but as long as people are aware of the violations as they happen , officials can take the proper measures to respond . " the really bad news is if we did n't have cicero cases because everyone keeps quiet , " said peters .
" i think there is a danger that we 're moving towards people being overly cautious . " andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schily on the defensive in cicero affair outgoing interior minister otto schily appeared before a bundestag committee thursday to answer questions on last month 's controversial raid on the offices of a potsdam-based magazine and the home of one of its staff .

others in his party agree . in an interview with the weekly newspaper die zeit , lammert said that german society needed to explore questions such as patriotism and national identity , echoing feelings already voiced by a number of christian democrats in recent weeks . " without any leading culture , there can not be any consensus on solving complex social problems , " he said . the " leitkultur " debate was first ignited in 2000 by friedrich merz , former leader of the cdu / csu parliamentary group , who coined the term to describe a way of life that immigrants to germany should aspire to . " we should expect people who want to live here for a long time to speak german and accept our constitution 's norms and values , " he said , citing forced marriages as an example of traditions germany should not have to tolerate from its immigrant community . his comments triggered widespread uproar , with an inevitable resistance to any form of german patriotism pitted against an emerging national self-confidence . reviving a relevant issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert lammert says it 's ok for germans to be patriots " i believe the debate surrounding the term , which was prematurely cut short , was a crucial one in terms of assessing the spirit of the nation , " said lammert , adding that the term had met with a " knee-jerk rejection , " even though it transpired there was " broad support for the argument .

" questions remain over fund 's feasibility the document , which was obtained by afp , provides no figures on how much money should be ploughed into the fund , although german newspaper handelsblatt reported wednesday that it could be in the double-digit billions of euros . the idea for such an eu fund has long been mooted in brussels , although member states , who would have to cough up the money for it , have so far shown little interest in making it become real . the document also says the eu-level response to globalisation should include bolstering the eu 's internal market , especially in services , telecommunications , energy and financial services .
it calls for better application of competition and state aid rules , cutting red tape , boosting free-trade abroad and agreeing on the eu 's long-term budget , an issue which member states are currently arguing over . eu not doing enough to ease pain the commission has come under fire recently for not doing enough to ease the pain caused by big restructurings as companies shift labour to countries outside of europe with cheaper employees . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac argued that the eu needs to do more to keep jobs in europe french president jacques chirac in particular chied the commission for not doing enough in the case of a big restructuring of the european operations of us computer maker hewlett packard 's european operations that will result in the loss of thousands of jobs across europe , including at least 1,200 in france . the commission responded by noting its authority to intervene in the matter is legally limited . investements could lower unemployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : improved infrastructure would help attract private investors even if the fund is approved , the eu " should not expect any miracles if we can not stimulate internal demand , " european employment commissioner vladimir spidla told reporters on wednesday . as a way of making the deal more enticing to the countries that would have to foot the bill , spidla said the massive fund could also curb unemployment across the 25-nation bloc .
the eu endured 9 percent unemployment with some 19 billion people out of work across the bloc , according to a report presented wednesday . " since 1998 the eu employment policy has created 12 million jobs , " spidla said . " we need to make another 20 million to reach full employment .

a widening cronfrontation : timeline of cartoon crisis report : fewer reporters die but press freedoms still in danger opinion : the principle of freedom germany -pipe- 20.10.2005 the silver lining in press tampering case großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german reporters are on shaky ground the dawn raid on the offices of a german political magazine and one of its journalists prompted a parliamentary hearing and concerns of government tampering with the free press .
the furor is good - for press freedom . whether it ’ s the judy miller case at the new york times , or the recent raid of the offices of the german political magazine cicero , the newsgathering process in the post 9/11 world is on new , shaky territory . miller went to prison for 85 days for refusing to reveal the source who told her the identity of cia agent valerie plame .
two months after miller began serving her sentence in july , german police launched a lengthy investigation into cicero investigative journalist bruno schirra after seizing 12 boxes of files and the hard disk from his computer in a september raid in potsdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram weimer , cicero 's editor in chief , says the raid was part of a strategy to discover the leak prosecutors suspect the journalist of being an " accessory to the divulgence of state secrets " after he authored an article on iraqi-based terrorist abu musab al-zarqawi that cited top-secret police documents . schirra 's publication says the target of the investigation is less the journalist than identifying who in the federal criminal office leaked him the reports . last week , media reported that prosecutors were mulling launching a separate investigation on schirra after the discovery of classified documents on a german bribery scandal in the boxes they seized . german journalism organizations say such investigations are on the rise , and some media analysts consider the cicero case a dangerous precedent .
newspapers and editorial columns have been rife with accusations of a government-engineered attack on press freedom in germany . but bettina peters , director of programs at the european journalism centre in maastricht , said that the case brings with it a silver lining . " the fact that the parliament has acted may hopefully serve as an indication that this is not going to happen in the future , " she said . politicians outraged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily 's colleagues had some harsh criticism for him after interior minister otto schily , who gave federal police the approval to launch the raid , stiffly defended himself and his officers before a parliamentary commission last week , green politician and committee member volker beck called his performance " condescending and authoritarian . "
beck was among several parliamentarians who announced they would consider introducing new legislation to better protect journalists and their reporting work .
even schily 's social democratic party colleague dieter wiefelspütz demanded a " debate beyond the one case . "
evidence collected by the german journalist 's federation -lrb- djv -rrb- over the past decade indicates there might be a need for it .
the djv told the financial times that the frequency of raids on journalists ' homes and offices in the past decade has increased - even though none of the raids led to a conviction . a chilling effect peters , whose organization trains journalists from around europe , says she senses a greater hesitation among journalists post 9/11 when it comes to publishing critical material .
anti-terrorism legislation passed in western countries like the uk , germany and the us since the terrorist attacks in the new york and washington has made the newsgathering process more difficult . " these provisions are vague and have a chilling effect on press freedom , " she said . but as long as people are aware of the violations as they happen , officials can take the proper measures to respond . " the really bad news is if we did n't have cicero cases because everyone keeps quiet , " said peters .

the furor is good - for press freedom . whether it ’ s the judy miller case at the new york times , or the recent raid of the offices of the german political magazine cicero , the newsgathering process in the post 9/11 world is on new , shaky territory . miller went to prison for 85 days for refusing to reveal the source who told her the identity of cia agent valerie plame .
two months after miller began serving her sentence in july , german police launched a lengthy investigation into cicero investigative journalist bruno schirra after seizing 12 boxes of files and the hard disk from his computer in a september raid in potsdam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram weimer , cicero 's editor in chief , says the raid was part of a strategy to discover the leak prosecutors suspect the journalist of being an " accessory to the divulgence of state secrets " after he authored an article on iraqi-based terrorist abu musab al-zarqawi that cited top-secret police documents . schirra 's publication says the target of the investigation is less the journalist than identifying who in the federal criminal office leaked him the reports . last week , media reported that prosecutors were mulling launching a separate investigation on schirra after the discovery of classified documents on a german bribery scandal in the boxes they seized . german journalism organizations say such investigations are on the rise , and some media analysts consider the cicero case a dangerous precedent .
newspapers and editorial columns have been rife with accusations of a government-engineered attack on press freedom in germany . but bettina peters , director of programs at the european journalism centre in maastricht , said that the case brings with it a silver lining . " the fact that the parliament has acted may hopefully serve as an indication that this is not going to happen in the future , " she said . politicians outraged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister otto schily 's colleagues had some harsh criticism for him after interior minister otto schily , who gave federal police the approval to launch the raid , stiffly defended himself and his officers before a parliamentary commission last week , green politician and committee member volker beck called his performance " condescending and authoritarian . "
beck was among several parliamentarians who announced they would consider introducing new legislation to better protect journalists and their reporting work .
even schily 's social democratic party colleague dieter wiefelspütz demanded a " debate beyond the one case . "
evidence collected by the german journalist 's federation -lrb- djv -rrb- over the past decade indicates there might be a need for it .
the djv told the financial times that the frequency of raids on journalists ' homes and offices in the past decade has increased - even though none of the raids led to a conviction . a chilling effect peters , whose organization trains journalists from around europe , says she senses a greater hesitation among journalists post 9/11 when it comes to publishing critical material .
anti-terrorism legislation passed in western countries like the uk , germany and the us since the terrorist attacks in the new york and washington has made the newsgathering process more difficult . " these provisions are vague and have a chilling effect on press freedom , " she said . but as long as people are aware of the violations as they happen , officials can take the proper measures to respond .

" there must always an opportunity to talk to one another . " new concept jung was a conscript in the bundeswehr himself in the late 1960s , although much has changed in the meantime .
the bundeswehr need no longer ready itself for the threat of a land-based soviet invasion , and it is now transforming itself from a cold war army into a smaller , more flexible force that can be deployed on peacekeeping missions around the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : restructuring the bundeswehr is on the agenda this means downsizing and has been painful for some .
many bundeswehr bases have been closed , hurting local economies and causing frustration among the troops .

fearing bird flu , germans stockpile meds germany -pipe- 20.10.2005 to hamper flu , germans lock up fowl großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's hoped this will reduce the risk of infection as eu veterinarians meet to set a unified strategy to combat the spreading avian flu , germany took a drastic measure of its own : keeping farmed bird indoors in order to prevent infection from migrating ones . on thursday , germany ’ s agriculture and environment minister jürgen trittin announced a ban on free range poultry farming . " as of today , we are introducing an emergency law to keep as many birds as possible locked in stalls .
this decree applies to every german state , " trittin said . at one of germany 's biggest poultry farms , the tiemann family farm near bremen , an eerie quiet reigned after all its birds were forced from their normal outdoor pens into sheds . ' the danger is great ' the bremen area accounts for more than 40 percent of the entire production of poultry in germany .
as long ago as sept .
15 , worried regional authorities there ordered all poultry to be shut inside . andreas tiemann , 22 , whose father set up the farm , said the ban on outdoor rearing was the only way forward . " we are in favor of birds being shut inside on a national level , " he told afp . " the danger is so great .

he calls his style ' classic with a twist ' . how would you describe your personality ?
" hopefully my personality is quite down to earth , quite normal .
i hope i am , and easy to comunicate with and friendly . "
who 's your personal hero ?
" i think my wife is pretty high upon the list , because she has been an inspiration to me from when we met and we met when i was 21 .
we are still living together , we are still very happy and very in love , so i would say my wife . "
what temptation are you unable to resist ?
" to work every hour of the day .
i already only sleep maybe five hours so i think i do n't really take too much time off , but i think to work every hour would be good . "
give us a pearl of wisdom !
" to be interested and to be interesting , to have the ability to listen and to have the ability to contribute to life itself . "
do you have an unfulfilled dream ?
" my dream , i suppose , is to have a good health until the end of my life and to have a good energy .
i like my work very much so to have paul smith , the company , obviously to continue to do well and to expand but still have a very down to earth , honest feeling . "
what really drives you bananas ?
" bad manners particularly drive me bananas .
i hate bad manners .
i think even if you are very cool , very young , very hip then you still could have good manners .
so , no bad manners please . "
what would be a perfect day for you ?
" a perfect day would be like most days : i swim .
we are swimming at 06:30 in the morning .
i go for a swim , around 07:30 have breakfast and come here to this building if i 'm in england .
but i 'm travelling for seven months of the year , so i will swim every day , wherever i am , and then start the day at 08:15 , 8:30 and meet lots of people and do lots of interesting things .
when i 'm in england i 'm always home at seven o 'clock and then i spend the evening with my wife .
we might go to the theatre , cinema , have supper with friends ... so it 's a very normal day .
it 's not about jetsetting and meeting very famous people ; it 's a very down-to-earth day and that 's what i like very much . "

and val shawcross , who is championing the return of the historic crystal palace park to what she calls its ' grand vision ' , is well aware of this .
she admits plans to build shops , cafes , flats and 200 homes on three corners of the south-east london park are controversial but says the money raised would be invested into the rest of the open space .
the london assembly member for southwark and lambeth says the " tatty " park would become a visitor attraction .
" i think what people have got to be realistic about is what we can do for the park and the value of enabling this small amount of housing , " she said .
" the community might not want to back that but then actually they lose some money to improving the park 's surfaces and access . "
the london development agency 's -lrb- lda -rrb- proposals for the park are on a huge scale , with a price tag of £ 100m .
the sports centre and athletics accommodation tower block are earmarked to be bulldozed and resituated .
ms shawcross is keen to point out that the actual amount of park land accessible to the public will increase despite the development .
a total of 39 acres will be opened up .
eighteen of these will be " new land " which previously housed buildings or the hard caravan park standings . "
the park has been allowed to disintegrate - it 's lost its grand vision " val shawcross the rest will be areas which are currently fenced off .
the park was a pay and enter attraction in victorian times and took its name from joseph paxton 's crystal palace which housed the 1851 great exhibition , which was sited there until it burnt down in 1936 .
the park was under the control of bromley council - one of five local authorities which border the park - but regenerating proved too large and expensive a project for it to tackle .
the job was given to the mayor 's business arm , the london development agency .
some local people have called for the 200-acre site to be left alone but ms shawcross says this is not an option .
key plans in pictures " one of the problems is that it 's never been looked at as a whole .
this is a park for south london , not a small council garden . "
another of the key developments would be replacing the gardens in the corner closest to the crystal palace shopping triangle , with a piazza of restaurants and shops , plus about 30 flats and a 150-space underground car park .
ms shawcross says this will help lift the fortunes of the area and create hundreds of jobs for local people .
" the economy on church road is not very good .
some of the shops are shut and the buildings look derelict .
" the piazza would create a natural flow into the triangle and the park , and the underground car park would encourage mothers with young children , and older people to visit . "
" i do n't see why we need commercial investment to improve the park " melvyn harrison , chairman of the crystal palace foundation the 1960s-built sports centre - if english heritage agrees - would be replaced with a semi-circular construction next to the athletics stadium .
it would be environmentally friendly , powering itself via solar panels and house a new 50m swimming pool .
there are plans for landscaping and making the park generally more child-friendly with play areas and the revival of the city farm which is currently empty .
the largest development of about 140 houses and flats would be in the corner near sydenham hill with the remainder of the homes being sited at the bottom of the park near penge .
none of the homes will be affordable - ms shawcross makes it clear the developments are purely a way of making money .
sensitive issue " the social value wo n't be social housing , " she said , " it will be in improvements to the park . "
melvyn harrison , chairman of the crystal palace foundation , said : " any proposals have to be considered in a controlled and measured way and we will be looking very closely at what has been proposed .
" it 's a very sensitive issue with residents .
" but i do n't see why we need commercial investment to improve the park .
" other parks have been improved without commercialisation but obviously the lda and the greater london authority see it differently . "
a public consultation on the lda 's proposals begins on thursday and lasts until december .
it will be held at the park for two weeks before becoming a road show .

and val shawcross , who is championing the return of the historic crystal palace park to what she calls its ' grand vision ' , is well aware of this .
she admits plans to build shops , cafes , flats and 200 homes on three corners of the south-east london park are controversial but says the money raised would be invested into the rest of the open space .
the london assembly member for southwark and lambeth says the " tatty " park would become a visitor attraction .
" i think what people have got to be realistic about is what we can do for the park and the value of enabling this small amount of housing , " she said .
read the full proposals external link " the community might not want to back that but then actually they lose some money to improving the park 's surfaces and access . "
the london development agency 's -lrb- lda -rrb- proposals for the park are on a huge scale , with a price tag of £ 100m .
the sports centre and athletics accommodation tower block are earmarked to be bulldozed and resituated .
ms shawcross is keen to point out that the actual amount of park land accessible to the public will increase despite the development .
a total of 39 acres will be opened up .
eighteen of these will be " new land " which previously housed buildings or the hard caravan park standings .
the park has been allowed to disintegrate - it 's lost its grand vision val shawcross the rest will be areas which are currently fenced off .
the park was a pay and enter attraction in victorian times and took its name from joseph paxton 's crystal palace which housed the 1851 great exhibition , which was sited there until it burnt down in 1936 .
the park was under the control of bromley council - one of five local authorities which border the park - but regenerating proved too large and expensive a project for it to tackle .
the job was given to the mayor 's business arm , the london development agency .
some local people have called for the 200-acre site to be left alone but ms shawcross says this is not an option .
key plans in pictures " one of the problems is that it 's never been looked at as a whole .
this is a park for south london , not a small council garden . "
another of the key developments would be replacing the gardens in the corner closest to the crystal palace shopping triangle , with a piazza of restaurants and shops , plus about 30 flats and a 150-space underground car park .
ms shawcross says this will help lift the fortunes of the area and create hundreds of jobs for local people .
" the economy on church road is not very good .
some of the shops are shut and the buildings look derelict .
" the piazza would create a natural flow into the triangle and the park , and the underground car park would encourage mothers with young children , and older people to visit . "
i do n't see why we need commercial investment to improve the park melvyn harrison , chairman of the crystal palace foundation the 1960s-built sports centre - if english heritage agrees - would be replaced with a semi-circular construction next to the athletics stadium .
it would be environmentally friendly , powering itself via solar panels and house a new 50m swimming pool .
there are plans for landscaping and making the park generally more child-friendly with play areas and the revival of the city farm which is currently empty .
the largest development of about 140 houses and flats would be in the corner near sydenham hill with the remainder of the homes being sited at the bottom of the park near penge .
none of the homes will be affordable - ms shawcross makes it clear the developments are purely a way of making money .
sensitive issue " the social value wo n't be social housing , " she said , " it will be in improvements to the park . "
melvyn harrison , chairman of the crystal palace foundation , said : " any proposals have to be considered in a controlled and measured way and we will be looking very closely at what has been proposed .
" it 's a very sensitive issue with residents .
" but i do n't see why we need commercial investment to improve the park .
" other parks have been improved without commercialisation but obviously the lda and the greater london authority see it differently . "
a public consultation on the lda 's proposals begins on thursday and lasts until december .
it will be held at the park for two weeks before becoming a road show .

and val shawcross , who is championing the return of the historic crystal palace park to what she calls its ' grand vision ' , is well aware of this .
she admits plans to build shops , cafes , flats and 200 homes on three corners of the south-east london park are controversial but says the money raised would be invested into the rest of the open space .
the london assembly member for southwark and lambeth says the " tatty " park would become a visitor attraction .
" i think what people have got to be realistic about is what we can do for the park and the value of enabling this small amount of housing , " she said .
read the full proposals external link " the community might not want to back that but then actually they lose some money to improving the park 's surfaces and access . "
the london development agency 's -lrb- lda -rrb- proposals for the park are on a huge scale , with a price tag of £ 100m .
the sports centre and athletics accommodation tower block are earmarked to be bulldozed and resituated .
ms shawcross is keen to point out that the actual amount of park land accessible to the public will increase despite the development .
a total of 39 acres will be opened up .
eighteen of these will be " new land " which previously housed buildings or the hard caravan park standings .
the park has been allowed to disintegrate - it 's lost its grand vision val shawcross the rest will be areas which are currently fenced off .
the park was a pay and enter attraction in victorian times and took its name from joseph paxton 's crystal palace which housed the 1851 great exhibition , which was sited there until it burnt down in 1936 .
the park was under the control of bromley council - one of five local authorities which border the park - but regenerating proved too large and expensive a project for it to tackle .
the job was given to the mayor 's business arm , the london development agency .
some local people have called for the 200-acre site to be left alone but ms shawcross says this is not an option .
key plans in pictures " one of the problems is that it 's never been looked at as a whole .
this is a park for south london , not a small council garden . "
another of the key developments would be replacing the gardens in the corner closest to the crystal palace shopping triangle , with a piazza of restaurants and shops , plus about 30 flats and a 150-space underground car park .
ms shawcross says this will help lift the fortunes of the area and create hundreds of jobs for local people .
" the economy on church road is not very good .
some of the shops are shut and the buildings look derelict .
" the piazza would create a natural flow into the triangle and the park , and the underground car park would encourage mothers with young children , and older people to visit . "
i do n't see why we need commercial investment to improve the park melvyn harrison , chairman of the crystal palace foundation the 1960s-built sports centre - if english heritage agrees - would be replaced with a semi-circular construction next to the athletics stadium .
it would be environmentally friendly , powering itself via solar panels and house a new 50m swimming pool .
there are plans for landscaping and making the park generally more child-friendly with play areas and the revival of the city farm which is currently empty .
the largest development of about 140 houses and flats would be in the corner near sydenham hill with the remainder of the homes being sited at the bottom of the park near penge .
none of the homes will be affordable - ms shawcross makes it clear the developments are purely a way of making money .
sensitive issue " the social value wo n't be social housing , " she said , " it will be in improvements to the park . "
melvyn harrison , chairman of the crystal palace foundation , said : " any proposals have to be considered in a controlled and measured way and we will be looking very closely at what has been proposed .
" it 's a very sensitive issue with residents .
" but i do n't see why we need commercial investment to improve the park .
" other parks have been improved without commercialisation but obviously the lda and the greater london authority see it differently . "

the us-based group says travel restrictions by the two countries reflect " an utter disregard for the welfare of families " .
the report says us policy on travel to cuba carries a terrible human cost .
cuba is criticised for " routinely refusing to grant its citizens permission to leave their country " .
it is also taken to task for not allowing those who do leave illegally to return .
restrictions ' necessary ' in this report , human rights watch has roughly equal criticism for the governments of cuba and the us .
it describes the travel restrictions which both countries impose on their respective citizens as inhumane and against internationally recognised principles .
cuba has not commented on this specific report .
in the past it has justified the restrictions it imposes on its citizens ' right to travel as a necessity in the face of us attempts to undermine the government of fidel castro .
human rights watch also has plenty of criticism for us policy on travel to cuba .
last year , the bush administration imposed tougher rules regarding licensed us travel to cuba .
most notably , it limited family visits to once every three years as opposed to the previous policy of once every year .
amongst the report 's detailed examples there are some of cubans living in the us who have been prevented from seeing their dying parents .
human rights watch is calling on the us government to abandon its travel ban on cuba and in the meantime establish humanitarian exceptions .

restrictions ' necessary ' in this report , human rights watch has roughly equal criticism for the governments of cuba and the us .
it describes the travel restrictions which both countries impose on their respective citizens as inhumane and against internationally recognised principles .
cuba has not commented on this specific report .
in the past it has justified the restrictions it imposes on its citizens ' right to travel as a necessity in the face of us attempts to undermine the government of fidel castro .
human rights watch also has plenty of criticism for us policy on travel to cuba .
last year , the bush administration imposed tougher rules regarding licensed us travel to cuba .
most notably , it limited family visits to once every three years as opposed to the previous policy of once every year .
amongst the report 's detailed examples there are some of cubans living in the us who have been prevented from seeing their dying parents .
human rights watch is calling on the us government to abandon its travel ban on cuba and in the meantime establish humanitarian exceptions .

iranian news agencies say the ban was approved by the main decision-making body on cultural affairs , the supreme council of islamic cultural revolution .
the council is headed by the iranian president , mahmoud ahmadinejad .
high-ranking officials of iranian tv and the culture ministry will be charged with implementing the policies .
much may depend on how strictly this ban is interpreted and enforced .
some say it may be an attempt by the new president - who comes from a hardline background - to demonstrate to his conservative supporters that he is upholding the values of iran 's islamic revolution by cracking down on corrupt western values .
foreign films , particularly action and detective films , are shown on iranian television and cinema , although they are already strictly censored for sexual content , alcohol usage and women wearing revealing clothing .
self-censorship fear the new ban could mean that state television , cinemas and arts festivals cut back on the number of foreign films they show .
that would not prevent such films being seen .
iran has a thriving black market in foreign dvds .
and many iranians watch satellite tv , despite the fact it is officially banned .
because the new ban does not apply to iranian-made films , iran 's thriving film industry should theoretically be unaffected .
but some analysts say it could cause nervousness and might tempt some iranian directors to apply self-censorship for fear of closer scrutiny by the authorities .

new prisoners have been sent to jails in england because of a lack of room .
the scale of the problem emerged as a report on swansea prison was published that found some inmates spent 22 hours a day in cells due to overcrowding .
prison inspectors also said support for inmates at risk of suicide was weak but there was excellent drug treatment work and a healthy environment .
a team from her majesty 's inspector of prisons said in their findings released on thursday that many of the issues facing swansea prison were due to overcrowding .
prison managers said that similar issues faced wales ' other prisons at cardiff , prescoed , usk and parc , in bridgend .
swansea 's city centre prison currently houses 425 inmates - the absolute maximum - in accommodation designed for 248 . "
the report recognises quite clearly that swansea is a decent prison " phil taylor , prison governor the report said that in swansea , accommodation was clean , race relations were good , and there was a positive relationship between staff and inmates .
but it also expressed concern about the care of vulnerable prisoners and said support plans for those at risk of suicide were weak .
there have been three deaths in the prison since the start of 2004 - two suicides and one from natural causes , although prison managers said that was relatively low compared with other jails .
the inspectors said there were few opportunities to gain employment skills and at any one time of the day , around half the prisoners were locked in their cells .
on the eve of the report 's publication , the bbc news website was invited to the prison .
governor phil taylor said work was already being done to address many of the inspectors concerns .
inmates in welsh prisons cardiff : 753 usk : 246 prescoed : 157 swansea : 425 parc , bridgend : n / a " the fact that we got such positive aspects in the report with such high numbers -lrb- of inmates -rrb- is a compliment to the establishment but we do not under estimate the value of the report , " he said .
" we are constantly looking at ways we can support vulnerable prisoners so that we can avoid them feeling so desperate they want to take their own lives and i think we do pretty well .
" it -lrb- the report -rrb- recognises quite clearly that swansea is a decent prison . "
inmate scott colombe , who had been at swansea for more than 12 months , told bbc wales that although he had a single cell now , when he first arrived he had to share with another prisoner .
he said : " there 's not really much privacy , especially when you have to go to the toilet with someone else looking on . "
" if you do n't exercise there 's not much to do " inmate scott colombe but he said morale amongst prisoners was good and the staff treated them well .
" it 's ok , i do n't find it that bad but if i had a family i think it would be a lot worse for me , " he said .
john may , operations manager for prisons in wales , said the situation in swansea was on a par with the others with " unprecedented high levels " of inmates .
" the reality is all the prisons in wales are at a very similar place , " he said .
" there is good work in some fairly uninspiring surroundings but finding enough accommodation is a huge problem for us .
" during this week we had two days when all the prisons in wales did not have any spare beds .
" we are not pretending overcrowding is a good idea from anyone 's point of view , especially the prisoner .
i do n't expect it to change any time soon . "

new prisoners have been sent to jails in england because of a lack of room .
the scale of the problem emerged as a report on swansea prison was published that found some inmates spent 22 hours a day in cells due to overcrowding .
prison inspectors also said support for inmates at risk of suicide was weak but there was excellent drug treatment work and a healthy environment .
a team from her majesty 's inspector of prisons said in their findings released on thursday that many of the issues facing swansea prison were due to overcrowding .
prison managers said that similar issues faced wales ' other prisons at cardiff , prescoed , usk and parc , in bridgend .
swansea 's city centre prison currently houses 425 inmates - the absolute maximum - in accommodation designed for 248 .
the report recognises quite clearly that swansea is a decent prison phil taylor , prison governor the report said that in swansea , accommodation was clean , race relations were good , and there was a positive relationship between staff and inmates .
but it also expressed concern about the care of vulnerable prisoners and said support plans for those at risk of suicide were weak .
there have been three deaths in the prison since the start of 2004 - two suicides and one from natural causes , although prison managers said that was relatively low compared with other jails .
the inspectors said there were few opportunities to gain employment skills and at any one time of the day , around half the prisoners were locked in their cells .
on the eve of the report 's publication , the bbc news website was invited to the prison .
governor phil taylor said work was already being done to address many of the inspectors concerns .

" we are constantly looking at ways we can support vulnerable prisoners so that we can avoid them feeling so desperate they want to take their own lives and i think we do pretty well .
" it -lrb- the report -rrb- recognises quite clearly that swansea is a decent prison . "
inmate scott colombe , who had been at swansea for more than 12 months , told bbc wales that although he had a single cell now , when he first arrived he had to share with another prisoner .
he said : " there 's not really much privacy , especially when you have to go to the toilet with someone else looking on . "
if you do n't exercise there 's not much to do inmate scott colombe but he said morale amongst prisoners was good and the staff treated them well .
" it 's ok , i do n't find it that bad but if i had a family i think it would be a lot worse for me , " he said .
john may , operations manager for prisons in wales , said the situation in swansea was on a par with the others with " unprecedented high levels " of inmates .
" the reality is all the prisons in wales are at a very similar place , " he said .
" there is good work in some fairly uninspiring surroundings but finding enough accommodation is a huge problem for us .

the scottish national party has issued the warning because of concern over cold weather and increasing energy costs .
social justice spokeswoman , christine grahame , called on ministers in edinburgh to help ease fuel poverty .
she claimed the death toll among the over 80s had gone up by 46 % between 2001 and 2004 .
ms grahame stressed that she was particularly worried about the plight of pensioners .

it is not a price scots of any age should be paying " christine grahame msp snp social justice spokeswoman " i am deeply concerned that the combination of these factors will lead to a record number of older people dying this coming winter . "
ms grahame said it was up to ministers to ensure that deaths were avoided .
she said : " excess winter deaths at these levels and the clear trends we are seeing suggest ministers in edinburgh are simply failing to ensure adequate protection for some of the most vulnerable groups in our society .
" if they continue with this approach then we will undoubtedly see a sharpening rise in such deaths this coming winter . "

the scottish gas help the aged partnership study found that nearly one in three elderly people turned off their heating in the afternoon .

we are concerned by any rise in excess winter deaths " scottish executive spokesman ms grahame added : " it is disgraceful that in an oil rich country such as scotland , our older people are dying due to cold winters .
" it is not a price scots of any age should be paying . "
however , a scottish executive spokesman said : " we are concerned by any rise in excess winter deaths , but we are working very hard on a number fronts to support elderly and other vulnerable people .
" this includes £ 220m investment so far to insulate more than 218,000 homes and free central heating systems in 57,000 homes . "
the official added : " we propose to extend these programmes beyond next year and to widen their eligibility . "

this is not to suggest there have been no decent playwrights , aside from pinter , since the 1950s .
but it does give rise to the question of which , if any , current playwrights might become household names in years to come .
alongside pinter , the 1950s and 1960s brought a plethora of acclaimed playwrights , including a trio of sirs - david hare , tom stoppard and alan ayckbourn .
but as television and film gained increasing prominence , new playwrights have struggled to enter our national consciousness .
it is not for want of talent , but with the commercial overheads in london 's west end it is increasingly difficult for today 's playwrights to win the international attention .
the west end is the heartbeat of london sonia friedman increasingly , new work has become the sole premise of the subsidised sector , with the national theatre , the royal court and regional theatres reaping the benefits , while the west end is submerged in a sea of tribute musicals and starry revivals .
earlier this week , manchester 's royal exchange theatre announced a playwriting competition promising £ 45,000 to the winning playwright and a fully-staged production .
but sonia friedman is just one of the current crop of west end producers challenging the recent trend for playing it safe in london 's theatreland .
" new producers have to take responsibility for bringing new work to the west end , " says ms friedman , 40 .
" we ca n't always be riding on the coat-tails of subsidised theatres . "
no guarantees success inevitably depends on allying new plays with star turns from celebrities , but there are no guarantees .
" new work in the west end is notoriously difficult to make work , because audiences are less confident about buying into a new play before it opens - and you need strong advances in the west end because it 's so expensive . "
friedman has had critical success with new play shoot the crow " very often , you produce a play in the west end - particularly a new play - because a certain actor is attached to it .
that is the element that drives it forward , as opposed to your passion for the play , " says ms friedman , whose producing credits include madonna in up for grabs in 2002 .
" you make your decision on a commercial basis . "
sir tom courtenay opened the west end production of brian friel 's new play the home place earlier this summer , but it closed early following lukewarm reviews .
nigel planer 's poorly received on the ceiling was similarly short-lived .
" that 's why reviews are so much more important in the west end , " explains ms friedman .
" when a theatre has a successful artistic policy , like the almeida or the donmar warehouse , and tickets are only £ 10 or £ 15 , people will take that risk up front .
in the west end , they do n't . "
but reality tv show the play 's the thing could do for budding playwrights what operatunity did for emerging sopranos .
the show takes its title from william shakespeare 's hamlet due to air on channel 4 next year , the show challenges friedman and her " expert panel " to uncover a new british playwright and open their play in the west end .
so far , the panel - with the help of some 40 readers - have whittled down more than 2,000 entries to just 30 plays .
but debate rages as to what qualities the winning play should have .
" it has to be a play that lives beyond that first cast .
a play that i can imagine being done across the country , in other territories , " says ms friedman .
socially aggressive royal court founder george devine pioneered new work in the late 1950s , in a bid to move theatre out of its safe , middle class confines .
john osborne 's look back in anger was among the first plays to premiere at the london theatre - and his socially aggressive drama set the benchmark for fellow court dramatists including joe orton , david edgar , caryl churchill and sarah kane .
osborne 's look back in anger debuted at the royal court in 1956 next year , the venue celebrates its 50th anniversary amid a fanfare of new works by stoppard and hare .
" i 'm not prepared to work in an environment where we have to accept a status quo that says we ca n't be challenging and radical , " says ms friedman .
" if the west end wants to be a vital force in the next 25 years , we have to nurture the new playwrights - and the new directors . "
" i 'm a creative producer .
i 'm much more interested in creating work from scratch - as opposed to cherry-picking the work that other people do . "

that is the element that drives it forward , as opposed to your passion for the play , " says ms friedman , whose producing credits include madonna in up for grabs in 2002 .
" you make your decision on a commercial basis . "
sir tom courtenay opened the west end production of brian friel 's new play the home place earlier this summer , but it closed early following lukewarm reviews .
nigel planer 's poorly received on the ceiling was similarly short-lived .
" that 's why reviews are so much more important in the west end , " explains ms friedman .
" when a theatre has a successful artistic policy , like the almeida or the donmar warehouse , and tickets are only £ 10 or £ 15 , people will take that risk up front .
in the west end , they do n't . "
but reality tv show the play 's the thing could do for budding playwrights what operatunity did for emerging sopranos .
the show takes its title from william shakespeare 's hamlet due to air on channel 4 next year , the show challenges friedman and her " expert panel " to uncover a new british playwright and open their play in the west end .
so far , the panel - with the help of some 40 readers - have whittled down more than 2,000 entries to just 30 plays .
but debate rages as to what qualities the winning play should have .
" it has to be a play that lives beyond that first cast .
a play that i can imagine being done across the country , in other territories , " says ms friedman .
socially aggressive royal court founder george devine pioneered new work in the late 1950s , in a bid to move theatre out of its safe , middle class confines .
john osborne 's look back in anger was among the first plays to premiere at the london theatre - and his socially aggressive drama set the benchmark for fellow court dramatists including joe orton , david edgar , caryl churchill and sarah kane .
osborne 's look back in anger debuted at the royal court in 1956 next year , the venue celebrates its 50th anniversary amid a fanfare of new works by stoppard and hare .
" i 'm not prepared to work in an environment where we have to accept a status quo that says we ca n't be challenging and radical , " says ms friedman .
" if the west end wants to be a vital force in the next 25 years , we have to nurture the new playwrights - and the new directors . "
" i 'm a creative producer .
i 'm much more interested in creating work from scratch - as opposed to cherry-picking the work that other people do . "
