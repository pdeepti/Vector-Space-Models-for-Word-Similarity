in the country of the reformation , the first pope from poland had strained relations with both catholics and non-catholics in germany . karol jozef wojtyla 's first contact with germany and germans came under the most horrendous circumstances .
he lived with his father in krakow when nazi germany launched world war ii by invading poland .
the future pope said that his father once told him , " i will not live long and would like to be certain before i die that you will commit yourself to god 's service . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii talks to german president johannes rau during their meeting at the vatican , saturday , march 6 , 2004 his father 's will became reality .
in 1943 , he entered an underground seminary in krakow .
in 1946 , one year after the war had ended , one year after poland had regained its independence from the nazi dictatorship , karol jozef wojtyla was ordained .
throughout his life , karol jozef wojtyla refused to begrudge the germans .
instead he wanted to pass on his memories of the nazi terror to the generation that did not have to experience it in order to ensure that such a horror was never repeated .
john paul celebrates german unification wojtyla 's contact with germany remained minimal in the years before he became pope in 1978 .
after taking up the papacy , however , he traveled to the country three times .
and when the berlin wall fell and the federal republic of germany and the german democratic republic -lrb- east germany -rrb- were reunited as a single germany , pope john paul ii rejoiced .
in his third and only visit to a unified germany , he visited the capital berlin in 1996 .
there , john paul ii walked side-by-side with german chancellor helmut kohl through the brandenburg gate and to what was once the inner-german border .
there , he gave a moving speech over the meaning of freedom .

thus , we can justifiably say that the brandenburg gate has become the gate of freedom , " john paul ii told the german people on june 23 , 1996 .
pope viewed cautiously in germany despite his committment to bringing down communism and uniting germany and europe , the pope had a difficult relationship with germans .
protestant germans , who make up about half of the population , and even many catholics are increasingly critical of the vatican 's conservative stance on on birth control , abortion , homosexuality , and aids . many regard the pope 's teachings as out of touch with modern reality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say pope john paul ii is too conservative but he is open to new things - here he is sending an e-mail just as exasperating to germans are the hurdles thrown up by the vatican to prevent a deeper ecumenical understanding .
germans and the papacy generally misunderstand each other , a point which cologne 's conservative cardinal joachim meisner makes .
" in many countries people gratefully take note of the pope 's prophetic power , and even praise it , " meisner said .
" unfortunately , german-speaking countries make the exception . "
another point of conflict is the protection of life .
catholics and indeed most germans applauded when john paul ii criticized the use of force against iraq .
but , when john paul attacked the use of force against unborn children , many catholic germans did n't want to hear it .
the pope 's stance - protection of all humans as well as embryos - may be consistent ; but it 's too inflexible for those who think that unwanted abortions could be avoided if the catholic church would counsel on birth control and better family planning . instead , the vatican banned the counseling service for unwanted pregnancies , something that some representatives in the german catholic church could n't comprehend .

in the country of the reformation , the first pope from poland had strained relations with both catholics and non-catholics in germany . karol jozef wojtyla 's first contact with germany and germans came under the most horrendous circumstances .
he lived with his father in krakow when nazi germany launched world war ii by invading poland .
the future pope said that his father once told him , " i will not live long and would like to be certain before i die that you will commit yourself to god 's service . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii talks to german president johannes rau during their meeting at the vatican , saturday , march 6 , 2004 his father 's will became reality .
in 1943 , he entered an underground seminary in krakow .
in 1946 , one year after the war had ended , one year after poland had regained its independence from the nazi dictatorship , karol jozef wojtyla was ordained .
throughout his life , karol jozef wojtyla refused to begrudge the germans .
instead he wanted to pass on his memories of the nazi terror to the generation that did not have to experience it in order to ensure that such a horror was never repeated .
john paul celebrates german unification wojtyla 's contact with germany remained minimal in the years before he became pope in 1978 .
after taking up the papacy , however , he traveled to the country three times .
and when the berlin wall fell and the federal republic of germany and the german democratic republic -lrb- east germany -rrb- were reunited as a single germany , pope john paul ii rejoiced .
in his third and only visit to a unified germany , he visited the capital berlin in 1996 .
there , john paul ii walked side-by-side with german chancellor helmut kohl through the brandenburg gate and to what was once the inner-german border .
there , he gave a moving speech over the meaning of freedom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul with helmut kohl and eberhard diepgen -lrb- left to right -rrb- standing at the gate that once divided germany " the closed brandenburg gate once stood as a symbol of separation .
when it was finally opened , it became a symbol of unity - and as a symbol of the demand of the german constitution for a united and free germany , determined by free will .
thus , we can justifiably say that the brandenburg gate has become the gate of freedom , " john paul ii told the german people on june 23 , 1996 .
pope viewed cautiously in germany despite his committment to bringing down communism and uniting germany and europe , the pope had a difficult relationship with germans .
protestant germans , who make up about half of the population , and even many catholics are increasingly critical of the vatican 's conservative stance on on birth control , abortion , homosexuality , and aids . many regard the pope 's teachings as out of touch with modern reality .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many say pope john paul ii is too conservative but he is open to new things - here he is sending an e-mail just as exasperating to germans are the hurdles thrown up by the vatican to prevent a deeper ecumenical understanding .
germans and the papacy generally misunderstand each other , a point which cologne 's conservative cardinal joachim meisner makes .
" in many countries people gratefully take note of the pope 's prophetic power , and even praise it , " meisner said .
" unfortunately , german-speaking countries make the exception . "
another point of conflict is the protection of life .
catholics and indeed most germans applauded when john paul ii criticized the use of force against iraq .
but , when john paul attacked the use of force against unborn children , many catholic germans did n't want to hear it .
the pope 's stance - protection of all humans as well as embryos - may be consistent ; but it 's too inflexible for those who think that unwanted abortions could be avoided if the catholic church would counsel on birth control and better family planning . instead , the vatican banned the counseling service for unwanted pregnancies , something that some representatives in the german catholic church could n't comprehend .
other sticking points include the suspension of teaching privileges of some prominent , more liberal german theologians .
despite such decisions that many might understand as discriminatory towards germany , never before have there been so many germans in the college of cardinals - exactly the body that will name john paul 's successor . philipp kreisselmeier -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de john paul ii leaves his mark on europe pope john paul ii played a larger role in current world events than any other pope in history .
in europe , his name will be inextricably tied to the fall of communism in eastern europe .
-lrb- april 2 , 2005 -rrb- too catholic for munich 's airwaves ?
the decision to award a catholic radio station one of munich 's coveted fm frequencies has caused outcry among critics who say the programming is too fundamentalist .

younger germans are taking a greater interest in world war ii but this does not always have positive facets according to the german historian wolfgang wippermann who spoke with dw-world . dw-world : what is the meaning of may 8 for german and world history ?
wolfgang wippermann : may 8 , 1945 is not only an momentous date for german history , but also for world history .
it 's definitely comparable to the reformation , the french revolution and the bolshevik revolution .
it is simply an epochal date in world history .
it was then that a new era began and was the end of a horrendous one - the era of fascism .
in germany the date is often spoken of as a new beginning , a stunde null , that 's to say the country 's " zero hour . "
how do you judge this ?
there was no stunde null like we viewed it .
instead , there was a strong road of continuity , not a restoration .
it was a kind of continuity that revealed itself in the elite before the third reich and also afterwards .
for example , there were more nazis in the foreign office after 1945 than before .
it was wishful thinking to believe that on may 8 , 1945 history ended to a more or less greater extent , that a " zero hour " took place and we were reborn .
that did n't happen .
it must be added , however , that the end of the war or the collapse of the third reich was very important for the collective memory of the germans .
which catastrophe in germany had a greater effect on the country , the political or the moral one ?
the first problem is the term " catastrophe " which friedrich meineke already coined with regard to 1945 in his book " the german catastrophe " in 1946 .
indeed , the end of the war was perceived as a catastrophe for the germans but that was historically completely wrong .
the actual catastrophe was the shoah , the catastrophe that was carried out on the jewish people .
people did n't want to recognize this in germany for a long time .
it was n't until after various historical and political discussions that the true meaning of fascism and the holocaust was recognized : the real catastrophe was the shoah .
how has the view of the second world war and the date may 8 , 1945 changed in germany over the past 60 years ?
there has been a crucial change .
the eighth of may was at one time the day the third reich collapsed , or as people said , the german catastrophe .
there was a long debate as to whether it was the day of liberation or the day of collapse ?
collapse or liberation was a topic of historical-political debates during the 1950 's and 60 's , but most of all in the 70 's and 80 's .
finally , those who called it the day of liberation won the upper hand .
german president richard von weizsäcker made this clear on may 8 , 1985 .
that meant that the important thing was not that it was a german catastrophe but a catastrophe for the jews .
this was a very long , arduous process but one that was concluded positively .
but i must also say that history is not just that which happened .
a historical event is also that which is made of it .
does the german perspective of the second world war conform with that of the world or are there differences ?
there are various controversies that spill beyond borders .
it ca n't be classified as strictly nationally historical .
one thing that is happening in my opinion is that there is no longer a historical-political discussion or one of how to deal with the past .
what 's happening is that may 8 , world war ii , the shoah and the like are being commercialized .
we not only have a historicization but a " knoppization " -lsb- guido knopp is a popular historian who has made numerous documentaries about world war ii for german national television -rsb- of history for commercial purposes .
it has more to do with television ratings and not really with history - knopp 's films are horribly commericialized .
that is the negative side of the awakened interest in history , which on the other hand is positive .
i view it negatively and think it 's also possibly dangerous that history is being commercialized . martin schrader interviewed wolfgang wippermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the end of german jewry " " auschwitz is a symbol of nazi atrocities but the murders happened in many places over a long period of time , " says w. michael blumenthal , director of the jewish museum berlin in a dw-world interview .

indeed , the end of the war was perceived as a catastrophe for the germans but that was historically completely wrong .
the actual catastrophe was the shoah , the catastrophe that was carried out on the jewish people .
people did n't want to recognize this in germany for a long time .
it was n't until after various historical and political discussions that the true meaning of fascism and the holocaust was recognized : the real catastrophe was the shoah .
how has the view of the second world war and the date may 8 , 1945 changed in germany over the past 60 years ?
there has been a crucial change .
the eighth of may was at one time the day the third reich collapsed , or as people said , the german catastrophe .
there was a long debate as to whether it was the day of liberation or the day of collapse ?
collapse or liberation was a topic of historical-political debates during the 1950 's and 60 's , but most of all in the 70 's and 80 's .
finally , those who called it the day of liberation won the upper hand .
german president richard von weizsäcker made this clear on may 8 , 1985 .
that meant that the important thing was not that it was a german catastrophe but a catastrophe for the jews .
this was a very long , arduous process but one that was concluded positively .
but i must also say that history is not just that which happened .
a historical event is also that which is made of it .
does the german perspective of the second world war conform with that of the world or are there differences ?
there are various controversies that spill beyond borders .
it ca n't be classified as strictly nationally historical .
one thing that is happening in my opinion is that there is no longer a historical-political discussion or one of how to deal with the past .
what 's happening is that may 8 , world war ii , the shoah and the like are being commercialized .
we not only have a historicization but a " knoppization " -lsb- guido knopp is a popular historian who has made numerous documentaries about world war ii for german national television -rsb- of history for commercial purposes .
it has more to do with television ratings and not really with history - knopp 's films are horribly commericialized .
that is the negative side of the awakened interest in history , which on the other hand is positive .
i view it negatively and think it 's also possibly dangerous that history is being commercialized . martin schrader interviewed wolfgang wippermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the end of german jewry " " auschwitz is a symbol of nazi atrocities but the murders happened in many places over a long period of time , " says w. michael blumenthal , director of the jewish museum berlin in a dw-world interview .

though their names are among the many being whispered in the vatican hallways as possible papal successors , prominent advisors all lose their powers upon the pope 's death and the cardinal camerlengo or chamberlain , cardinal eduardo martinez somalo , becomes the temporary head of the church .
the pope 's death immediately sets into motion a historic chain of events to elect a successor and prevents any risk of division in the roman catholic church .
successor elected in complete secrecy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prayers of millions are with john paul ii whoever takes over the throne in rome and the 1.1 billion member catholic church is elected 15 to 20 days after the pope 's death in a secret conclave meeting of up to 120 cardinals under the age of 80 in the vatican 's sistine chapel under michelangelo 's awesome fresco of the last judgment , according to a law adopted in 1975 .
opinions are split as to whether the current 117 such cardinals , nearly 100 of whom were appointed by john paul ii , will continue karol wojtyla 's conservative legacy or try to reflect the profound changes that have taken place in the church in choosing a successor , who is most likely to come from among the cardinals themselves .

if this were to happen , strong candidates would include archbishops dionigi tettamanzi , 70 , of milan , angelo scola , 63 , of venice , tarcisio bertone , 70 , of genoa , angelo sodano , 77 , and battista re , 71 .

church on rise in africa , south america if the cardinals decide on a non-italian candidate , the field is wide open .
with church congregations rising across africa , southern asia and latin america , observers see a global church that is increasingly orientated towards the south and away from its european heartland .
africa , where the church is facing competition from islam and other confessions , has a strong candidate in cardinal francis arinze from nigeria , 72 , who heads the vatican congregation for divine worship .
there are also four possible candidates from latin america .
by church estimates the number of catholics in africa has nearly doubled , from 50 million to 90 million , in the past 20 years .
more than two thirds of catholics are now estimated to come from the " global south . "

opinions are split as to whether the current 117 such cardinals , nearly 100 of whom were appointed by john paul ii , will continue karol wojtyla 's conservative legacy or try to reflect the profound changes that have taken place in the church in choosing a successor , who is most likely to come from among the cardinals themselves .

younger germans are taking a greater interest in world war ii but this does not always have positive facets according to the german historian wolfgang wippermann who spoke with dw-world . dw-world : what is the meaning of may 8 for german and world history ?
wolfgang wippermann : may 8 , 1945 is not only an momentous date for german history , but also for world history .
it 's definitely comparable to the reformation , the french revolution and the bolshevik revolution .
it is simply an epochal date in world history .
it was then that a new era began and was the end of a horrendous one - the era of fascism .
in germany the date is often spoken of as a new beginning , a stunde null , that 's to say the country 's " zero hour . "
how do you judge this ?
there was no stunde null like we viewed it .
instead , there was a strong road of continuity , not a restoration .
it was a kind of continuity that revealed itself in the elite before the third reich and also afterwards .
for example , there were more nazis in the foreign office after 1945 than before .
it was wishful thinking to believe that on may 8 , 1945 history ended to a more or less greater extent , that a " zero hour " took place and we were reborn .
that did n't happen .
it must be added , however , that the end of the war or the collapse of the third reich was very important for the collective memory of the germans .
which catastrophe in germany had a greater effect on the country , the political or the moral one ?
the first problem is the term " catastrophe " which friedrich meineke already coined with regard to 1945 in his book " the german catastrophe " in 1946 .
indeed , the end of the war was perceived as a catastrophe for the germans but that was historically completely wrong .
the actual catastrophe was the shoah , the catastrophe that was carried out on the jewish people .
people did n't want to recognize this in germany for a long time .
it was n't until after various historical and political discussions that the true meaning of fascism and the holocaust was recognized : the real catastrophe was the shoah .
how has the view of the second world war and the date may 8 , 1945 changed in germany over the past 60 years ?
there has been a crucial change .
the eighth of may was at one time the day the third reich collapsed , or as people said , the german catastrophe .
there was a long debate as to whether it was the day of liberation or the day of collapse ?
collapse or liberation was a topic of historical-political debates during the 1950 's and 60 's , but most of all in the 70 's and 80 's .
finally , those who called it the day of liberation won the upper hand .
german president richard von weizsäcker made this clear on may 8 , 1985 .
that meant that the important thing was not that it was a german catastrophe but a catastrophe for the jews .
this was a very long , arduous process but one that was concluded positively .
but i must also say that history is not just that which happened .
a historical event is also that which is made of it .
does the german perspective of the second world war conform with that of the world or are there differences ?
there are various controversies that spill beyond borders .
it ca n't be classified as strictly nationally historical .
one thing that is happening in my opinion is that there is no longer a historical-political discussion or one of how to deal with the past .
what 's happening is that may 8 , world war ii , the shoah and the like are being commercialized .
we not only have a historicization but a " knoppization " -lsb- guido knopp is a popular historian who has made numerous documentaries about world war ii for german national television -rsb- of history for commercial purposes .

younger germans are taking a greater interest in world war ii but this does not always have positive facets according to the german historian wolfgang wippermann who spoke with dw-world . dw-world : what is the meaning of may 8 for german and world history ?
wolfgang wippermann : may 8 , 1945 is not only an momentous date for german history , but also for world history .
it 's definitely comparable to the reformation , the french revolution and the bolshevik revolution .
it is simply an epochal date in world history .
it was then that a new era began and was the end of a horrendous one - the era of fascism .
in germany the date is often spoken of as a new beginning , a stunde null , that 's to say the country 's " zero hour . "
how do you judge this ?
there was no stunde null like we viewed it .
instead , there was a strong road of continuity , not a restoration .
it was a kind of continuity that revealed itself in the elite before the third reich and also afterwards .
for example , there were more nazis in the foreign office after 1945 than before .
it was wishful thinking to believe that on may 8 , 1945 history ended to a more or less greater extent , that a " zero hour " took place and we were reborn .
that did n't happen .
it must be added , however , that the end of the war or the collapse of the third reich was very important for the collective memory of the germans .
which catastrophe in germany had a greater effect on the country , the political or the moral one ?
the first problem is the term " catastrophe " which friedrich meineke already coined with regard to 1945 in his book " the german catastrophe " in 1946 .
indeed , the end of the war was perceived as a catastrophe for the germans but that was historically completely wrong .
the actual catastrophe was the shoah , the catastrophe that was carried out on the jewish people .
people did n't want to recognize this in germany for a long time .
it was n't until after various historical and political discussions that the true meaning of fascism and the holocaust was recognized : the real catastrophe was the shoah .
how has the view of the second world war and the date may 8 , 1945 changed in germany over the past 60 years ?
there has been a crucial change .
the eighth of may was at one time the day the third reich collapsed , or as people said , the german catastrophe .
there was a long debate as to whether it was the day of liberation or the day of collapse ?
collapse or liberation was a topic of historical-political debates during the 1950 's and 60 's , but most of all in the 70 's and 80 's .
finally , those who called it the day of liberation won the upper hand .
german president richard von weizsäcker made this clear on may 8 , 1985 .
that meant that the important thing was not that it was a german catastrophe but a catastrophe for the jews .
this was a very long , arduous process but one that was concluded positively .
but i must also say that history is not just that which happened .
a historical event is also that which is made of it .
does the german perspective of the second world war conform with that of the world or are there differences ?
there are various controversies that spill beyond borders .
it ca n't be classified as strictly nationally historical .
one thing that is happening in my opinion is that there is no longer a historical-political discussion or one of how to deal with the past .
what 's happening is that may 8 , world war ii , the shoah and the like are being commercialized .
we not only have a historicization but a " knoppization " -lsb- guido knopp is a popular historian who has made numerous documentaries about world war ii for german national television -rsb- of history for commercial purposes .
it has more to do with television ratings and not really with history - knopp 's films are horribly commericialized .

instead , there was a strong road of continuity , not a restoration .
it was a kind of continuity that revealed itself in the elite before the third reich and also afterwards .
for example , there were more nazis in the foreign office after 1945 than before .
it was wishful thinking to believe that on may 8 , 1945 history ended to a more or less greater extent , that a " zero hour " took place and we were reborn .
that did n't happen .
it must be added , however , that the end of the war or the collapse of the third reich was very important for the collective memory of the germans .
which catastrophe in germany had a greater effect on the country , the political or the moral one ?
the first problem is the term " catastrophe " which friedrich meineke already coined with regard to 1945 in his book " the german catastrophe " in 1946 .
indeed , the end of the war was perceived as a catastrophe for the germans but that was historically completely wrong .
the actual catastrophe was the shoah , the catastrophe that was carried out on the jewish people .
people did n't want to recognize this in germany for a long time .
it was n't until after various historical and political discussions that the true meaning of fascism and the holocaust was recognized : the real catastrophe was the shoah .
how has the view of the second world war and the date may 8 , 1945 changed in germany over the past 60 years ?
there has been a crucial change .
the eighth of may was at one time the day the third reich collapsed , or as people said , the german catastrophe .
there was a long debate as to whether it was the day of liberation or the day of collapse ?
collapse or liberation was a topic of historical-political debates during the 1950 's and 60 's , but most of all in the 70 's and 80 's .
finally , those who called it the day of liberation won the upper hand .
german president richard von weizsäcker made this clear on may 8 , 1985 .
that meant that the important thing was not that it was a german catastrophe but a catastrophe for the jews .
this was a very long , arduous process but one that was concluded positively .
but i must also say that history is not just that which happened .
a historical event is also that which is made of it .
does the german perspective of the second world war conform with that of the world or are there differences ?
there are various controversies that spill beyond borders .
it ca n't be classified as strictly nationally historical .
one thing that is happening in my opinion is that there is no longer a historical-political discussion or one of how to deal with the past .
what 's happening is that may 8 , world war ii , the shoah and the like are being commercialized .
we not only have a historicization but a " knoppization " -lsb- guido knopp is a popular historian who has made numerous documentaries about world war ii for german national television -rsb- of history for commercial purposes .
it has more to do with television ratings and not really with history - knopp 's films are horribly commericialized .
that is the negative side of the awakened interest in history , which on the other hand is positive .
i view it negatively and think it 's also possibly dangerous that history is being commercialized . martin schrader interviewed wolfgang wippermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the end of german jewry " " auschwitz is a symbol of nazi atrocities but the murders happened in many places over a long period of time , " says w. michael blumenthal , director of the jewish museum berlin in a dw-world interview .

opinions are split as to whether the current 117 such cardinals , nearly 100 of whom were appointed by john paul ii , will continue karol wojtyla 's conservative legacy or try to reflect the profound changes that have taken place in the church in choosing a successor , who is most likely to come from among the cardinals themselves .

younger germans are taking a greater interest in world war ii but this does not always have positive facets according to the german historian wolfgang wippermann who spoke with dw-world . dw-world : what is the meaning of may 8 for german and world history ?
wolfgang wippermann : may 8 , 1945 is not only an momentous date for german history , but also for world history .
it 's definitely comparable to the reformation , the french revolution and the bolshevik revolution .
it is simply an epochal date in world history .
it was then that a new era began and was the end of a horrendous one - the era of fascism .
in germany the date is often spoken of as a new beginning , a stunde null , that 's to say the country 's " zero hour . "
how do you judge this ?
there was no stunde null like we viewed it .
instead , there was a strong road of continuity , not a restoration .
it was a kind of continuity that revealed itself in the elite before the third reich and also afterwards .
for example , there were more nazis in the foreign office after 1945 than before .
it was wishful thinking to believe that on may 8 , 1945 history ended to a more or less greater extent , that a " zero hour " took place and we were reborn .
that did n't happen .
it must be added , however , that the end of the war or the collapse of the third reich was very important for the collective memory of the germans .
which catastrophe in germany had a greater effect on the country , the political or the moral one ?
the first problem is the term " catastrophe " which friedrich meineke already coined with regard to 1945 in his book " the german catastrophe " in 1946 .
indeed , the end of the war was perceived as a catastrophe for the germans but that was historically completely wrong .
the actual catastrophe was the shoah , the catastrophe that was carried out on the jewish people .
people did n't want to recognize this in germany for a long time .
it was n't until after various historical and political discussions that the true meaning of fascism and the holocaust was recognized : the real catastrophe was the shoah .
how has the view of the second world war and the date may 8 , 1945 changed in germany over the past 60 years ?
there has been a crucial change .
the eighth of may was at one time the day the third reich collapsed , or as people said , the german catastrophe .
there was a long debate as to whether it was the day of liberation or the day of collapse ?
collapse or liberation was a topic of historical-political debates during the 1950 's and 60 's , but most of all in the 70 's and 80 's .
finally , those who called it the day of liberation won the upper hand .
german president richard von weizsäcker made this clear on may 8 , 1985 .
that meant that the important thing was not that it was a german catastrophe but a catastrophe for the jews .
this was a very long , arduous process but one that was concluded positively .
but i must also say that history is not just that which happened .
a historical event is also that which is made of it .
does the german perspective of the second world war conform with that of the world or are there differences ?
there are various controversies that spill beyond borders .
it ca n't be classified as strictly nationally historical .
one thing that is happening in my opinion is that there is no longer a historical-political discussion or one of how to deal with the past .
what 's happening is that may 8 , world war ii , the shoah and the like are being commercialized .
we not only have a historicization but a " knoppization " -lsb- guido knopp is a popular historian who has made numerous documentaries about world war ii for german national television -rsb- of history for commercial purposes .
it has more to do with television ratings and not really with history - knopp 's films are horribly commericialized .
that is the negative side of the awakened interest in history , which on the other hand is positive .
i view it negatively and think it 's also possibly dangerous that history is being commercialized . martin schrader interviewed wolfgang wippermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the end of german jewry " " auschwitz is a symbol of nazi atrocities but the murders happened in many places over a long period of time , " says w. michael blumenthal , director of the jewish museum berlin in a dw-world interview .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.04.2005 plenty of variables in papal succession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are more than enough pontifical candidates to choose from age , nationality and tradition all play a role in the growing speculation about the next man who will take over as head of the roman catholic church . ratzinger , battista re and angelo sodano are just three of the names of the many high-ranking vatican figures who are thought to have serious chances at becoming the roman catholic church 's next pontiff .
though their names are among the many being whispered in the vatican hallways as possible papal successors , prominent advisors all lose their powers upon the pope 's death and the cardinal camerlengo or chamberlain , cardinal eduardo martinez somalo , becomes the temporary head of the church .
the pope 's death immediately sets into motion a historic chain of events to elect a successor and prevents any risk of division in the roman catholic church .
successor elected in complete secrecy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prayers of millions are with john paul ii whoever takes over the throne in rome and the 1.1 billion member catholic church is elected 15 to 20 days after the pope 's death in a secret conclave meeting of up to 120 cardinals under the age of 80 in the vatican 's sistine chapel under michelangelo 's awesome fresco of the last judgment , according to a law adopted in 1975 .
opinions are split as to whether the current 117 such cardinals , nearly 100 of whom were appointed by john paul ii , will continue karol wojtyla 's conservative legacy or try to reflect the profound changes that have taken place in the church in choosing a successor , who is most likely to come from among the cardinals themselves .
age and nationality key issues if the cardinals are reasonably unanimous about the policies they want the church to follow , they are likely to elect a young man to carry out these policies far into the future .
if they can not agree on policies , they are more likely to choose an elderly candidate as a temporary measure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii legacy will be one of conservative orthodoxy under john paul ii , the college of cardinals has become so internationalized and decentralized that the next pope could come from anywhere in the world , although there is a powerful sentiment to return to tradition and elect an italian .
if this were to happen , strong candidates would include archbishops dionigi tettamanzi , 70 , of milan , angelo scola , 63 , of venice , tarcisio bertone , 70 , of genoa , angelo sodano , 77 , and battista re , 71 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith german cardinal joseph ratzinger -lrb- photo -rrb- , 77 , head of the vatican 's congregation for the doctrine of the faith , is also seen as a potential pontiff .
church on rise in africa , south america if the cardinals decide on a non-italian candidate , the field is wide open .
with church congregations rising across africa , southern asia and latin america , observers see a global church that is increasingly orientated towards the south and away from its european heartland .
africa , where the church is facing competition from islam and other confessions , has a strong candidate in cardinal francis arinze from nigeria , 72 , who heads the vatican congregation for divine worship .
there are also four possible candidates from latin america .
by church estimates the number of catholics in africa has nearly doubled , from 50 million to 90 million , in the past 20 years .
more than two thirds of catholics are now estimated to come from the " global south . "
holy spirit said to guide decision in the past , the cardinal electors had to live in frugal quarters in the palace itself , but this time they will stay in hotel-style rooms in a vatican hostelry called santa martha house .
the staff assigned to serve them , including a doctor , a cook and several nuns , are sworn to secrecy on pain of excommunication from the church .
a key factor often ignored by outsiders is that the cardinals believe that the invisible presence of the holy spirit is with them in the sistine chapel guiding their decision . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de john paul ii : passing of a papal giant the vatican announced saturday evening that the pope died at 2027 cet .

it ca n't be classified as strictly nationally historical .
one thing that is happening in my opinion is that there is no longer a historical-political discussion or one of how to deal with the past .
what 's happening is that may 8 , world war ii , the shoah and the like are being commercialized .
we not only have a historicization but a " knoppization " -lsb- guido knopp is a popular historian who has made numerous documentaries about world war ii for german national television -rsb- of history for commercial purposes .
it has more to do with television ratings and not really with history - knopp 's films are horribly commericialized .
that is the negative side of the awakened interest in history , which on the other hand is positive .
i view it negatively and think it 's also possibly dangerous that history is being commercialized . martin schrader interviewed wolfgang wippermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the end of german jewry " " auschwitz is a symbol of nazi atrocities but the murders happened in many places over a long period of time , " says w. michael blumenthal , director of the jewish museum berlin in a dw-world interview .

his far-reaching influence , particularly in the developing world , has been blamed for failing to prevent the spread of hiv / aids . he maintained throughout his papacy that the roman catholic church believed abstinence and fidelity within marriage , and not condoms , were the best way to stop the spread of hiv / aids , a message seen by health organizations in particular as an irresponsible one . " the holy see ... believes prevention through education about the sacredness of life and the correct practice of sexuality , that is chastity and faithfulness , is necessary above all other things in order to prevent this disease responsibly , " the pontiff said during one of his last visits abroad in spain in january . the catholic church opposes condoms in all except the rarest of circumstances because they are a form of contraception , which it believes prevents the god-given gift of life .
the pope held the church 's hard line that promoting the use of condoms to fight the spread of aids fostered what he saw as immoral and hedonistic lifestyles and behavior that will only contribute to its spread .
there were even reports that the church was sending out messages in africa that condoms actually caused hiv / aids . the pope 's stance on same-sex relationships was also a source of conflict .
the pope referred to homosexuality as " part of a new ideology of evil , perhaps more insidious and hidden , which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man . "
he was staunchly opposed to gay marriage and publicly expressed his concerns that governments around the world were being put under pressure to legalize same-sex unions . gay rights groups accuse pope of complicity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter tatchell , of gay human rights group outrage , said in a statement in the wake of the pope 's death : " history will judge the pope harshly .
his opposition to the use of condoms to prevent the spread of hiv has condemned millions of people to die an agonizing , needless death . " " millions of children in developing countries are orphans ; having lost their parents to aids because of the pope ’ s anti-condom dogma , " tatchell added .
" pope john paul ii waged a ceaseless war against the human rights of women and gay people ; opposing the right of women to control their own fertility ; blocking women ’ s equality in the church ; and endorsing state-sponsored discrimination against lesbians and gay men . "
many hope for a new liberal pontiff gay catholic group rainbow sash hoped the next pope would take a more liberal view on homosexuality .
" there 's a lot of gays and lesbians out there who have a strong faith and a strong commitment to the church and they are still continually cut out of the loop , " spokesman george barbary said in the group 's own statement .
" that 's an important message that 's been lost and one can only hope for change . "
the polish pontiff was also staunch defender of traditional church policies on women , refusing to consider ordaining them as priests , enforcing contraception decrees and opposing abortion . " a fifth-century pope in terms of who women are " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gisela forster , left , and christine mayr-lumetzberger wear white robes as they bear a figure of pope john paul ii. during a protest campaign against the threat of being excommunicated by the vatican in munich , southern germany , july 22 , 2002 .
they are two of the seven women who were ordained as priests by argentine bishop romulo braschi in defiance of the ban of catholic church on female clergy .
the pope excommunicated the seven women monday , aug .
5 , 2002 .
" he will go down in history as a pope who did n't understand and who was n't friendly to women , " frances kissling , president of the liberal washington d.c.-based activist group catholics for a free choice , said of john paul in a statement .
" he could n't have slammed the door shut more loudly on the question of the ordination of women .
he will go down as a fifth-century pope in terms of who women are . " the vatican was rounded on by women in 2004 for issuing a long-awaited document on men and women that charged that feminists were " adversaries of men " who undermined families and paved the way for acceptance of gay marriage . parallels between abortion and holocaust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actresses whoopi goldberg , right , and christine lahti , left , yell at anti-abortion demonstrators in washington , sunday , april 25 , 2004 , during an abortion rights rally and march .
the day , which focused on protecting women 's reproductive rights , included men and women from across the country along with activists from nearly 60 countries .
the pope 's views on abortion may have endeared himself to the christian right in the united states but angered and dismayed many others around the world .
john paul accused governments which allowed abortion of committing murder on a huge scale , even at one stage drawing parallels between abortion and the holocaust . " there is still , however , a legal extermination of human beings who have been conceived but not yet born , " the pope wrote in his book memory and identity .
" and this time , we are talking about an extermination which has been allowed by nothing less than democratically elected parliaments . " pedophile priest problem tainted papacy pope john paul also presided over one of the most damaging scandals that the catholic church has had to face in modern times : pedophile priests .
scandals , resignations , confessions and expulsions rocked the church in the united states , while similar cases came to light across europe . some critics accused the pope of heading a cover-up .
the catholic church has always been reluctant to make sexual abuse problems public , preferring to deal with the issue internally , or as many believe , not deal with it at all .
critics accused the church of moving pedophile priests between parishes instead of dismissing them which was no solution to the problem .
the pope responded by declaring a policy of zero tolerance for priests found guilty of pedophilia . staunchly opposed to euthanasia the pope was also scathing in his views on euthanasia .
on one visit to the netherlands , the pope chose an appearance at the dutch parliament to condemn the country 's policy on assisted suicide and called for all dutch catholics to uphold the church 's view : " the holy see has made known its clear position and invites catholics in the netherlands always to show their absolute respect for human life , from conception to natural death , " the pope said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recently , just shortly before his health took a fatal turn for the worst , the pope called the doctors , campaigners and government officials who were instrumental in allowing brain-dead american terri schiavo to die " murderers " . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gay groups blast “ cardinal mistake ” to fight love the vatican has slammed same-sex unions as " deviant " and a threat to society in a controversial document .

dw-world looks at the key steps for the next several days . immediately after the pope has passed away , a document known as the apostolic constitution drafted by john paul ii himself in 1996 enters into effect .
at this point , the pope ’ s camerlengo -lrb- chamberlain -rrb- verifies the pontiff ’ s death by calling him by his christian name three times .
if there is no response , the chamberlain declares “ the pope is truly dead . ” the confirmation used to be accompanied by the chamberlain tapping the pope ’ s forehead three times with a small silver hammer , but the tradition fell into disuse after pope john xxiii ’ s death in 1963 .
the vatican follows a strict protocol for dealing with the death of a pope .
word is passed through the church ’ s civil service – the curia – and foreign ambassadors and heads of state are informed officially .
vatican radio then flashes news of his death around the world .
in many cities , churches ring their bells to announce the death .
john paul ii ’ s body was then removed from his apartment , which was then locked and sealed .
a small ceremony takes place during which the pope ’ s fisherman ’ s ring and papal seal are broken .
today it is a symbolic act , but historically it was designed to prevent impersonation and forgery . no images or recordings of any kind are permitted to be taken apart from portraits of the pope after his corpse has been suitably prepared to the satisfaction of the camerlengo , cardinal eduardo martinez somalo .
bildunterschrift : many thousands of people pray in a floodlit st. peter 's square at the vatican burial procedure each pope is able to specify his own funeral arrangements .
this time , the vatican will be working to requests drawn up by john paul ii in 1996 . according to experts , the pope ’ s body is likely to be embalmed and then exposed for the veneration of the faithful – most likely in st. peter ’ s basilica . tradition calls for nine days of mourning during which there is a papal interregnum , or interval during which the catholic church is without a spiritual leader .
burial occurs four to six days after death – between wednesday and friday in the case of john paul ii .
the italian news agency ansa , however , reported that the interment would not take place before thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. peter 's basilica in rome the funeral service will take place in st. peter ’ s and heads of state and government as well as religious leaders from around the world will attend . the pope is expected to be buried alongside his immediate predecessors in the crypt under the main altar of st. peter 's basilica .
there have been rumors that john paul ii wanted to be buried in poland , but experts say this is unlikely . how is a successor chosen ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only those cardinals under age 80 may vote for the next pope the election of a new pope does not begin until 15 days after the death of a pontiff .
in the meantime , cardinals from around the world begin arriving at the vatican to participate in a centuries-old ritual called the conclave -lrb- from the latin cum clave meaning “ with key ” -rrb- . those cardinals involved in electing the new pope must be under 80 .
there are 117 eligible to vote for john paul ii ’ s successor .
before the conclave , coalition-builders begin forging alliances .
senior cardinals who may themselves have little chance of becoming pope can still exert a considerable influence over others . on the day the conclave begins , the cardinals move in procession into the sistine chapel , where they will have the option of holding an initial ballot on the first day .
this ballot often serves to gauge the level of support for various candidates .
on the next day the voting process begins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly-elected pope john paul ii raises his arms in greeting the crowd from the balcony of st. peter 's basilica on oct .
16 , 1978 throughout the entire conclave , the cardinals are sequestered in the vatican without outside contact until they choose a new pope .
a two-thirds-plus-one majority is needed for a successful election , otherwise the vote is repeated .
if the right percentage is not met after 12 to 13 days , a simple majority vote may be imposed .
cardinals can not vote for themselves and may be eliminated from consideration if they campaign for support .
until a successor has been elected , there will be four ballots a day .
the ballot papers are burned in an old stove after every second vote .
different chemicals are mixed in to produce black smoke for an inconclusive vote or white smoke for a successful vote , a signal to the public that a new pope has been chosen .
the pope-elect that emerges from the voting is asked whether he accepts becoming the supreme pontiff .
if he answer is yes , he is asked what name he wishes to take .
he then goes to the room of tears , a small room next to the sistine chapel , where he dresses himself in white papal robes , before returning to the conclave to sit near the altar and have a new fisherman ’ s ring put on his finger .
then cardinals then file by to pay homage to the man who from that point on will be considered christ ’ s representative on earth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conclave will convene in the sistine chapel under michelangelo 's " last judgement " the senior cardinal deacon , at the moment chilean cardinal jorge medina estevez , will then step onto the central loggia of st. peter ’ s basilica to proclaim “ habemus papam ” – we have a pope – and the new pontiff will appear on the balcony to deliver his first apostolic blessing to the world . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de john paul ii : passing of a papal giant the vatican announced saturday evening that the pope died at 2027 cet .

an african pontiff ?
how about latin america or india ? no one knows for sure and those who might have an idea - the cardinals who actually choose the next leader of the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics - certainly are n't giving much away . nevertheless the process is underway , triggered automatically by the death saturday of the conservative 84-year-old pope john paul ii who had headed the catholic church since his own election in 1978 . no doubt the impending election will be on their minds when cardinals hold their first congregation monday to begin planning the pontiff 's funeral .
however , the conclave at which cardinals choose a successor must not start until at least two weeks after a pope 's death , but no later than 20 days . one of the few to have talked about the succession , cardinal francis george of the chicago archdiocese , urged the next pope not to make radical changes .
" people think things are up for grabs that are n't up for grabs , " he told a press conference saturday after a memorial mass .
however , he admitted , " we may need a different kind of pope . " in a possible indication of his thinking , he said that although there were good reasons to elect a pope from africa , asia or latin america , he would have to be " acceptable to the romans .
he should speak italian . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who , if any , of the top vatican cardinals will get the job ?
clockwise from top left : vatican secretary of state italian cardinal angelo sodano , german cardinal joseph ratzinger , italian cardinal giovanni battista re , colombian cardinal alfonso lopez trujillo , italian cardinal camillo ruini , us cardinal james stafford .
some vatican insiders think cardinals will likely return to a safe italian candidate - john paul ii was the first non-italian pontiff in 455 years .
" i do n't think the college of electors will risk electing a foreigner .
the italians are the inner circle , " one said under cover of anonymity . a return to italian type in that case , the front-runner could be cardinal dionigi tettamanzi , who as archbishop of milan oversees the most populous diocese in europe .
aged 71 , he is seen as an intellectual , a pastor and someone who would have new ideas . another italian possible is angelo scola , patriarch or archbishop of venice who at 63 counts as one of the church 's younger set . a moderate , he is thought likely to have the backing of opus dei , a highly conservative grouping which has several european and latin american cardinals among its supporters . a south or central american pope ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : away from italy , potential candidates are oscar andres rodriguez maradiaga , the 62-year-old honduran cardinal who has campaigned against poverty ; claudio hummes , archbishop of sao paulo ; and dario castrillon hoyos of colombia . hummes has distanced himself from the terms progressive and conservative and prefers to maintain a strong personal conviction on issues regardless of where they fall in the two camps .
hoyos was responsible for steering the latin american church away from controversial liberation theology and was rewarded by the pope , who appointed him head of the powerful congregation for the clergy , the vatican department which deals directly with the world 's priests . also in the running could be jorge mario bergoglio , the archbishop of buenos aires .
a man of humility who lives a simple existence , bergoglio is an advocate of a traditional and spiritual approach to the role of archbishop .
he once insisted that the entire church of argentina wear garments of public penance for sins committed during the county 's military dictatorship .
a member of the jesuit order , this fact may play against him as the order is supposed to renounce church awards and pledge only to serve the pope , not become one . an indian or african holy father ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian catholics will be praying for pope john paul ii and wondering if one of their won will take his place .
ivan dias , the 69-year-old archbishop of bombay , carries the best hopes of the indian sub-continent .
while an indian national , dias spent most of his life serving as a diplomat for the church around the world before returning home to become bombay 's archbishop .
a fluent multilinguist , dias is a conservative among a large number of more reformist bishops in the asian church . nigeria 's francis arinze is regarded by many as the best non-italian bet .
a conservative , he would become the second african pope after gelasius i in the late fifth century .
he has been the catholic church 's point man for relations with islam , an important factor considering the high profile growth rate of that religion .
arinze is currently the head of the vatican department for divine worship . factors that may influence the cardinals range from policy - conservative or liberal , bridge-builder or doctrinaire - to the mundane , such as whether someone might be a good bureaucrat running the huge vatican machinery but less gifted as a pastor in the field . another element is age .
will they go for someone young to drive the church forward for the foreseeable future at a time of declining belief in god ? french poll favors " more progressive " pope a poll sunday in the daily le paris ien found 53 percent of french people in favor of a " more progressive " pope than john paul ii , while 27 percent wanted continuity and only 13 percent a more traditional successor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinals attend a mass for the late pope john paul ii celebrated by the vatican secretary of state , cardinal angelo sodano on the steps of st. peter 's basilica at the vatican on sunday .
do n't expect any public jockeying by the cardinals , however .
rules say they must abstain under pain of excommunication from any form of agreement or promise that would influence their vote , and they are not allowed to vote for themselves . george , the archbishop of chicago , said he expected debate to be heated but not to last more than a week .
" i think we 'll all be cordial but i expect there will be great differences of opinion , " he said . both john paul ii and his immediate predecessor were compromise candidates who emerged because of deadlocks over cardinals who had initially seemed more promising when the conclaves got under way . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de plenty of variables in papal succession age , nationality and tradition all play a role in the growing speculation about the next man who will take over as head of the roman catholic church .

dw-world looks at the key steps for the next several days . immediately after the pope has passed away , a document known as the apostolic constitution drafted by john paul ii himself in 1996 enters into effect .
at this point , the pope ’ s camerlengo -lrb- chamberlain -rrb- verifies the pontiff ’ s death by calling him by his christian name three times .
if there is no response , the chamberlain declares “ the pope is truly dead . ” the confirmation used to be accompanied by the chamberlain tapping the pope ’ s forehead three times with a small silver hammer , but the tradition fell into disuse after pope john xxiii ’ s death in 1963 .
the vatican follows a strict protocol for dealing with the death of a pope .
word is passed through the church ’ s civil service – the curia – and foreign ambassadors and heads of state are informed officially .
vatican radio then flashes news of his death around the world .
in many cities , churches ring their bells to announce the death .
john paul ii ’ s body was then removed from his apartment , which was then locked and sealed .
a small ceremony takes place during which the pope ’ s fisherman ’ s ring and papal seal are broken .
today it is a symbolic act , but historically it was designed to prevent impersonation and forgery . no images or recordings of any kind are permitted to be taken apart from portraits of the pope after his corpse has been suitably prepared to the satisfaction of the camerlengo , cardinal eduardo martinez somalo .
bildunterschrift : many thousands of people pray in a floodlit st. peter 's square at the vatican burial procedure each pope is able to specify his own funeral arrangements .
this time , the vatican will be working to requests drawn up by john paul ii in 1996 . according to experts , the pope ’ s body is likely to be embalmed and then exposed for the veneration of the faithful – most likely in st. peter ’ s basilica . tradition calls for nine days of mourning during which there is a papal interregnum , or interval during which the catholic church is without a spiritual leader .
burial occurs four to six days after death – between wednesday and friday in the case of john paul ii .
the italian news agency ansa , however , reported that the interment would not take place before thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. peter 's basilica in rome the funeral service will take place in st. peter ’ s and heads of state and government as well as religious leaders from around the world will attend . the pope is expected to be buried alongside his immediate predecessors in the crypt under the main altar of st. peter 's basilica .
there have been rumors that john paul ii wanted to be buried in poland , but experts say this is unlikely . how is a successor chosen ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only those cardinals under age 80 may vote for the next pope the election of a new pope does not begin until 15 days after the death of a pontiff .
in the meantime , cardinals from around the world begin arriving at the vatican to participate in a centuries-old ritual called the conclave -lrb- from the latin cum clave meaning “ with key ” -rrb- . those cardinals involved in electing the new pope must be under 80 .
there are 117 eligible to vote for john paul ii ’ s successor .
before the conclave , coalition-builders begin forging alliances .
senior cardinals who may themselves have little chance of becoming pope can still exert a considerable influence over others . on the day the conclave begins , the cardinals move in procession into the sistine chapel , where they will have the option of holding an initial ballot on the first day .
this ballot often serves to gauge the level of support for various candidates .
on the next day the voting process begins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly-elected pope john paul ii raises his arms in greeting the crowd from the balcony of st. peter 's basilica on oct .
16 , 1978 throughout the entire conclave , the cardinals are sequestered in the vatican without outside contact until they choose a new pope .
a two-thirds-plus-one majority is needed for a successful election , otherwise the vote is repeated .
if the right percentage is not met after 12 to 13 days , a simple majority vote may be imposed .
cardinals can not vote for themselves and may be eliminated from consideration if they campaign for support .
until a successor has been elected , there will be four ballots a day .
the ballot papers are burned in an old stove after every second vote .
different chemicals are mixed in to produce black smoke for an inconclusive vote or white smoke for a successful vote , a signal to the public that a new pope has been chosen .
the pope-elect that emerges from the voting is asked whether he accepts becoming the supreme pontiff .
if he answer is yes , he is asked what name he wishes to take .

an african pontiff ?
how about latin america or india ? no one knows for sure and those who might have an idea - the cardinals who actually choose the next leader of the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics - certainly are n't giving much away . nevertheless the process is underway , triggered automatically by the death saturday of the conservative 84-year-old pope john paul ii who had headed the catholic church since his own election in 1978 . no doubt the impending election will be on their minds when cardinals hold their first congregation monday to begin planning the pontiff 's funeral .
however , the conclave at which cardinals choose a successor must not start until at least two weeks after a pope 's death , but no later than 20 days . one of the few to have talked about the succession , cardinal francis george of the chicago archdiocese , urged the next pope not to make radical changes .
" people think things are up for grabs that are n't up for grabs , " he told a press conference saturday after a memorial mass .
however , he admitted , " we may need a different kind of pope . " in a possible indication of his thinking , he said that although there were good reasons to elect a pope from africa , asia or latin america , he would have to be " acceptable to the romans .
he should speak italian . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who , if any , of the top vatican cardinals will get the job ?
clockwise from top left : vatican secretary of state italian cardinal angelo sodano , german cardinal joseph ratzinger , italian cardinal giovanni battista re , colombian cardinal alfonso lopez trujillo , italian cardinal camillo ruini , us cardinal james stafford .
some vatican insiders think cardinals will likely return to a safe italian candidate - john paul ii was the first non-italian pontiff in 455 years .
" i do n't think the college of electors will risk electing a foreigner .
the italians are the inner circle , " one said under cover of anonymity . a return to italian type in that case , the front-runner could be cardinal dionigi tettamanzi , who as archbishop of milan oversees the most populous diocese in europe .
aged 71 , he is seen as an intellectual , a pastor and someone who would have new ideas . another italian possible is angelo scola , patriarch or archbishop of venice who at 63 counts as one of the church 's younger set . a moderate , he is thought likely to have the backing of opus dei , a highly conservative grouping which has several european and latin american cardinals among its supporters . a south or central american pope ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : away from italy , potential candidates are oscar andres rodriguez maradiaga , the 62-year-old honduran cardinal who has campaigned against poverty ; claudio hummes , archbishop of sao paulo ; and dario castrillon hoyos of colombia . hummes has distanced himself from the terms progressive and conservative and prefers to maintain a strong personal conviction on issues regardless of where they fall in the two camps .
hoyos was responsible for steering the latin american church away from controversial liberation theology and was rewarded by the pope , who appointed him head of the powerful congregation for the clergy , the vatican department which deals directly with the world 's priests . also in the running could be jorge mario bergoglio , the archbishop of buenos aires .
a man of humility who lives a simple existence , bergoglio is an advocate of a traditional and spiritual approach to the role of archbishop .
he once insisted that the entire church of argentina wear garments of public penance for sins committed during the county 's military dictatorship .
a member of the jesuit order , this fact may play against him as the order is supposed to renounce church awards and pledge only to serve the pope , not become one . an indian or african holy father ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian catholics will be praying for pope john paul ii and wondering if one of their won will take his place .
ivan dias , the 69-year-old archbishop of bombay , carries the best hopes of the indian sub-continent .
while an indian national , dias spent most of his life serving as a diplomat for the church around the world before returning home to become bombay 's archbishop .
a fluent multilinguist , dias is a conservative among a large number of more reformist bishops in the asian church . nigeria 's francis arinze is regarded by many as the best non-italian bet .
a conservative , he would become the second african pope after gelasius i in the late fifth century .

" i do n't think the college of electors will risk electing a foreigner .
the italians are the inner circle , " one said under cover of anonymity . a return to italian type in that case , the front-runner could be cardinal dionigi tettamanzi , who as archbishop of milan oversees the most populous diocese in europe .
aged 71 , he is seen as an intellectual , a pastor and someone who would have new ideas . another italian possible is angelo scola , patriarch or archbishop of venice who at 63 counts as one of the church 's younger set . a moderate , he is thought likely to have the backing of opus dei , a highly conservative grouping which has several european and latin american cardinals among its supporters . a south or central american pope ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : away from italy , potential candidates are oscar andres rodriguez maradiaga , the 62-year-old honduran cardinal who has campaigned against poverty ; claudio hummes , archbishop of sao paulo ; and dario castrillon hoyos of colombia . hummes has distanced himself from the terms progressive and conservative and prefers to maintain a strong personal conviction on issues regardless of where they fall in the two camps .
hoyos was responsible for steering the latin american church away from controversial liberation theology and was rewarded by the pope , who appointed him head of the powerful congregation for the clergy , the vatican department which deals directly with the world 's priests . also in the running could be jorge mario bergoglio , the archbishop of buenos aires .
a man of humility who lives a simple existence , bergoglio is an advocate of a traditional and spiritual approach to the role of archbishop .
he once insisted that the entire church of argentina wear garments of public penance for sins committed during the county 's military dictatorship .
a member of the jesuit order , this fact may play against him as the order is supposed to renounce church awards and pledge only to serve the pope , not become one . an indian or african holy father ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian catholics will be praying for pope john paul ii and wondering if one of their won will take his place .
ivan dias , the 69-year-old archbishop of bombay , carries the best hopes of the indian sub-continent .
while an indian national , dias spent most of his life serving as a diplomat for the church around the world before returning home to become bombay 's archbishop .
a fluent multilinguist , dias is a conservative among a large number of more reformist bishops in the asian church . nigeria 's francis arinze is regarded by many as the best non-italian bet .
a conservative , he would become the second african pope after gelasius i in the late fifth century .
he has been the catholic church 's point man for relations with islam , an important factor considering the high profile growth rate of that religion .
arinze is currently the head of the vatican department for divine worship . factors that may influence the cardinals range from policy - conservative or liberal , bridge-builder or doctrinaire - to the mundane , such as whether someone might be a good bureaucrat running the huge vatican machinery but less gifted as a pastor in the field . another element is age .
will they go for someone young to drive the church forward for the foreseeable future at a time of declining belief in god ? french poll favors " more progressive " pope a poll sunday in the daily le paris ien found 53 percent of french people in favor of a " more progressive " pope than john paul ii , while 27 percent wanted continuity and only 13 percent a more traditional successor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinals attend a mass for the late pope john paul ii celebrated by the vatican secretary of state , cardinal angelo sodano on the steps of st. peter 's basilica at the vatican on sunday .
do n't expect any public jockeying by the cardinals , however .
rules say they must abstain under pain of excommunication from any form of agreement or promise that would influence their vote , and they are not allowed to vote for themselves . george , the archbishop of chicago , said he expected debate to be heated but not to last more than a week .
" i think we 'll all be cordial but i expect there will be great differences of opinion , " he said . both john paul ii and his immediate predecessor were compromise candidates who emerged because of deadlocks over cardinals who had initially seemed more promising when the conclaves got under way . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de plenty of variables in papal succession age , nationality and tradition all play a role in the growing speculation about the next man who will take over as head of the roman catholic church .
-lrb- april 2 , 2005 -rrb- could a bavarian become pope ?
while some priests say talk of a papal resignation is in bad taste , others are looking for the man who will come after john paul ii , and there 's a chance it might be german cardinal joseph ratzinger .

dw-world looks at the key steps for the next several days . immediately after the pope has passed away , a document known as the apostolic constitution drafted by john paul ii himself in 1996 enters into effect .
at this point , the pope ’ s camerlengo -lrb- chamberlain -rrb- verifies the pontiff ’ s death by calling him by his christian name three times .
if there is no response , the chamberlain declares “ the pope is truly dead . ” the confirmation used to be accompanied by the chamberlain tapping the pope ’ s forehead three times with a small silver hammer , but the tradition fell into disuse after pope john xxiii ’ s death in 1963 .
the vatican follows a strict protocol for dealing with the death of a pope .
word is passed through the church ’ s civil service – the curia – and foreign ambassadors and heads of state are informed officially .
vatican radio then flashes news of his death around the world .
in many cities , churches ring their bells to announce the death .
john paul ii ’ s body was then removed from his apartment , which was then locked and sealed .
a small ceremony takes place during which the pope ’ s fisherman ’ s ring and papal seal are broken .
today it is a symbolic act , but historically it was designed to prevent impersonation and forgery . no images or recordings of any kind are permitted to be taken apart from portraits of the pope after his corpse has been suitably prepared to the satisfaction of the camerlengo , cardinal eduardo martinez somalo .
bildunterschrift : many thousands of people pray in a floodlit st. peter 's square at the vatican burial procedure each pope is able to specify his own funeral arrangements .
this time , the vatican will be working to requests drawn up by john paul ii in 1996 . according to experts , the pope ’ s body is likely to be embalmed and then exposed for the veneration of the faithful – most likely in st. peter ’ s basilica . tradition calls for nine days of mourning during which there is a papal interregnum , or interval during which the catholic church is without a spiritual leader .
burial occurs four to six days after death – between wednesday and friday in the case of john paul ii .
the italian news agency ansa , however , reported that the interment would not take place before thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. peter 's basilica in rome the funeral service will take place in st. peter ’ s and heads of state and government as well as religious leaders from around the world will attend . the pope is expected to be buried alongside his immediate predecessors in the crypt under the main altar of st. peter 's basilica .
there have been rumors that john paul ii wanted to be buried in poland , but experts say this is unlikely . how is a successor chosen ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only those cardinals under age 80 may vote for the next pope the election of a new pope does not begin until 15 days after the death of a pontiff .
in the meantime , cardinals from around the world begin arriving at the vatican to participate in a centuries-old ritual called the conclave -lrb- from the latin cum clave meaning “ with key ” -rrb- . those cardinals involved in electing the new pope must be under 80 .
there are 117 eligible to vote for john paul ii ’ s successor .
before the conclave , coalition-builders begin forging alliances .
senior cardinals who may themselves have little chance of becoming pope can still exert a considerable influence over others . on the day the conclave begins , the cardinals move in procession into the sistine chapel , where they will have the option of holding an initial ballot on the first day .
this ballot often serves to gauge the level of support for various candidates .
on the next day the voting process begins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly-elected pope john paul ii raises his arms in greeting the crowd from the balcony of st. peter 's basilica on oct .
16 , 1978 throughout the entire conclave , the cardinals are sequestered in the vatican without outside contact until they choose a new pope .
a two-thirds-plus-one majority is needed for a successful election , otherwise the vote is repeated .
if the right percentage is not met after 12 to 13 days , a simple majority vote may be imposed .
cardinals can not vote for themselves and may be eliminated from consideration if they campaign for support .
until a successor has been elected , there will be four ballots a day .
the ballot papers are burned in an old stove after every second vote .
different chemicals are mixed in to produce black smoke for an inconclusive vote or white smoke for a successful vote , a signal to the public that a new pope has been chosen .
the pope-elect that emerges from the voting is asked whether he accepts becoming the supreme pontiff .
if he answer is yes , he is asked what name he wishes to take .
he then goes to the room of tears , a small room next to the sistine chapel , where he dresses himself in white papal robes , before returning to the conclave to sit near the altar and have a new fisherman ’ s ring put on his finger .
then cardinals then file by to pay homage to the man who from that point on will be considered christ ’ s representative on earth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conclave will convene in the sistine chapel under michelangelo 's " last judgement " the senior cardinal deacon , at the moment chilean cardinal jorge medina estevez , will then step onto the central loggia of st. peter ’ s basilica to proclaim “ habemus papam ” – we have a pope – and the new pontiff will appear on the balcony to deliver his first apostolic blessing to the world . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de john paul ii : passing of a papal giant the vatican announced saturday evening that the pope died at 2027 cet .

his far-reaching influence , particularly in the developing world , has been blamed for failing to prevent the spread of hiv / aids . he maintained throughout his papacy that the roman catholic church believed abstinence and fidelity within marriage , and not condoms , were the best way to stop the spread of hiv / aids , a message seen by health organizations in particular as an irresponsible one . " the holy see ... believes prevention through education about the sacredness of life and the correct practice of sexuality , that is chastity and faithfulness , is necessary above all other things in order to prevent this disease responsibly , " the pontiff said during one of his last visits abroad in spain in january . the catholic church opposes condoms in all except the rarest of circumstances because they are a form of contraception , which it believes prevents the god-given gift of life .
the pope held the church 's hard line that promoting the use of condoms to fight the spread of aids fostered what he saw as immoral and hedonistic lifestyles and behavior that will only contribute to its spread .
there were even reports that the church was sending out messages in africa that condoms actually caused hiv / aids . the pope 's stance on same-sex relationships was also a source of conflict .
the pope referred to homosexuality as " part of a new ideology of evil , perhaps more insidious and hidden , which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man . "
he was staunchly opposed to gay marriage and publicly expressed his concerns that governments around the world were being put under pressure to legalize same-sex unions . gay rights groups accuse pope of complicity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter tatchell , of gay human rights group outrage , said in a statement in the wake of the pope 's death : " history will judge the pope harshly .
his opposition to the use of condoms to prevent the spread of hiv has condemned millions of people to die an agonizing , needless death . " " millions of children in developing countries are orphans ; having lost their parents to aids because of the pope ’ s anti-condom dogma , " tatchell added .
" pope john paul ii waged a ceaseless war against the human rights of women and gay people ; opposing the right of women to control their own fertility ; blocking women ’ s equality in the church ; and endorsing state-sponsored discrimination against lesbians and gay men . "
many hope for a new liberal pontiff gay catholic group rainbow sash hoped the next pope would take a more liberal view on homosexuality .
" there 's a lot of gays and lesbians out there who have a strong faith and a strong commitment to the church and they are still continually cut out of the loop , " spokesman george barbary said in the group 's own statement .
" that 's an important message that 's been lost and one can only hope for change . "
the polish pontiff was also staunch defender of traditional church policies on women , refusing to consider ordaining them as priests , enforcing contraception decrees and opposing abortion .

john paul accused governments which allowed abortion of committing murder on a huge scale , even at one stage drawing parallels between abortion and the holocaust .

younger germans are taking a greater interest in world war ii but this does not always have positive facets according to the german historian wolfgang wippermann who spoke with dw-world . dw-world : what is the meaning of may 8 for german and world history ?
wolfgang wippermann : may 8 , 1945 is not only an momentous date for german history , but also for world history .
it 's definitely comparable to the reformation , the french revolution and the bolshevik revolution .
it is simply an epochal date in world history .
it was then that a new era began and was the end of a horrendous one - the era of fascism .
in germany the date is often spoken of as a new beginning , a stunde null , that 's to say the country 's " zero hour . "
how do you judge this ?
there was no stunde null like we viewed it .
instead , there was a strong road of continuity , not a restoration .
it was a kind of continuity that revealed itself in the elite before the third reich and also afterwards .
for example , there were more nazis in the foreign office after 1945 than before .
it was wishful thinking to believe that on may 8 , 1945 history ended to a more or less greater extent , that a " zero hour " took place and we were reborn .
that did n't happen .
it must be added , however , that the end of the war or the collapse of the third reich was very important for the collective memory of the germans .
which catastrophe in germany had a greater effect on the country , the political or the moral one ?
the first problem is the term " catastrophe " which friedrich meineke already coined with regard to 1945 in his book " the german catastrophe " in 1946 .
indeed , the end of the war was perceived as a catastrophe for the germans but that was historically completely wrong .
the actual catastrophe was the shoah , the catastrophe that was carried out on the jewish people .
people did n't want to recognize this in germany for a long time .
it was n't until after various historical and political discussions that the true meaning of fascism and the holocaust was recognized : the real catastrophe was the shoah .
how has the view of the second world war and the date may 8 , 1945 changed in germany over the past 60 years ?
there has been a crucial change .
the eighth of may was at one time the day the third reich collapsed , or as people said , the german catastrophe .
there was a long debate as to whether it was the day of liberation or the day of collapse ?
collapse or liberation was a topic of historical-political debates during the 1950 's and 60 's , but most of all in the 70 's and 80 's .
finally , those who called it the day of liberation won the upper hand .
german president richard von weizsäcker made this clear on may 8 , 1985 .
that meant that the important thing was not that it was a german catastrophe but a catastrophe for the jews .
this was a very long , arduous process but one that was concluded positively .
but i must also say that history is not just that which happened .
a historical event is also that which is made of it .
does the german perspective of the second world war conform with that of the world or are there differences ?
there are various controversies that spill beyond borders .
it ca n't be classified as strictly nationally historical .
one thing that is happening in my opinion is that there is no longer a historical-political discussion or one of how to deal with the past .
what 's happening is that may 8 , world war ii , the shoah and the like are being commercialized .
we not only have a historicization but a " knoppization " -lsb- guido knopp is a popular historian who has made numerous documentaries about world war ii for german national television -rsb- of history for commercial purposes .
it has more to do with television ratings and not really with history - knopp 's films are horribly commericialized .
that is the negative side of the awakened interest in history , which on the other hand is positive .

younger germans are taking a greater interest in world war ii but this does not always have positive facets according to the german historian wolfgang wippermann who spoke with dw-world . dw-world : what is the meaning of may 8 for german and world history ?
wolfgang wippermann : may 8 , 1945 is not only an momentous date for german history , but also for world history .
it 's definitely comparable to the reformation , the french revolution and the bolshevik revolution .
it is simply an epochal date in world history .
it was then that a new era began and was the end of a horrendous one - the era of fascism .
in germany the date is often spoken of as a new beginning , a stunde null , that 's to say the country 's " zero hour . "
how do you judge this ?
there was no stunde null like we viewed it .
instead , there was a strong road of continuity , not a restoration .
it was a kind of continuity that revealed itself in the elite before the third reich and also afterwards .
for example , there were more nazis in the foreign office after 1945 than before .

younger germans are taking a greater interest in world war ii but this does not always have positive facets according to the german historian wolfgang wippermann who spoke with dw-world . dw-world : what is the meaning of may 8 for german and world history ?
wolfgang wippermann : may 8 , 1945 is not only an momentous date for german history , but also for world history .
it 's definitely comparable to the reformation , the french revolution and the bolshevik revolution .
it is simply an epochal date in world history .
it was then that a new era began and was the end of a horrendous one - the era of fascism .
in germany the date is often spoken of as a new beginning , a stunde null , that 's to say the country 's " zero hour . "
how do you judge this ?
there was no stunde null like we viewed it .
instead , there was a strong road of continuity , not a restoration .
it was a kind of continuity that revealed itself in the elite before the third reich and also afterwards .
for example , there were more nazis in the foreign office after 1945 than before .
it was wishful thinking to believe that on may 8 , 1945 history ended to a more or less greater extent , that a " zero hour " took place and we were reborn .
that did n't happen .
it must be added , however , that the end of the war or the collapse of the third reich was very important for the collective memory of the germans .
which catastrophe in germany had a greater effect on the country , the political or the moral one ?
the first problem is the term " catastrophe " which friedrich meineke already coined with regard to 1945 in his book " the german catastrophe " in 1946 .
indeed , the end of the war was perceived as a catastrophe for the germans but that was historically completely wrong .
the actual catastrophe was the shoah , the catastrophe that was carried out on the jewish people .
people did n't want to recognize this in germany for a long time .
it was n't until after various historical and political discussions that the true meaning of fascism and the holocaust was recognized : the real catastrophe was the shoah .
how has the view of the second world war and the date may 8 , 1945 changed in germany over the past 60 years ?
there has been a crucial change .
the eighth of may was at one time the day the third reich collapsed , or as people said , the german catastrophe .
there was a long debate as to whether it was the day of liberation or the day of collapse ?
collapse or liberation was a topic of historical-political debates during the 1950 's and 60 's , but most of all in the 70 's and 80 's .
finally , those who called it the day of liberation won the upper hand .
german president richard von weizsäcker made this clear on may 8 , 1985 .
that meant that the important thing was not that it was a german catastrophe but a catastrophe for the jews .
this was a very long , arduous process but one that was concluded positively .
but i must also say that history is not just that which happened .
a historical event is also that which is made of it .
does the german perspective of the second world war conform with that of the world or are there differences ?
there are various controversies that spill beyond borders .
it ca n't be classified as strictly nationally historical .
one thing that is happening in my opinion is that there is no longer a historical-political discussion or one of how to deal with the past .
what 's happening is that may 8 , world war ii , the shoah and the like are being commercialized .
we not only have a historicization but a " knoppization " -lsb- guido knopp is a popular historian who has made numerous documentaries about world war ii for german national television -rsb- of history for commercial purposes .
it has more to do with television ratings and not really with history - knopp 's films are horribly commericialized .
that is the negative side of the awakened interest in history , which on the other hand is positive .
i view it negatively and think it 's also possibly dangerous that history is being commercialized . martin schrader interviewed wolfgang wippermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the end of german jewry " " auschwitz is a symbol of nazi atrocities but the murders happened in many places over a long period of time , " says w. michael blumenthal , director of the jewish museum berlin in a dw-world interview .

though their names are among the many being whispered in the vatican hallways as possible papal successors , prominent advisors all lose their powers upon the pope 's death and the cardinal camerlengo or chamberlain , cardinal eduardo martinez somalo , becomes the temporary head of the church .
the pope 's death immediately sets into motion a historic chain of events to elect a successor and prevents any risk of division in the roman catholic church .
successor elected in complete secrecy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prayers of millions are with john paul ii whoever takes over the throne in rome and the 1.1 billion member catholic church is elected 15 to 20 days after the pope 's death in a secret conclave meeting of up to 120 cardinals under the age of 80 in the vatican 's sistine chapel under michelangelo 's awesome fresco of the last judgment , according to a law adopted in 1975 .
opinions are split as to whether the current 117 such cardinals , nearly 100 of whom were appointed by john paul ii , will continue karol wojtyla 's conservative legacy or try to reflect the profound changes that have taken place in the church in choosing a successor , who is most likely to come from among the cardinals themselves .
age and nationality key issues if the cardinals are reasonably unanimous about the policies they want the church to follow , they are likely to elect a young man to carry out these policies far into the future .

if this were to happen , strong candidates would include archbishops dionigi tettamanzi , 70 , of milan , angelo scola , 63 , of venice , tarcisio bertone , 70 , of genoa , angelo sodano , 77 , and battista re , 71 .

with church congregations rising across africa , southern asia and latin america , observers see a global church that is increasingly orientated towards the south and away from its european heartland .
africa , where the church is facing competition from islam and other confessions , has a strong candidate in cardinal francis arinze from nigeria , 72 , who heads the vatican congregation for divine worship .
there are also four possible candidates from latin america .

though their names are among the many being whispered in the vatican hallways as possible papal successors , prominent advisors all lose their powers upon the pope 's death and the cardinal camerlengo or chamberlain , cardinal eduardo martinez somalo , becomes the temporary head of the church .
the pope 's death immediately sets into motion a historic chain of events to elect a successor and prevents any risk of division in the roman catholic church .
successor elected in complete secrecy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prayers of millions are with john paul ii whoever takes over the throne in rome and the 1.1 billion member catholic church is elected 15 to 20 days after the pope 's death in a secret conclave meeting of up to 120 cardinals under the age of 80 in the vatican 's sistine chapel under michelangelo 's awesome fresco of the last judgment , according to a law adopted in 1975 .
opinions are split as to whether the current 117 such cardinals , nearly 100 of whom were appointed by john paul ii , will continue karol wojtyla 's conservative legacy or try to reflect the profound changes that have taken place in the church in choosing a successor , who is most likely to come from among the cardinals themselves .
age and nationality key issues if the cardinals are reasonably unanimous about the policies they want the church to follow , they are likely to elect a young man to carry out these policies far into the future .
if they can not agree on policies , they are more likely to choose an elderly candidate as a temporary measure .

if this were to happen , strong candidates would include archbishops dionigi tettamanzi , 70 , of milan , angelo scola , 63 , of venice , tarcisio bertone , 70 , of genoa , angelo sodano , 77 , and battista re , 71 .

with church congregations rising across africa , southern asia and latin america , observers see a global church that is increasingly orientated towards the south and away from its european heartland .

dw-world looks at the key steps for the next several days . immediately after the pope has passed away , a document known as the apostolic constitution drafted by john paul ii himself in 1996 enters into effect .
at this point , the pope ’ s camerlengo -lrb- chamberlain -rrb- verifies the pontiff ’ s death by calling him by his christian name three times .
if there is no response , the chamberlain declares “ the pope is truly dead . ” the confirmation used to be accompanied by the chamberlain tapping the pope ’ s forehead three times with a small silver hammer , but the tradition fell into disuse after pope john xxiii ’ s death in 1963 .
the vatican follows a strict protocol for dealing with the death of a pope .
word is passed through the church ’ s civil service – the curia – and foreign ambassadors and heads of state are informed officially .
vatican radio then flashes news of his death around the world .
in many cities , churches ring their bells to announce the death .
john paul ii ’ s body was then removed from his apartment , which was then locked and sealed .
a small ceremony takes place during which the pope ’ s fisherman ’ s ring and papal seal are broken .
today it is a symbolic act , but historically it was designed to prevent impersonation and forgery . no images or recordings of any kind are permitted to be taken apart from portraits of the pope after his corpse has been suitably prepared to the satisfaction of the camerlengo , cardinal eduardo martinez somalo .
bildunterschrift : many thousands of people pray in a floodlit st. peter 's square at the vatican burial procedure each pope is able to specify his own funeral arrangements .
this time , the vatican will be working to requests drawn up by john paul ii in 1996 . according to experts , the pope ’ s body is likely to be embalmed and then exposed for the veneration of the faithful – most likely in st. peter ’ s basilica . tradition calls for nine days of mourning during which there is a papal interregnum , or interval during which the catholic church is without a spiritual leader .
burial occurs four to six days after death – between wednesday and friday in the case of john paul ii .
the italian news agency ansa , however , reported that the interment would not take place before thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. peter 's basilica in rome the funeral service will take place in st. peter ’ s and heads of state and government as well as religious leaders from around the world will attend . the pope is expected to be buried alongside his immediate predecessors in the crypt under the main altar of st. peter 's basilica .
there have been rumors that john paul ii wanted to be buried in poland , but experts say this is unlikely . how is a successor chosen ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only those cardinals under age 80 may vote for the next pope the election of a new pope does not begin until 15 days after the death of a pontiff .
in the meantime , cardinals from around the world begin arriving at the vatican to participate in a centuries-old ritual called the conclave -lrb- from the latin cum clave meaning “ with key ” -rrb- . those cardinals involved in electing the new pope must be under 80 .
there are 117 eligible to vote for john paul ii ’ s successor .
before the conclave , coalition-builders begin forging alliances .
senior cardinals who may themselves have little chance of becoming pope can still exert a considerable influence over others . on the day the conclave begins , the cardinals move in procession into the sistine chapel , where they will have the option of holding an initial ballot on the first day .
this ballot often serves to gauge the level of support for various candidates .
on the next day the voting process begins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly-elected pope john paul ii raises his arms in greeting the crowd from the balcony of st. peter 's basilica on oct .
16 , 1978 throughout the entire conclave , the cardinals are sequestered in the vatican without outside contact until they choose a new pope .
a two-thirds-plus-one majority is needed for a successful election , otherwise the vote is repeated .
if the right percentage is not met after 12 to 13 days , a simple majority vote may be imposed .
cardinals can not vote for themselves and may be eliminated from consideration if they campaign for support .
until a successor has been elected , there will be four ballots a day .
the ballot papers are burned in an old stove after every second vote .
different chemicals are mixed in to produce black smoke for an inconclusive vote or white smoke for a successful vote , a signal to the public that a new pope has been chosen .
the pope-elect that emerges from the voting is asked whether he accepts becoming the supreme pontiff .
if he answer is yes , he is asked what name he wishes to take .
he then goes to the room of tears , a small room next to the sistine chapel , where he dresses himself in white papal robes , before returning to the conclave to sit near the altar and have a new fisherman ’ s ring put on his finger .
then cardinals then file by to pay homage to the man who from that point on will be considered christ ’ s representative on earth .

" we think however that the economic outlook for the eurozone makes a rate increase with the next year or more extremely unlikely , " artus said . the ecb was on the verge of raising rates late last year , a high-level source close to the central bank told afp .
but policymakers changed their minds because of soaring crude oil prices and the euro 's appreciation against the dollar . credibility of single currency at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for ecb watchers , the guardians of the euro are also playing with their credibility .
" by crying wolf , they may end up not being believed , " warned eric chaney , an economist at morgan stanley .
" i do not find it very easy to interpret the ecb , " he said . critics point out by comparison that the us federal reserve , the central bank of the world 's biggest economy , seeks to communicate with absolute clarity .

his far-reaching influence , particularly in the developing world , has been blamed for failing to prevent the spread of hiv / aids . he maintained throughout his papacy that the roman catholic church believed abstinence and fidelity within marriage , and not condoms , were the best way to stop the spread of hiv / aids , a message seen by health organizations in particular as an irresponsible one . " the holy see ... believes prevention through education about the sacredness of life and the correct practice of sexuality , that is chastity and faithfulness , is necessary above all other things in order to prevent this disease responsibly , " the pontiff said during one of his last visits abroad in spain in january . the catholic church opposes condoms in all except the rarest of circumstances because they are a form of contraception , which it believes prevents the god-given gift of life .
the pope held the church 's hard line that promoting the use of condoms to fight the spread of aids fostered what he saw as immoral and hedonistic lifestyles and behavior that will only contribute to its spread .
there were even reports that the church was sending out messages in africa that condoms actually caused hiv / aids . the pope 's stance on same-sex relationships was also a source of conflict .
the pope referred to homosexuality as " part of a new ideology of evil , perhaps more insidious and hidden , which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man . "
he was staunchly opposed to gay marriage and publicly expressed his concerns that governments around the world were being put under pressure to legalize same-sex unions . gay rights groups accuse pope of complicity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter tatchell , of gay human rights group outrage , said in a statement in the wake of the pope 's death : " history will judge the pope harshly .
his opposition to the use of condoms to prevent the spread of hiv has condemned millions of people to die an agonizing , needless death . " " millions of children in developing countries are orphans ; having lost their parents to aids because of the pope ’ s anti-condom dogma , " tatchell added .
" pope john paul ii waged a ceaseless war against the human rights of women and gay people ; opposing the right of women to control their own fertility ; blocking women ’ s equality in the church ; and endorsing state-sponsored discrimination against lesbians and gay men . "
many hope for a new liberal pontiff gay catholic group rainbow sash hoped the next pope would take a more liberal view on homosexuality .
" there 's a lot of gays and lesbians out there who have a strong faith and a strong commitment to the church and they are still continually cut out of the loop , " spokesman george barbary said in the group 's own statement .
" that 's an important message that 's been lost and one can only hope for change . "
the polish pontiff was also staunch defender of traditional church policies on women , refusing to consider ordaining them as priests , enforcing contraception decrees and opposing abortion . " a fifth-century pope in terms of who women are " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gisela forster , left , and christine mayr-lumetzberger wear white robes as they bear a figure of pope john paul ii. during a protest campaign against the threat of being excommunicated by the vatican in munich , southern germany , july 22 , 2002 .
they are two of the seven women who were ordained as priests by argentine bishop romulo braschi in defiance of the ban of catholic church on female clergy .

" he will go down in history as a pope who did n't understand and who was n't friendly to women , " frances kissling , president of the liberal washington d.c.-based activist group catholics for a free choice , said of john paul in a statement .
" he could n't have slammed the door shut more loudly on the question of the ordination of women .
he will go down as a fifth-century pope in terms of who women are . " the vatican was rounded on by women in 2004 for issuing a long-awaited document on men and women that charged that feminists were " adversaries of men " who undermined families and paved the way for acceptance of gay marriage . parallels between abortion and holocaust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actresses whoopi goldberg , right , and christine lahti , left , yell at anti-abortion demonstrators in washington , sunday , april 25 , 2004 , during an abortion rights rally and march .
the day , which focused on protecting women 's reproductive rights , included men and women from across the country along with activists from nearly 60 countries .
the pope 's views on abortion may have endeared himself to the christian right in the united states but angered and dismayed many others around the world .
john paul accused governments which allowed abortion of committing murder on a huge scale , even at one stage drawing parallels between abortion and the holocaust . " there is still , however , a legal extermination of human beings who have been conceived but not yet born , " the pope wrote in his book memory and identity .
" and this time , we are talking about an extermination which has been allowed by nothing less than democratically elected parliaments . " pedophile priest problem tainted papacy pope john paul also presided over one of the most damaging scandals that the catholic church has had to face in modern times : pedophile priests .
scandals , resignations , confessions and expulsions rocked the church in the united states , while similar cases came to light across europe . some critics accused the pope of heading a cover-up .
the catholic church has always been reluctant to make sexual abuse problems public , preferring to deal with the issue internally , or as many believe , not deal with it at all .
critics accused the church of moving pedophile priests between parishes instead of dismissing them which was no solution to the problem .
the pope responded by declaring a policy of zero tolerance for priests found guilty of pedophilia . staunchly opposed to euthanasia the pope was also scathing in his views on euthanasia .
on one visit to the netherlands , the pope chose an appearance at the dutch parliament to condemn the country 's policy on assisted suicide and called for all dutch catholics to uphold the church 's view : " the holy see has made known its clear position and invites catholics in the netherlands always to show their absolute respect for human life , from conception to natural death , " the pope said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recently , just shortly before his health took a fatal turn for the worst , the pope called the doctors , campaigners and government officials who were instrumental in allowing brain-dead american terri schiavo to die " murderers " . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gay groups blast “ cardinal mistake ” to fight love the vatican has slammed same-sex unions as " deviant " and a threat to society in a controversial document .

the pope held the church 's hard line that promoting the use of condoms to fight the spread of aids fostered what he saw as immoral and hedonistic lifestyles and behavior that will only contribute to its spread .
there were even reports that the church was sending out messages in africa that condoms actually caused hiv / aids . the pope 's stance on same-sex relationships was also a source of conflict .
the pope referred to homosexuality as " part of a new ideology of evil , perhaps more insidious and hidden , which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man . "
he was staunchly opposed to gay marriage and publicly expressed his concerns that governments around the world were being put under pressure to legalize same-sex unions . gay rights groups accuse pope of complicity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter tatchell , of gay human rights group outrage , said in a statement in the wake of the pope 's death : " history will judge the pope harshly .
his opposition to the use of condoms to prevent the spread of hiv has condemned millions of people to die an agonizing , needless death . " " millions of children in developing countries are orphans ; having lost their parents to aids because of the pope ’ s anti-condom dogma , " tatchell added .
" pope john paul ii waged a ceaseless war against the human rights of women and gay people ; opposing the right of women to control their own fertility ; blocking women ’ s equality in the church ; and endorsing state-sponsored discrimination against lesbians and gay men . "
many hope for a new liberal pontiff gay catholic group rainbow sash hoped the next pope would take a more liberal view on homosexuality .
" there 's a lot of gays and lesbians out there who have a strong faith and a strong commitment to the church and they are still continually cut out of the loop , " spokesman george barbary said in the group 's own statement .
" that 's an important message that 's been lost and one can only hope for change . "
the polish pontiff was also staunch defender of traditional church policies on women , refusing to consider ordaining them as priests , enforcing contraception decrees and opposing abortion . " a fifth-century pope in terms of who women are " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gisela forster , left , and christine mayr-lumetzberger wear white robes as they bear a figure of pope john paul ii. during a protest campaign against the threat of being excommunicated by the vatican in munich , southern germany , july 22 , 2002 .

" he will go down in history as a pope who did n't understand and who was n't friendly to women , " frances kissling , president of the liberal washington d.c.-based activist group catholics for a free choice , said of john paul in a statement .
" he could n't have slammed the door shut more loudly on the question of the ordination of women .
he will go down as a fifth-century pope in terms of who women are . " the vatican was rounded on by women in 2004 for issuing a long-awaited document on men and women that charged that feminists were " adversaries of men " who undermined families and paved the way for acceptance of gay marriage . parallels between abortion and holocaust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actresses whoopi goldberg , right , and christine lahti , left , yell at anti-abortion demonstrators in washington , sunday , april 25 , 2004 , during an abortion rights rally and march .
the day , which focused on protecting women 's reproductive rights , included men and women from across the country along with activists from nearly 60 countries .
the pope 's views on abortion may have endeared himself to the christian right in the united states but angered and dismayed many others around the world .
john paul accused governments which allowed abortion of committing murder on a huge scale , even at one stage drawing parallels between abortion and the holocaust . " there is still , however , a legal extermination of human beings who have been conceived but not yet born , " the pope wrote in his book memory and identity .
" and this time , we are talking about an extermination which has been allowed by nothing less than democratically elected parliaments . " pedophile priest problem tainted papacy pope john paul also presided over one of the most damaging scandals that the catholic church has had to face in modern times : pedophile priests .
scandals , resignations , confessions and expulsions rocked the church in the united states , while similar cases came to light across europe . some critics accused the pope of heading a cover-up .
the catholic church has always been reluctant to make sexual abuse problems public , preferring to deal with the issue internally , or as many believe , not deal with it at all .
critics accused the church of moving pedophile priests between parishes instead of dismissing them which was no solution to the problem .
the pope responded by declaring a policy of zero tolerance for priests found guilty of pedophilia . staunchly opposed to euthanasia the pope was also scathing in his views on euthanasia .
on one visit to the netherlands , the pope chose an appearance at the dutch parliament to condemn the country 's policy on assisted suicide and called for all dutch catholics to uphold the church 's view : " the holy see has made known its clear position and invites catholics in the netherlands always to show their absolute respect for human life , from conception to natural death , " the pope said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recently , just shortly before his health took a fatal turn for the worst , the pope called the doctors , campaigners and government officials who were instrumental in allowing brain-dead american terri schiavo to die " murderers " . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gay groups blast “ cardinal mistake ” to fight love the vatican has slammed same-sex unions as " deviant " and a threat to society in a controversial document .

an african pontiff ?
how about latin america or india ? no one knows for sure and those who might have an idea - the cardinals who actually choose the next leader of the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics - certainly are n't giving much away . nevertheless the process is underway , triggered automatically by the death saturday of the conservative 84-year-old pope john paul ii who had headed the catholic church since his own election in 1978 . no doubt the impending election will be on their minds when cardinals hold their first congregation monday to begin planning the pontiff 's funeral .
however , the conclave at which cardinals choose a successor must not start until at least two weeks after a pope 's death , but no later than 20 days . one of the few to have talked about the succession , cardinal francis george of the chicago archdiocese , urged the next pope not to make radical changes .
" people think things are up for grabs that are n't up for grabs , " he told a press conference saturday after a memorial mass .
however , he admitted , " we may need a different kind of pope . " in a possible indication of his thinking , he said that although there were good reasons to elect a pope from africa , asia or latin america , he would have to be " acceptable to the romans .
he should speak italian . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who , if any , of the top vatican cardinals will get the job ?
clockwise from top left : vatican secretary of state italian cardinal angelo sodano , german cardinal joseph ratzinger , italian cardinal giovanni battista re , colombian cardinal alfonso lopez trujillo , italian cardinal camillo ruini , us cardinal james stafford .
some vatican insiders think cardinals will likely return to a safe italian candidate - john paul ii was the first non-italian pontiff in 455 years .
" i do n't think the college of electors will risk electing a foreigner .
the italians are the inner circle , " one said under cover of anonymity . a return to italian type in that case , the front-runner could be cardinal dionigi tettamanzi , who as archbishop of milan oversees the most populous diocese in europe .
aged 71 , he is seen as an intellectual , a pastor and someone who would have new ideas . another italian possible is angelo scola , patriarch or archbishop of venice who at 63 counts as one of the church 's younger set . a moderate , he is thought likely to have the backing of opus dei , a highly conservative grouping which has several european and latin american cardinals among its supporters . a south or central american pope ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : away from italy , potential candidates are oscar andres rodriguez maradiaga , the 62-year-old honduran cardinal who has campaigned against poverty ; claudio hummes , archbishop of sao paulo ; and dario castrillon hoyos of colombia . hummes has distanced himself from the terms progressive and conservative and prefers to maintain a strong personal conviction on issues regardless of where they fall in the two camps .
hoyos was responsible for steering the latin american church away from controversial liberation theology and was rewarded by the pope , who appointed him head of the powerful congregation for the clergy , the vatican department which deals directly with the world 's priests . also in the running could be jorge mario bergoglio , the archbishop of buenos aires .
a man of humility who lives a simple existence , bergoglio is an advocate of a traditional and spiritual approach to the role of archbishop .
he once insisted that the entire church of argentina wear garments of public penance for sins committed during the county 's military dictatorship .
a member of the jesuit order , this fact may play against him as the order is supposed to renounce church awards and pledge only to serve the pope , not become one . an indian or african holy father ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian catholics will be praying for pope john paul ii and wondering if one of their won will take his place .
ivan dias , the 69-year-old archbishop of bombay , carries the best hopes of the indian sub-continent .
while an indian national , dias spent most of his life serving as a diplomat for the church around the world before returning home to become bombay 's archbishop .
a fluent multilinguist , dias is a conservative among a large number of more reformist bishops in the asian church . nigeria 's francis arinze is regarded by many as the best non-italian bet .
a conservative , he would become the second african pope after gelasius i in the late fifth century .
he has been the catholic church 's point man for relations with islam , an important factor considering the high profile growth rate of that religion .
arinze is currently the head of the vatican department for divine worship . factors that may influence the cardinals range from policy - conservative or liberal , bridge-builder or doctrinaire - to the mundane , such as whether someone might be a good bureaucrat running the huge vatican machinery but less gifted as a pastor in the field . another element is age .
will they go for someone young to drive the church forward for the foreseeable future at a time of declining belief in god ? french poll favors " more progressive " pope a poll sunday in the daily le paris ien found 53 percent of french people in favor of a " more progressive " pope than john paul ii , while 27 percent wanted continuity and only 13 percent a more traditional successor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinals attend a mass for the late pope john paul ii celebrated by the vatican secretary of state , cardinal angelo sodano on the steps of st. peter 's basilica at the vatican on sunday .
do n't expect any public jockeying by the cardinals , however .
rules say they must abstain under pain of excommunication from any form of agreement or promise that would influence their vote , and they are not allowed to vote for themselves . george , the archbishop of chicago , said he expected debate to be heated but not to last more than a week .
" i think we 'll all be cordial but i expect there will be great differences of opinion , " he said . both john paul ii and his immediate predecessor were compromise candidates who emerged because of deadlocks over cardinals who had initially seemed more promising when the conclaves got under way . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de plenty of variables in papal succession age , nationality and tradition all play a role in the growing speculation about the next man who will take over as head of the roman catholic church .

his far-reaching influence , particularly in the developing world , has been blamed for failing to prevent the spread of hiv / aids . he maintained throughout his papacy that the roman catholic church believed abstinence and fidelity within marriage , and not condoms , were the best way to stop the spread of hiv / aids , a message seen by health organizations in particular as an irresponsible one . " the holy see ... believes prevention through education about the sacredness of life and the correct practice of sexuality , that is chastity and faithfulness , is necessary above all other things in order to prevent this disease responsibly , " the pontiff said during one of his last visits abroad in spain in january . the catholic church opposes condoms in all except the rarest of circumstances because they are a form of contraception , which it believes prevents the god-given gift of life .
the pope held the church 's hard line that promoting the use of condoms to fight the spread of aids fostered what he saw as immoral and hedonistic lifestyles and behavior that will only contribute to its spread .
there were even reports that the church was sending out messages in africa that condoms actually caused hiv / aids . the pope 's stance on same-sex relationships was also a source of conflict .
the pope referred to homosexuality as " part of a new ideology of evil , perhaps more insidious and hidden , which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man . "
he was staunchly opposed to gay marriage and publicly expressed his concerns that governments around the world were being put under pressure to legalize same-sex unions . gay rights groups accuse pope of complicity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter tatchell , of gay human rights group outrage , said in a statement in the wake of the pope 's death : " history will judge the pope harshly .
his opposition to the use of condoms to prevent the spread of hiv has condemned millions of people to die an agonizing , needless death . " " millions of children in developing countries are orphans ; having lost their parents to aids because of the pope ’ s anti-condom dogma , " tatchell added .
" pope john paul ii waged a ceaseless war against the human rights of women and gay people ; opposing the right of women to control their own fertility ; blocking women ’ s equality in the church ; and endorsing state-sponsored discrimination against lesbians and gay men . "
many hope for a new liberal pontiff gay catholic group rainbow sash hoped the next pope would take a more liberal view on homosexuality .
" there 's a lot of gays and lesbians out there who have a strong faith and a strong commitment to the church and they are still continually cut out of the loop , " spokesman george barbary said in the group 's own statement .
" that 's an important message that 's been lost and one can only hope for change . "
the polish pontiff was also staunch defender of traditional church policies on women , refusing to consider ordaining them as priests , enforcing contraception decrees and opposing abortion . " a fifth-century pope in terms of who women are " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gisela forster , left , and christine mayr-lumetzberger wear white robes as they bear a figure of pope john paul ii. during a protest campaign against the threat of being excommunicated by the vatican in munich , southern germany , july 22 , 2002 .
they are two of the seven women who were ordained as priests by argentine bishop romulo braschi in defiance of the ban of catholic church on female clergy .
the pope excommunicated the seven women monday , aug .
5 , 2002 .
" he will go down in history as a pope who did n't understand and who was n't friendly to women , " frances kissling , president of the liberal washington d.c.-based activist group catholics for a free choice , said of john paul in a statement .
" he could n't have slammed the door shut more loudly on the question of the ordination of women .
he will go down as a fifth-century pope in terms of who women are . " the vatican was rounded on by women in 2004 for issuing a long-awaited document on men and women that charged that feminists were " adversaries of men " who undermined families and paved the way for acceptance of gay marriage . parallels between abortion and holocaust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actresses whoopi goldberg , right , and christine lahti , left , yell at anti-abortion demonstrators in washington , sunday , april 25 , 2004 , during an abortion rights rally and march .
the day , which focused on protecting women 's reproductive rights , included men and women from across the country along with activists from nearly 60 countries .
the pope 's views on abortion may have endeared himself to the christian right in the united states but angered and dismayed many others around the world .
john paul accused governments which allowed abortion of committing murder on a huge scale , even at one stage drawing parallels between abortion and the holocaust . " there is still , however , a legal extermination of human beings who have been conceived but not yet born , " the pope wrote in his book memory and identity .
" and this time , we are talking about an extermination which has been allowed by nothing less than democratically elected parliaments . " pedophile priest problem tainted papacy pope john paul also presided over one of the most damaging scandals that the catholic church has had to face in modern times : pedophile priests .
scandals , resignations , confessions and expulsions rocked the church in the united states , while similar cases came to light across europe . some critics accused the pope of heading a cover-up .
the catholic church has always been reluctant to make sexual abuse problems public , preferring to deal with the issue internally , or as many believe , not deal with it at all .
critics accused the church of moving pedophile priests between parishes instead of dismissing them which was no solution to the problem .
the pope responded by declaring a policy of zero tolerance for priests found guilty of pedophilia . staunchly opposed to euthanasia the pope was also scathing in his views on euthanasia .
on one visit to the netherlands , the pope chose an appearance at the dutch parliament to condemn the country 's policy on assisted suicide and called for all dutch catholics to uphold the church 's view : " the holy see has made known its clear position and invites catholics in the netherlands always to show their absolute respect for human life , from conception to natural death , " the pope said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recently , just shortly before his health took a fatal turn for the worst , the pope called the doctors , campaigners and government officials who were instrumental in allowing brain-dead american terri schiavo to die " murderers " . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gay groups blast “ cardinal mistake ” to fight love the vatican has slammed same-sex unions as " deviant " and a threat to society in a controversial document .

" i am cautiously optimistic and maintain that the economic recovery will take hold during 2005 , " said lucas papademos , the ecb vice-president , in an interview this week . but that message seems to be more and more out of sync with reality .
the bank that sets monetary policy for the countries sharing the euro has in fact been somewhat embarrassed .
the ecb had begun to prepare financial markets for its first interest-rate increase since june 2003 , most likely in the fourth quarter of this year . real risk of inflation spurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb policymakers had pointed to the low cost of credit that was creating an excess of liquidity , and in particular the strong real estate market in several countries that risked provoking a spurt in inflation .
but weak economic growth in the eurozone threatens to defer that scenario . the anticipated increase in rates had been " reinforced by certain statements by the ecb about the inevitability of rates going up again and also after the revision " of the european stability and growth pact , said patrick artus , director of economic research at cdc ixis in a study published friday .
" we think however that the economic outlook for the eurozone makes a rate increase with the next year or more extremely unlikely , " artus said . the ecb was on the verge of raising rates late last year , a high-level source close to the central bank told afp .
but policymakers changed their minds because of soaring crude oil prices and the euro 's appreciation against the dollar . credibility of single currency at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for ecb watchers , the guardians of the euro are also playing with their credibility .
" by crying wolf , they may end up not being believed , " warned eric chaney , an economist at morgan stanley .
" i do not find it very easy to interpret the ecb , " he said . critics point out by comparison that the us federal reserve , the central bank of the world 's biggest economy , seeks to communicate with absolute clarity .
last year the fed clearly prepared the markets one month before it began to raise interest rates , taking a measured approach to a tougher monetary policy . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the euro 's slow way east the deutsche mark , franc , lira - all currencies that do n't exist anymore .

though their names are among the many being whispered in the vatican hallways as possible papal successors , prominent advisors all lose their powers upon the pope 's death and the cardinal camerlengo or chamberlain , cardinal eduardo martinez somalo , becomes the temporary head of the church .
the pope 's death immediately sets into motion a historic chain of events to elect a successor and prevents any risk of division in the roman catholic church .
successor elected in complete secrecy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prayers of millions are with john paul ii whoever takes over the throne in rome and the 1.1 billion member catholic church is elected 15 to 20 days after the pope 's death in a secret conclave meeting of up to 120 cardinals under the age of 80 in the vatican 's sistine chapel under michelangelo 's awesome fresco of the last judgment , according to a law adopted in 1975 .
opinions are split as to whether the current 117 such cardinals , nearly 100 of whom were appointed by john paul ii , will continue karol wojtyla 's conservative legacy or try to reflect the profound changes that have taken place in the church in choosing a successor , who is most likely to come from among the cardinals themselves .

if this were to happen , strong candidates would include archbishops dionigi tettamanzi , 70 , of milan , angelo scola , 63 , of venice , tarcisio bertone , 70 , of genoa , angelo sodano , 77 , and battista re , 71 .

church on rise in africa , south america if the cardinals decide on a non-italian candidate , the field is wide open .
with church congregations rising across africa , southern asia and latin america , observers see a global church that is increasingly orientated towards the south and away from its european heartland .
africa , where the church is facing competition from islam and other confessions , has a strong candidate in cardinal francis arinze from nigeria , 72 , who heads the vatican congregation for divine worship .
there are also four possible candidates from latin america .
by church estimates the number of catholics in africa has nearly doubled , from 50 million to 90 million , in the past 20 years .
more than two thirds of catholics are now estimated to come from the " global south . "

opinions are split as to whether the current 117 such cardinals , nearly 100 of whom were appointed by john paul ii , will continue karol wojtyla 's conservative legacy or try to reflect the profound changes that have taken place in the church in choosing a successor , who is most likely to come from among the cardinals themselves .

dw-world looks at the key steps for the next several days . immediately after the pope has passed away , a document known as the apostolic constitution drafted by john paul ii himself in 1996 enters into effect .
at this point , the pope ’ s camerlengo -lrb- chamberlain -rrb- verifies the pontiff ’ s death by calling him by his christian name three times .
if there is no response , the chamberlain declares “ the pope is truly dead . ” the confirmation used to be accompanied by the chamberlain tapping the pope ’ s forehead three times with a small silver hammer , but the tradition fell into disuse after pope john xxiii ’ s death in 1963 .
the vatican follows a strict protocol for dealing with the death of a pope .
word is passed through the church ’ s civil service – the curia – and foreign ambassadors and heads of state are informed officially .
vatican radio then flashes news of his death around the world .
in many cities , churches ring their bells to announce the death .
john paul ii ’ s body was then removed from his apartment , which was then locked and sealed .
a small ceremony takes place during which the pope ’ s fisherman ’ s ring and papal seal are broken .
today it is a symbolic act , but historically it was designed to prevent impersonation and forgery . no images or recordings of any kind are permitted to be taken apart from portraits of the pope after his corpse has been suitably prepared to the satisfaction of the camerlengo , cardinal eduardo martinez somalo .
bildunterschrift : many thousands of people pray in a floodlit st. peter 's square at the vatican burial procedure each pope is able to specify his own funeral arrangements .
this time , the vatican will be working to requests drawn up by john paul ii in 1996 . according to experts , the pope ’ s body is likely to be embalmed and then exposed for the veneration of the faithful – most likely in st. peter ’ s basilica . tradition calls for nine days of mourning during which there is a papal interregnum , or interval during which the catholic church is without a spiritual leader .
burial occurs four to six days after death – between wednesday and friday in the case of john paul ii .
the italian news agency ansa , however , reported that the interment would not take place before thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. peter 's basilica in rome the funeral service will take place in st. peter ’ s and heads of state and government as well as religious leaders from around the world will attend . the pope is expected to be buried alongside his immediate predecessors in the crypt under the main altar of st. peter 's basilica .
there have been rumors that john paul ii wanted to be buried in poland , but experts say this is unlikely . how is a successor chosen ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only those cardinals under age 80 may vote for the next pope the election of a new pope does not begin until 15 days after the death of a pontiff .
in the meantime , cardinals from around the world begin arriving at the vatican to participate in a centuries-old ritual called the conclave -lrb- from the latin cum clave meaning “ with key ” -rrb- . those cardinals involved in electing the new pope must be under 80 .
there are 117 eligible to vote for john paul ii ’ s successor .
before the conclave , coalition-builders begin forging alliances .
senior cardinals who may themselves have little chance of becoming pope can still exert a considerable influence over others . on the day the conclave begins , the cardinals move in procession into the sistine chapel , where they will have the option of holding an initial ballot on the first day .
this ballot often serves to gauge the level of support for various candidates .
on the next day the voting process begins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly-elected pope john paul ii raises his arms in greeting the crowd from the balcony of st. peter 's basilica on oct .
16 , 1978 throughout the entire conclave , the cardinals are sequestered in the vatican without outside contact until they choose a new pope .
a two-thirds-plus-one majority is needed for a successful election , otherwise the vote is repeated .
if the right percentage is not met after 12 to 13 days , a simple majority vote may be imposed .
cardinals can not vote for themselves and may be eliminated from consideration if they campaign for support .
until a successor has been elected , there will be four ballots a day .
the ballot papers are burned in an old stove after every second vote .
different chemicals are mixed in to produce black smoke for an inconclusive vote or white smoke for a successful vote , a signal to the public that a new pope has been chosen .
the pope-elect that emerges from the voting is asked whether he accepts becoming the supreme pontiff .
if he answer is yes , he is asked what name he wishes to take .
he then goes to the room of tears , a small room next to the sistine chapel , where he dresses himself in white papal robes , before returning to the conclave to sit near the altar and have a new fisherman ’ s ring put on his finger .
then cardinals then file by to pay homage to the man who from that point on will be considered christ ’ s representative on earth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conclave will convene in the sistine chapel under michelangelo 's " last judgement " the senior cardinal deacon , at the moment chilean cardinal jorge medina estevez , will then step onto the central loggia of st. peter ’ s basilica to proclaim “ habemus papam ” – we have a pope – and the new pontiff will appear on the balcony to deliver his first apostolic blessing to the world . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de john paul ii : passing of a papal giant the vatican announced saturday evening that the pope died at 2027 cet .

an african pontiff ?
how about latin america or india ? no one knows for sure and those who might have an idea - the cardinals who actually choose the next leader of the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics - certainly are n't giving much away . nevertheless the process is underway , triggered automatically by the death saturday of the conservative 84-year-old pope john paul ii who had headed the catholic church since his own election in 1978 . no doubt the impending election will be on their minds when cardinals hold their first congregation monday to begin planning the pontiff 's funeral .
however , the conclave at which cardinals choose a successor must not start until at least two weeks after a pope 's death , but no later than 20 days . one of the few to have talked about the succession , cardinal francis george of the chicago archdiocese , urged the next pope not to make radical changes .
" people think things are up for grabs that are n't up for grabs , " he told a press conference saturday after a memorial mass .
however , he admitted , " we may need a different kind of pope . " in a possible indication of his thinking , he said that although there were good reasons to elect a pope from africa , asia or latin america , he would have to be " acceptable to the romans .
he should speak italian . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who , if any , of the top vatican cardinals will get the job ?
clockwise from top left : vatican secretary of state italian cardinal angelo sodano , german cardinal joseph ratzinger , italian cardinal giovanni battista re , colombian cardinal alfonso lopez trujillo , italian cardinal camillo ruini , us cardinal james stafford .
some vatican insiders think cardinals will likely return to a safe italian candidate - john paul ii was the first non-italian pontiff in 455 years .
" i do n't think the college of electors will risk electing a foreigner .
the italians are the inner circle , " one said under cover of anonymity . a return to italian type in that case , the front-runner could be cardinal dionigi tettamanzi , who as archbishop of milan oversees the most populous diocese in europe .
aged 71 , he is seen as an intellectual , a pastor and someone who would have new ideas . another italian possible is angelo scola , patriarch or archbishop of venice who at 63 counts as one of the church 's younger set . a moderate , he is thought likely to have the backing of opus dei , a highly conservative grouping which has several european and latin american cardinals among its supporters . a south or central american pope ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : away from italy , potential candidates are oscar andres rodriguez maradiaga , the 62-year-old honduran cardinal who has campaigned against poverty ; claudio hummes , archbishop of sao paulo ; and dario castrillon hoyos of colombia . hummes has distanced himself from the terms progressive and conservative and prefers to maintain a strong personal conviction on issues regardless of where they fall in the two camps .
hoyos was responsible for steering the latin american church away from controversial liberation theology and was rewarded by the pope , who appointed him head of the powerful congregation for the clergy , the vatican department which deals directly with the world 's priests . also in the running could be jorge mario bergoglio , the archbishop of buenos aires .
a man of humility who lives a simple existence , bergoglio is an advocate of a traditional and spiritual approach to the role of archbishop .
he once insisted that the entire church of argentina wear garments of public penance for sins committed during the county 's military dictatorship .
a member of the jesuit order , this fact may play against him as the order is supposed to renounce church awards and pledge only to serve the pope , not become one . an indian or african holy father ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian catholics will be praying for pope john paul ii and wondering if one of their won will take his place .
ivan dias , the 69-year-old archbishop of bombay , carries the best hopes of the indian sub-continent .
while an indian national , dias spent most of his life serving as a diplomat for the church around the world before returning home to become bombay 's archbishop .
a fluent multilinguist , dias is a conservative among a large number of more reformist bishops in the asian church . nigeria 's francis arinze is regarded by many as the best non-italian bet .
a conservative , he would become the second african pope after gelasius i in the late fifth century .
he has been the catholic church 's point man for relations with islam , an important factor considering the high profile growth rate of that religion .
arinze is currently the head of the vatican department for divine worship . factors that may influence the cardinals range from policy - conservative or liberal , bridge-builder or doctrinaire - to the mundane , such as whether someone might be a good bureaucrat running the huge vatican machinery but less gifted as a pastor in the field . another element is age .
will they go for someone young to drive the church forward for the foreseeable future at a time of declining belief in god ? french poll favors " more progressive " pope a poll sunday in the daily le paris ien found 53 percent of french people in favor of a " more progressive " pope than john paul ii , while 27 percent wanted continuity and only 13 percent a more traditional successor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinals attend a mass for the late pope john paul ii celebrated by the vatican secretary of state , cardinal angelo sodano on the steps of st. peter 's basilica at the vatican on sunday .
do n't expect any public jockeying by the cardinals , however .
rules say they must abstain under pain of excommunication from any form of agreement or promise that would influence their vote , and they are not allowed to vote for themselves . george , the archbishop of chicago , said he expected debate to be heated but not to last more than a week .
" i think we 'll all be cordial but i expect there will be great differences of opinion , " he said . both john paul ii and his immediate predecessor were compromise candidates who emerged because of deadlocks over cardinals who had initially seemed more promising when the conclaves got under way . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de plenty of variables in papal succession age , nationality and tradition all play a role in the growing speculation about the next man who will take over as head of the roman catholic church .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.04.2005 plenty of variables in papal succession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are more than enough pontifical candidates to choose from age , nationality and tradition all play a role in the growing speculation about the next man who will take over as head of the roman catholic church . ratzinger , battista re and angelo sodano are just three of the names of the many high-ranking vatican figures who are thought to have serious chances at becoming the roman catholic church 's next pontiff .
though their names are among the many being whispered in the vatican hallways as possible papal successors , prominent advisors all lose their powers upon the pope 's death and the cardinal camerlengo or chamberlain , cardinal eduardo martinez somalo , becomes the temporary head of the church .
the pope 's death immediately sets into motion a historic chain of events to elect a successor and prevents any risk of division in the roman catholic church .
successor elected in complete secrecy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the prayers of millions are with john paul ii whoever takes over the throne in rome and the 1.1 billion member catholic church is elected 15 to 20 days after the pope 's death in a secret conclave meeting of up to 120 cardinals under the age of 80 in the vatican 's sistine chapel under michelangelo 's awesome fresco of the last judgment , according to a law adopted in 1975 .
opinions are split as to whether the current 117 such cardinals , nearly 100 of whom were appointed by john paul ii , will continue karol wojtyla 's conservative legacy or try to reflect the profound changes that have taken place in the church in choosing a successor , who is most likely to come from among the cardinals themselves .
age and nationality key issues if the cardinals are reasonably unanimous about the policies they want the church to follow , they are likely to elect a young man to carry out these policies far into the future .
if they can not agree on policies , they are more likely to choose an elderly candidate as a temporary measure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii legacy will be one of conservative orthodoxy under john paul ii , the college of cardinals has become so internationalized and decentralized that the next pope could come from anywhere in the world , although there is a powerful sentiment to return to tradition and elect an italian .
if this were to happen , strong candidates would include archbishops dionigi tettamanzi , 70 , of milan , angelo scola , 63 , of venice , tarcisio bertone , 70 , of genoa , angelo sodano , 77 , and battista re , 71 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith german cardinal joseph ratzinger -lrb- photo -rrb- , 77 , head of the vatican 's congregation for the doctrine of the faith , is also seen as a potential pontiff .
church on rise in africa , south america if the cardinals decide on a non-italian candidate , the field is wide open .
with church congregations rising across africa , southern asia and latin america , observers see a global church that is increasingly orientated towards the south and away from its european heartland .
africa , where the church is facing competition from islam and other confessions , has a strong candidate in cardinal francis arinze from nigeria , 72 , who heads the vatican congregation for divine worship .
there are also four possible candidates from latin america .
by church estimates the number of catholics in africa has nearly doubled , from 50 million to 90 million , in the past 20 years .
more than two thirds of catholics are now estimated to come from the " global south . "
holy spirit said to guide decision in the past , the cardinal electors had to live in frugal quarters in the palace itself , but this time they will stay in hotel-style rooms in a vatican hostelry called santa martha house .
the staff assigned to serve them , including a doctor , a cook and several nuns , are sworn to secrecy on pain of excommunication from the church .
a key factor often ignored by outsiders is that the cardinals believe that the invisible presence of the holy spirit is with them in the sistine chapel guiding their decision . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de john paul ii : passing of a papal giant the vatican announced saturday evening that the pope died at 2027 cet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : passing of a pope pope 's funeral set for friday the question of succession a pope of unity but also division a life at odds with the germans current affairs -pipe- 03.04.2005 what happens after the pope dies ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election of a new pope begins 15 days after the death of a pontiff after the death of pope john paul ii , a strict procedure of events is set into motion leading to the burial and election of a successor .
dw-world looks at the key steps for the next several days . immediately after the pope has passed away , a document known as the apostolic constitution drafted by john paul ii himself in 1996 enters into effect .
at this point , the pope ’ s camerlengo -lrb- chamberlain -rrb- verifies the pontiff ’ s death by calling him by his christian name three times .
if there is no response , the chamberlain declares “ the pope is truly dead . ” the confirmation used to be accompanied by the chamberlain tapping the pope ’ s forehead three times with a small silver hammer , but the tradition fell into disuse after pope john xxiii ’ s death in 1963 .
the vatican follows a strict protocol for dealing with the death of a pope .
word is passed through the church ’ s civil service – the curia – and foreign ambassadors and heads of state are informed officially .
vatican radio then flashes news of his death around the world .
in many cities , churches ring their bells to announce the death .
john paul ii ’ s body was then removed from his apartment , which was then locked and sealed .
a small ceremony takes place during which the pope ’ s fisherman ’ s ring and papal seal are broken .
today it is a symbolic act , but historically it was designed to prevent impersonation and forgery . no images or recordings of any kind are permitted to be taken apart from portraits of the pope after his corpse has been suitably prepared to the satisfaction of the camerlengo , cardinal eduardo martinez somalo .
bildunterschrift : many thousands of people pray in a floodlit st. peter 's square at the vatican burial procedure each pope is able to specify his own funeral arrangements .
this time , the vatican will be working to requests drawn up by john paul ii in 1996 . according to experts , the pope ’ s body is likely to be embalmed and then exposed for the veneration of the faithful – most likely in st. peter ’ s basilica . tradition calls for nine days of mourning during which there is a papal interregnum , or interval during which the catholic church is without a spiritual leader .
burial occurs four to six days after death – between wednesday and friday in the case of john paul ii .

dw-world looks at the key steps for the next several days . immediately after the pope has passed away , a document known as the apostolic constitution drafted by john paul ii himself in 1996 enters into effect .
at this point , the pope ’ s camerlengo -lrb- chamberlain -rrb- verifies the pontiff ’ s death by calling him by his christian name three times .
if there is no response , the chamberlain declares “ the pope is truly dead . ” the confirmation used to be accompanied by the chamberlain tapping the pope ’ s forehead three times with a small silver hammer , but the tradition fell into disuse after pope john xxiii ’ s death in 1963 .
the vatican follows a strict protocol for dealing with the death of a pope .
word is passed through the church ’ s civil service – the curia – and foreign ambassadors and heads of state are informed officially .
vatican radio then flashes news of his death around the world .
in many cities , churches ring their bells to announce the death .
john paul ii ’ s body was then removed from his apartment , which was then locked and sealed .
a small ceremony takes place during which the pope ’ s fisherman ’ s ring and papal seal are broken .
today it is a symbolic act , but historically it was designed to prevent impersonation and forgery . no images or recordings of any kind are permitted to be taken apart from portraits of the pope after his corpse has been suitably prepared to the satisfaction of the camerlengo , cardinal eduardo martinez somalo .
bildunterschrift : many thousands of people pray in a floodlit st. peter 's square at the vatican burial procedure each pope is able to specify his own funeral arrangements .
this time , the vatican will be working to requests drawn up by john paul ii in 1996 . according to experts , the pope ’ s body is likely to be embalmed and then exposed for the veneration of the faithful – most likely in st. peter ’ s basilica . tradition calls for nine days of mourning during which there is a papal interregnum , or interval during which the catholic church is without a spiritual leader .

however , the conclave at which cardinals choose a successor must not start until at least two weeks after a pope 's death , but no later than 20 days . one of the few to have talked about the succession , cardinal francis george of the chicago archdiocese , urged the next pope not to make radical changes .
" people think things are up for grabs that are n't up for grabs , " he told a press conference saturday after a memorial mass .
however , he admitted , " we may need a different kind of pope . " in a possible indication of his thinking , he said that although there were good reasons to elect a pope from africa , asia or latin america , he would have to be " acceptable to the romans .

hoyos was responsible for steering the latin american church away from controversial liberation theology and was rewarded by the pope , who appointed him head of the powerful congregation for the clergy , the vatican department which deals directly with the world 's priests . also in the running could be jorge mario bergoglio , the archbishop of buenos aires .

he has been the catholic church 's point man for relations with islam , an important factor considering the high profile growth rate of that religion .
arinze is currently the head of the vatican department for divine worship . factors that may influence the cardinals range from policy - conservative or liberal , bridge-builder or doctrinaire - to the mundane , such as whether someone might be a good bureaucrat running the huge vatican machinery but less gifted as a pastor in the field . another element is age .

his far-reaching influence , particularly in the developing world , has been blamed for failing to prevent the spread of hiv / aids . he maintained throughout his papacy that the roman catholic church believed abstinence and fidelity within marriage , and not condoms , were the best way to stop the spread of hiv / aids , a message seen by health organizations in particular as an irresponsible one . " the holy see ... believes prevention through education about the sacredness of life and the correct practice of sexuality , that is chastity and faithfulness , is necessary above all other things in order to prevent this disease responsibly , " the pontiff said during one of his last visits abroad in spain in january . the catholic church opposes condoms in all except the rarest of circumstances because they are a form of contraception , which it believes prevents the god-given gift of life .

" i am cautiously optimistic and maintain that the economic recovery will take hold during 2005 , " said lucas papademos , the ecb vice-president , in an interview this week . but that message seems to be more and more out of sync with reality .
the bank that sets monetary policy for the countries sharing the euro has in fact been somewhat embarrassed .
the ecb had begun to prepare financial markets for its first interest-rate increase since june 2003 , most likely in the fourth quarter of this year . real risk of inflation spurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb policymakers had pointed to the low cost of credit that was creating an excess of liquidity , and in particular the strong real estate market in several countries that risked provoking a spurt in inflation .
but weak economic growth in the eurozone threatens to defer that scenario . the anticipated increase in rates had been " reinforced by certain statements by the ecb about the inevitability of rates going up again and also after the revision " of the european stability and growth pact , said patrick artus , director of economic research at cdc ixis in a study published friday .
" we think however that the economic outlook for the eurozone makes a rate increase with the next year or more extremely unlikely , " artus said . the ecb was on the verge of raising rates late last year , a high-level source close to the central bank told afp .
but policymakers changed their minds because of soaring crude oil prices and the euro 's appreciation against the dollar . credibility of single currency at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for ecb watchers , the guardians of the euro are also playing with their credibility .
" by crying wolf , they may end up not being believed , " warned eric chaney , an economist at morgan stanley .
" i do not find it very easy to interpret the ecb , " he said . critics point out by comparison that the us federal reserve , the central bank of the world 's biggest economy , seeks to communicate with absolute clarity .
last year the fed clearly prepared the markets one month before it began to raise interest rates , taking a measured approach to a tougher monetary policy . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the euro 's slow way east the deutsche mark , franc , lira - all currencies that do n't exist anymore .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : passing of a pope pope 's funeral set for friday a life at odds with the germans a pope of unity but also division what happens after the pope dies ? current affairs -pipe- 03.04.2005 the question of succession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speculation is rife over which candidate will become the new pope with the death of pope john paul ii , a chain of events laid down by centuries of papal tradition swung into action , but who will emerge as the next pontiff is a guess no one dares to hazard . a pope from italy , reverting to habit ?
an african pontiff ?
how about latin america or india ? no one knows for sure and those who might have an idea - the cardinals who actually choose the next leader of the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics - certainly are n't giving much away . nevertheless the process is underway , triggered automatically by the death saturday of the conservative 84-year-old pope john paul ii who had headed the catholic church since his own election in 1978 . no doubt the impending election will be on their minds when cardinals hold their first congregation monday to begin planning the pontiff 's funeral .

how about latin america or india ? no one knows for sure and those who might have an idea - the cardinals who actually choose the next leader of the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics - certainly are n't giving much away . nevertheless the process is underway , triggered automatically by the death saturday of the conservative 84-year-old pope john paul ii who had headed the catholic church since his own election in 1978 . no doubt the impending election will be on their minds when cardinals hold their first congregation monday to begin planning the pontiff 's funeral .

" i am cautiously optimistic and maintain that the economic recovery will take hold during 2005 , " said lucas papademos , the ecb vice-president , in an interview this week . but that message seems to be more and more out of sync with reality .
the bank that sets monetary policy for the countries sharing the euro has in fact been somewhat embarrassed .
the ecb had begun to prepare financial markets for its first interest-rate increase since june 2003 , most likely in the fourth quarter of this year . real risk of inflation spurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb policymakers had pointed to the low cost of credit that was creating an excess of liquidity , and in particular the strong real estate market in several countries that risked provoking a spurt in inflation .
but weak economic growth in the eurozone threatens to defer that scenario . the anticipated increase in rates had been " reinforced by certain statements by the ecb about the inevitability of rates going up again and also after the revision " of the european stability and growth pact , said patrick artus , director of economic research at cdc ixis in a study published friday .
" we think however that the economic outlook for the eurozone makes a rate increase with the next year or more extremely unlikely , " artus said . the ecb was on the verge of raising rates late last year , a high-level source close to the central bank told afp .
but policymakers changed their minds because of soaring crude oil prices and the euro 's appreciation against the dollar . credibility of single currency at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for ecb watchers , the guardians of the euro are also playing with their credibility .
" by crying wolf , they may end up not being believed , " warned eric chaney , an economist at morgan stanley .
" i do not find it very easy to interpret the ecb , " he said . critics point out by comparison that the us federal reserve , the central bank of the world 's biggest economy , seeks to communicate with absolute clarity .
last year the fed clearly prepared the markets one month before it began to raise interest rates , taking a measured approach to a tougher monetary policy . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the euro 's slow way east the deutsche mark , franc , lira - all currencies that do n't exist anymore .

bildunterschrift : many thousands of people pray in a floodlit st. peter 's square at the vatican burial procedure each pope is able to specify his own funeral arrangements .
this time , the vatican will be working to requests drawn up by john paul ii in 1996 . according to experts , the pope ’ s body is likely to be embalmed and then exposed for the veneration of the faithful – most likely in st. peter ’ s basilica . tradition calls for nine days of mourning during which there is a papal interregnum , or interval during which the catholic church is without a spiritual leader .
burial occurs four to six days after death – between wednesday and friday in the case of john paul ii .
the italian news agency ansa , however , reported that the interment would not take place before thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. peter 's basilica in rome the funeral service will take place in st. peter ’ s and heads of state and government as well as religious leaders from around the world will attend . the pope is expected to be buried alongside his immediate predecessors in the crypt under the main altar of st. peter 's basilica .
there have been rumors that john paul ii wanted to be buried in poland , but experts say this is unlikely . how is a successor chosen ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only those cardinals under age 80 may vote for the next pope the election of a new pope does not begin until 15 days after the death of a pontiff .
in the meantime , cardinals from around the world begin arriving at the vatican to participate in a centuries-old ritual called the conclave -lrb- from the latin cum clave meaning “ with key ” -rrb- . those cardinals involved in electing the new pope must be under 80 .
there are 117 eligible to vote for john paul ii ’ s successor .
before the conclave , coalition-builders begin forging alliances .
senior cardinals who may themselves have little chance of becoming pope can still exert a considerable influence over others . on the day the conclave begins , the cardinals move in procession into the sistine chapel , where they will have the option of holding an initial ballot on the first day .
this ballot often serves to gauge the level of support for various candidates .
on the next day the voting process begins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly-elected pope john paul ii raises his arms in greeting the crowd from the balcony of st. peter 's basilica on oct .
16 , 1978 throughout the entire conclave , the cardinals are sequestered in the vatican without outside contact until they choose a new pope .
a two-thirds-plus-one majority is needed for a successful election , otherwise the vote is repeated .
if the right percentage is not met after 12 to 13 days , a simple majority vote may be imposed .
cardinals can not vote for themselves and may be eliminated from consideration if they campaign for support .
until a successor has been elected , there will be four ballots a day .
the ballot papers are burned in an old stove after every second vote .
different chemicals are mixed in to produce black smoke for an inconclusive vote or white smoke for a successful vote , a signal to the public that a new pope has been chosen .
the pope-elect that emerges from the voting is asked whether he accepts becoming the supreme pontiff .
if he answer is yes , he is asked what name he wishes to take .
he then goes to the room of tears , a small room next to the sistine chapel , where he dresses himself in white papal robes , before returning to the conclave to sit near the altar and have a new fisherman ’ s ring put on his finger .
then cardinals then file by to pay homage to the man who from that point on will be considered christ ’ s representative on earth .

his far-reaching influence , particularly in the developing world , has been blamed for failing to prevent the spread of hiv / aids . he maintained throughout his papacy that the roman catholic church believed abstinence and fidelity within marriage , and not condoms , were the best way to stop the spread of hiv / aids , a message seen by health organizations in particular as an irresponsible one . " the holy see ... believes prevention through education about the sacredness of life and the correct practice of sexuality , that is chastity and faithfulness , is necessary above all other things in order to prevent this disease responsibly , " the pontiff said during one of his last visits abroad in spain in january . the catholic church opposes condoms in all except the rarest of circumstances because they are a form of contraception , which it believes prevents the god-given gift of life .
the pope held the church 's hard line that promoting the use of condoms to fight the spread of aids fostered what he saw as immoral and hedonistic lifestyles and behavior that will only contribute to its spread .
there were even reports that the church was sending out messages in africa that condoms actually caused hiv / aids . the pope 's stance on same-sex relationships was also a source of conflict .
the pope referred to homosexuality as " part of a new ideology of evil , perhaps more insidious and hidden , which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man . "
he was staunchly opposed to gay marriage and publicly expressed his concerns that governments around the world were being put under pressure to legalize same-sex unions . gay rights groups accuse pope of complicity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter tatchell , of gay human rights group outrage , said in a statement in the wake of the pope 's death : " history will judge the pope harshly .
his opposition to the use of condoms to prevent the spread of hiv has condemned millions of people to die an agonizing , needless death . " " millions of children in developing countries are orphans ; having lost their parents to aids because of the pope ’ s anti-condom dogma , " tatchell added .
" pope john paul ii waged a ceaseless war against the human rights of women and gay people ; opposing the right of women to control their own fertility ; blocking women ’ s equality in the church ; and endorsing state-sponsored discrimination against lesbians and gay men . "
many hope for a new liberal pontiff gay catholic group rainbow sash hoped the next pope would take a more liberal view on homosexuality .
" there 's a lot of gays and lesbians out there who have a strong faith and a strong commitment to the church and they are still continually cut out of the loop , " spokesman george barbary said in the group 's own statement .
" that 's an important message that 's been lost and one can only hope for change . "
the polish pontiff was also staunch defender of traditional church policies on women , refusing to consider ordaining them as priests , enforcing contraception decrees and opposing abortion . " a fifth-century pope in terms of who women are " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gisela forster , left , and christine mayr-lumetzberger wear white robes as they bear a figure of pope john paul ii. during a protest campaign against the threat of being excommunicated by the vatican in munich , southern germany , july 22 , 2002 .
they are two of the seven women who were ordained as priests by argentine bishop romulo braschi in defiance of the ban of catholic church on female clergy .
the pope excommunicated the seven women monday , aug .
5 , 2002 .
" he will go down in history as a pope who did n't understand and who was n't friendly to women , " frances kissling , president of the liberal washington d.c.-based activist group catholics for a free choice , said of john paul in a statement .
" he could n't have slammed the door shut more loudly on the question of the ordination of women .
he will go down as a fifth-century pope in terms of who women are . " the vatican was rounded on by women in 2004 for issuing a long-awaited document on men and women that charged that feminists were " adversaries of men " who undermined families and paved the way for acceptance of gay marriage . parallels between abortion and holocaust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actresses whoopi goldberg , right , and christine lahti , left , yell at anti-abortion demonstrators in washington , sunday , april 25 , 2004 , during an abortion rights rally and march .
the day , which focused on protecting women 's reproductive rights , included men and women from across the country along with activists from nearly 60 countries .
the pope 's views on abortion may have endeared himself to the christian right in the united states but angered and dismayed many others around the world .
john paul accused governments which allowed abortion of committing murder on a huge scale , even at one stage drawing parallels between abortion and the holocaust . " there is still , however , a legal extermination of human beings who have been conceived but not yet born , " the pope wrote in his book memory and identity .
" and this time , we are talking about an extermination which has been allowed by nothing less than democratically elected parliaments . " pedophile priest problem tainted papacy pope john paul also presided over one of the most damaging scandals that the catholic church has had to face in modern times : pedophile priests .
scandals , resignations , confessions and expulsions rocked the church in the united states , while similar cases came to light across europe . some critics accused the pope of heading a cover-up .
the catholic church has always been reluctant to make sexual abuse problems public , preferring to deal with the issue internally , or as many believe , not deal with it at all .
critics accused the church of moving pedophile priests between parishes instead of dismissing them which was no solution to the problem .
the pope responded by declaring a policy of zero tolerance for priests found guilty of pedophilia . staunchly opposed to euthanasia the pope was also scathing in his views on euthanasia .
on one visit to the netherlands , the pope chose an appearance at the dutch parliament to condemn the country 's policy on assisted suicide and called for all dutch catholics to uphold the church 's view : " the holy see has made known its clear position and invites catholics in the netherlands always to show their absolute respect for human life , from conception to natural death , " the pope said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recently , just shortly before his health took a fatal turn for the worst , the pope called the doctors , campaigners and government officials who were instrumental in allowing brain-dead american terri schiavo to die " murderers " . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gay groups blast “ cardinal mistake ” to fight love the vatican has slammed same-sex unions as " deviant " and a threat to society in a controversial document .

dw-world looks at the key steps for the next several days . immediately after the pope has passed away , a document known as the apostolic constitution drafted by john paul ii himself in 1996 enters into effect .
at this point , the pope ’ s camerlengo -lrb- chamberlain -rrb- verifies the pontiff ’ s death by calling him by his christian name three times .
if there is no response , the chamberlain declares “ the pope is truly dead . ” the confirmation used to be accompanied by the chamberlain tapping the pope ’ s forehead three times with a small silver hammer , but the tradition fell into disuse after pope john xxiii ’ s death in 1963 .
the vatican follows a strict protocol for dealing with the death of a pope .
word is passed through the church ’ s civil service – the curia – and foreign ambassadors and heads of state are informed officially .
vatican radio then flashes news of his death around the world .
in many cities , churches ring their bells to announce the death .
john paul ii ’ s body was then removed from his apartment , which was then locked and sealed .
a small ceremony takes place during which the pope ’ s fisherman ’ s ring and papal seal are broken .
today it is a symbolic act , but historically it was designed to prevent impersonation and forgery . no images or recordings of any kind are permitted to be taken apart from portraits of the pope after his corpse has been suitably prepared to the satisfaction of the camerlengo , cardinal eduardo martinez somalo .

an african pontiff ?
how about latin america or india ? no one knows for sure and those who might have an idea - the cardinals who actually choose the next leader of the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics - certainly are n't giving much away . nevertheless the process is underway , triggered automatically by the death saturday of the conservative 84-year-old pope john paul ii who had headed the catholic church since his own election in 1978 . no doubt the impending election will be on their minds when cardinals hold their first congregation monday to begin planning the pontiff 's funeral .
however , the conclave at which cardinals choose a successor must not start until at least two weeks after a pope 's death , but no later than 20 days . one of the few to have talked about the succession , cardinal francis george of the chicago archdiocese , urged the next pope not to make radical changes .
" people think things are up for grabs that are n't up for grabs , " he told a press conference saturday after a memorial mass .
however , he admitted , " we may need a different kind of pope . " in a possible indication of his thinking , he said that although there were good reasons to elect a pope from africa , asia or latin america , he would have to be " acceptable to the romans .
he should speak italian . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who , if any , of the top vatican cardinals will get the job ?
clockwise from top left : vatican secretary of state italian cardinal angelo sodano , german cardinal joseph ratzinger , italian cardinal giovanni battista re , colombian cardinal alfonso lopez trujillo , italian cardinal camillo ruini , us cardinal james stafford .
some vatican insiders think cardinals will likely return to a safe italian candidate - john paul ii was the first non-italian pontiff in 455 years .
" i do n't think the college of electors will risk electing a foreigner .
the italians are the inner circle , " one said under cover of anonymity . a return to italian type in that case , the front-runner could be cardinal dionigi tettamanzi , who as archbishop of milan oversees the most populous diocese in europe .
aged 71 , he is seen as an intellectual , a pastor and someone who would have new ideas . another italian possible is angelo scola , patriarch or archbishop of venice who at 63 counts as one of the church 's younger set . a moderate , he is thought likely to have the backing of opus dei , a highly conservative grouping which has several european and latin american cardinals among its supporters . a south or central american pope ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : away from italy , potential candidates are oscar andres rodriguez maradiaga , the 62-year-old honduran cardinal who has campaigned against poverty ; claudio hummes , archbishop of sao paulo ; and dario castrillon hoyos of colombia . hummes has distanced himself from the terms progressive and conservative and prefers to maintain a strong personal conviction on issues regardless of where they fall in the two camps .
hoyos was responsible for steering the latin american church away from controversial liberation theology and was rewarded by the pope , who appointed him head of the powerful congregation for the clergy , the vatican department which deals directly with the world 's priests . also in the running could be jorge mario bergoglio , the archbishop of buenos aires .
a man of humility who lives a simple existence , bergoglio is an advocate of a traditional and spiritual approach to the role of archbishop .
he once insisted that the entire church of argentina wear garments of public penance for sins committed during the county 's military dictatorship .
a member of the jesuit order , this fact may play against him as the order is supposed to renounce church awards and pledge only to serve the pope , not become one . an indian or african holy father ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian catholics will be praying for pope john paul ii and wondering if one of their won will take his place .
ivan dias , the 69-year-old archbishop of bombay , carries the best hopes of the indian sub-continent .
while an indian national , dias spent most of his life serving as a diplomat for the church around the world before returning home to become bombay 's archbishop .
a fluent multilinguist , dias is a conservative among a large number of more reformist bishops in the asian church . nigeria 's francis arinze is regarded by many as the best non-italian bet .
a conservative , he would become the second african pope after gelasius i in the late fifth century .
he has been the catholic church 's point man for relations with islam , an important factor considering the high profile growth rate of that religion .
arinze is currently the head of the vatican department for divine worship . factors that may influence the cardinals range from policy - conservative or liberal , bridge-builder or doctrinaire - to the mundane , such as whether someone might be a good bureaucrat running the huge vatican machinery but less gifted as a pastor in the field . another element is age .
will they go for someone young to drive the church forward for the foreseeable future at a time of declining belief in god ? french poll favors " more progressive " pope a poll sunday in the daily le paris ien found 53 percent of french people in favor of a " more progressive " pope than john paul ii , while 27 percent wanted continuity and only 13 percent a more traditional successor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinals attend a mass for the late pope john paul ii celebrated by the vatican secretary of state , cardinal angelo sodano on the steps of st. peter 's basilica at the vatican on sunday .
do n't expect any public jockeying by the cardinals , however .
rules say they must abstain under pain of excommunication from any form of agreement or promise that would influence their vote , and they are not allowed to vote for themselves . george , the archbishop of chicago , said he expected debate to be heated but not to last more than a week .
" i think we 'll all be cordial but i expect there will be great differences of opinion , " he said . both john paul ii and his immediate predecessor were compromise candidates who emerged because of deadlocks over cardinals who had initially seemed more promising when the conclaves got under way . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de plenty of variables in papal succession age , nationality and tradition all play a role in the growing speculation about the next man who will take over as head of the roman catholic church .

though their names are among the many being whispered in the vatican hallways as possible papal successors , prominent advisors all lose their powers upon the pope 's death and the cardinal camerlengo or chamberlain , cardinal eduardo martinez somalo , becomes the temporary head of the church .
the pope 's death immediately sets into motion a historic chain of events to elect a successor and prevents any risk of division in the roman catholic church .

opinions are split as to whether the current 117 such cardinals , nearly 100 of whom were appointed by john paul ii , will continue karol wojtyla 's conservative legacy or try to reflect the profound changes that have taken place in the church in choosing a successor , who is most likely to come from among the cardinals themselves .

with church congregations rising across africa , southern asia and latin america , observers see a global church that is increasingly orientated towards the south and away from its european heartland .
africa , where the church is facing competition from islam and other confessions , has a strong candidate in cardinal francis arinze from nigeria , 72 , who heads the vatican congregation for divine worship .

younger germans are taking a greater interest in world war ii but this does not always have positive facets according to the german historian wolfgang wippermann who spoke with dw-world . dw-world : what is the meaning of may 8 for german and world history ?
wolfgang wippermann : may 8 , 1945 is not only an momentous date for german history , but also for world history .
it 's definitely comparable to the reformation , the french revolution and the bolshevik revolution .
it is simply an epochal date in world history .
it was then that a new era began and was the end of a horrendous one - the era of fascism .
in germany the date is often spoken of as a new beginning , a stunde null , that 's to say the country 's " zero hour . "
how do you judge this ?
there was no stunde null like we viewed it .
instead , there was a strong road of continuity , not a restoration .
it was a kind of continuity that revealed itself in the elite before the third reich and also afterwards .
for example , there were more nazis in the foreign office after 1945 than before .
it was wishful thinking to believe that on may 8 , 1945 history ended to a more or less greater extent , that a " zero hour " took place and we were reborn .
that did n't happen .
it must be added , however , that the end of the war or the collapse of the third reich was very important for the collective memory of the germans .
which catastrophe in germany had a greater effect on the country , the political or the moral one ?
the first problem is the term " catastrophe " which friedrich meineke already coined with regard to 1945 in his book " the german catastrophe " in 1946 .
indeed , the end of the war was perceived as a catastrophe for the germans but that was historically completely wrong .
the actual catastrophe was the shoah , the catastrophe that was carried out on the jewish people .
people did n't want to recognize this in germany for a long time .
it was n't until after various historical and political discussions that the true meaning of fascism and the holocaust was recognized : the real catastrophe was the shoah .
how has the view of the second world war and the date may 8 , 1945 changed in germany over the past 60 years ?
there has been a crucial change .
the eighth of may was at one time the day the third reich collapsed , or as people said , the german catastrophe .
there was a long debate as to whether it was the day of liberation or the day of collapse ?
collapse or liberation was a topic of historical-political debates during the 1950 's and 60 's , but most of all in the 70 's and 80 's .
finally , those who called it the day of liberation won the upper hand .
german president richard von weizsäcker made this clear on may 8 , 1985 .
that meant that the important thing was not that it was a german catastrophe but a catastrophe for the jews .
this was a very long , arduous process but one that was concluded positively .
but i must also say that history is not just that which happened .
a historical event is also that which is made of it .
does the german perspective of the second world war conform with that of the world or are there differences ?
there are various controversies that spill beyond borders .
it ca n't be classified as strictly nationally historical .
one thing that is happening in my opinion is that there is no longer a historical-political discussion or one of how to deal with the past .
what 's happening is that may 8 , world war ii , the shoah and the like are being commercialized .
we not only have a historicization but a " knoppization " -lsb- guido knopp is a popular historian who has made numerous documentaries about world war ii for german national television -rsb- of history for commercial purposes .
it has more to do with television ratings and not really with history - knopp 's films are horribly commericialized .
that is the negative side of the awakened interest in history , which on the other hand is positive .
i view it negatively and think it 's also possibly dangerous that history is being commercialized . martin schrader interviewed wolfgang wippermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the end of german jewry " " auschwitz is a symbol of nazi atrocities but the murders happened in many places over a long period of time , " says w. michael blumenthal , director of the jewish museum berlin in a dw-world interview .

that did n't happen .
it must be added , however , that the end of the war or the collapse of the third reich was very important for the collective memory of the germans .
which catastrophe in germany had a greater effect on the country , the political or the moral one ?
the first problem is the term " catastrophe " which friedrich meineke already coined with regard to 1945 in his book " the german catastrophe " in 1946 .
indeed , the end of the war was perceived as a catastrophe for the germans but that was historically completely wrong .
the actual catastrophe was the shoah , the catastrophe that was carried out on the jewish people .
people did n't want to recognize this in germany for a long time .
it was n't until after various historical and political discussions that the true meaning of fascism and the holocaust was recognized : the real catastrophe was the shoah .
how has the view of the second world war and the date may 8 , 1945 changed in germany over the past 60 years ?
there has been a crucial change .
the eighth of may was at one time the day the third reich collapsed , or as people said , the german catastrophe .
there was a long debate as to whether it was the day of liberation or the day of collapse ?
collapse or liberation was a topic of historical-political debates during the 1950 's and 60 's , but most of all in the 70 's and 80 's .
finally , those who called it the day of liberation won the upper hand .
german president richard von weizsäcker made this clear on may 8 , 1985 .
that meant that the important thing was not that it was a german catastrophe but a catastrophe for the jews .
this was a very long , arduous process but one that was concluded positively .
but i must also say that history is not just that which happened .
a historical event is also that which is made of it .
does the german perspective of the second world war conform with that of the world or are there differences ?
there are various controversies that spill beyond borders .
it ca n't be classified as strictly nationally historical .
one thing that is happening in my opinion is that there is no longer a historical-political discussion or one of how to deal with the past .
what 's happening is that may 8 , world war ii , the shoah and the like are being commercialized .
we not only have a historicization but a " knoppization " -lsb- guido knopp is a popular historian who has made numerous documentaries about world war ii for german national television -rsb- of history for commercial purposes .
it has more to do with television ratings and not really with history - knopp 's films are horribly commericialized .
that is the negative side of the awakened interest in history , which on the other hand is positive .
i view it negatively and think it 's also possibly dangerous that history is being commercialized . martin schrader interviewed wolfgang wippermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the end of german jewry " " auschwitz is a symbol of nazi atrocities but the murders happened in many places over a long period of time , " says w. michael blumenthal , director of the jewish museum berlin in a dw-world interview .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : passing of a pope pope 's funeral set for friday a life at odds with the germans the question of succession what happens after the pope dies ? current affairs -pipe- 03.04.2005 a pope of unity but also division großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : loved and respected by millions , the pope 's views angered just as many while millions of people , not only roman catholics , mourned for pope john paul ii , many regarded his influential views as out-of-date and damaging in the modern world . the pope stuck by his convictions on a number of sensitive subjects which brought him and his church into the firing line of liberals and social groups .
his far-reaching influence , particularly in the developing world , has been blamed for failing to prevent the spread of hiv / aids . he maintained throughout his papacy that the roman catholic church believed abstinence and fidelity within marriage , and not condoms , were the best way to stop the spread of hiv / aids , a message seen by health organizations in particular as an irresponsible one . " the holy see ... believes prevention through education about the sacredness of life and the correct practice of sexuality , that is chastity and faithfulness , is necessary above all other things in order to prevent this disease responsibly , " the pontiff said during one of his last visits abroad in spain in january . the catholic church opposes condoms in all except the rarest of circumstances because they are a form of contraception , which it believes prevents the god-given gift of life .
the pope held the church 's hard line that promoting the use of condoms to fight the spread of aids fostered what he saw as immoral and hedonistic lifestyles and behavior that will only contribute to its spread .
there were even reports that the church was sending out messages in africa that condoms actually caused hiv / aids . the pope 's stance on same-sex relationships was also a source of conflict .
the pope referred to homosexuality as " part of a new ideology of evil , perhaps more insidious and hidden , which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man . "
he was staunchly opposed to gay marriage and publicly expressed his concerns that governments around the world were being put under pressure to legalize same-sex unions . gay rights groups accuse pope of complicity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter tatchell , of gay human rights group outrage , said in a statement in the wake of the pope 's death : " history will judge the pope harshly .
his opposition to the use of condoms to prevent the spread of hiv has condemned millions of people to die an agonizing , needless death . " " millions of children in developing countries are orphans ; having lost their parents to aids because of the pope ’ s anti-condom dogma , " tatchell added .
" pope john paul ii waged a ceaseless war against the human rights of women and gay people ; opposing the right of women to control their own fertility ; blocking women ’ s equality in the church ; and endorsing state-sponsored discrimination against lesbians and gay men . "
many hope for a new liberal pontiff gay catholic group rainbow sash hoped the next pope would take a more liberal view on homosexuality .
" there 's a lot of gays and lesbians out there who have a strong faith and a strong commitment to the church and they are still continually cut out of the loop , " spokesman george barbary said in the group 's own statement .
" that 's an important message that 's been lost and one can only hope for change . "
the polish pontiff was also staunch defender of traditional church policies on women , refusing to consider ordaining them as priests , enforcing contraception decrees and opposing abortion .

" i am cautiously optimistic and maintain that the economic recovery will take hold during 2005 , " said lucas papademos , the ecb vice-president , in an interview this week . but that message seems to be more and more out of sync with reality .
the bank that sets monetary policy for the countries sharing the euro has in fact been somewhat embarrassed .
the ecb had begun to prepare financial markets for its first interest-rate increase since june 2003 , most likely in the fourth quarter of this year . real risk of inflation spurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb policymakers had pointed to the low cost of credit that was creating an excess of liquidity , and in particular the strong real estate market in several countries that risked provoking a spurt in inflation .
but weak economic growth in the eurozone threatens to defer that scenario . the anticipated increase in rates had been " reinforced by certain statements by the ecb about the inevitability of rates going up again and also after the revision " of the european stability and growth pact , said patrick artus , director of economic research at cdc ixis in a study published friday .
" we think however that the economic outlook for the eurozone makes a rate increase with the next year or more extremely unlikely , " artus said . the ecb was on the verge of raising rates late last year , a high-level source close to the central bank told afp .
but policymakers changed their minds because of soaring crude oil prices and the euro 's appreciation against the dollar . credibility of single currency at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for ecb watchers , the guardians of the euro are also playing with their credibility .
" by crying wolf , they may end up not being believed , " warned eric chaney , an economist at morgan stanley .
" i do not find it very easy to interpret the ecb , " he said . critics point out by comparison that the us federal reserve , the central bank of the world 's biggest economy , seeks to communicate with absolute clarity .

his far-reaching influence , particularly in the developing world , has been blamed for failing to prevent the spread of hiv / aids . he maintained throughout his papacy that the roman catholic church believed abstinence and fidelity within marriage , and not condoms , were the best way to stop the spread of hiv / aids , a message seen by health organizations in particular as an irresponsible one . " the holy see ... believes prevention through education about the sacredness of life and the correct practice of sexuality , that is chastity and faithfulness , is necessary above all other things in order to prevent this disease responsibly , " the pontiff said during one of his last visits abroad in spain in january . the catholic church opposes condoms in all except the rarest of circumstances because they are a form of contraception , which it believes prevents the god-given gift of life .
the pope held the church 's hard line that promoting the use of condoms to fight the spread of aids fostered what he saw as immoral and hedonistic lifestyles and behavior that will only contribute to its spread .
there were even reports that the church was sending out messages in africa that condoms actually caused hiv / aids . the pope 's stance on same-sex relationships was also a source of conflict .
the pope referred to homosexuality as " part of a new ideology of evil , perhaps more insidious and hidden , which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man . "
he was staunchly opposed to gay marriage and publicly expressed his concerns that governments around the world were being put under pressure to legalize same-sex unions . gay rights groups accuse pope of complicity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter tatchell , of gay human rights group outrage , said in a statement in the wake of the pope 's death : " history will judge the pope harshly .
his opposition to the use of condoms to prevent the spread of hiv has condemned millions of people to die an agonizing , needless death . " " millions of children in developing countries are orphans ; having lost their parents to aids because of the pope ’ s anti-condom dogma , " tatchell added .
" pope john paul ii waged a ceaseless war against the human rights of women and gay people ; opposing the right of women to control their own fertility ; blocking women ’ s equality in the church ; and endorsing state-sponsored discrimination against lesbians and gay men . "
many hope for a new liberal pontiff gay catholic group rainbow sash hoped the next pope would take a more liberal view on homosexuality .
" there 's a lot of gays and lesbians out there who have a strong faith and a strong commitment to the church and they are still continually cut out of the loop , " spokesman george barbary said in the group 's own statement .
" that 's an important message that 's been lost and one can only hope for change . "
the polish pontiff was also staunch defender of traditional church policies on women , refusing to consider ordaining them as priests , enforcing contraception decrees and opposing abortion . " a fifth-century pope in terms of who women are " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gisela forster , left , and christine mayr-lumetzberger wear white robes as they bear a figure of pope john paul ii. during a protest campaign against the threat of being excommunicated by the vatican in munich , southern germany , july 22 , 2002 .
they are two of the seven women who were ordained as priests by argentine bishop romulo braschi in defiance of the ban of catholic church on female clergy .
the pope excommunicated the seven women monday , aug .
5 , 2002 .
" he will go down in history as a pope who did n't understand and who was n't friendly to women , " frances kissling , president of the liberal washington d.c.-based activist group catholics for a free choice , said of john paul in a statement .
" he could n't have slammed the door shut more loudly on the question of the ordination of women .
he will go down as a fifth-century pope in terms of who women are . " the vatican was rounded on by women in 2004 for issuing a long-awaited document on men and women that charged that feminists were " adversaries of men " who undermined families and paved the way for acceptance of gay marriage . parallels between abortion and holocaust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actresses whoopi goldberg , right , and christine lahti , left , yell at anti-abortion demonstrators in washington , sunday , april 25 , 2004 , during an abortion rights rally and march .
the day , which focused on protecting women 's reproductive rights , included men and women from across the country along with activists from nearly 60 countries .
the pope 's views on abortion may have endeared himself to the christian right in the united states but angered and dismayed many others around the world .
john paul accused governments which allowed abortion of committing murder on a huge scale , even at one stage drawing parallels between abortion and the holocaust . " there is still , however , a legal extermination of human beings who have been conceived but not yet born , " the pope wrote in his book memory and identity .
" and this time , we are talking about an extermination which has been allowed by nothing less than democratically elected parliaments . " pedophile priest problem tainted papacy pope john paul also presided over one of the most damaging scandals that the catholic church has had to face in modern times : pedophile priests .
scandals , resignations , confessions and expulsions rocked the church in the united states , while similar cases came to light across europe . some critics accused the pope of heading a cover-up .
the catholic church has always been reluctant to make sexual abuse problems public , preferring to deal with the issue internally , or as many believe , not deal with it at all .
critics accused the church of moving pedophile priests between parishes instead of dismissing them which was no solution to the problem .
the pope responded by declaring a policy of zero tolerance for priests found guilty of pedophilia . staunchly opposed to euthanasia the pope was also scathing in his views on euthanasia .
on one visit to the netherlands , the pope chose an appearance at the dutch parliament to condemn the country 's policy on assisted suicide and called for all dutch catholics to uphold the church 's view : " the holy see has made known its clear position and invites catholics in the netherlands always to show their absolute respect for human life , from conception to natural death , " the pope said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recently , just shortly before his health took a fatal turn for the worst , the pope called the doctors , campaigners and government officials who were instrumental in allowing brain-dead american terri schiavo to die " murderers " . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gay groups blast “ cardinal mistake ” to fight love the vatican has slammed same-sex unions as " deviant " and a threat to society in a controversial document .

an african pontiff ?
how about latin america or india ? no one knows for sure and those who might have an idea - the cardinals who actually choose the next leader of the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics - certainly are n't giving much away . nevertheless the process is underway , triggered automatically by the death saturday of the conservative 84-year-old pope john paul ii who had headed the catholic church since his own election in 1978 . no doubt the impending election will be on their minds when cardinals hold their first congregation monday to begin planning the pontiff 's funeral .
however , the conclave at which cardinals choose a successor must not start until at least two weeks after a pope 's death , but no later than 20 days . one of the few to have talked about the succession , cardinal francis george of the chicago archdiocese , urged the next pope not to make radical changes .
" people think things are up for grabs that are n't up for grabs , " he told a press conference saturday after a memorial mass .
however , he admitted , " we may need a different kind of pope . " in a possible indication of his thinking , he said that although there were good reasons to elect a pope from africa , asia or latin america , he would have to be " acceptable to the romans .
he should speak italian . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who , if any , of the top vatican cardinals will get the job ?
clockwise from top left : vatican secretary of state italian cardinal angelo sodano , german cardinal joseph ratzinger , italian cardinal giovanni battista re , colombian cardinal alfonso lopez trujillo , italian cardinal camillo ruini , us cardinal james stafford .
some vatican insiders think cardinals will likely return to a safe italian candidate - john paul ii was the first non-italian pontiff in 455 years .
" i do n't think the college of electors will risk electing a foreigner .
the italians are the inner circle , " one said under cover of anonymity . a return to italian type in that case , the front-runner could be cardinal dionigi tettamanzi , who as archbishop of milan oversees the most populous diocese in europe .
aged 71 , he is seen as an intellectual , a pastor and someone who would have new ideas . another italian possible is angelo scola , patriarch or archbishop of venice who at 63 counts as one of the church 's younger set . a moderate , he is thought likely to have the backing of opus dei , a highly conservative grouping which has several european and latin american cardinals among its supporters . a south or central american pope ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : away from italy , potential candidates are oscar andres rodriguez maradiaga , the 62-year-old honduran cardinal who has campaigned against poverty ; claudio hummes , archbishop of sao paulo ; and dario castrillon hoyos of colombia . hummes has distanced himself from the terms progressive and conservative and prefers to maintain a strong personal conviction on issues regardless of where they fall in the two camps .
hoyos was responsible for steering the latin american church away from controversial liberation theology and was rewarded by the pope , who appointed him head of the powerful congregation for the clergy , the vatican department which deals directly with the world 's priests . also in the running could be jorge mario bergoglio , the archbishop of buenos aires .
a man of humility who lives a simple existence , bergoglio is an advocate of a traditional and spiritual approach to the role of archbishop .
he once insisted that the entire church of argentina wear garments of public penance for sins committed during the county 's military dictatorship .
a member of the jesuit order , this fact may play against him as the order is supposed to renounce church awards and pledge only to serve the pope , not become one . an indian or african holy father ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian catholics will be praying for pope john paul ii and wondering if one of their won will take his place .
ivan dias , the 69-year-old archbishop of bombay , carries the best hopes of the indian sub-continent .
while an indian national , dias spent most of his life serving as a diplomat for the church around the world before returning home to become bombay 's archbishop .
a fluent multilinguist , dias is a conservative among a large number of more reformist bishops in the asian church . nigeria 's francis arinze is regarded by many as the best non-italian bet .
a conservative , he would become the second african pope after gelasius i in the late fifth century .
he has been the catholic church 's point man for relations with islam , an important factor considering the high profile growth rate of that religion .
arinze is currently the head of the vatican department for divine worship . factors that may influence the cardinals range from policy - conservative or liberal , bridge-builder or doctrinaire - to the mundane , such as whether someone might be a good bureaucrat running the huge vatican machinery but less gifted as a pastor in the field . another element is age .
will they go for someone young to drive the church forward for the foreseeable future at a time of declining belief in god ? french poll favors " more progressive " pope a poll sunday in the daily le paris ien found 53 percent of french people in favor of a " more progressive " pope than john paul ii , while 27 percent wanted continuity and only 13 percent a more traditional successor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinals attend a mass for the late pope john paul ii celebrated by the vatican secretary of state , cardinal angelo sodano on the steps of st. peter 's basilica at the vatican on sunday .
do n't expect any public jockeying by the cardinals , however .
rules say they must abstain under pain of excommunication from any form of agreement or promise that would influence their vote , and they are not allowed to vote for themselves . george , the archbishop of chicago , said he expected debate to be heated but not to last more than a week .
" i think we 'll all be cordial but i expect there will be great differences of opinion , " he said . both john paul ii and his immediate predecessor were compromise candidates who emerged because of deadlocks over cardinals who had initially seemed more promising when the conclaves got under way . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de plenty of variables in papal succession age , nationality and tradition all play a role in the growing speculation about the next man who will take over as head of the roman catholic church .

younger germans are taking a greater interest in world war ii but this does not always have positive facets according to the german historian wolfgang wippermann who spoke with dw-world . dw-world : what is the meaning of may 8 for german and world history ?
wolfgang wippermann : may 8 , 1945 is not only an momentous date for german history , but also for world history .
it 's definitely comparable to the reformation , the french revolution and the bolshevik revolution .
it is simply an epochal date in world history .
it was then that a new era began and was the end of a horrendous one - the era of fascism .
in germany the date is often spoken of as a new beginning , a stunde null , that 's to say the country 's " zero hour . "
how do you judge this ?
there was no stunde null like we viewed it .
instead , there was a strong road of continuity , not a restoration .
it was a kind of continuity that revealed itself in the elite before the third reich and also afterwards .
for example , there were more nazis in the foreign office after 1945 than before .
it was wishful thinking to believe that on may 8 , 1945 history ended to a more or less greater extent , that a " zero hour " took place and we were reborn .
that did n't happen .
it must be added , however , that the end of the war or the collapse of the third reich was very important for the collective memory of the germans .
which catastrophe in germany had a greater effect on the country , the political or the moral one ?
the first problem is the term " catastrophe " which friedrich meineke already coined with regard to 1945 in his book " the german catastrophe " in 1946 .
indeed , the end of the war was perceived as a catastrophe for the germans but that was historically completely wrong .
the actual catastrophe was the shoah , the catastrophe that was carried out on the jewish people .
people did n't want to recognize this in germany for a long time .
it was n't until after various historical and political discussions that the true meaning of fascism and the holocaust was recognized : the real catastrophe was the shoah .
how has the view of the second world war and the date may 8 , 1945 changed in germany over the past 60 years ?
there has been a crucial change .
the eighth of may was at one time the day the third reich collapsed , or as people said , the german catastrophe .
there was a long debate as to whether it was the day of liberation or the day of collapse ?
collapse or liberation was a topic of historical-political debates during the 1950 's and 60 's , but most of all in the 70 's and 80 's .
finally , those who called it the day of liberation won the upper hand .
german president richard von weizsäcker made this clear on may 8 , 1985 .
that meant that the important thing was not that it was a german catastrophe but a catastrophe for the jews .
this was a very long , arduous process but one that was concluded positively .
but i must also say that history is not just that which happened .
a historical event is also that which is made of it .
does the german perspective of the second world war conform with that of the world or are there differences ?
there are various controversies that spill beyond borders .
it ca n't be classified as strictly nationally historical .
one thing that is happening in my opinion is that there is no longer a historical-political discussion or one of how to deal with the past .
what 's happening is that may 8 , world war ii , the shoah and the like are being commercialized .
we not only have a historicization but a " knoppization " -lsb- guido knopp is a popular historian who has made numerous documentaries about world war ii for german national television -rsb- of history for commercial purposes .
it has more to do with television ratings and not really with history - knopp 's films are horribly commericialized .
that is the negative side of the awakened interest in history , which on the other hand is positive .
i view it negatively and think it 's also possibly dangerous that history is being commercialized . martin schrader interviewed wolfgang wippermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the end of german jewry " " auschwitz is a symbol of nazi atrocities but the murders happened in many places over a long period of time , " says w. michael blumenthal , director of the jewish museum berlin in a dw-world interview .

younger germans are taking a greater interest in world war ii but this does not always have positive facets according to the german historian wolfgang wippermann who spoke with dw-world . dw-world : what is the meaning of may 8 for german and world history ?
wolfgang wippermann : may 8 , 1945 is not only an momentous date for german history , but also for world history .
it 's definitely comparable to the reformation , the french revolution and the bolshevik revolution .
it is simply an epochal date in world history .
it was then that a new era began and was the end of a horrendous one - the era of fascism .
in germany the date is often spoken of as a new beginning , a stunde null , that 's to say the country 's " zero hour . "
how do you judge this ?
there was no stunde null like we viewed it .
instead , there was a strong road of continuity , not a restoration .
it was a kind of continuity that revealed itself in the elite before the third reich and also afterwards .
for example , there were more nazis in the foreign office after 1945 than before .
it was wishful thinking to believe that on may 8 , 1945 history ended to a more or less greater extent , that a " zero hour " took place and we were reborn .
that did n't happen .
it must be added , however , that the end of the war or the collapse of the third reich was very important for the collective memory of the germans .
which catastrophe in germany had a greater effect on the country , the political or the moral one ?
the first problem is the term " catastrophe " which friedrich meineke already coined with regard to 1945 in his book " the german catastrophe " in 1946 .
indeed , the end of the war was perceived as a catastrophe for the germans but that was historically completely wrong .
the actual catastrophe was the shoah , the catastrophe that was carried out on the jewish people .
people did n't want to recognize this in germany for a long time .
it was n't until after various historical and political discussions that the true meaning of fascism and the holocaust was recognized : the real catastrophe was the shoah .
how has the view of the second world war and the date may 8 , 1945 changed in germany over the past 60 years ?
there has been a crucial change .
the eighth of may was at one time the day the third reich collapsed , or as people said , the german catastrophe .
there was a long debate as to whether it was the day of liberation or the day of collapse ?
collapse or liberation was a topic of historical-political debates during the 1950 's and 60 's , but most of all in the 70 's and 80 's .
finally , those who called it the day of liberation won the upper hand .
german president richard von weizsäcker made this clear on may 8 , 1985 .
that meant that the important thing was not that it was a german catastrophe but a catastrophe for the jews .
this was a very long , arduous process but one that was concluded positively .
but i must also say that history is not just that which happened .
a historical event is also that which is made of it .
does the german perspective of the second world war conform with that of the world or are there differences ?
there are various controversies that spill beyond borders .
it ca n't be classified as strictly nationally historical .
one thing that is happening in my opinion is that there is no longer a historical-political discussion or one of how to deal with the past .
what 's happening is that may 8 , world war ii , the shoah and the like are being commercialized .
we not only have a historicization but a " knoppization " -lsb- guido knopp is a popular historian who has made numerous documentaries about world war ii for german national television -rsb- of history for commercial purposes .
it has more to do with television ratings and not really with history - knopp 's films are horribly commericialized .
that is the negative side of the awakened interest in history , which on the other hand is positive .
i view it negatively and think it 's also possibly dangerous that history is being commercialized . martin schrader interviewed wolfgang wippermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the end of german jewry " " auschwitz is a symbol of nazi atrocities but the murders happened in many places over a long period of time , " says w. michael blumenthal , director of the jewish museum berlin in a dw-world interview .

dw-world looks at the key steps for the next several days . immediately after the pope has passed away , a document known as the apostolic constitution drafted by john paul ii himself in 1996 enters into effect .
at this point , the pope ’ s camerlengo -lrb- chamberlain -rrb- verifies the pontiff ’ s death by calling him by his christian name three times .
if there is no response , the chamberlain declares “ the pope is truly dead . ” the confirmation used to be accompanied by the chamberlain tapping the pope ’ s forehead three times with a small silver hammer , but the tradition fell into disuse after pope john xxiii ’ s death in 1963 .
the vatican follows a strict protocol for dealing with the death of a pope .
word is passed through the church ’ s civil service – the curia – and foreign ambassadors and heads of state are informed officially .
vatican radio then flashes news of his death around the world .
in many cities , churches ring their bells to announce the death .
john paul ii ’ s body was then removed from his apartment , which was then locked and sealed .
a small ceremony takes place during which the pope ’ s fisherman ’ s ring and papal seal are broken .
today it is a symbolic act , but historically it was designed to prevent impersonation and forgery . no images or recordings of any kind are permitted to be taken apart from portraits of the pope after his corpse has been suitably prepared to the satisfaction of the camerlengo , cardinal eduardo martinez somalo .
bildunterschrift : many thousands of people pray in a floodlit st. peter 's square at the vatican burial procedure each pope is able to specify his own funeral arrangements .
this time , the vatican will be working to requests drawn up by john paul ii in 1996 . according to experts , the pope ’ s body is likely to be embalmed and then exposed for the veneration of the faithful – most likely in st. peter ’ s basilica . tradition calls for nine days of mourning during which there is a papal interregnum , or interval during which the catholic church is without a spiritual leader .
burial occurs four to six days after death – between wednesday and friday in the case of john paul ii .
the italian news agency ansa , however , reported that the interment would not take place before thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. peter 's basilica in rome the funeral service will take place in st. peter ’ s and heads of state and government as well as religious leaders from around the world will attend . the pope is expected to be buried alongside his immediate predecessors in the crypt under the main altar of st. peter 's basilica .
there have been rumors that john paul ii wanted to be buried in poland , but experts say this is unlikely . how is a successor chosen ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only those cardinals under age 80 may vote for the next pope the election of a new pope does not begin until 15 days after the death of a pontiff .
in the meantime , cardinals from around the world begin arriving at the vatican to participate in a centuries-old ritual called the conclave -lrb- from the latin cum clave meaning “ with key ” -rrb- . those cardinals involved in electing the new pope must be under 80 .
there are 117 eligible to vote for john paul ii ’ s successor .
before the conclave , coalition-builders begin forging alliances .
senior cardinals who may themselves have little chance of becoming pope can still exert a considerable influence over others . on the day the conclave begins , the cardinals move in procession into the sistine chapel , where they will have the option of holding an initial ballot on the first day .
this ballot often serves to gauge the level of support for various candidates .
on the next day the voting process begins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly-elected pope john paul ii raises his arms in greeting the crowd from the balcony of st. peter 's basilica on oct .
16 , 1978 throughout the entire conclave , the cardinals are sequestered in the vatican without outside contact until they choose a new pope .
a two-thirds-plus-one majority is needed for a successful election , otherwise the vote is repeated .
if the right percentage is not met after 12 to 13 days , a simple majority vote may be imposed .
cardinals can not vote for themselves and may be eliminated from consideration if they campaign for support .
until a successor has been elected , there will be four ballots a day .
the ballot papers are burned in an old stove after every second vote .
different chemicals are mixed in to produce black smoke for an inconclusive vote or white smoke for a successful vote , a signal to the public that a new pope has been chosen .
the pope-elect that emerges from the voting is asked whether he accepts becoming the supreme pontiff .
if he answer is yes , he is asked what name he wishes to take .
he then goes to the room of tears , a small room next to the sistine chapel , where he dresses himself in white papal robes , before returning to the conclave to sit near the altar and have a new fisherman ’ s ring put on his finger .
then cardinals then file by to pay homage to the man who from that point on will be considered christ ’ s representative on earth .

how about latin america or india ? no one knows for sure and those who might have an idea - the cardinals who actually choose the next leader of the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics - certainly are n't giving much away . nevertheless the process is underway , triggered automatically by the death saturday of the conservative 84-year-old pope john paul ii who had headed the catholic church since his own election in 1978 . no doubt the impending election will be on their minds when cardinals hold their first congregation monday to begin planning the pontiff 's funeral .
however , the conclave at which cardinals choose a successor must not start until at least two weeks after a pope 's death , but no later than 20 days . one of the few to have talked about the succession , cardinal francis george of the chicago archdiocese , urged the next pope not to make radical changes .
" people think things are up for grabs that are n't up for grabs , " he told a press conference saturday after a memorial mass .
however , he admitted , " we may need a different kind of pope . " in a possible indication of his thinking , he said that although there were good reasons to elect a pope from africa , asia or latin america , he would have to be " acceptable to the romans .

some vatican insiders think cardinals will likely return to a safe italian candidate - john paul ii was the first non-italian pontiff in 455 years .
" i do n't think the college of electors will risk electing a foreigner .
the italians are the inner circle , " one said under cover of anonymity . a return to italian type in that case , the front-runner could be cardinal dionigi tettamanzi , who as archbishop of milan oversees the most populous diocese in europe .

hoyos was responsible for steering the latin american church away from controversial liberation theology and was rewarded by the pope , who appointed him head of the powerful congregation for the clergy , the vatican department which deals directly with the world 's priests . also in the running could be jorge mario bergoglio , the archbishop of buenos aires .
a man of humility who lives a simple existence , bergoglio is an advocate of a traditional and spiritual approach to the role of archbishop .
he once insisted that the entire church of argentina wear garments of public penance for sins committed during the county 's military dictatorship .

ivan dias , the 69-year-old archbishop of bombay , carries the best hopes of the indian sub-continent .
while an indian national , dias spent most of his life serving as a diplomat for the church around the world before returning home to become bombay 's archbishop .

a conservative , he would become the second african pope after gelasius i in the late fifth century .
he has been the catholic church 's point man for relations with islam , an important factor considering the high profile growth rate of that religion .
arinze is currently the head of the vatican department for divine worship . factors that may influence the cardinals range from policy - conservative or liberal , bridge-builder or doctrinaire - to the mundane , such as whether someone might be a good bureaucrat running the huge vatican machinery but less gifted as a pastor in the field . another element is age .
will they go for someone young to drive the church forward for the foreseeable future at a time of declining belief in god ? french poll favors " more progressive " pope a poll sunday in the daily le paris ien found 53 percent of french people in favor of a " more progressive " pope than john paul ii , while 27 percent wanted continuity and only 13 percent a more traditional successor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinals attend a mass for the late pope john paul ii celebrated by the vatican secretary of state , cardinal angelo sodano on the steps of st. peter 's basilica at the vatican on sunday .

dw-world looks at the key steps for the next several days . immediately after the pope has passed away , a document known as the apostolic constitution drafted by john paul ii himself in 1996 enters into effect .
at this point , the pope ’ s camerlengo -lrb- chamberlain -rrb- verifies the pontiff ’ s death by calling him by his christian name three times .
if there is no response , the chamberlain declares “ the pope is truly dead . ” the confirmation used to be accompanied by the chamberlain tapping the pope ’ s forehead three times with a small silver hammer , but the tradition fell into disuse after pope john xxiii ’ s death in 1963 .
the vatican follows a strict protocol for dealing with the death of a pope .
word is passed through the church ’ s civil service – the curia – and foreign ambassadors and heads of state are informed officially .
vatican radio then flashes news of his death around the world .
in many cities , churches ring their bells to announce the death .
john paul ii ’ s body was then removed from his apartment , which was then locked and sealed .
a small ceremony takes place during which the pope ’ s fisherman ’ s ring and papal seal are broken .
today it is a symbolic act , but historically it was designed to prevent impersonation and forgery . no images or recordings of any kind are permitted to be taken apart from portraits of the pope after his corpse has been suitably prepared to the satisfaction of the camerlengo , cardinal eduardo martinez somalo .
bildunterschrift : many thousands of people pray in a floodlit st. peter 's square at the vatican burial procedure each pope is able to specify his own funeral arrangements .
this time , the vatican will be working to requests drawn up by john paul ii in 1996 . according to experts , the pope ’ s body is likely to be embalmed and then exposed for the veneration of the faithful – most likely in st. peter ’ s basilica . tradition calls for nine days of mourning during which there is a papal interregnum , or interval during which the catholic church is without a spiritual leader .
burial occurs four to six days after death – between wednesday and friday in the case of john paul ii .
the italian news agency ansa , however , reported that the interment would not take place before thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. peter 's basilica in rome the funeral service will take place in st. peter ’ s and heads of state and government as well as religious leaders from around the world will attend . the pope is expected to be buried alongside his immediate predecessors in the crypt under the main altar of st. peter 's basilica .
there have been rumors that john paul ii wanted to be buried in poland , but experts say this is unlikely . how is a successor chosen ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only those cardinals under age 80 may vote for the next pope the election of a new pope does not begin until 15 days after the death of a pontiff .
in the meantime , cardinals from around the world begin arriving at the vatican to participate in a centuries-old ritual called the conclave -lrb- from the latin cum clave meaning “ with key ” -rrb- . those cardinals involved in electing the new pope must be under 80 .
there are 117 eligible to vote for john paul ii ’ s successor .
before the conclave , coalition-builders begin forging alliances .
senior cardinals who may themselves have little chance of becoming pope can still exert a considerable influence over others . on the day the conclave begins , the cardinals move in procession into the sistine chapel , where they will have the option of holding an initial ballot on the first day .
this ballot often serves to gauge the level of support for various candidates .
on the next day the voting process begins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly-elected pope john paul ii raises his arms in greeting the crowd from the balcony of st. peter 's basilica on oct .
16 , 1978 throughout the entire conclave , the cardinals are sequestered in the vatican without outside contact until they choose a new pope .
a two-thirds-plus-one majority is needed for a successful election , otherwise the vote is repeated .
if the right percentage is not met after 12 to 13 days , a simple majority vote may be imposed .
cardinals can not vote for themselves and may be eliminated from consideration if they campaign for support .
until a successor has been elected , there will be four ballots a day .
the ballot papers are burned in an old stove after every second vote .
different chemicals are mixed in to produce black smoke for an inconclusive vote or white smoke for a successful vote , a signal to the public that a new pope has been chosen .
the pope-elect that emerges from the voting is asked whether he accepts becoming the supreme pontiff .
if he answer is yes , he is asked what name he wishes to take .
he then goes to the room of tears , a small room next to the sistine chapel , where he dresses himself in white papal robes , before returning to the conclave to sit near the altar and have a new fisherman ’ s ring put on his finger .
then cardinals then file by to pay homage to the man who from that point on will be considered christ ’ s representative on earth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conclave will convene in the sistine chapel under michelangelo 's " last judgement " the senior cardinal deacon , at the moment chilean cardinal jorge medina estevez , will then step onto the central loggia of st. peter ’ s basilica to proclaim “ habemus papam ” – we have a pope – and the new pontiff will appear on the balcony to deliver his first apostolic blessing to the world . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de john paul ii : passing of a papal giant the vatican announced saturday evening that the pope died at 2027 cet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.04.2005 commercialization and world war ii großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's surrender - was that the country 's new beginning ?
younger germans are taking a greater interest in world war ii but this does not always have positive facets according to the german historian wolfgang wippermann who spoke with dw-world . dw-world : what is the meaning of may 8 for german and world history ?
wolfgang wippermann : may 8 , 1945 is not only an momentous date for german history , but also for world history .
it 's definitely comparable to the reformation , the french revolution and the bolshevik revolution .
it is simply an epochal date in world history .
it was then that a new era began and was the end of a horrendous one - the era of fascism .
in germany the date is often spoken of as a new beginning , a stunde null , that 's to say the country 's " zero hour . "
how do you judge this ?
there was no stunde null like we viewed it .
instead , there was a strong road of continuity , not a restoration .
it was a kind of continuity that revealed itself in the elite before the third reich and also afterwards .
for example , there were more nazis in the foreign office after 1945 than before .
it was wishful thinking to believe that on may 8 , 1945 history ended to a more or less greater extent , that a " zero hour " took place and we were reborn .
that did n't happen .
it must be added , however , that the end of the war or the collapse of the third reich was very important for the collective memory of the germans .
which catastrophe in germany had a greater effect on the country , the political or the moral one ?
the first problem is the term " catastrophe " which friedrich meineke already coined with regard to 1945 in his book " the german catastrophe " in 1946 .
indeed , the end of the war was perceived as a catastrophe for the germans but that was historically completely wrong .
the actual catastrophe was the shoah , the catastrophe that was carried out on the jewish people .
people did n't want to recognize this in germany for a long time .
it was n't until after various historical and political discussions that the true meaning of fascism and the holocaust was recognized : the real catastrophe was the shoah .
how has the view of the second world war and the date may 8 , 1945 changed in germany over the past 60 years ?
there has been a crucial change .
the eighth of may was at one time the day the third reich collapsed , or as people said , the german catastrophe .
there was a long debate as to whether it was the day of liberation or the day of collapse ?
collapse or liberation was a topic of historical-political debates during the 1950 's and 60 's , but most of all in the 70 's and 80 's .
finally , those who called it the day of liberation won the upper hand .
german president richard von weizsäcker made this clear on may 8 , 1985 .
that meant that the important thing was not that it was a german catastrophe but a catastrophe for the jews .
this was a very long , arduous process but one that was concluded positively .
but i must also say that history is not just that which happened .
a historical event is also that which is made of it .
does the german perspective of the second world war conform with that of the world or are there differences ?
there are various controversies that spill beyond borders .
it ca n't be classified as strictly nationally historical .
one thing that is happening in my opinion is that there is no longer a historical-political discussion or one of how to deal with the past .
what 's happening is that may 8 , world war ii , the shoah and the like are being commercialized .
we not only have a historicization but a " knoppization " -lsb- guido knopp is a popular historian who has made numerous documentaries about world war ii for german national television -rsb- of history for commercial purposes .
it has more to do with television ratings and not really with history - knopp 's films are horribly commericialized .
that is the negative side of the awakened interest in history , which on the other hand is positive .
i view it negatively and think it 's also possibly dangerous that history is being commercialized . martin schrader interviewed wolfgang wippermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the end of german jewry " " auschwitz is a symbol of nazi atrocities but the murders happened in many places over a long period of time , " says w. michael blumenthal , director of the jewish museum berlin in a dw-world interview .

younger germans are taking a greater interest in world war ii but this does not always have positive facets according to the german historian wolfgang wippermann who spoke with dw-world . dw-world : what is the meaning of may 8 for german and world history ?
wolfgang wippermann : may 8 , 1945 is not only an momentous date for german history , but also for world history .
it 's definitely comparable to the reformation , the french revolution and the bolshevik revolution .
it is simply an epochal date in world history .
it was then that a new era began and was the end of a horrendous one - the era of fascism .
in germany the date is often spoken of as a new beginning , a stunde null , that 's to say the country 's " zero hour . "
how do you judge this ?
there was no stunde null like we viewed it .
instead , there was a strong road of continuity , not a restoration .
it was a kind of continuity that revealed itself in the elite before the third reich and also afterwards .
for example , there were more nazis in the foreign office after 1945 than before .
it was wishful thinking to believe that on may 8 , 1945 history ended to a more or less greater extent , that a " zero hour " took place and we were reborn .
that did n't happen .
it must be added , however , that the end of the war or the collapse of the third reich was very important for the collective memory of the germans .
which catastrophe in germany had a greater effect on the country , the political or the moral one ?
the first problem is the term " catastrophe " which friedrich meineke already coined with regard to 1945 in his book " the german catastrophe " in 1946 .
indeed , the end of the war was perceived as a catastrophe for the germans but that was historically completely wrong .
the actual catastrophe was the shoah , the catastrophe that was carried out on the jewish people .
people did n't want to recognize this in germany for a long time .
it was n't until after various historical and political discussions that the true meaning of fascism and the holocaust was recognized : the real catastrophe was the shoah .
how has the view of the second world war and the date may 8 , 1945 changed in germany over the past 60 years ?
there has been a crucial change .
the eighth of may was at one time the day the third reich collapsed , or as people said , the german catastrophe .
there was a long debate as to whether it was the day of liberation or the day of collapse ?
collapse or liberation was a topic of historical-political debates during the 1950 's and 60 's , but most of all in the 70 's and 80 's .
finally , those who called it the day of liberation won the upper hand .
german president richard von weizsäcker made this clear on may 8 , 1985 .
that meant that the important thing was not that it was a german catastrophe but a catastrophe for the jews .
this was a very long , arduous process but one that was concluded positively .
but i must also say that history is not just that which happened .
a historical event is also that which is made of it .
does the german perspective of the second world war conform with that of the world or are there differences ?
there are various controversies that spill beyond borders .
it ca n't be classified as strictly nationally historical .
one thing that is happening in my opinion is that there is no longer a historical-political discussion or one of how to deal with the past .
what 's happening is that may 8 , world war ii , the shoah and the like are being commercialized .
we not only have a historicization but a " knoppization " -lsb- guido knopp is a popular historian who has made numerous documentaries about world war ii for german national television -rsb- of history for commercial purposes .
it has more to do with television ratings and not really with history - knopp 's films are horribly commericialized .
that is the negative side of the awakened interest in history , which on the other hand is positive .
i view it negatively and think it 's also possibly dangerous that history is being commercialized . martin schrader interviewed wolfgang wippermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the end of german jewry " " auschwitz is a symbol of nazi atrocities but the murders happened in many places over a long period of time , " says w. michael blumenthal , director of the jewish museum berlin in a dw-world interview .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : passing of a pope pope 's funeral set for friday the question of succession a pope of unity but also division a life at odds with the germans current affairs -pipe- 03.04.2005 what happens after the pope dies ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the election of a new pope begins 15 days after the death of a pontiff after the death of pope john paul ii , a strict procedure of events is set into motion leading to the burial and election of a successor .
dw-world looks at the key steps for the next several days . immediately after the pope has passed away , a document known as the apostolic constitution drafted by john paul ii himself in 1996 enters into effect .
at this point , the pope ’ s camerlengo -lrb- chamberlain -rrb- verifies the pontiff ’ s death by calling him by his christian name three times .
if there is no response , the chamberlain declares “ the pope is truly dead . ” the confirmation used to be accompanied by the chamberlain tapping the pope ’ s forehead three times with a small silver hammer , but the tradition fell into disuse after pope john xxiii ’ s death in 1963 .
the vatican follows a strict protocol for dealing with the death of a pope .
word is passed through the church ’ s civil service – the curia – and foreign ambassadors and heads of state are informed officially .
vatican radio then flashes news of his death around the world .
in many cities , churches ring their bells to announce the death .
john paul ii ’ s body was then removed from his apartment , which was then locked and sealed .
a small ceremony takes place during which the pope ’ s fisherman ’ s ring and papal seal are broken .
today it is a symbolic act , but historically it was designed to prevent impersonation and forgery . no images or recordings of any kind are permitted to be taken apart from portraits of the pope after his corpse has been suitably prepared to the satisfaction of the camerlengo , cardinal eduardo martinez somalo .
bildunterschrift : many thousands of people pray in a floodlit st. peter 's square at the vatican burial procedure each pope is able to specify his own funeral arrangements .
this time , the vatican will be working to requests drawn up by john paul ii in 1996 . according to experts , the pope ’ s body is likely to be embalmed and then exposed for the veneration of the faithful – most likely in st. peter ’ s basilica . tradition calls for nine days of mourning during which there is a papal interregnum , or interval during which the catholic church is without a spiritual leader .
burial occurs four to six days after death – between wednesday and friday in the case of john paul ii .
the italian news agency ansa , however , reported that the interment would not take place before thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. peter 's basilica in rome the funeral service will take place in st. peter ’ s and heads of state and government as well as religious leaders from around the world will attend . the pope is expected to be buried alongside his immediate predecessors in the crypt under the main altar of st. peter 's basilica .
there have been rumors that john paul ii wanted to be buried in poland , but experts say this is unlikely . how is a successor chosen ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only those cardinals under age 80 may vote for the next pope the election of a new pope does not begin until 15 days after the death of a pontiff .
in the meantime , cardinals from around the world begin arriving at the vatican to participate in a centuries-old ritual called the conclave -lrb- from the latin cum clave meaning “ with key ” -rrb- . those cardinals involved in electing the new pope must be under 80 .
there are 117 eligible to vote for john paul ii ’ s successor .
before the conclave , coalition-builders begin forging alliances .
senior cardinals who may themselves have little chance of becoming pope can still exert a considerable influence over others . on the day the conclave begins , the cardinals move in procession into the sistine chapel , where they will have the option of holding an initial ballot on the first day .
this ballot often serves to gauge the level of support for various candidates .
on the next day the voting process begins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly-elected pope john paul ii raises his arms in greeting the crowd from the balcony of st. peter 's basilica on oct .
16 , 1978 throughout the entire conclave , the cardinals are sequestered in the vatican without outside contact until they choose a new pope .
a two-thirds-plus-one majority is needed for a successful election , otherwise the vote is repeated .
if the right percentage is not met after 12 to 13 days , a simple majority vote may be imposed .
cardinals can not vote for themselves and may be eliminated from consideration if they campaign for support .
until a successor has been elected , there will be four ballots a day .
the ballot papers are burned in an old stove after every second vote .
different chemicals are mixed in to produce black smoke for an inconclusive vote or white smoke for a successful vote , a signal to the public that a new pope has been chosen .
the pope-elect that emerges from the voting is asked whether he accepts becoming the supreme pontiff .
if he answer is yes , he is asked what name he wishes to take .
he then goes to the room of tears , a small room next to the sistine chapel , where he dresses himself in white papal robes , before returning to the conclave to sit near the altar and have a new fisherman ’ s ring put on his finger .
then cardinals then file by to pay homage to the man who from that point on will be considered christ ’ s representative on earth .

dw-world looks at the key steps for the next several days . immediately after the pope has passed away , a document known as the apostolic constitution drafted by john paul ii himself in 1996 enters into effect .
at this point , the pope ’ s camerlengo -lrb- chamberlain -rrb- verifies the pontiff ’ s death by calling him by his christian name three times .
if there is no response , the chamberlain declares “ the pope is truly dead . ” the confirmation used to be accompanied by the chamberlain tapping the pope ’ s forehead three times with a small silver hammer , but the tradition fell into disuse after pope john xxiii ’ s death in 1963 .
the vatican follows a strict protocol for dealing with the death of a pope .
word is passed through the church ’ s civil service – the curia – and foreign ambassadors and heads of state are informed officially .
vatican radio then flashes news of his death around the world .
in many cities , churches ring their bells to announce the death .
john paul ii ’ s body was then removed from his apartment , which was then locked and sealed .
a small ceremony takes place during which the pope ’ s fisherman ’ s ring and papal seal are broken .
today it is a symbolic act , but historically it was designed to prevent impersonation and forgery . no images or recordings of any kind are permitted to be taken apart from portraits of the pope after his corpse has been suitably prepared to the satisfaction of the camerlengo , cardinal eduardo martinez somalo .
bildunterschrift : many thousands of people pray in a floodlit st. peter 's square at the vatican burial procedure each pope is able to specify his own funeral arrangements .
this time , the vatican will be working to requests drawn up by john paul ii in 1996 . according to experts , the pope ’ s body is likely to be embalmed and then exposed for the veneration of the faithful – most likely in st. peter ’ s basilica . tradition calls for nine days of mourning during which there is a papal interregnum , or interval during which the catholic church is without a spiritual leader .
burial occurs four to six days after death – between wednesday and friday in the case of john paul ii .
the italian news agency ansa , however , reported that the interment would not take place before thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : st. peter 's basilica in rome the funeral service will take place in st. peter ’ s and heads of state and government as well as religious leaders from around the world will attend . the pope is expected to be buried alongside his immediate predecessors in the crypt under the main altar of st. peter 's basilica .
there have been rumors that john paul ii wanted to be buried in poland , but experts say this is unlikely . how is a successor chosen ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only those cardinals under age 80 may vote for the next pope the election of a new pope does not begin until 15 days after the death of a pontiff .
in the meantime , cardinals from around the world begin arriving at the vatican to participate in a centuries-old ritual called the conclave -lrb- from the latin cum clave meaning “ with key ” -rrb- . those cardinals involved in electing the new pope must be under 80 .
there are 117 eligible to vote for john paul ii ’ s successor .
before the conclave , coalition-builders begin forging alliances .
senior cardinals who may themselves have little chance of becoming pope can still exert a considerable influence over others . on the day the conclave begins , the cardinals move in procession into the sistine chapel , where they will have the option of holding an initial ballot on the first day .
this ballot often serves to gauge the level of support for various candidates .
on the next day the voting process begins . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the newly-elected pope john paul ii raises his arms in greeting the crowd from the balcony of st. peter 's basilica on oct .
16 , 1978 throughout the entire conclave , the cardinals are sequestered in the vatican without outside contact until they choose a new pope .
a two-thirds-plus-one majority is needed for a successful election , otherwise the vote is repeated .
if the right percentage is not met after 12 to 13 days , a simple majority vote may be imposed .
cardinals can not vote for themselves and may be eliminated from consideration if they campaign for support .
until a successor has been elected , there will be four ballots a day .
the ballot papers are burned in an old stove after every second vote .
different chemicals are mixed in to produce black smoke for an inconclusive vote or white smoke for a successful vote , a signal to the public that a new pope has been chosen .
the pope-elect that emerges from the voting is asked whether he accepts becoming the supreme pontiff .
if he answer is yes , he is asked what name he wishes to take .
he then goes to the room of tears , a small room next to the sistine chapel , where he dresses himself in white papal robes , before returning to the conclave to sit near the altar and have a new fisherman ’ s ring put on his finger .
then cardinals then file by to pay homage to the man who from that point on will be considered christ ’ s representative on earth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conclave will convene in the sistine chapel under michelangelo 's " last judgement " the senior cardinal deacon , at the moment chilean cardinal jorge medina estevez , will then step onto the central loggia of st. peter ’ s basilica to proclaim “ habemus papam ” – we have a pope – and the new pontiff will appear on the balcony to deliver his first apostolic blessing to the world . dw staff -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de john paul ii : passing of a papal giant the vatican announced saturday evening that the pope died at 2027 cet .

" i am cautiously optimistic and maintain that the economic recovery will take hold during 2005 , " said lucas papademos , the ecb vice-president , in an interview this week . but that message seems to be more and more out of sync with reality .
the bank that sets monetary policy for the countries sharing the euro has in fact been somewhat embarrassed .
the ecb had begun to prepare financial markets for its first interest-rate increase since june 2003 , most likely in the fourth quarter of this year . real risk of inflation spurt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ecb policymakers had pointed to the low cost of credit that was creating an excess of liquidity , and in particular the strong real estate market in several countries that risked provoking a spurt in inflation .
but weak economic growth in the eurozone threatens to defer that scenario . the anticipated increase in rates had been " reinforced by certain statements by the ecb about the inevitability of rates going up again and also after the revision " of the european stability and growth pact , said patrick artus , director of economic research at cdc ixis in a study published friday .
" we think however that the economic outlook for the eurozone makes a rate increase with the next year or more extremely unlikely , " artus said . the ecb was on the verge of raising rates late last year , a high-level source close to the central bank told afp .
but policymakers changed their minds because of soaring crude oil prices and the euro 's appreciation against the dollar . credibility of single currency at risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for ecb watchers , the guardians of the euro are also playing with their credibility .
" by crying wolf , they may end up not being believed , " warned eric chaney , an economist at morgan stanley .
" i do not find it very easy to interpret the ecb , " he said . critics point out by comparison that the us federal reserve , the central bank of the world 's biggest economy , seeks to communicate with absolute clarity .
last year the fed clearly prepared the markets one month before it began to raise interest rates , taking a measured approach to a tougher monetary policy . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the euro 's slow way east the deutsche mark , franc , lira - all currencies that do n't exist anymore .

an african pontiff ?
how about latin america or india ? no one knows for sure and those who might have an idea - the cardinals who actually choose the next leader of the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics - certainly are n't giving much away . nevertheless the process is underway , triggered automatically by the death saturday of the conservative 84-year-old pope john paul ii who had headed the catholic church since his own election in 1978 . no doubt the impending election will be on their minds when cardinals hold their first congregation monday to begin planning the pontiff 's funeral .
however , the conclave at which cardinals choose a successor must not start until at least two weeks after a pope 's death , but no later than 20 days . one of the few to have talked about the succession , cardinal francis george of the chicago archdiocese , urged the next pope not to make radical changes .
" people think things are up for grabs that are n't up for grabs , " he told a press conference saturday after a memorial mass .
however , he admitted , " we may need a different kind of pope . " in a possible indication of his thinking , he said that although there were good reasons to elect a pope from africa , asia or latin america , he would have to be " acceptable to the romans .
he should speak italian . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who , if any , of the top vatican cardinals will get the job ?
clockwise from top left : vatican secretary of state italian cardinal angelo sodano , german cardinal joseph ratzinger , italian cardinal giovanni battista re , colombian cardinal alfonso lopez trujillo , italian cardinal camillo ruini , us cardinal james stafford .
some vatican insiders think cardinals will likely return to a safe italian candidate - john paul ii was the first non-italian pontiff in 455 years .
" i do n't think the college of electors will risk electing a foreigner .
the italians are the inner circle , " one said under cover of anonymity . a return to italian type in that case , the front-runner could be cardinal dionigi tettamanzi , who as archbishop of milan oversees the most populous diocese in europe .
aged 71 , he is seen as an intellectual , a pastor and someone who would have new ideas . another italian possible is angelo scola , patriarch or archbishop of venice who at 63 counts as one of the church 's younger set . a moderate , he is thought likely to have the backing of opus dei , a highly conservative grouping which has several european and latin american cardinals among its supporters . a south or central american pope ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : away from italy , potential candidates are oscar andres rodriguez maradiaga , the 62-year-old honduran cardinal who has campaigned against poverty ; claudio hummes , archbishop of sao paulo ; and dario castrillon hoyos of colombia . hummes has distanced himself from the terms progressive and conservative and prefers to maintain a strong personal conviction on issues regardless of where they fall in the two camps .
hoyos was responsible for steering the latin american church away from controversial liberation theology and was rewarded by the pope , who appointed him head of the powerful congregation for the clergy , the vatican department which deals directly with the world 's priests . also in the running could be jorge mario bergoglio , the archbishop of buenos aires .
a man of humility who lives a simple existence , bergoglio is an advocate of a traditional and spiritual approach to the role of archbishop .
he once insisted that the entire church of argentina wear garments of public penance for sins committed during the county 's military dictatorship .
a member of the jesuit order , this fact may play against him as the order is supposed to renounce church awards and pledge only to serve the pope , not become one . an indian or african holy father ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian catholics will be praying for pope john paul ii and wondering if one of their won will take his place .
ivan dias , the 69-year-old archbishop of bombay , carries the best hopes of the indian sub-continent .
while an indian national , dias spent most of his life serving as a diplomat for the church around the world before returning home to become bombay 's archbishop .
a fluent multilinguist , dias is a conservative among a large number of more reformist bishops in the asian church . nigeria 's francis arinze is regarded by many as the best non-italian bet .
a conservative , he would become the second african pope after gelasius i in the late fifth century .
he has been the catholic church 's point man for relations with islam , an important factor considering the high profile growth rate of that religion .
arinze is currently the head of the vatican department for divine worship . factors that may influence the cardinals range from policy - conservative or liberal , bridge-builder or doctrinaire - to the mundane , such as whether someone might be a good bureaucrat running the huge vatican machinery but less gifted as a pastor in the field . another element is age .
will they go for someone young to drive the church forward for the foreseeable future at a time of declining belief in god ? french poll favors " more progressive " pope a poll sunday in the daily le paris ien found 53 percent of french people in favor of a " more progressive " pope than john paul ii , while 27 percent wanted continuity and only 13 percent a more traditional successor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinals attend a mass for the late pope john paul ii celebrated by the vatican secretary of state , cardinal angelo sodano on the steps of st. peter 's basilica at the vatican on sunday .
do n't expect any public jockeying by the cardinals , however .
rules say they must abstain under pain of excommunication from any form of agreement or promise that would influence their vote , and they are not allowed to vote for themselves . george , the archbishop of chicago , said he expected debate to be heated but not to last more than a week .
" i think we 'll all be cordial but i expect there will be great differences of opinion , " he said . both john paul ii and his immediate predecessor were compromise candidates who emerged because of deadlocks over cardinals who had initially seemed more promising when the conclaves got under way . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de plenty of variables in papal succession age , nationality and tradition all play a role in the growing speculation about the next man who will take over as head of the roman catholic church .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : passing of a pope pope 's funeral set for friday a life at odds with the germans a pope of unity but also division what happens after the pope dies ? current affairs -pipe- 03.04.2005 the question of succession großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speculation is rife over which candidate will become the new pope with the death of pope john paul ii , a chain of events laid down by centuries of papal tradition swung into action , but who will emerge as the next pontiff is a guess no one dares to hazard . a pope from italy , reverting to habit ?
an african pontiff ?
how about latin america or india ? no one knows for sure and those who might have an idea - the cardinals who actually choose the next leader of the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics - certainly are n't giving much away . nevertheless the process is underway , triggered automatically by the death saturday of the conservative 84-year-old pope john paul ii who had headed the catholic church since his own election in 1978 . no doubt the impending election will be on their minds when cardinals hold their first congregation monday to begin planning the pontiff 's funeral .
however , the conclave at which cardinals choose a successor must not start until at least two weeks after a pope 's death , but no later than 20 days . one of the few to have talked about the succession , cardinal francis george of the chicago archdiocese , urged the next pope not to make radical changes .
" people think things are up for grabs that are n't up for grabs , " he told a press conference saturday after a memorial mass .
however , he admitted , " we may need a different kind of pope . " in a possible indication of his thinking , he said that although there were good reasons to elect a pope from africa , asia or latin america , he would have to be " acceptable to the romans .
he should speak italian . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who , if any , of the top vatican cardinals will get the job ?
clockwise from top left : vatican secretary of state italian cardinal angelo sodano , german cardinal joseph ratzinger , italian cardinal giovanni battista re , colombian cardinal alfonso lopez trujillo , italian cardinal camillo ruini , us cardinal james stafford .
some vatican insiders think cardinals will likely return to a safe italian candidate - john paul ii was the first non-italian pontiff in 455 years .
" i do n't think the college of electors will risk electing a foreigner .
the italians are the inner circle , " one said under cover of anonymity . a return to italian type in that case , the front-runner could be cardinal dionigi tettamanzi , who as archbishop of milan oversees the most populous diocese in europe .
aged 71 , he is seen as an intellectual , a pastor and someone who would have new ideas . another italian possible is angelo scola , patriarch or archbishop of venice who at 63 counts as one of the church 's younger set . a moderate , he is thought likely to have the backing of opus dei , a highly conservative grouping which has several european and latin american cardinals among its supporters . a south or central american pope ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : away from italy , potential candidates are oscar andres rodriguez maradiaga , the 62-year-old honduran cardinal who has campaigned against poverty ; claudio hummes , archbishop of sao paulo ; and dario castrillon hoyos of colombia . hummes has distanced himself from the terms progressive and conservative and prefers to maintain a strong personal conviction on issues regardless of where they fall in the two camps .
hoyos was responsible for steering the latin american church away from controversial liberation theology and was rewarded by the pope , who appointed him head of the powerful congregation for the clergy , the vatican department which deals directly with the world 's priests . also in the running could be jorge mario bergoglio , the archbishop of buenos aires .
a man of humility who lives a simple existence , bergoglio is an advocate of a traditional and spiritual approach to the role of archbishop .
he once insisted that the entire church of argentina wear garments of public penance for sins committed during the county 's military dictatorship .
a member of the jesuit order , this fact may play against him as the order is supposed to renounce church awards and pledge only to serve the pope , not become one . an indian or african holy father ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indian catholics will be praying for pope john paul ii and wondering if one of their won will take his place .
ivan dias , the 69-year-old archbishop of bombay , carries the best hopes of the indian sub-continent .
while an indian national , dias spent most of his life serving as a diplomat for the church around the world before returning home to become bombay 's archbishop .
a fluent multilinguist , dias is a conservative among a large number of more reformist bishops in the asian church . nigeria 's francis arinze is regarded by many as the best non-italian bet .
a conservative , he would become the second african pope after gelasius i in the late fifth century .
he has been the catholic church 's point man for relations with islam , an important factor considering the high profile growth rate of that religion .
arinze is currently the head of the vatican department for divine worship . factors that may influence the cardinals range from policy - conservative or liberal , bridge-builder or doctrinaire - to the mundane , such as whether someone might be a good bureaucrat running the huge vatican machinery but less gifted as a pastor in the field . another element is age .
will they go for someone young to drive the church forward for the foreseeable future at a time of declining belief in god ? french poll favors " more progressive " pope a poll sunday in the daily le paris ien found 53 percent of french people in favor of a " more progressive " pope than john paul ii , while 27 percent wanted continuity and only 13 percent a more traditional successor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinals attend a mass for the late pope john paul ii celebrated by the vatican secretary of state , cardinal angelo sodano on the steps of st. peter 's basilica at the vatican on sunday .
do n't expect any public jockeying by the cardinals , however .
rules say they must abstain under pain of excommunication from any form of agreement or promise that would influence their vote , and they are not allowed to vote for themselves . george , the archbishop of chicago , said he expected debate to be heated but not to last more than a week .
" i think we 'll all be cordial but i expect there will be great differences of opinion , " he said . both john paul ii and his immediate predecessor were compromise candidates who emerged because of deadlocks over cardinals who had initially seemed more promising when the conclaves got under way . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de plenty of variables in papal succession age , nationality and tradition all play a role in the growing speculation about the next man who will take over as head of the roman catholic church .

his far-reaching influence , particularly in the developing world , has been blamed for failing to prevent the spread of hiv / aids . he maintained throughout his papacy that the roman catholic church believed abstinence and fidelity within marriage , and not condoms , were the best way to stop the spread of hiv / aids , a message seen by health organizations in particular as an irresponsible one . " the holy see ... believes prevention through education about the sacredness of life and the correct practice of sexuality , that is chastity and faithfulness , is necessary above all other things in order to prevent this disease responsibly , " the pontiff said during one of his last visits abroad in spain in january . the catholic church opposes condoms in all except the rarest of circumstances because they are a form of contraception , which it believes prevents the god-given gift of life .
the pope held the church 's hard line that promoting the use of condoms to fight the spread of aids fostered what he saw as immoral and hedonistic lifestyles and behavior that will only contribute to its spread .
there were even reports that the church was sending out messages in africa that condoms actually caused hiv / aids . the pope 's stance on same-sex relationships was also a source of conflict .
the pope referred to homosexuality as " part of a new ideology of evil , perhaps more insidious and hidden , which attempts to pit human rights against the family and against man . "
he was staunchly opposed to gay marriage and publicly expressed his concerns that governments around the world were being put under pressure to legalize same-sex unions . gay rights groups accuse pope of complicity bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter tatchell , of gay human rights group outrage , said in a statement in the wake of the pope 's death : " history will judge the pope harshly .
his opposition to the use of condoms to prevent the spread of hiv has condemned millions of people to die an agonizing , needless death . " " millions of children in developing countries are orphans ; having lost their parents to aids because of the pope ’ s anti-condom dogma , " tatchell added .
" pope john paul ii waged a ceaseless war against the human rights of women and gay people ; opposing the right of women to control their own fertility ; blocking women ’ s equality in the church ; and endorsing state-sponsored discrimination against lesbians and gay men . "
many hope for a new liberal pontiff gay catholic group rainbow sash hoped the next pope would take a more liberal view on homosexuality .
" there 's a lot of gays and lesbians out there who have a strong faith and a strong commitment to the church and they are still continually cut out of the loop , " spokesman george barbary said in the group 's own statement .
" that 's an important message that 's been lost and one can only hope for change . "
the polish pontiff was also staunch defender of traditional church policies on women , refusing to consider ordaining them as priests , enforcing contraception decrees and opposing abortion . " a fifth-century pope in terms of who women are " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gisela forster , left , and christine mayr-lumetzberger wear white robes as they bear a figure of pope john paul ii. during a protest campaign against the threat of being excommunicated by the vatican in munich , southern germany , july 22 , 2002 .
they are two of the seven women who were ordained as priests by argentine bishop romulo braschi in defiance of the ban of catholic church on female clergy .
the pope excommunicated the seven women monday , aug .
5 , 2002 .
" he will go down in history as a pope who did n't understand and who was n't friendly to women , " frances kissling , president of the liberal washington d.c.-based activist group catholics for a free choice , said of john paul in a statement .
" he could n't have slammed the door shut more loudly on the question of the ordination of women .
he will go down as a fifth-century pope in terms of who women are . " the vatican was rounded on by women in 2004 for issuing a long-awaited document on men and women that charged that feminists were " adversaries of men " who undermined families and paved the way for acceptance of gay marriage . parallels between abortion and holocaust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actresses whoopi goldberg , right , and christine lahti , left , yell at anti-abortion demonstrators in washington , sunday , april 25 , 2004 , during an abortion rights rally and march .
the day , which focused on protecting women 's reproductive rights , included men and women from across the country along with activists from nearly 60 countries .
the pope 's views on abortion may have endeared himself to the christian right in the united states but angered and dismayed many others around the world .
john paul accused governments which allowed abortion of committing murder on a huge scale , even at one stage drawing parallels between abortion and the holocaust . " there is still , however , a legal extermination of human beings who have been conceived but not yet born , " the pope wrote in his book memory and identity .
" and this time , we are talking about an extermination which has been allowed by nothing less than democratically elected parliaments . " pedophile priest problem tainted papacy pope john paul also presided over one of the most damaging scandals that the catholic church has had to face in modern times : pedophile priests .
scandals , resignations , confessions and expulsions rocked the church in the united states , while similar cases came to light across europe . some critics accused the pope of heading a cover-up .
the catholic church has always been reluctant to make sexual abuse problems public , preferring to deal with the issue internally , or as many believe , not deal with it at all .
critics accused the church of moving pedophile priests between parishes instead of dismissing them which was no solution to the problem .
the pope responded by declaring a policy of zero tolerance for priests found guilty of pedophilia . staunchly opposed to euthanasia the pope was also scathing in his views on euthanasia .
on one visit to the netherlands , the pope chose an appearance at the dutch parliament to condemn the country 's policy on assisted suicide and called for all dutch catholics to uphold the church 's view : " the holy see has made known its clear position and invites catholics in the netherlands always to show their absolute respect for human life , from conception to natural death , " the pope said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recently , just shortly before his health took a fatal turn for the worst , the pope called the doctors , campaigners and government officials who were instrumental in allowing brain-dead american terri schiavo to die " murderers " . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gay groups blast “ cardinal mistake ” to fight love the vatican has slammed same-sex unions as " deviant " and a threat to society in a controversial document .

his far-reaching influence , particularly in the developing world , has been blamed for failing to prevent the spread of hiv / aids . he maintained throughout his papacy that the roman catholic church believed abstinence and fidelity within marriage , and not condoms , were the best way to stop the spread of hiv / aids , a message seen by health organizations in particular as an irresponsible one .

on one visit to the netherlands , the pope chose an appearance at the dutch parliament to condemn the country 's policy on assisted suicide and called for all dutch catholics to uphold the church 's view : " the holy see has made known its clear position and invites catholics in the netherlands always to show their absolute respect for human life , from conception to natural death , " the pope said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recently , just shortly before his health took a fatal turn for the worst , the pope called the doctors , campaigners and government officials who were instrumental in allowing brain-dead american terri schiavo to die " murderers " . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gay groups blast “ cardinal mistake ” to fight love the vatican has slammed same-sex unions as " deviant " and a threat to society in a controversial document .

younger germans are taking a greater interest in world war ii but this does not always have positive facets according to the german historian wolfgang wippermann who spoke with dw-world . dw-world : what is the meaning of may 8 for german and world history ?
wolfgang wippermann : may 8 , 1945 is not only an momentous date for german history , but also for world history .
it 's definitely comparable to the reformation , the french revolution and the bolshevik revolution .
it is simply an epochal date in world history .
it was then that a new era began and was the end of a horrendous one - the era of fascism .
in germany the date is often spoken of as a new beginning , a stunde null , that 's to say the country 's " zero hour . "
how do you judge this ?
there was no stunde null like we viewed it .
instead , there was a strong road of continuity , not a restoration .
it was a kind of continuity that revealed itself in the elite before the third reich and also afterwards .
for example , there were more nazis in the foreign office after 1945 than before .
it was wishful thinking to believe that on may 8 , 1945 history ended to a more or less greater extent , that a " zero hour " took place and we were reborn .
that did n't happen .
it must be added , however , that the end of the war or the collapse of the third reich was very important for the collective memory of the germans .
which catastrophe in germany had a greater effect on the country , the political or the moral one ?
the first problem is the term " catastrophe " which friedrich meineke already coined with regard to 1945 in his book " the german catastrophe " in 1946 .
indeed , the end of the war was perceived as a catastrophe for the germans but that was historically completely wrong .
the actual catastrophe was the shoah , the catastrophe that was carried out on the jewish people .
people did n't want to recognize this in germany for a long time .
it was n't until after various historical and political discussions that the true meaning of fascism and the holocaust was recognized : the real catastrophe was the shoah .
how has the view of the second world war and the date may 8 , 1945 changed in germany over the past 60 years ?
there has been a crucial change .
the eighth of may was at one time the day the third reich collapsed , or as people said , the german catastrophe .
there was a long debate as to whether it was the day of liberation or the day of collapse ?
collapse or liberation was a topic of historical-political debates during the 1950 's and 60 's , but most of all in the 70 's and 80 's .
finally , those who called it the day of liberation won the upper hand .
german president richard von weizsäcker made this clear on may 8 , 1985 .
that meant that the important thing was not that it was a german catastrophe but a catastrophe for the jews .
this was a very long , arduous process but one that was concluded positively .
but i must also say that history is not just that which happened .
a historical event is also that which is made of it .
does the german perspective of the second world war conform with that of the world or are there differences ?
there are various controversies that spill beyond borders .
it ca n't be classified as strictly nationally historical .
one thing that is happening in my opinion is that there is no longer a historical-political discussion or one of how to deal with the past .
what 's happening is that may 8 , world war ii , the shoah and the like are being commercialized .
we not only have a historicization but a " knoppization " -lsb- guido knopp is a popular historian who has made numerous documentaries about world war ii for german national television -rsb- of history for commercial purposes .
it has more to do with television ratings and not really with history - knopp 's films are horribly commericialized .
that is the negative side of the awakened interest in history , which on the other hand is positive .
i view it negatively and think it 's also possibly dangerous that history is being commercialized . martin schrader interviewed wolfgang wippermann send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " the end of german jewry " " auschwitz is a symbol of nazi atrocities but the murders happened in many places over a long period of time , " says w. michael blumenthal , director of the jewish museum berlin in a dw-world interview .

it was then that a new era began and was the end of a horrendous one - the era of fascism .
in germany the date is often spoken of as a new beginning , a stunde null , that 's to say the country 's " zero hour . "
how do you judge this ?
there was no stunde null like we viewed it .
instead , there was a strong road of continuity , not a restoration .
it was a kind of continuity that revealed itself in the elite before the third reich and also afterwards .
for example , there were more nazis in the foreign office after 1945 than before .
it was wishful thinking to believe that on may 8 , 1945 history ended to a more or less greater extent , that a " zero hour " took place and we were reborn .
that did n't happen .
it must be added , however , that the end of the war or the collapse of the third reich was very important for the collective memory of the germans .
which catastrophe in germany had a greater effect on the country , the political or the moral one ?
the first problem is the term " catastrophe " which friedrich meineke already coined with regard to 1945 in his book " the german catastrophe " in 1946 .
indeed , the end of the war was perceived as a catastrophe for the germans but that was historically completely wrong .
the actual catastrophe was the shoah , the catastrophe that was carried out on the jewish people .
people did n't want to recognize this in germany for a long time .
it was n't until after various historical and political discussions that the true meaning of fascism and the holocaust was recognized : the real catastrophe was the shoah .
how has the view of the second world war and the date may 8 , 1945 changed in germany over the past 60 years ?
there has been a crucial change .
the eighth of may was at one time the day the third reich collapsed , or as people said , the german catastrophe .
there was a long debate as to whether it was the day of liberation or the day of collapse ?
collapse or liberation was a topic of historical-political debates during the 1950 's and 60 's , but most of all in the 70 's and 80 's .
finally , those who called it the day of liberation won the upper hand .
german president richard von weizsäcker made this clear on may 8 , 1985 .
that meant that the important thing was not that it was a german catastrophe but a catastrophe for the jews .
this was a very long , arduous process but one that was concluded positively .
but i must also say that history is not just that which happened .
a historical event is also that which is made of it .
does the german perspective of the second world war conform with that of the world or are there differences ?
there are various controversies that spill beyond borders .
it ca n't be classified as strictly nationally historical .
one thing that is happening in my opinion is that there is no longer a historical-political discussion or one of how to deal with the past .
what 's happening is that may 8 , world war ii , the shoah and the like are being commercialized .
we not only have a historicization but a " knoppization " -lsb- guido knopp is a popular historian who has made numerous documentaries about world war ii for german national television -rsb- of history for commercial purposes .
it has more to do with television ratings and not really with history - knopp 's films are horribly commericialized .
that is the negative side of the awakened interest in history , which on the other hand is positive .

younger germans are taking a greater interest in world war ii but this does not always have positive facets according to the german historian wolfgang wippermann who spoke with dw-world . dw-world : what is the meaning of may 8 for german and world history ?
wolfgang wippermann : may 8 , 1945 is not only an momentous date for german history , but also for world history .
it 's definitely comparable to the reformation , the french revolution and the bolshevik revolution .
it is simply an epochal date in world history .
it was then that a new era began and was the end of a horrendous one - the era of fascism .

the torrington cavaliers are building a half-size replica of the wooden warship in north devon to mark the 200th anniversary of the battle of trafalgar .
the mock victory will have 100ft -lrb- 30m -rrb- masts , cross trees and reefed sails , which all need rope .
the charity hopes to raise £ 57,000 when the ship goes up in flames in august .
cabin boy chris stacey , chairman of the torrington cavaliers , says the group is desperately short of rope .
" we will take any size of rope and can make what we need by splicing it , " he said , adding that the original warship was rigged with about 26 miles of rope .
the replica is being built by about 40 volunteers , including a relative of the ship 's crew .
project leader dick matthews is the great-great-great-grandson of the victory 's cabin boy , whose surname was oliver .
burning reputation the cabin boy can be seen in a painting which hangs in the house of commons , depicting the scene of nelson shot aboard victory .
the torrington cavaliers have raised tens of thousands of pounds for charity with spectacular bonfires , including a replica of the houses of parliament - for which they invited a descendant of guy fawkes to light .
in 2000 , the group built a full-size replica of part of london in 1666 and recreated the " great fire of london " .
this year , the group 's replica of hms victory , promises to be equally spectacular .
the ship will have open gun ports for fireworks and viewing platforms will be erected so the public can see inside .
the torrington victory will go up in flames on 27 august .
it is expected the pyrotechnic spectacular will be watched by many thousands of local people and visitors .
the aim is to raise about £ 57,000 - the cost of nelson 's original victory - for cancer and local charities .

the torrington cavaliers are building a half-size replica of the wooden warship in north devon to mark the 200th anniversary of the battle of trafalgar .
the mock victory will have 100ft -lrb- 30m -rrb- masts , cross trees and reefed sails , which all need rope .
the charity hopes to raise £ 57,000 when the ship goes up in flames in august .
cabin boy chris stacey , chairman of the torrington cavaliers , says the group is desperately short of rope .
" we will take any size of rope and can make what we need by splicing it , " he said , adding that the original warship was rigged with about 26 miles of rope .
the replica is being built by about 40 volunteers , including a relative of the ship 's crew .
project leader dick matthews is the great-great-great-grandson of the victory 's cabin boy , whose surname was oliver .
burning reputation the cabin boy can be seen in a painting which hangs in the house of commons , depicting the scene of nelson shot aboard victory .
the torrington cavaliers have raised tens of thousands of pounds for charity with spectacular bonfires , including a replica of the houses of parliament - for which they invited a descendant of guy fawkes to light .
in 2000 , the group built a full-size replica of part of london in 1666 and recreated the " great fire of london " .
this year , the group 's replica of hms victory , promises to be equally spectacular .
the ship will have open gun ports for fireworks and viewing platforms will be erected so the public can see inside .
the torrington victory will go up in flames on 27 august .
it is expected the pyrotechnic spectacular will be watched by many thousands of local people and visitors .
the aim is to raise about £ 57,000 - the cost of nelson 's original victory - for cancer and local charities .

mr blair said the pope had led a remarkable life and had been admired by those of all faiths and of none because of his profound religious belief .
conservative leader michael howard said the pope had been seen as a " rock " in a world of change and uncertainty .
liberal democrat leader charles kennedy said john paul ii was " a pivotal presence on the international stage " .
all the main political parties have said they are suspending public election campaigning on sunday in the wake of the pope 's death .
' radiated kindness ' the prime minister is not catholic himself but his wife cherie is and he has met the pope .
in a televised statement on sunday , mr blair said the pope had survived and triumphed over nazi and communist rule in his native poland .
he had also played a great part in the fall of communism , he argued .
" the reason why there 's been such a great outpouring of feeling over the past few days is because of the nature of the man himself , " said mr blair .
" even if you are not a catholic , even if you are not a christian , even if you have no religious faith at all , what people could see in pope john paul was a man of true and profound spiritual faith , a shining example of what that faith should mean .
" i think that is the reason why the world has , in this rather extraordinary way , come together to mark his passing . "
conservative leader michael howard said : " in a world of change and uncertainty , people saw him as a rock : steadfast in support of freedom , unswerving in opposition to totalitarianism , robust in defence of christian values .
" the catholic church has lost a truly remarkable pope , and the world a very great spiritual leader . "
opposing communism liberal democrat leader charles kennedy said : " the papacy of pope john paul ii will be remembered rightly as a historic turning point in european and world affairs .
" his was a pivotal presence on the international stage and he took his christian message of hope to millions across the world . "

his condemnation of war whether in northern ireland or iraq was absolute " lord st john of fawsley , constitutional expert she said : " by combating the falsehoods of communism and proclaiming the true dignity of the individual , his was the moral force behind victory in the cold war . "
constitutional expert lord st john of fawsley , one of britain 's leading roman catholics , described pope john paul ii as the " greatest spiritual leader of the 20th century " .
" his condemnation of war whether in northern ireland or iraq was absolute .
" so was his upholding of the rights of the unborn child and protection of the terminally ill and dying . "
scotland remembers scottish first minister jack mcconnell said scots have fond memories of his visit to scotland in 1982 .
" his passing will leave a big gap on the world stage , " he said .
conservative mp ann widdecombe , a convert to roman catholicism , said : " it will come as a relief that his suffering is over , but the effects of his reign are going to be felt for a very long time to come . "
democrat unionist party leader , the reverend ian paisley , who had opposed the pope 's 1982 scotland visit , said he understood how catholics must feel following the pontiff 's passing .
" we need to learn that everyone on earth no matter what position he holds or the claims he makes or the support he has must come to death and eternity .
" we can understand how roman catholics feel at the death of the pope and we would want in no way to interfere with their expression of sorrow and grief at this time . "
" he was an exemplary teacher to his church , a truly good shepherd to his flock " michael ancram , deputy leader of the tories john reid , secretary of state for health , who met the pope in december 2000 when he was secretary of state for scotland , said john paul ii had " taken the papacy out to the world " .
" in the midst of our western affluence , he reminded us constantly of the plight of the poor , the underprivileged and the starving of the world and , above all , of our moral obligation to care for them . "
deputy leader of the conservatives and the party 's senior roman catholic , michael ancram , described john paul ii as " the people 's pope " .
