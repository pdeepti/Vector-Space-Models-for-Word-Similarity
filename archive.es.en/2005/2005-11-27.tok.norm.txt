and even though christmas in germany also means tinsel and lights and extended shopping hours , it is the markets that set the country off from its christian neighbors . a typical christmas market consists of wooden stalls perched on a site in the center of the city , where people shove past each other to buy christmas decorations and stop for a chat over a mug of mulled wine .
a nativity scene is usually on display and often musicians , singers and dance clubs offer entertainment from a central stage .
lo n g traditio n since the 15th century , merchants have traveled to dresden to display their wares .
to this day , from nov .

24 , shoppers flock to the market in the city center which also features a christmas pyramid , woodcarvings and a stolle n festival , where a nearly four-ton heavy version of the fruit-cake-like german christmas specialty that dresden is famous for will be dished up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the augsburg market lights up the night cologne has six christmas markets , one of which is situated next to the city 's gothic cathedral .
the cathedral 's towers , reaching some 150 meters -lrb- 490-feet -rrb- into the winter sky , make the giant christmas tree in the middle of the setting appear quite small .
in the four weeks of december during which the markets are open , around 2 million people come to cologne , according to karl-heinz merfeld of the cologne tourism association .
" the christmas market industry is still important … and the tourists who come here are usually really excited - above all the english and dutch - because they are n't familiar with these kinds of markets with the music and the lights , " he said .
in augsburg 's old market , once called the lebkuche n markt after the gingerbread-like cookie called lebkuche n it sold , visitors still can find numerous varieties of the baked goods .
ce n turies ' old traditio n no trip to the christmas market is complete without a bratwurst sausage or a cup of german mulled wine , which is spiced with cinnamon and cloves .
it is said to have originated in india , where the drink was prepared with water , alcohol , sugar and spices .
apparently the british then brought the recipe to europe in the 18th century .
folklore has it that at the christmas market in nuremberg , germany 's most famous , someone first added red wine to the mixture and created what 's now known as glühwei n .

dresden is said to have had the first , in the 15th century , and nuremberg followed suit in 1697 .
in 1820 , the first christmas market was held in cologne and restricted to locals who could buy toys and food but no alcoholic beverages .
back to the past now cologne holds a medieval christmas market where the salespeople wear wool clothes and wooden shoes and pursue medieval chores like blacksmithing .
the smell of burning wood wafts through the air , and candles illuminate the setting .
nothing as profane as reibekuche n or potato pancakes is for sale ; hungry visitors can snack on unleavened bread freshly baked in ovens heated with wood .
nor is glühwei n available .
instead , thirsty souls drink mead .
since christmas markets did n't exist during medieval times , one of the organizers drew a tenuous link to the markets held long ago .

the versatile movie-maker from hamburg , made it big in 2004 with his hit " head on . " born to turkish parents , fatih akin grew up in germany .
his first feature film , " short sharp shock , " told the story of three young friends looking for happiness , love , power and wealth .
it proved to be too much all at once and had a negative effect for some of the movie 's protagonists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sibel kekilli and birol ünel in " head on " his second feature , " in july , " was essentially about love , and recounted the tale of two young people , daniel and july , who find one another after traveling thousands of kilometers between germany and turkey .
for what was essentially a very simple story , fatih akin used several genres , from wild fairy-tale to romantic comedy to road movie . " i know the route from hamburg to istanbul very well because my parents and i used to drive it each year during the summer holidays .
we 'd all pile into the car , a ford transit with luggage rack .
it was all a bit of a cliché , and that is possibly the most autobiographical element of the whole thing . " points for radicalism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from akin 's film " solino " although he was quite playful in his first films and would n't part with his original ideas , akin knows how to switch from one genre to another .
he proved his versatility in the film " solino " , which is about italian immigrants in germany 's highly-industrialized ruhr valley region .
for the first time , akin adapted someone else 's script , and the resulting film was a little too polished and less original . his big hit , " head on , " was his triumph .
a love story full of passion , desperation , violence and humor , it is one of the best films to emerge from germany in recent years .
it served to silence critics who scorned him for being too complaisant .
his bravery was rewarded when his most radical film to date won him the highest award , the golden bear , at the 2004 berlin film festival as well as the european film award later in the year . bildunterschrift : " crossing the bridge " film poster following the success of " head on , " akin said he still had a " little bit of strength , " and he invested it in the music film " crossing the bridge - the sound of istanbul . "
when asked whether music has the power to affect change , he offered a clear " yes , " adding that it " might be naive , " but such is his belief . and perhaps it is this very naivety which leads akin to ask questions and to review his own opinions .
as such , he remains a filmmaker with the capacity to surprise his audience and from whom they can expect much to come . jörg tszman -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cinema on life support in 1990 , the eu launched the media program to provide support for european films , in danger of being driven to extinction by hollywood .

the versatile movie-maker from hamburg , made it big in 2004 with his hit " head on . " born to turkish parents , fatih akin grew up in germany .
his first feature film , " short sharp shock , " told the story of three young friends looking for happiness , love , power and wealth .
it proved to be too much all at once and had a negative effect for some of the movie 's protagonists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sibel kekilli and birol ünel in " head on " his second feature , " in july , " was essentially about love , and recounted the tale of two young people , daniel and july , who find one another after traveling thousands of kilometers between germany and turkey .
for what was essentially a very simple story , fatih akin used several genres , from wild fairy-tale to romantic comedy to road movie . " i know the route from hamburg to istanbul very well because my parents and i used to drive it each year during the summer holidays .
we 'd all pile into the car , a ford transit with luggage rack .
it was all a bit of a cliché , and that is possibly the most autobiographical element of the whole thing . " points for radicalism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from akin 's film " solino " although he was quite playful in his first films and would n't part with his original ideas , akin knows how to switch from one genre to another .
he proved his versatility in the film " solino " , which is about italian immigrants in germany 's highly-industrialized ruhr valley region .
for the first time , akin adapted someone else 's script , and the resulting film was a little too polished and less original . his big hit , " head on , " was his triumph .
a love story full of passion , desperation , violence and humor , it is one of the best films to emerge from germany in recent years .
it served to silence critics who scorned him for being too complaisant .
his bravery was rewarded when his most radical film to date won him the highest award , the golden bear , at the 2004 berlin film festival as well as the european film award later in the year . bildunterschrift : " crossing the bridge " film poster following the success of " head on , " akin said he still had a " little bit of strength , " and he invested it in the music film " crossing the bridge - the sound of istanbul . "
when asked whether music has the power to affect change , he offered a clear " yes , " adding that it " might be naive , " but such is his belief . and perhaps it is this very naivety which leads akin to ask questions and to review his own opinions .
as such , he remains a filmmaker with the capacity to surprise his audience and from whom they can expect much to come . jörg tszman -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cinema on life support in 1990 , the eu launched the media program to provide support for european films , in danger of being driven to extinction by hollywood .

and even though christmas in germany also means tinsel and lights and extended shopping hours , it is the markets that set the country off from its christian neighbors . a typical christmas market consists of wooden stalls perched on a site in the center of the city , where people shove past each other to buy christmas decorations and stop for a chat over a mug of mulled wine .
a nativity scene is usually on display and often musicians , singers and dance clubs offer entertainment from a central stage .
lo n g traditio n since the 15th century , merchants have traveled to dresden to display their wares .
to this day , from nov .
24 until dec .
24 , shoppers flock to the market in the city center which also features a christmas pyramid , woodcarvings and a stolle n festival , where a nearly four-ton heavy version of the fruit-cake-like german christmas specialty that dresden is famous for will be dished up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the augsburg market lights up the night cologne has six christmas markets , one of which is situated next to the city 's gothic cathedral .
the cathedral 's towers , reaching some 150 meters -lrb- 490-feet -rrb- into the winter sky , make the giant christmas tree in the middle of the setting appear quite small .
in the four weeks of december during which the markets are open , around 2 million people come to cologne , according to karl-heinz merfeld of the cologne tourism association .
" the christmas market industry is still important … and the tourists who come here are usually really excited - above all the english and dutch - because they are n't familiar with these kinds of markets with the music and the lights , " he said .
in augsburg 's old market , once called the lebkuche n markt after the gingerbread-like cookie called lebkuche n it sold , visitors still can find numerous varieties of the baked goods .
ce n turies ' old traditio n no trip to the christmas market is complete without a bratwurst sausage or a cup of german mulled wine , which is spiced with cinnamon and cloves .
it is said to have originated in india , where the drink was prepared with water , alcohol , sugar and spices .
apparently the british then brought the recipe to europe in the 18th century .
folklore has it that at the christmas market in nuremberg , germany 's most famous , someone first added red wine to the mixture and created what 's now known as glühwei n .
these days , about every third stall sells the stuff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : backer thomas schmidt with tons of the christmas specialty , stollen , in dresden still , christmas markets have come a long way since they were first introduced in germany .
dresden is said to have had the first , in the 15th century , and nuremberg followed suit in 1697 .
in 1820 , the first christmas market was held in cologne and restricted to locals who could buy toys and food but no alcoholic beverages .
back to the past now cologne holds a medieval christmas market where the salespeople wear wool clothes and wooden shoes and pursue medieval chores like blacksmithing .
the smell of burning wood wafts through the air , and candles illuminate the setting .
nothing as profane as reibekuche n or potato pancakes is for sale ; hungry visitors can snack on unleavened bread freshly baked in ovens heated with wood .
nor is glühwei n available .
instead , thirsty souls drink mead .
since christmas markets did n't exist during medieval times , one of the organizers drew a tenuous link to the markets held long ago . " the emphasis is on a market where there is peace and quiet as opposed to the other christmas markets where the turbulences of every-day life are dominant , " he said .

and even though christmas in germany also means tinsel and lights and extended shopping hours , it is the markets that set the country off from its christian neighbors . a typical christmas market consists of wooden stalls perched on a site in the center of the city , where people shove past each other to buy christmas decorations and stop for a chat over a mug of mulled wine .

in the four weeks of december during which the markets are open , around 2 million people come to cologne , according to karl-heinz merfeld of the cologne tourism association .
" the christmas market industry is still important … and the tourists who come here are usually really excited - above all the english and dutch - because they are n't familiar with these kinds of markets with the music and the lights , " he said .

" what we have read is in fact grounds for concern , " steinmeier said in an interview with the weekly bild am sonntag published sunday , one day before he is to travel to the united states . steinmeier welcomed a request made by his british counterpart jack straw to washington on behalf of the european union for an explanation of the accounts and said he would reserve judgment until an answer was received . " a foreign minister must evaluate the facts and not newspaper reports , " he said . germany has already opened an investigation into a case in which an egyptian suspect was reportedly secretly transported via ramstein in western germany , the largest us air base in europe . public broadcaster zdf and several newspapers have reported that more than 80 secret central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- flights touched down in germany en route to secret centers where suspects , held without charge as " enemy combatants , " were allegedly interrogated and tortured .

and even though christmas in germany also means tinsel and lights and extended shopping hours , it is the markets that set the country off from its christian neighbors . a typical christmas market consists of wooden stalls perched on a site in the center of the city , where people shove past each other to buy christmas decorations and stop for a chat over a mug of mulled wine .
a nativity scene is usually on display and often musicians , singers and dance clubs offer entertainment from a central stage .
lo n g traditio n since the 15th century , merchants have traveled to dresden to display their wares .
to this day , from nov .
24 until dec .
24 , shoppers flock to the market in the city center which also features a christmas pyramid , woodcarvings and a stolle n festival , where a nearly four-ton heavy version of the fruit-cake-like german christmas specialty that dresden is famous for will be dished up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the augsburg market lights up the night cologne has six christmas markets , one of which is situated next to the city 's gothic cathedral .
the cathedral 's towers , reaching some 150 meters -lrb- 490-feet -rrb- into the winter sky , make the giant christmas tree in the middle of the setting appear quite small .
in the four weeks of december during which the markets are open , around 2 million people come to cologne , according to karl-heinz merfeld of the cologne tourism association .
" the christmas market industry is still important … and the tourists who come here are usually really excited - above all the english and dutch - because they are n't familiar with these kinds of markets with the music and the lights , " he said .
in augsburg 's old market , once called the lebkuche n markt after the gingerbread-like cookie called lebkuche n it sold , visitors still can find numerous varieties of the baked goods .
ce n turies ' old traditio n no trip to the christmas market is complete without a bratwurst sausage or a cup of german mulled wine , which is spiced with cinnamon and cloves .
it is said to have originated in india , where the drink was prepared with water , alcohol , sugar and spices .
apparently the british then brought the recipe to europe in the 18th century .
folklore has it that at the christmas market in nuremberg , germany 's most famous , someone first added red wine to the mixture and created what 's now known as glühwei n .
these days , about every third stall sells the stuff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : backer thomas schmidt with tons of the christmas specialty , stollen , in dresden still , christmas markets have come a long way since they were first introduced in germany .
dresden is said to have had the first , in the 15th century , and nuremberg followed suit in 1697 .
in 1820 , the first christmas market was held in cologne and restricted to locals who could buy toys and food but no alcoholic beverages .
back to the past now cologne holds a medieval christmas market where the salespeople wear wool clothes and wooden shoes and pursue medieval chores like blacksmithing .
the smell of burning wood wafts through the air , and candles illuminate the setting .
nothing as profane as reibekuche n or potato pancakes is for sale ; hungry visitors can snack on unleavened bread freshly baked in ovens heated with wood .
nor is glühwei n available .
instead , thirsty souls drink mead .
since christmas markets did n't exist during medieval times , one of the organizers drew a tenuous link to the markets held long ago . " the emphasis is on a market where there is peace and quiet as opposed to the other christmas markets where the turbulences of every-day life are dominant , " he said .

dieter graumann , board member of the central council for jews in germany spoke to dw-world about their integration . dw-world : integration has long been a contoversial political issue . what does it mean to you ? dieter graumann : the way i see it , integration is the process of becoming part of a society without giving up one 's own identity .
as jews , we want to be jews in a country which respects us as such and does not exclude us .
that is how we would like integration to be . how does that process of integration look for new members of the jewish community ?
there are sometimes problems .
it 's a little bit odd that a minority in our community , which is not well integrated itself , should be responsible for integratíng a majority .
but somehow it works .
it is important to point out here that jewish migrants enrich rather than burden the jewish community and german society .
and that is why we are fighting to encourage migration to germany .
it 's very important for us , because it gives jewish life in germany a dynamic , vitality and perspective which help us all . how german can a migrant be ? jews have a painful past experience of that .
germany had a jewish population which tried to be very german , one could say , more german than the germans .
we know now that it was of no help when it came to the nazis and we have learned that giving up on being jewish does n't make anybody a better german .
standing by and nurturing one 's own identity and being responsible german citizens are not mutually exclusive .
that goes for other migrant groups as well . what problems do jewish migrants face while trying to fit into german society ? jewish migrants who come here from the former soviet union , are initially faced with existential problems , such as having nowhere to live , no training and no job .
these problems are so big that they completely consume the newcomers .
people who have to concentrate on looking for an apartment or a job invest their initial energies in doing just that .
but with time , that begins to change .
we hope that people who are here for longer find a way to become a part of society .
we can see it happening in the case of second-generation jewish migrants . what role does religion play in the integration process ? religion in itself neither serves to hinder nor help the integration process .
of course it is worrying when we notice the emergence of parallel societies , but i know that we jews try to avoid the creation of ghettos .
we have to live in the middle of society , to nurture our judaism and not partition ourselves off from others . how important is it that migrant groups are represented by an organization ?
i do n't want to tell anybody else what to do , but we have seen that it makes sense to speak with a united voice rather than dividing our energies .
those who pool their strength are taken more seriously and are granted greater political recognition than a series of splinter organizations trying to represent a single migrant group .

dieter graumann , board member of the central council for jews in germany spoke to dw-world about their integration . dw-world : integration has long been a contoversial political issue . what does it mean to you ? dieter graumann : the way i see it , integration is the process of becoming part of a society without giving up one 's own identity .
as jews , we want to be jews in a country which respects us as such and does not exclude us .
that is how we would like integration to be . how does that process of integration look for new members of the jewish community ?
there are sometimes problems .
it 's a little bit odd that a minority in our community , which is not well integrated itself , should be responsible for integratíng a majority .
but somehow it works .
it is important to point out here that jewish migrants enrich rather than burden the jewish community and german society .
and that is why we are fighting to encourage migration to germany .
it 's very important for us , because it gives jewish life in germany a dynamic , vitality and perspective which help us all . how german can a migrant be ? jews have a painful past experience of that .
germany had a jewish population which tried to be very german , one could say , more german than the germans .
we know now that it was of no help when it came to the nazis and we have learned that giving up on being jewish does n't make anybody a better german .
standing by and nurturing one 's own identity and being responsible german citizens are not mutually exclusive .
that goes for other migrant groups as well . what problems do jewish migrants face while trying to fit into german society ? jewish migrants who come here from the former soviet union , are initially faced with existential problems , such as having nowhere to live , no training and no job .
these problems are so big that they completely consume the newcomers .
people who have to concentrate on looking for an apartment or a job invest their initial energies in doing just that .
but with time , that begins to change .
we hope that people who are here for longer find a way to become a part of society .
we can see it happening in the case of second-generation jewish migrants . what role does religion play in the integration process ? religion in itself neither serves to hinder nor help the integration process .
of course it is worrying when we notice the emergence of parallel societies , but i know that we jews try to avoid the creation of ghettos .
we have to live in the middle of society , to nurture our judaism and not partition ourselves off from others . how important is it that migrant groups are represented by an organization ?
i do n't want to tell anybody else what to do , but we have seen that it makes sense to speak with a united voice rather than dividing our energies .
those who pool their strength are taken more seriously and are granted greater political recognition than a series of splinter organizations trying to represent a single migrant group .

not all reader comme n ts have bee n published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for le n gth a n d appropriate n ess of co n te n t .
i strongly believe that the rumors are correct about secret prisons run by the cia .
the americans have demonstrated in the past time and time again that while preaching " democracy " they violate the principles whenever it suits them .
and all in the name of democracy . - haymohenry i do n't have hard evidence , but everything suggests that , yes , we do have such secret prisons in europe .
we need your help to shed light on this horrible issue .
this is an utter disgrace for the so-called leader of the free world . - citizennaim i think that the bush administration will do anything that it can get away with .
these people regard themselves as above all laws .
bush has said " it would be eerier if i had absolute dictatorial powers . "
nixon said : " the president has absolute power , but only for four years . "
there is a school of thought among the american right wing that says : " only we know what is best ; therefore your opinion does n't count .
we will decide everything . " - rgmccorkle i am a us army and us air force vet .
i know a little about the c-130 air craft pictured at the top of the web page .
if these planes are being used , they would have to be refueled in central europe to reach romania or bulgaria .
the cia has done some very bad things over the years .
the end justifies the means . - lee davis i live in romania and i know from our newspapers that the cia planes stopped on the airports mihail kogalniceanu and timisoara , but i am sure that in romania there are not secret prisons . - constantin liviuviorel , romania germany seems more " troubled " about the fate of terrorists in cia custody than the activities of the terrorists themselves .
it should be kept in mind that information gathered from jailed terrorists may prevent something bad from happening in germany .
but it is considered safe to criticize the cia .
judging from the free pass given to terrorists on trial in german courts , nothing must be done to make the terrorists mad .
they may notice that berlin has some tall buildings too . - petra ronish it does not matter what we think about the truthfulness of secret cia prisons on european soil , the facts are well-documented that the cia very seldom played by the rules of the geneva convention .
so why should we doubt the critics now ? - guenter gosau , canada the washington post is known for getting it wrong sometimes .
there is a big fight between republicans and democrats and i 'll bet that is the underlying issue .
one is doing everything it can to embarrass bush at the moment .
he does n't need any help though . - russaa compiled by dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us denies mini-guantanamo in kosovo the us military saturday denied that it was running a guantanamo-style prison for terror suspects in kosovo , as tensions continued to simmer over reports of secret cia flights across europe .
-lrb- nov .
26 , 2005 -rrb- cia uses german bases to transport terrorists , paper says while the issue over secret cia prisons in europe continues to simmer , new allegations over undisclosed cia flights transporting suspected terrorists is pushing european officials to demand answers from washington .
-lrb- nov .

so far the americans remain silent .

and even though christmas in germany also means tinsel and lights and extended shopping hours , it is the markets that set the country off from its christian neighbors . a typical christmas market consists of wooden stalls perched on a site in the center of the city , where people shove past each other to buy christmas decorations and stop for a chat over a mug of mulled wine .

the versatile movie-maker from hamburg , made it big in 2004 with his hit " head on . " born to turkish parents , fatih akin grew up in germany .
his first feature film , " short sharp shock , " told the story of three young friends looking for happiness , love , power and wealth .
it proved to be too much all at once and had a negative effect for some of the movie 's protagonists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sibel kekilli and birol ünel in " head on " his second feature , " in july , " was essentially about love , and recounted the tale of two young people , daniel and july , who find one another after traveling thousands of kilometers between germany and turkey .
for what was essentially a very simple story , fatih akin used several genres , from wild fairy-tale to romantic comedy to road movie . " i know the route from hamburg to istanbul very well because my parents and i used to drive it each year during the summer holidays .
we 'd all pile into the car , a ford transit with luggage rack .
it was all a bit of a cliché , and that is possibly the most autobiographical element of the whole thing . " points for radicalism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from akin 's film " solino " although he was quite playful in his first films and would n't part with his original ideas , akin knows how to switch from one genre to another .
he proved his versatility in the film " solino " , which is about italian immigrants in germany 's highly-industrialized ruhr valley region .
for the first time , akin adapted someone else 's script , and the resulting film was a little too polished and less original . his big hit , " head on , " was his triumph .
a love story full of passion , desperation , violence and humor , it is one of the best films to emerge from germany in recent years .
it served to silence critics who scorned him for being too complaisant .
his bravery was rewarded when his most radical film to date won him the highest award , the golden bear , at the 2004 berlin film festival as well as the european film award later in the year . bildunterschrift : " crossing the bridge " film poster following the success of " head on , " akin said he still had a " little bit of strength , " and he invested it in the music film " crossing the bridge - the sound of istanbul . "
when asked whether music has the power to affect change , he offered a clear " yes , " adding that it " might be naive , " but such is his belief . and perhaps it is this very naivety which leads akin to ask questions and to review his own opinions .
as such , he remains a filmmaker with the capacity to surprise his audience and from whom they can expect much to come . jörg tszman -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cinema on life support in 1990 , the eu launched the media program to provide support for european films , in danger of being driven to extinction by hollywood .

dieter graumann , board member of the central council for jews in germany spoke to dw-world about their integration . dw-world : integration has long been a contoversial political issue . what does it mean to you ? dieter graumann : the way i see it , integration is the process of becoming part of a society without giving up one 's own identity .
as jews , we want to be jews in a country which respects us as such and does not exclude us .
that is how we would like integration to be . how does that process of integration look for new members of the jewish community ?
there are sometimes problems .
it 's a little bit odd that a minority in our community , which is not well integrated itself , should be responsible for integratíng a majority .
but somehow it works .
it is important to point out here that jewish migrants enrich rather than burden the jewish community and german society .
and that is why we are fighting to encourage migration to germany .
it 's very important for us , because it gives jewish life in germany a dynamic , vitality and perspective which help us all . how german can a migrant be ? jews have a painful past experience of that .
germany had a jewish population which tried to be very german , one could say , more german than the germans .
we know now that it was of no help when it came to the nazis and we have learned that giving up on being jewish does n't make anybody a better german .
standing by and nurturing one 's own identity and being responsible german citizens are not mutually exclusive .
that goes for other migrant groups as well . what problems do jewish migrants face while trying to fit into german society ? jewish migrants who come here from the former soviet union , are initially faced with existential problems , such as having nowhere to live , no training and no job .
these problems are so big that they completely consume the newcomers .
people who have to concentrate on looking for an apartment or a job invest their initial energies in doing just that .
but with time , that begins to change .
we hope that people who are here for longer find a way to become a part of society .
we can see it happening in the case of second-generation jewish migrants . what role does religion play in the integration process ? religion in itself neither serves to hinder nor help the integration process .
of course it is worrying when we notice the emergence of parallel societies , but i know that we jews try to avoid the creation of ghettos .
we have to live in the middle of society , to nurture our judaism and not partition ourselves off from others . how important is it that migrant groups are represented by an organization ?
i do n't want to tell anybody else what to do , but we have seen that it makes sense to speak with a united voice rather than dividing our energies .
those who pool their strength are taken more seriously and are granted greater political recognition than a series of splinter organizations trying to represent a single migrant group .

standing by and nurturing one 's own identity and being responsible german citizens are not mutually exclusive .
that goes for other migrant groups as well . what problems do jewish migrants face while trying to fit into german society ? jewish migrants who come here from the former soviet union , are initially faced with existential problems , such as having nowhere to live , no training and no job .
these problems are so big that they completely consume the newcomers .
people who have to concentrate on looking for an apartment or a job invest their initial energies in doing just that .
but with time , that begins to change .
we hope that people who are here for longer find a way to become a part of society .
we can see it happening in the case of second-generation jewish migrants . what role does religion play in the integration process ? religion in itself neither serves to hinder nor help the integration process .
of course it is worrying when we notice the emergence of parallel societies , but i know that we jews try to avoid the creation of ghettos .
we have to live in the middle of society , to nurture our judaism and not partition ourselves off from others . how important is it that migrant groups are represented by an organization ?
i do n't want to tell anybody else what to do , but we have seen that it makes sense to speak with a united voice rather than dividing our energies .
those who pool their strength are taken more seriously and are granted greater political recognition than a series of splinter organizations trying to represent a single migrant group .

dieter graumann , board member of the central council for jews in germany spoke to dw-world about their integration . dw-world : integration has long been a contoversial political issue . what does it mean to you ? dieter graumann : the way i see it , integration is the process of becoming part of a society without giving up one 's own identity .
as jews , we want to be jews in a country which respects us as such and does not exclude us .
that is how we would like integration to be . how does that process of integration look for new members of the jewish community ?
there are sometimes problems .
it 's a little bit odd that a minority in our community , which is not well integrated itself , should be responsible for integratíng a majority .
but somehow it works .
it is important to point out here that jewish migrants enrich rather than burden the jewish community and german society .
and that is why we are fighting to encourage migration to germany .
it 's very important for us , because it gives jewish life in germany a dynamic , vitality and perspective which help us all . how german can a migrant be ? jews have a painful past experience of that .
germany had a jewish population which tried to be very german , one could say , more german than the germans .
we know now that it was of no help when it came to the nazis and we have learned that giving up on being jewish does n't make anybody a better german .
standing by and nurturing one 's own identity and being responsible german citizens are not mutually exclusive .

the latest shareholder meeting revealed though that some calm has returned to the boardroom and that is spilling onto the pitch this season . it was probably borussia dortmund team president hans-joachim watzke 's worst nightmare .
top players like strikers jan koller and lars ricken , veterans with loads of experience to help the cash-strapped club through troubled times , get hurt and are out for weeks .
the possibility of climbing out from the almost 90-million-euro -lrb- $ 108-million -rrb- hole by making it to european club competition seemed nothing but a dream .
yet instead of plummeting to the bottom of the table , manager bert van marwijk has performed a minor miracle in the first half of the season and has dortmund in the upper flights of the bundesliga .
it might be too soon to speak of a phoenix rising from the ashes , but the atmosphere of the recent shareholder meeting on nov .
22 was the complete opposite of last year 's .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans heaped abuse on dortmund president niebaum -lrb- left -rrb- and general manager meier last year at that time , former club president gerd niebaum and general manager michael meier received an earful from unappreciative shareholders and fans , and they later handed in their resignations .
supporters ' flight in the late 1990s and early 2000s almost ended in the club 's demise .
just this spring , the club stood on the brink of bankruptcy after their house of cards based on risky schemes collapsed .
" no more amoroso deals " hans-joachim watzke was given the assignment of restoring order to borussia .
he 's done his job well , and that has brought back a sense of calm to the ruhr valley city .
be it the sale of the naming rights to the traditional westfalen stadium - soon-to-be signal iduna park - or more sponsors , watzke seems to be have turned around the critical situation of last spring , where the club stood on the brink of bankruptcy .
the 46-year old has won the confidence of the shareholders - much needed after the club amassed losses amounting to 145 million euros over the last two seasons .

flamboyant brazilian striker marcio amoroso signed on in 2001 for 25 million euros and immediately led the team to a bundesliga title with his 18 goals .
then he got hurt and became a liability to the club when he returned .
during a tumultuous 2003-04 campaign , his contract was dissolved , but the club still had to pay him .
youth can pay off in the current campaign , one that the soccer experts thought could result in dortmund 's relegation , the team has performed impressively .
former german international and current hungary manager lothar matthäus recently wrote for the magazine sport-bild just how amazed he was by manager bert van marwijk 's job this autumn .

seventeen-year old nuri sahin and 18-year old marc-andre kruska have secured starting spots in the current situation , much to the chagrin of " oldies " like 22-year old swiss international philipp degen .

not all reader comme n ts have bee n published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for le n gth a n d appropriate n ess of co n te n t .
i strongly believe that the rumors are correct about secret prisons run by the cia .
the americans have demonstrated in the past time and time again that while preaching " democracy " they violate the principles whenever it suits them .
and all in the name of democracy . - haymohenry i do n't have hard evidence , but everything suggests that , yes , we do have such secret prisons in europe .
we need your help to shed light on this horrible issue .
this is an utter disgrace for the so-called leader of the free world . - citizennaim i think that the bush administration will do anything that it can get away with .
these people regard themselves as above all laws .
bush has said " it would be eerier if i had absolute dictatorial powers . "
nixon said : " the president has absolute power , but only for four years . "
there is a school of thought among the american right wing that says : " only we know what is best ; therefore your opinion does n't count .
we will decide everything . " - rgmccorkle i am a us army and us air force vet .
i know a little about the c-130 air craft pictured at the top of the web page .
if these planes are being used , they would have to be refueled in central europe to reach romania or bulgaria .
the cia has done some very bad things over the years .
the end justifies the means . - lee davis i live in romania and i know from our newspapers that the cia planes stopped on the airports mihail kogalniceanu and timisoara , but i am sure that in romania there are not secret prisons . - constantin liviuviorel , romania germany seems more " troubled " about the fate of terrorists in cia custody than the activities of the terrorists themselves .
it should be kept in mind that information gathered from jailed terrorists may prevent something bad from happening in germany .
but it is considered safe to criticize the cia .
judging from the free pass given to terrorists on trial in german courts , nothing must be done to make the terrorists mad .
they may notice that berlin has some tall buildings too . - petra ronish it does not matter what we think about the truthfulness of secret cia prisons on european soil , the facts are well-documented that the cia very seldom played by the rules of the geneva convention .
so why should we doubt the critics now ? - guenter gosau , canada the washington post is known for getting it wrong sometimes .
there is a big fight between republicans and democrats and i 'll bet that is the underlying issue .
one is doing everything it can to embarrass bush at the moment .
he does n't need any help though . - russaa compiled by dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us denies mini-guantanamo in kosovo the us military saturday denied that it was running a guantanamo-style prison for terror suspects in kosovo , as tensions continued to simmer over reports of secret cia flights across europe .

26 , 2005 -rrb- cia uses german bases to transport terrorists , paper says while the issue over secret cia prisons in europe continues to simmer , new allegations over undisclosed cia flights transporting suspected terrorists is pushing european officials to demand answers from washington .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.11.2005 being jewish in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration ca n't start soon enough since 1989 , some 190,000 jews from the former soviet union have come to germany .
dieter graumann , board member of the central council for jews in germany spoke to dw-world about their integration . dw-world : integration has long been a contoversial political issue . what does it mean to you ? dieter graumann : the way i see it , integration is the process of becoming part of a society without giving up one 's own identity .
as jews , we want to be jews in a country which respects us as such and does not exclude us .
that is how we would like integration to be . how does that process of integration look for new members of the jewish community ?
there are sometimes problems .
it 's a little bit odd that a minority in our community , which is not well integrated itself , should be responsible for integratíng a majority .
but somehow it works .
it is important to point out here that jewish migrants enrich rather than burden the jewish community and german society .
and that is why we are fighting to encourage migration to germany .
it 's very important for us , because it gives jewish life in germany a dynamic , vitality and perspective which help us all . how german can a migrant be ? jews have a painful past experience of that .
germany had a jewish population which tried to be very german , one could say , more german than the germans .
we know now that it was of no help when it came to the nazis and we have learned that giving up on being jewish does n't make anybody a better german .
standing by and nurturing one 's own identity and being responsible german citizens are not mutually exclusive .
that goes for other migrant groups as well . what problems do jewish migrants face while trying to fit into german society ? jewish migrants who come here from the former soviet union , are initially faced with existential problems , such as having nowhere to live , no training and no job .
these problems are so big that they completely consume the newcomers .
people who have to concentrate on looking for an apartment or a job invest their initial energies in doing just that .
but with time , that begins to change .
we hope that people who are here for longer find a way to become a part of society .
we can see it happening in the case of second-generation jewish migrants . what role does religion play in the integration process ? religion in itself neither serves to hinder nor help the integration process .
of course it is worrying when we notice the emergence of parallel societies , but i know that we jews try to avoid the creation of ghettos .
we have to live in the middle of society , to nurture our judaism and not partition ourselves off from others . how important is it that migrant groups are represented by an organization ?
i do n't want to tell anybody else what to do , but we have seen that it makes sense to speak with a united voice rather than dividing our energies .
those who pool their strength are taken more seriously and are granted greater political recognition than a series of splinter organizations trying to represent a single migrant group .

the versatile movie-maker from hamburg , made it big in 2004 with his hit " head on . " born to turkish parents , fatih akin grew up in germany .
his first feature film , " short sharp shock , " told the story of three young friends looking for happiness , love , power and wealth .

for the first time , akin adapted someone else 's script , and the resulting film was a little too polished and less original . his big hit , " head on , " was his triumph .
a love story full of passion , desperation , violence and humor , it is one of the best films to emerge from germany in recent years .
it served to silence critics who scorned him for being too complaisant .
his bravery was rewarded when his most radical film to date won him the highest award , the golden bear , at the 2004 berlin film festival as well as the european film award later in the year . bildunterschrift : " crossing the bridge " film poster following the success of " head on , " akin said he still had a " little bit of strength , " and he invested it in the music film " crossing the bridge - the sound of istanbul . "
when asked whether music has the power to affect change , he offered a clear " yes , " adding that it " might be naive , " but such is his belief . and perhaps it is this very naivety which leads akin to ask questions and to review his own opinions .

and even though christmas in germany also means tinsel and lights and extended shopping hours , it is the markets that set the country off from its christian neighbors . a typical christmas market consists of wooden stalls perched on a site in the center of the city , where people shove past each other to buy christmas decorations and stop for a chat over a mug of mulled wine .
a nativity scene is usually on display and often musicians , singers and dance clubs offer entertainment from a central stage .
lo n g traditio n since the 15th century , merchants have traveled to dresden to display their wares .
to this day , from nov .
24 until dec .
24 , shoppers flock to the market in the city center which also features a christmas pyramid , woodcarvings and a stolle n festival , where a nearly four-ton heavy version of the fruit-cake-like german christmas specialty that dresden is famous for will be dished up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the augsburg market lights up the night cologne has six christmas markets , one of which is situated next to the city 's gothic cathedral .
the cathedral 's towers , reaching some 150 meters -lrb- 490-feet -rrb- into the winter sky , make the giant christmas tree in the middle of the setting appear quite small .
in the four weeks of december during which the markets are open , around 2 million people come to cologne , according to karl-heinz merfeld of the cologne tourism association .
" the christmas market industry is still important … and the tourists who come here are usually really excited - above all the english and dutch - because they are n't familiar with these kinds of markets with the music and the lights , " he said .
in augsburg 's old market , once called the lebkuche n markt after the gingerbread-like cookie called lebkuche n it sold , visitors still can find numerous varieties of the baked goods .
ce n turies ' old traditio n no trip to the christmas market is complete without a bratwurst sausage or a cup of german mulled wine , which is spiced with cinnamon and cloves .
it is said to have originated in india , where the drink was prepared with water , alcohol , sugar and spices .
apparently the british then brought the recipe to europe in the 18th century .
folklore has it that at the christmas market in nuremberg , germany 's most famous , someone first added red wine to the mixture and created what 's now known as glühwei n .
these days , about every third stall sells the stuff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : backer thomas schmidt with tons of the christmas specialty , stollen , in dresden still , christmas markets have come a long way since they were first introduced in germany .
dresden is said to have had the first , in the 15th century , and nuremberg followed suit in 1697 .
in 1820 , the first christmas market was held in cologne and restricted to locals who could buy toys and food but no alcoholic beverages .
back to the past now cologne holds a medieval christmas market where the salespeople wear wool clothes and wooden shoes and pursue medieval chores like blacksmithing .
the smell of burning wood wafts through the air , and candles illuminate the setting .
nothing as profane as reibekuche n or potato pancakes is for sale ; hungry visitors can snack on unleavened bread freshly baked in ovens heated with wood .
nor is glühwei n available .
instead , thirsty souls drink mead .
since christmas markets did n't exist during medieval times , one of the organizers drew a tenuous link to the markets held long ago . " the emphasis is on a market where there is peace and quiet as opposed to the other christmas markets where the turbulences of every-day life are dominant , " he said .

" what we have read is in fact grounds for concern , " steinmeier said in an interview with the weekly bild am sonntag published sunday , one day before he is to travel to the united states . steinmeier welcomed a request made by his british counterpart jack straw to washington on behalf of the european union for an explanation of the accounts and said he would reserve judgment until an answer was received . " a foreign minister must evaluate the facts and not newspaper reports , " he said . germany has already opened an investigation into a case in which an egyptian suspect was reportedly secretly transported via ramstein in western germany , the largest us air base in europe . public broadcaster zdf and several newspapers have reported that more than 80 secret central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- flights touched down in germany en route to secret centers where suspects , held without charge as " enemy combatants , " were allegedly interrogated and tortured .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.11.2005 being jewish in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : integration ca n't start soon enough since 1989 , some 190,000 jews from the former soviet union have come to germany .
dieter graumann , board member of the central council for jews in germany spoke to dw-world about their integration . dw-world : integration has long been a contoversial political issue . what does it mean to you ? dieter graumann : the way i see it , integration is the process of becoming part of a society without giving up one 's own identity .
as jews , we want to be jews in a country which respects us as such and does not exclude us .
that is how we would like integration to be . how does that process of integration look for new members of the jewish community ?
there are sometimes problems .
it 's a little bit odd that a minority in our community , which is not well integrated itself , should be responsible for integratíng a majority .
but somehow it works .
it is important to point out here that jewish migrants enrich rather than burden the jewish community and german society .
and that is why we are fighting to encourage migration to germany .
it 's very important for us , because it gives jewish life in germany a dynamic , vitality and perspective which help us all . how german can a migrant be ? jews have a painful past experience of that .
germany had a jewish population which tried to be very german , one could say , more german than the germans .
we know now that it was of no help when it came to the nazis and we have learned that giving up on being jewish does n't make anybody a better german .
standing by and nurturing one 's own identity and being responsible german citizens are not mutually exclusive .
that goes for other migrant groups as well . what problems do jewish migrants face while trying to fit into german society ? jewish migrants who come here from the former soviet union , are initially faced with existential problems , such as having nowhere to live , no training and no job .
these problems are so big that they completely consume the newcomers .
people who have to concentrate on looking for an apartment or a job invest their initial energies in doing just that .
but with time , that begins to change .
we hope that people who are here for longer find a way to become a part of society .

not all reader comme n ts have bee n published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for le n gth a n d appropriate n ess of co n te n t .
i strongly believe that the rumors are correct about secret prisons run by the cia .
the americans have demonstrated in the past time and time again that while preaching " democracy " they violate the principles whenever it suits them .
and all in the name of democracy . - haymohenry i do n't have hard evidence , but everything suggests that , yes , we do have such secret prisons in europe .
we need your help to shed light on this horrible issue .
this is an utter disgrace for the so-called leader of the free world . - citizennaim i think that the bush administration will do anything that it can get away with .
these people regard themselves as above all laws .
bush has said " it would be eerier if i had absolute dictatorial powers . "
nixon said : " the president has absolute power , but only for four years . "
there is a school of thought among the american right wing that says : " only we know what is best ; therefore your opinion does n't count .
we will decide everything . " - rgmccorkle i am a us army and us air force vet .
i know a little about the c-130 air craft pictured at the top of the web page .
if these planes are being used , they would have to be refueled in central europe to reach romania or bulgaria .
the cia has done some very bad things over the years .
the end justifies the means . - lee davis i live in romania and i know from our newspapers that the cia planes stopped on the airports mihail kogalniceanu and timisoara , but i am sure that in romania there are not secret prisons . - constantin liviuviorel , romania germany seems more " troubled " about the fate of terrorists in cia custody than the activities of the terrorists themselves .
it should be kept in mind that information gathered from jailed terrorists may prevent something bad from happening in germany .
but it is considered safe to criticize the cia .
judging from the free pass given to terrorists on trial in german courts , nothing must be done to make the terrorists mad .
they may notice that berlin has some tall buildings too . - petra ronish it does not matter what we think about the truthfulness of secret cia prisons on european soil , the facts are well-documented that the cia very seldom played by the rules of the geneva convention .
so why should we doubt the critics now ? - guenter gosau , canada the washington post is known for getting it wrong sometimes .
there is a big fight between republicans and democrats and i 'll bet that is the underlying issue .
one is doing everything it can to embarrass bush at the moment .
he does n't need any help though . - russaa compiled by dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us denies mini-guantanamo in kosovo the us military saturday denied that it was running a guantanamo-style prison for terror suspects in kosovo , as tensions continued to simmer over reports of secret cia flights across europe .

dieter graumann , board member of the central council for jews in germany spoke to dw-world about their integration . dw-world : integration has long been a contoversial political issue . what does it mean to you ? dieter graumann : the way i see it , integration is the process of becoming part of a society without giving up one 's own identity .

standing by and nurturing one 's own identity and being responsible german citizens are not mutually exclusive .
that goes for other migrant groups as well . what problems do jewish migrants face while trying to fit into german society ? jewish migrants who come here from the former soviet union , are initially faced with existential problems , such as having nowhere to live , no training and no job .
these problems are so big that they completely consume the newcomers .
people who have to concentrate on looking for an apartment or a job invest their initial energies in doing just that .

the latest shareholder meeting revealed though that some calm has returned to the boardroom and that is spilling onto the pitch this season . it was probably borussia dortmund team president hans-joachim watzke 's worst nightmare .
top players like strikers jan koller and lars ricken , veterans with loads of experience to help the cash-strapped club through troubled times , get hurt and are out for weeks .
the possibility of climbing out from the almost 90-million-euro -lrb- $ 108-million -rrb- hole by making it to european club competition seemed nothing but a dream .
yet instead of plummeting to the bottom of the table , manager bert van marwijk has performed a minor miracle in the first half of the season and has dortmund in the upper flights of the bundesliga .
it might be too soon to speak of a phoenix rising from the ashes , but the atmosphere of the recent shareholder meeting on nov .
22 was the complete opposite of last year 's .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans heaped abuse on dortmund president niebaum -lrb- left -rrb- and general manager meier last year at that time , former club president gerd niebaum and general manager michael meier received an earful from unappreciative shareholders and fans , and they later handed in their resignations .
supporters ' flight in the late 1990s and early 2000s almost ended in the club 's demise .
just this spring , the club stood on the brink of bankruptcy after their house of cards based on risky schemes collapsed .
" no more amoroso deals " hans-joachim watzke was given the assignment of restoring order to borussia .
he 's done his job well , and that has brought back a sense of calm to the ruhr valley city .
be it the sale of the naming rights to the traditional westfalen stadium - soon-to-be signal iduna park - or more sponsors , watzke seems to be have turned around the critical situation of last spring , where the club stood on the brink of bankruptcy .
the 46-year old has won the confidence of the shareholders - much needed after the club amassed losses amounting to 145 million euros over the last two seasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcio amoroso , once feted and then maligned at dortmund " there wo n't be any financial high-wire acts with me - there wo n't be any amoroso deals , " he said at the shareholder meeting .
watzke was referring to one of the biggest player flops in dortmund history .
flamboyant brazilian striker marcio amoroso signed on in 2001 for 25 million euros and immediately led the team to a bundesliga title with his 18 goals .
then he got hurt and became a liability to the club when he returned .
during a tumultuous 2003-04 campaign , his contract was dissolved , but the club still had to pay him .
youth can pay off in the current campaign , one that the soccer experts thought could result in dortmund 's relegation , the team has performed impressively .
former german international and current hungary manager lothar matthäus recently wrote for the magazine sport-bild just how amazed he was by manager bert van marwijk 's job this autumn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manager bert van marwijk must n't hide his face anymore van marwijk has done it with youth .
not because he necessarily wanted to , but because watzke has brought about an end to expensive foreign acquisitions .
the team 's average age on the playing field is a youthful 23.8 years .
seventeen-year old nuri sahin and 18-year old marc-andre kruska have secured starting spots in the current situation , much to the chagrin of " oldies " like 22-year old swiss international philipp degen .
it has worked so far , but many wonder whether such a young squad can keep up the strong performances .
the fact is , watzke and van marwijk do n't have much choice . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de life after soccer ?

the latest shareholder meeting revealed though that some calm has returned to the boardroom and that is spilling onto the pitch this season . it was probably borussia dortmund team president hans-joachim watzke 's worst nightmare .
top players like strikers jan koller and lars ricken , veterans with loads of experience to help the cash-strapped club through troubled times , get hurt and are out for weeks .
the possibility of climbing out from the almost 90-million-euro -lrb- $ 108-million -rrb- hole by making it to european club competition seemed nothing but a dream .
yet instead of plummeting to the bottom of the table , manager bert van marwijk has performed a minor miracle in the first half of the season and has dortmund in the upper flights of the bundesliga .
it might be too soon to speak of a phoenix rising from the ashes , but the atmosphere of the recent shareholder meeting on nov .
22 was the complete opposite of last year 's .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans heaped abuse on dortmund president niebaum -lrb- left -rrb- and general manager meier last year at that time , former club president gerd niebaum and general manager michael meier received an earful from unappreciative shareholders and fans , and they later handed in their resignations .
supporters ' flight in the late 1990s and early 2000s almost ended in the club 's demise .
just this spring , the club stood on the brink of bankruptcy after their house of cards based on risky schemes collapsed .
" no more amoroso deals " hans-joachim watzke was given the assignment of restoring order to borussia .
he 's done his job well , and that has brought back a sense of calm to the ruhr valley city .
be it the sale of the naming rights to the traditional westfalen stadium - soon-to-be signal iduna park - or more sponsors , watzke seems to be have turned around the critical situation of last spring , where the club stood on the brink of bankruptcy .
the 46-year old has won the confidence of the shareholders - much needed after the club amassed losses amounting to 145 million euros over the last two seasons .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcio amoroso , once feted and then maligned at dortmund " there wo n't be any financial high-wire acts with me - there wo n't be any amoroso deals , " he said at the shareholder meeting .
watzke was referring to one of the biggest player flops in dortmund history .
flamboyant brazilian striker marcio amoroso signed on in 2001 for 25 million euros and immediately led the team to a bundesliga title with his 18 goals .
then he got hurt and became a liability to the club when he returned .
during a tumultuous 2003-04 campaign , his contract was dissolved , but the club still had to pay him .
youth can pay off in the current campaign , one that the soccer experts thought could result in dortmund 's relegation , the team has performed impressively .
former german international and current hungary manager lothar matthäus recently wrote for the magazine sport-bild just how amazed he was by manager bert van marwijk 's job this autumn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : manager bert van marwijk must n't hide his face anymore van marwijk has done it with youth .
not because he necessarily wanted to , but because watzke has brought about an end to expensive foreign acquisitions .
the team 's average age on the playing field is a youthful 23.8 years .
seventeen-year old nuri sahin and 18-year old marc-andre kruska have secured starting spots in the current situation , much to the chagrin of " oldies " like 22-year old swiss international philipp degen .
it has worked so far , but many wonder whether such a young squad can keep up the strong performances .
the fact is , watzke and van marwijk do n't have much choice . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de life after soccer ?

and even though christmas in germany also means tinsel and lights and extended shopping hours , it is the markets that set the country off from its christian neighbors . a typical christmas market consists of wooden stalls perched on a site in the center of the city , where people shove past each other to buy christmas decorations and stop for a chat over a mug of mulled wine .
a nativity scene is usually on display and often musicians , singers and dance clubs offer entertainment from a central stage .
lo n g traditio n since the 15th century , merchants have traveled to dresden to display their wares .
to this day , from nov .
24 until dec .
24 , shoppers flock to the market in the city center which also features a christmas pyramid , woodcarvings and a stolle n festival , where a nearly four-ton heavy version of the fruit-cake-like german christmas specialty that dresden is famous for will be dished up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the augsburg market lights up the night cologne has six christmas markets , one of which is situated next to the city 's gothic cathedral .
the cathedral 's towers , reaching some 150 meters -lrb- 490-feet -rrb- into the winter sky , make the giant christmas tree in the middle of the setting appear quite small .
in the four weeks of december during which the markets are open , around 2 million people come to cologne , according to karl-heinz merfeld of the cologne tourism association .
" the christmas market industry is still important … and the tourists who come here are usually really excited - above all the english and dutch - because they are n't familiar with these kinds of markets with the music and the lights , " he said .
in augsburg 's old market , once called the lebkuche n markt after the gingerbread-like cookie called lebkuche n it sold , visitors still can find numerous varieties of the baked goods .
ce n turies ' old traditio n no trip to the christmas market is complete without a bratwurst sausage or a cup of german mulled wine , which is spiced with cinnamon and cloves .
it is said to have originated in india , where the drink was prepared with water , alcohol , sugar and spices .
apparently the british then brought the recipe to europe in the 18th century .
folklore has it that at the christmas market in nuremberg , germany 's most famous , someone first added red wine to the mixture and created what 's now known as glühwei n .
these days , about every third stall sells the stuff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : backer thomas schmidt with tons of the christmas specialty , stollen , in dresden still , christmas markets have come a long way since they were first introduced in germany .
dresden is said to have had the first , in the 15th century , and nuremberg followed suit in 1697 .
in 1820 , the first christmas market was held in cologne and restricted to locals who could buy toys and food but no alcoholic beverages .
back to the past now cologne holds a medieval christmas market where the salespeople wear wool clothes and wooden shoes and pursue medieval chores like blacksmithing .
the smell of burning wood wafts through the air , and candles illuminate the setting .
nothing as profane as reibekuche n or potato pancakes is for sale ; hungry visitors can snack on unleavened bread freshly baked in ovens heated with wood .
nor is glühwei n available .
instead , thirsty souls drink mead .
since christmas markets did n't exist during medieval times , one of the organizers drew a tenuous link to the markets held long ago . " the emphasis is on a market where there is peace and quiet as opposed to the other christmas markets where the turbulences of every-day life are dominant , " he said .

dieter graumann , board member of the central council for jews in germany spoke to dw-world about their integration . dw-world : integration has long been a contoversial political issue . what does it mean to you ? dieter graumann : the way i see it , integration is the process of becoming part of a society without giving up one 's own identity .
as jews , we want to be jews in a country which respects us as such and does not exclude us .
that is how we would like integration to be . how does that process of integration look for new members of the jewish community ?
there are sometimes problems .
it 's a little bit odd that a minority in our community , which is not well integrated itself , should be responsible for integratíng a majority .
but somehow it works .
it is important to point out here that jewish migrants enrich rather than burden the jewish community and german society .
and that is why we are fighting to encourage migration to germany .
it 's very important for us , because it gives jewish life in germany a dynamic , vitality and perspective which help us all . how german can a migrant be ? jews have a painful past experience of that .
germany had a jewish population which tried to be very german , one could say , more german than the germans .
we know now that it was of no help when it came to the nazis and we have learned that giving up on being jewish does n't make anybody a better german .
standing by and nurturing one 's own identity and being responsible german citizens are not mutually exclusive .
that goes for other migrant groups as well . what problems do jewish migrants face while trying to fit into german society ? jewish migrants who come here from the former soviet union , are initially faced with existential problems , such as having nowhere to live , no training and no job .
these problems are so big that they completely consume the newcomers .
people who have to concentrate on looking for an apartment or a job invest their initial energies in doing just that .
but with time , that begins to change .
we hope that people who are here for longer find a way to become a part of society .
we can see it happening in the case of second-generation jewish migrants . what role does religion play in the integration process ? religion in itself neither serves to hinder nor help the integration process .
of course it is worrying when we notice the emergence of parallel societies , but i know that we jews try to avoid the creation of ghettos .
we have to live in the middle of society , to nurture our judaism and not partition ourselves off from others . how important is it that migrant groups are represented by an organization ?
i do n't want to tell anybody else what to do , but we have seen that it makes sense to speak with a united voice rather than dividing our energies .
those who pool their strength are taken more seriously and are granted greater political recognition than a series of splinter organizations trying to represent a single migrant group .

the versatile movie-maker from hamburg , made it big in 2004 with his hit " head on . " born to turkish parents , fatih akin grew up in germany .
his first feature film , " short sharp shock , " told the story of three young friends looking for happiness , love , power and wealth .
it proved to be too much all at once and had a negative effect for some of the movie 's protagonists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sibel kekilli and birol ünel in " head on " his second feature , " in july , " was essentially about love , and recounted the tale of two young people , daniel and july , who find one another after traveling thousands of kilometers between germany and turkey .
for what was essentially a very simple story , fatih akin used several genres , from wild fairy-tale to romantic comedy to road movie . " i know the route from hamburg to istanbul very well because my parents and i used to drive it each year during the summer holidays .
we 'd all pile into the car , a ford transit with luggage rack .
it was all a bit of a cliché , and that is possibly the most autobiographical element of the whole thing . " points for radicalism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from akin 's film " solino " although he was quite playful in his first films and would n't part with his original ideas , akin knows how to switch from one genre to another .
he proved his versatility in the film " solino " , which is about italian immigrants in germany 's highly-industrialized ruhr valley region .
for the first time , akin adapted someone else 's script , and the resulting film was a little too polished and less original . his big hit , " head on , " was his triumph .
a love story full of passion , desperation , violence and humor , it is one of the best films to emerge from germany in recent years .
it served to silence critics who scorned him for being too complaisant .
his bravery was rewarded when his most radical film to date won him the highest award , the golden bear , at the 2004 berlin film festival as well as the european film award later in the year . bildunterschrift : " crossing the bridge " film poster following the success of " head on , " akin said he still had a " little bit of strength , " and he invested it in the music film " crossing the bridge - the sound of istanbul . "
when asked whether music has the power to affect change , he offered a clear " yes , " adding that it " might be naive , " but such is his belief . and perhaps it is this very naivety which leads akin to ask questions and to review his own opinions .
as such , he remains a filmmaker with the capacity to surprise his audience and from whom they can expect much to come . jörg tszman -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cinema on life support in 1990 , the eu launched the media program to provide support for european films , in danger of being driven to extinction by hollywood .

the versatile movie-maker from hamburg , made it big in 2004 with his hit " head on . " born to turkish parents , fatih akin grew up in germany .
his first feature film , " short sharp shock , " told the story of three young friends looking for happiness , love , power and wealth .
it proved to be too much all at once and had a negative effect for some of the movie 's protagonists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sibel kekilli and birol ünel in " head on " his second feature , " in july , " was essentially about love , and recounted the tale of two young people , daniel and july , who find one another after traveling thousands of kilometers between germany and turkey .
for what was essentially a very simple story , fatih akin used several genres , from wild fairy-tale to romantic comedy to road movie . " i know the route from hamburg to istanbul very well because my parents and i used to drive it each year during the summer holidays .
we 'd all pile into the car , a ford transit with luggage rack .
it was all a bit of a cliché , and that is possibly the most autobiographical element of the whole thing . " points for radicalism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from akin 's film " solino " although he was quite playful in his first films and would n't part with his original ideas , akin knows how to switch from one genre to another .
he proved his versatility in the film " solino " , which is about italian immigrants in germany 's highly-industrialized ruhr valley region .
for the first time , akin adapted someone else 's script , and the resulting film was a little too polished and less original . his big hit , " head on , " was his triumph .
a love story full of passion , desperation , violence and humor , it is one of the best films to emerge from germany in recent years .
it served to silence critics who scorned him for being too complaisant .
his bravery was rewarded when his most radical film to date won him the highest award , the golden bear , at the 2004 berlin film festival as well as the european film award later in the year . bildunterschrift : " crossing the bridge " film poster following the success of " head on , " akin said he still had a " little bit of strength , " and he invested it in the music film " crossing the bridge - the sound of istanbul . "
when asked whether music has the power to affect change , he offered a clear " yes , " adding that it " might be naive , " but such is his belief . and perhaps it is this very naivety which leads akin to ask questions and to review his own opinions .
as such , he remains a filmmaker with the capacity to surprise his audience and from whom they can expect much to come . jörg tszman -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cinema on life support in 1990 , the eu launched the media program to provide support for european films , in danger of being driven to extinction by hollywood .

not all reader comme n ts have bee n published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for le n gth a n d appropriate n ess of co n te n t .
i strongly believe that the rumors are correct about secret prisons run by the cia .
the americans have demonstrated in the past time and time again that while preaching " democracy " they violate the principles whenever it suits them .
and all in the name of democracy . - haymohenry i do n't have hard evidence , but everything suggests that , yes , we do have such secret prisons in europe .
we need your help to shed light on this horrible issue .
this is an utter disgrace for the so-called leader of the free world . - citizennaim i think that the bush administration will do anything that it can get away with .
these people regard themselves as above all laws .

not all reader comme n ts have bee n published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for le n gth a n d appropriate n ess of co n te n t .
i strongly believe that the rumors are correct about secret prisons run by the cia .
the americans have demonstrated in the past time and time again that while preaching " democracy " they violate the principles whenever it suits them .
and all in the name of democracy . - haymohenry i do n't have hard evidence , but everything suggests that , yes , we do have such secret prisons in europe .
we need your help to shed light on this horrible issue .
this is an utter disgrace for the so-called leader of the free world . - citizennaim i think that the bush administration will do anything that it can get away with .
these people regard themselves as above all laws .
bush has said " it would be eerier if i had absolute dictatorial powers . "
nixon said : " the president has absolute power , but only for four years . "
there is a school of thought among the american right wing that says : " only we know what is best ; therefore your opinion does n't count .
we will decide everything . " - rgmccorkle i am a us army and us air force vet .
i know a little about the c-130 air craft pictured at the top of the web page .
if these planes are being used , they would have to be refueled in central europe to reach romania or bulgaria .
the cia has done some very bad things over the years .
the end justifies the means . - lee davis i live in romania and i know from our newspapers that the cia planes stopped on the airports mihail kogalniceanu and timisoara , but i am sure that in romania there are not secret prisons . - constantin liviuviorel , romania germany seems more " troubled " about the fate of terrorists in cia custody than the activities of the terrorists themselves .
it should be kept in mind that information gathered from jailed terrorists may prevent something bad from happening in germany .
but it is considered safe to criticize the cia .
judging from the free pass given to terrorists on trial in german courts , nothing must be done to make the terrorists mad .
they may notice that berlin has some tall buildings too . - petra ronish it does not matter what we think about the truthfulness of secret cia prisons on european soil , the facts are well-documented that the cia very seldom played by the rules of the geneva convention .
so why should we doubt the critics now ? - guenter gosau , canada the washington post is known for getting it wrong sometimes .
there is a big fight between republicans and democrats and i 'll bet that is the underlying issue .
one is doing everything it can to embarrass bush at the moment .
he does n't need any help though . - russaa compiled by dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us denies mini-guantanamo in kosovo the us military saturday denied that it was running a guantanamo-style prison for terror suspects in kosovo , as tensions continued to simmer over reports of secret cia flights across europe .

26 , 2005 -rrb- cia uses german bases to transport terrorists , paper says while the issue over secret cia prisons in europe continues to simmer , new allegations over undisclosed cia flights transporting suspected terrorists is pushing european officials to demand answers from washington .

dieter graumann , board member of the central council for jews in germany spoke to dw-world about their integration . dw-world : integration has long been a contoversial political issue . what does it mean to you ? dieter graumann : the way i see it , integration is the process of becoming part of a society without giving up one 's own identity .
as jews , we want to be jews in a country which respects us as such and does not exclude us .
that is how we would like integration to be . how does that process of integration look for new members of the jewish community ?
there are sometimes problems .
it 's a little bit odd that a minority in our community , which is not well integrated itself , should be responsible for integratíng a majority .
but somehow it works .
it is important to point out here that jewish migrants enrich rather than burden the jewish community and german society .
and that is why we are fighting to encourage migration to germany .
it 's very important for us , because it gives jewish life in germany a dynamic , vitality and perspective which help us all . how german can a migrant be ? jews have a painful past experience of that .
germany had a jewish population which tried to be very german , one could say , more german than the germans .
we know now that it was of no help when it came to the nazis and we have learned that giving up on being jewish does n't make anybody a better german .
standing by and nurturing one 's own identity and being responsible german citizens are not mutually exclusive .
that goes for other migrant groups as well . what problems do jewish migrants face while trying to fit into german society ? jewish migrants who come here from the former soviet union , are initially faced with existential problems , such as having nowhere to live , no training and no job .
these problems are so big that they completely consume the newcomers .
people who have to concentrate on looking for an apartment or a job invest their initial energies in doing just that .
but with time , that begins to change .
we hope that people who are here for longer find a way to become a part of society .
we can see it happening in the case of second-generation jewish migrants . what role does religion play in the integration process ? religion in itself neither serves to hinder nor help the integration process .
of course it is worrying when we notice the emergence of parallel societies , but i know that we jews try to avoid the creation of ghettos .
we have to live in the middle of society , to nurture our judaism and not partition ourselves off from others . how important is it that migrant groups are represented by an organization ?
i do n't want to tell anybody else what to do , but we have seen that it makes sense to speak with a united voice rather than dividing our energies .

dieter graumann , board member of the central council for jews in germany spoke to dw-world about their integration . dw-world : integration has long been a contoversial political issue . what does it mean to you ? dieter graumann : the way i see it , integration is the process of becoming part of a society without giving up one 's own identity .
as jews , we want to be jews in a country which respects us as such and does not exclude us .
that is how we would like integration to be . how does that process of integration look for new members of the jewish community ?
there are sometimes problems .
it 's a little bit odd that a minority in our community , which is not well integrated itself , should be responsible for integratíng a majority .
but somehow it works .
it is important to point out here that jewish migrants enrich rather than burden the jewish community and german society .
and that is why we are fighting to encourage migration to germany .
it 's very important for us , because it gives jewish life in germany a dynamic , vitality and perspective which help us all . how german can a migrant be ? jews have a painful past experience of that .
germany had a jewish population which tried to be very german , one could say , more german than the germans .
we know now that it was of no help when it came to the nazis and we have learned that giving up on being jewish does n't make anybody a better german .
standing by and nurturing one 's own identity and being responsible german citizens are not mutually exclusive .
that goes for other migrant groups as well . what problems do jewish migrants face while trying to fit into german society ? jewish migrants who come here from the former soviet union , are initially faced with existential problems , such as having nowhere to live , no training and no job .
these problems are so big that they completely consume the newcomers .
people who have to concentrate on looking for an apartment or a job invest their initial energies in doing just that .
but with time , that begins to change .
we hope that people who are here for longer find a way to become a part of society .
we can see it happening in the case of second-generation jewish migrants . what role does religion play in the integration process ? religion in itself neither serves to hinder nor help the integration process .
of course it is worrying when we notice the emergence of parallel societies , but i know that we jews try to avoid the creation of ghettos .
we have to live in the middle of society , to nurture our judaism and not partition ourselves off from others . how important is it that migrant groups are represented by an organization ?
i do n't want to tell anybody else what to do , but we have seen that it makes sense to speak with a united voice rather than dividing our energies .
those who pool their strength are taken more seriously and are granted greater political recognition than a series of splinter organizations trying to represent a single migrant group .

the versatile movie-maker from hamburg , made it big in 2004 with his hit " head on . " born to turkish parents , fatih akin grew up in germany .
his first feature film , " short sharp shock , " told the story of three young friends looking for happiness , love , power and wealth .
it proved to be too much all at once and had a negative effect for some of the movie 's protagonists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sibel kekilli and birol ünel in " head on " his second feature , " in july , " was essentially about love , and recounted the tale of two young people , daniel and july , who find one another after traveling thousands of kilometers between germany and turkey .
for what was essentially a very simple story , fatih akin used several genres , from wild fairy-tale to romantic comedy to road movie . " i know the route from hamburg to istanbul very well because my parents and i used to drive it each year during the summer holidays .
we 'd all pile into the car , a ford transit with luggage rack .
it was all a bit of a cliché , and that is possibly the most autobiographical element of the whole thing . " points for radicalism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from akin 's film " solino " although he was quite playful in his first films and would n't part with his original ideas , akin knows how to switch from one genre to another .
he proved his versatility in the film " solino " , which is about italian immigrants in germany 's highly-industrialized ruhr valley region .
for the first time , akin adapted someone else 's script , and the resulting film was a little too polished and less original . his big hit , " head on , " was his triumph .
a love story full of passion , desperation , violence and humor , it is one of the best films to emerge from germany in recent years .
it served to silence critics who scorned him for being too complaisant .
his bravery was rewarded when his most radical film to date won him the highest award , the golden bear , at the 2004 berlin film festival as well as the european film award later in the year . bildunterschrift : " crossing the bridge " film poster following the success of " head on , " akin said he still had a " little bit of strength , " and he invested it in the music film " crossing the bridge - the sound of istanbul . "
when asked whether music has the power to affect change , he offered a clear " yes , " adding that it " might be naive , " but such is his belief . and perhaps it is this very naivety which leads akin to ask questions and to review his own opinions .
as such , he remains a filmmaker with the capacity to surprise his audience and from whom they can expect much to come . jörg tszman -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cinema on life support in 1990 , the eu launched the media program to provide support for european films , in danger of being driven to extinction by hollywood .

" a foreign minister must evaluate the facts and not newspaper reports , " he said . germany has already opened an investigation into a case in which an egyptian suspect was reportedly secretly transported via ramstein in western germany , the largest us air base in europe . public broadcaster zdf and several newspapers have reported that more than 80 secret central intelligence agency -lrb- cia -rrb- flights touched down in germany en route to secret centers where suspects , held without charge as " enemy combatants , " were allegedly interrogated and tortured .

the latest shareholder meeting revealed though that some calm has returned to the boardroom and that is spilling onto the pitch this season . it was probably borussia dortmund team president hans-joachim watzke 's worst nightmare .
top players like strikers jan koller and lars ricken , veterans with loads of experience to help the cash-strapped club through troubled times , get hurt and are out for weeks .
the possibility of climbing out from the almost 90-million-euro -lrb- $ 108-million -rrb- hole by making it to european club competition seemed nothing but a dream .
yet instead of plummeting to the bottom of the table , manager bert van marwijk has performed a minor miracle in the first half of the season and has dortmund in the upper flights of the bundesliga .

the latest shareholder meeting revealed though that some calm has returned to the boardroom and that is spilling onto the pitch this season . it was probably borussia dortmund team president hans-joachim watzke 's worst nightmare .
top players like strikers jan koller and lars ricken , veterans with loads of experience to help the cash-strapped club through troubled times , get hurt and are out for weeks .
the possibility of climbing out from the almost 90-million-euro -lrb- $ 108-million -rrb- hole by making it to european club competition seemed nothing but a dream .
yet instead of plummeting to the bottom of the table , manager bert van marwijk has performed a minor miracle in the first half of the season and has dortmund in the upper flights of the bundesliga .

dieter graumann , board member of the central council for jews in germany spoke to dw-world about their integration . dw-world : integration has long been a contoversial political issue . what does it mean to you ? dieter graumann : the way i see it , integration is the process of becoming part of a society without giving up one 's own identity .
as jews , we want to be jews in a country which respects us as such and does not exclude us .
that is how we would like integration to be . how does that process of integration look for new members of the jewish community ?
there are sometimes problems .
it 's a little bit odd that a minority in our community , which is not well integrated itself , should be responsible for integratíng a majority .
but somehow it works .
it is important to point out here that jewish migrants enrich rather than burden the jewish community and german society .
and that is why we are fighting to encourage migration to germany .
it 's very important for us , because it gives jewish life in germany a dynamic , vitality and perspective which help us all . how german can a migrant be ? jews have a painful past experience of that .
germany had a jewish population which tried to be very german , one could say , more german than the germans .
we know now that it was of no help when it came to the nazis and we have learned that giving up on being jewish does n't make anybody a better german .
standing by and nurturing one 's own identity and being responsible german citizens are not mutually exclusive .
that goes for other migrant groups as well . what problems do jewish migrants face while trying to fit into german society ? jewish migrants who come here from the former soviet union , are initially faced with existential problems , such as having nowhere to live , no training and no job .
these problems are so big that they completely consume the newcomers .
people who have to concentrate on looking for an apartment or a job invest their initial energies in doing just that .
but with time , that begins to change .
we hope that people who are here for longer find a way to become a part of society .
we can see it happening in the case of second-generation jewish migrants . what role does religion play in the integration process ? religion in itself neither serves to hinder nor help the integration process .
of course it is worrying when we notice the emergence of parallel societies , but i know that we jews try to avoid the creation of ghettos .
we have to live in the middle of society , to nurture our judaism and not partition ourselves off from others . how important is it that migrant groups are represented by an organization ?
i do n't want to tell anybody else what to do , but we have seen that it makes sense to speak with a united voice rather than dividing our energies .
those who pool their strength are taken more seriously and are granted greater political recognition than a series of splinter organizations trying to represent a single migrant group .

dieter graumann , board member of the central council for jews in germany spoke to dw-world about their integration . dw-world : integration has long been a contoversial political issue . what does it mean to you ? dieter graumann : the way i see it , integration is the process of becoming part of a society without giving up one 's own identity .
as jews , we want to be jews in a country which respects us as such and does not exclude us .
that is how we would like integration to be . how does that process of integration look for new members of the jewish community ?
there are sometimes problems .
it 's a little bit odd that a minority in our community , which is not well integrated itself , should be responsible for integratíng a majority .
but somehow it works .
it is important to point out here that jewish migrants enrich rather than burden the jewish community and german society .
and that is why we are fighting to encourage migration to germany .
it 's very important for us , because it gives jewish life in germany a dynamic , vitality and perspective which help us all . how german can a migrant be ? jews have a painful past experience of that .
germany had a jewish population which tried to be very german , one could say , more german than the germans .
we know now that it was of no help when it came to the nazis and we have learned that giving up on being jewish does n't make anybody a better german .
standing by and nurturing one 's own identity and being responsible german citizens are not mutually exclusive .
that goes for other migrant groups as well . what problems do jewish migrants face while trying to fit into german society ? jewish migrants who come here from the former soviet union , are initially faced with existential problems , such as having nowhere to live , no training and no job .
these problems are so big that they completely consume the newcomers .
people who have to concentrate on looking for an apartment or a job invest their initial energies in doing just that .
but with time , that begins to change .
we hope that people who are here for longer find a way to become a part of society .
we can see it happening in the case of second-generation jewish migrants . what role does religion play in the integration process ? religion in itself neither serves to hinder nor help the integration process .
of course it is worrying when we notice the emergence of parallel societies , but i know that we jews try to avoid the creation of ghettos .
we have to live in the middle of society , to nurture our judaism and not partition ourselves off from others . how important is it that migrant groups are represented by an organization ?
i do n't want to tell anybody else what to do , but we have seen that it makes sense to speak with a united voice rather than dividing our energies .
those who pool their strength are taken more seriously and are granted greater political recognition than a series of splinter organizations trying to represent a single migrant group .

the latest shareholder meeting revealed though that some calm has returned to the boardroom and that is spilling onto the pitch this season . it was probably borussia dortmund team president hans-joachim watzke 's worst nightmare .
top players like strikers jan koller and lars ricken , veterans with loads of experience to help the cash-strapped club through troubled times , get hurt and are out for weeks .
the possibility of climbing out from the almost 90-million-euro -lrb- $ 108-million -rrb- hole by making it to european club competition seemed nothing but a dream .
yet instead of plummeting to the bottom of the table , manager bert van marwijk has performed a minor miracle in the first half of the season and has dortmund in the upper flights of the bundesliga .
it might be too soon to speak of a phoenix rising from the ashes , but the atmosphere of the recent shareholder meeting on nov .
22 was the complete opposite of last year 's .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans heaped abuse on dortmund president niebaum -lrb- left -rrb- and general manager meier last year at that time , former club president gerd niebaum and general manager michael meier received an earful from unappreciative shareholders and fans , and they later handed in their resignations .
supporters ' flight in the late 1990s and early 2000s almost ended in the club 's demise .
just this spring , the club stood on the brink of bankruptcy after their house of cards based on risky schemes collapsed .
" no more amoroso deals " hans-joachim watzke was given the assignment of restoring order to borussia .

and even though christmas in germany also means tinsel and lights and extended shopping hours , it is the markets that set the country off from its christian neighbors . a typical christmas market consists of wooden stalls perched on a site in the center of the city , where people shove past each other to buy christmas decorations and stop for a chat over a mug of mulled wine .
a nativity scene is usually on display and often musicians , singers and dance clubs offer entertainment from a central stage .
lo n g traditio n since the 15th century , merchants have traveled to dresden to display their wares .
to this day , from nov .
24 until dec .
24 , shoppers flock to the market in the city center which also features a christmas pyramid , woodcarvings and a stolle n festival , where a nearly four-ton heavy version of the fruit-cake-like german christmas specialty that dresden is famous for will be dished up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the augsburg market lights up the night cologne has six christmas markets , one of which is situated next to the city 's gothic cathedral .
the cathedral 's towers , reaching some 150 meters -lrb- 490-feet -rrb- into the winter sky , make the giant christmas tree in the middle of the setting appear quite small .
in the four weeks of december during which the markets are open , around 2 million people come to cologne , according to karl-heinz merfeld of the cologne tourism association .
" the christmas market industry is still important … and the tourists who come here are usually really excited - above all the english and dutch - because they are n't familiar with these kinds of markets with the music and the lights , " he said .
in augsburg 's old market , once called the lebkuche n markt after the gingerbread-like cookie called lebkuche n it sold , visitors still can find numerous varieties of the baked goods .
ce n turies ' old traditio n no trip to the christmas market is complete without a bratwurst sausage or a cup of german mulled wine , which is spiced with cinnamon and cloves .
it is said to have originated in india , where the drink was prepared with water , alcohol , sugar and spices .
apparently the british then brought the recipe to europe in the 18th century .
folklore has it that at the christmas market in nuremberg , germany 's most famous , someone first added red wine to the mixture and created what 's now known as glühwei n .
these days , about every third stall sells the stuff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : backer thomas schmidt with tons of the christmas specialty , stollen , in dresden still , christmas markets have come a long way since they were first introduced in germany .
dresden is said to have had the first , in the 15th century , and nuremberg followed suit in 1697 .
in 1820 , the first christmas market was held in cologne and restricted to locals who could buy toys and food but no alcoholic beverages .
back to the past now cologne holds a medieval christmas market where the salespeople wear wool clothes and wooden shoes and pursue medieval chores like blacksmithing .
the smell of burning wood wafts through the air , and candles illuminate the setting .
nothing as profane as reibekuche n or potato pancakes is for sale ; hungry visitors can snack on unleavened bread freshly baked in ovens heated with wood .
nor is glühwei n available .
instead , thirsty souls drink mead .
since christmas markets did n't exist during medieval times , one of the organizers drew a tenuous link to the markets held long ago . " the emphasis is on a market where there is peace and quiet as opposed to the other christmas markets where the turbulences of every-day life are dominant , " he said .

dieter graumann , board member of the central council for jews in germany spoke to dw-world about their integration . dw-world : integration has long been a contoversial political issue . what does it mean to you ? dieter graumann : the way i see it , integration is the process of becoming part of a society without giving up one 's own identity .
as jews , we want to be jews in a country which respects us as such and does not exclude us .
that is how we would like integration to be . how does that process of integration look for new members of the jewish community ?
there are sometimes problems .
it 's a little bit odd that a minority in our community , which is not well integrated itself , should be responsible for integratíng a majority .
but somehow it works .
it is important to point out here that jewish migrants enrich rather than burden the jewish community and german society .
and that is why we are fighting to encourage migration to germany .
it 's very important for us , because it gives jewish life in germany a dynamic , vitality and perspective which help us all . how german can a migrant be ? jews have a painful past experience of that .
germany had a jewish population which tried to be very german , one could say , more german than the germans .
we know now that it was of no help when it came to the nazis and we have learned that giving up on being jewish does n't make anybody a better german .
standing by and nurturing one 's own identity and being responsible german citizens are not mutually exclusive .
that goes for other migrant groups as well . what problems do jewish migrants face while trying to fit into german society ? jewish migrants who come here from the former soviet union , are initially faced with existential problems , such as having nowhere to live , no training and no job .
these problems are so big that they completely consume the newcomers .
people who have to concentrate on looking for an apartment or a job invest their initial energies in doing just that .
but with time , that begins to change .
we hope that people who are here for longer find a way to become a part of society .
we can see it happening in the case of second-generation jewish migrants . what role does religion play in the integration process ? religion in itself neither serves to hinder nor help the integration process .
of course it is worrying when we notice the emergence of parallel societies , but i know that we jews try to avoid the creation of ghettos .
we have to live in the middle of society , to nurture our judaism and not partition ourselves off from others . how important is it that migrant groups are represented by an organization ?
i do n't want to tell anybody else what to do , but we have seen that it makes sense to speak with a united voice rather than dividing our energies .
those who pool their strength are taken more seriously and are granted greater political recognition than a series of splinter organizations trying to represent a single migrant group .

a statement by the us embassy in baku said it deplored the " unjustified and unprovoked use of force " .
many people were reported to have been injured by police using truncheons , tear gas and water cannon .
the opposition say the results giving president ilham aliyev 's party overwhelming victory were falsified .
leaders of the opposition united freedom bloc have insisted on a re-run of the vote .

" we deplore the unjustified and unprovoked use of force against citizens peacefully exercising their right to freedom of assembly , " said the statement issued by the us embassy in baku .
police chiefs said only one demonstrator sustained injuries , while 20 officers were seriously hurt .
they branded the demonstrators , who defied a two-hour limit on their rally , as " provocateurs " and denied using water cannons or tear gas .
" they were calling for disobedience ... we warned them , " said baku deputy police chief yashar aliyev .
he said 29 people were arrested , including a leader of the opposition liberal party .
many activists , inspired by ukraine 's " orange revolution " of a year ago and believing the time has come to put more pressure on the government , had called for an open-ended protest .

postgraduate paula roberts will spend three-and-a-half months on signy island , which is less than 6.5km long .
her work there will be part of a joint scientific research expedition with the british antarctic survey .
but she is not daunted by the prospect of life in the remote location , saying : " some 40,000 seals and many penguins live there , so i wo n't be lonely . "
" i will be collecting samples for analysis over their summer period .
only two kinds of native plants flower on the island - but there is plenty of moss there .
" signy is twice the size of bardsey island , and that 's where the british antarctica centre is , where i 'll be staying , " said ms roberts , before she left her home in llanberis in gwynedd on sunday .
baking fresh bread she said there will be nine people working on scientific projects at the centre .
" i will be a part of the community , the crew come from all over the world , from holland , sweden , south africa and malaysia , " she said .
" so there will be plenty of opportunity for discussion .
everyone has to participate in the centre 's work , baking fresh bread , maintaining the water and heating equipment . "
currently only two flowering plants thrive in the harsh ecosystem of signy - a grass and a small cushion-forming plant .
the student scientist visited the arctic earlier this summer ms roberts , who is about to complete a phd in soil science at the university 's school of agricultural and forest sciences , will be collecting soil samples from areas where the plants grow .
once back in bangor , she will analyse the samples to prove or disprove a hypothesis regarding how climate change will affect the flora of antarctica .
some scientists believe that rather than making the harsh environment more hospitable , global warming will reduce the soil 's capacity to support plant life causing a loss of native biodiversity and leading to irreversible changes to the ecosystem there .
ms roberts will be one of two welsh-speaking women in the continent this antarctic summer , although the second will not be at the same base .
she said she was not daunted by the project ahead , having spent time on bardsey island off the lleyn peninsula in north wales , as a student .
she spent two weeks at the opposite pole , the artic , in june and said that its constant sunshine affected her sleep patterns .
" the sun was shining above all the time , there was no difference between night and day .
but in antarctica there will be an hour of two of darkness . "

around 10m people are not saving enough to see them through old age .
that is almost half the current british workforce .
for months the government has been deflecting questions on what to do about the so-called " pensions crisis " .
a committee led by adair turner had been set up by the government to investigate .
but even before its recommendations are officially announced , the political wrangling has begun - with clear hints that they will not be implemented by ministers .
that will come as little comfort to sharon adams .
she lives in yatton near bristol .
she works part-time in a care home , and can not afford to put anything aside for her old age .
so we gave her a glimpse of what life could be like when she retires .
sharon earns just over £ 6000 a year .
her husband pays into a pension for both of them .
depending on the market at the time they retire , the length of time they pay into the scheme and assuming sharon benefits from the pension in full the couple could receive around £ 1300 a month in their retirement .
martin sullivan , a senior lecturer at the university of the west of england , says sharon and her family should not be relying on a pension plan alone .
sharon adams ...
40 years on they should have other savings too .
sharon says that is not an option .
" the problem is i work part time to make up an income so to have excess to save is unlikely .
i have to work part-time just to pay bills at the moment " , she says .
martin sullivan says there are several options open to the government : force people to save more raise the state pension raise the retirement age pensions activist rita booth , from nailsea near bristol , sympathises with sharon .
she says people have to make very difficult decisions about where they spend their money : " you can not do everything .
" you can not pay it out and save it for your future unless you earn an unrealistic amount which ordinary people do not get .
it is a dilemma . "
sharon says she has been left feeling nervous about her future .
she is happy that her husband is paying enough into a pension but says " if anything happens to one of us and we are not able to continue with our contributions we will really struggle " .

that is almost half the current british workforce .
for months the government has been deflecting questions on what to do about the so-called " pensions crisis " .
a committee led by adair turner had been set up by the government to investigate .
but even before its recommendations are officially announced , the political wrangling has begun - with clear hints that they will not be implemented by ministers .
that will come as little comfort to sharon adams .
she lives in yatton near bristol .
she works part-time in a care home , and can not afford to put anything aside for her old age .
so we gave her a glimpse of what life could be like when she retires .
sharon earns just over £ 6000 a year .
her husband pays into a pension for both of them .
depending on the market at the time they retire , the length of time they pay into the scheme and assuming sharon benefits from the pension in full the couple could receive around £ 1300 a month in their retirement .
martin sullivan , a senior lecturer at the university of the west of england , says sharon and her family should not be relying on a pension plan alone .
they should have other savings too .
sharon says that is not an option .
" the problem is i work part time to make up an income so to have excess to save is unlikely .
i have to work part-time just to pay bills at the moment " , she says .
martin sullivan says there are several options open to the government : force people to save more raise the state pension raise the retirement age pensions activist rita booth , from nailsea near bristol , sympathises with sharon .
she says people have to make very difficult decisions about where they spend their money : " you can not do everything .
" you can not pay it out and save it for your future unless you earn an unrealistic amount which ordinary people do not get .
it is a dilemma . "
sharon says she has been left feeling nervous about her future .
she is happy that her husband is paying enough into a pension but says " if anything happens to one of us and we are not able to continue with our contributions we will really struggle " .

martyn oates the politics show south west cash registers are ringing across the south west as the christmas shopping spree gets underway .
christmas is a time of year when many people experience their credit cards and overdrafts reaching their limit .
and for every payment that is overdue or can not be made , the banks and credit card companies levy a charge against the customer .
but andrew george , mp for st ives , claims the amount charged is extortionate , and is campaigning to get them set at a lower level - or even abolished altogether .
for every cheque , direct debit , or credit card balance payment that can not be met due to insufficient funds in the account - the banks and credit card companies will charge customers some £ 25 a time , which can often lead to spiralling debts .
students especially can fall prey to these extra payments : in july 2005 , the office of fair trading ruled the charges were unfair under the terms of consumer contract regulations 1999 .
" in a consumer contract , a default charge is likely to be disproportionately high if it is more then a genuine pre-estimate of the damages that the card issuer would win in court if it sued the cardholder for breach of contract . "
the oft called upon the banks and credit companies to justify the charges or remove them , and gave the institutions three months to respond .
but that deadline passed in october 2005 , and now mr george says the oft 's credibility hangs on how it proceeds with this issue .
it is estimated that britain 's high street banks make around £ 3bn a year from these punitive charges .
mr george says every day the oft delays in its ruling , that is another £ 3m profit for the banking system .

a total of 2,462 year seven and eight pupils from the city 's 11 state secondary schools were asked for their experiences of bullying .
more than 68 % reported they had not been bullied at all during the term , an improvement of 4 % from the 2002 survey .
the most common form of bullying was name-calling or having rumours spread rather than hitting or kicking .
girls seem more likely to suffer anti-social behaviour than boys , the researchers found .
but there was a general fall in the number of pupils who said they usually like being at school .
mark ellis from the city of york council 's education team said : " although the incidence of bullying is on the decrease , there are still a number of areas to work on , especially in terms of the reduction in the number of pupils who report not liking school . "
