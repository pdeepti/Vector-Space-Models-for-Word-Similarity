upon the expansion of the bloc , the new states in the east have committed themselves to joining the currency union but the path is filled with numerous obstacles . one of the major goals of the 25 member european union is one day to have a single currency for the almost 460 million citizens .
currently , 12 countries have sacrificed their marks , francs and drachmas among other currencies , and assumed the euro as its unit of payment , while 13 have retained their currencies . britain , denmark and sweden have opted out of joining the continental currency .
yet , for the newest members who joined on may 1 , 2004 , they have obliged themselves to take on the euro .
they , like the original 12 , must fulfil the strict maastricht criteria in order to become a country in the euro zone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish membership in the eu , yes , but joining the common currency euro is more difficult the path to this ultimate goal is filled with obstacles that even financially strong countries like germany , france and italy are finding hard to adhere to .
the former communist states of poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , estonia , latvia , lithuania and slovenia are experiencing economic booms but the old , rusted infrastructure must be replaced and that is forcing many of the new eu countries to amass large debts . for estonia , lithuania , latvia and slovenia , progress is being made at an astonishingly fast rate .
they should be ready for the euro by 2007 , or 2008 at the latest .
lithuania stands alone in fulfilling the four maastricht demands of a budget deficit being less than three percent of gdp , total debt not exceeding 60 percent of gdp , and also keeping inflation under control along with low interest rates . big new members having problems while the smaller baltic states steam towards a new currency , their bigger cousins in central europe are riding rough waters .
poland , hungary , the czech republic and slovakia have the largest populations and the largest infrastructures that must be brought up to date .
the governments in these four countries are taking on new debts to finance that .
the likelihood of joining the euro zone any time soon is small . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian president vaira vike-freiberga is leading her country to the euro " these countries will probably continue to have their problems with budget deficits .
this criterion is the most difficult to adhere to , " said jürgen matthes from the cologne-based institute for the german economy . indeed , sticking to the criteria drawn out at maastricht is not reason enough to get rid of the national currency for the euro . compliance with european policies the 12 current members in the euro zone have surrendered their individual monetary policies to the european central bank .
their robust economies can tolerate so-called external shocks , say from rapidly rising oil prices . the new eu members still must maintain some independence on how to deal with unexpected events .
slovakia , hungary and the czech republic need two to five times more oil per gdp unit compared to western europe .
they can still devalue their currency to a certain extent or lower interest rates in times of need according to matthes . the bigger countries are also fighting high unemployment .
to take up another burden , such as complying with euro monetary policies , would be too great for poland or slovakia .
yet , the eight central and eastern european countries must one day join the euro zone .
it looks as though they will do this at various speeds , and some countries will have larger obstacles to overcome than others . rolf wenkel -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrations across eu mark historic enlargement when the european union welcomed 10 new members at midnight friday , parties kicked off across the continent .

both rates are far lower than the average of 20 cents per minute airtime rate that most other providers charge . and while a few others do match those cheap rates , most do n't have the marketing power of aldi with its well-known brand name and 4,000 stores in which three out of every four germans frequent . still , when other cut rate competitors showed up on the market last year , mostly through the internet , average rates declined by half . aldi is reportedly able to offer such low prices because it has guaranteed 750,000 contracts to e-plus . others may join the fray and the wireless market may even face greater competition as reports of discounters lidl and plus are considering offering their own cell phone service at rock bottom prices . the cell phone market is an interesting one that lidl has watched for a long time , " a spokesman for the chain told tagesspiegel .

both rates are far lower than the average of 20 cents per minute airtime rate that most other providers charge . and while a few others do match those cheap rates , most do n't have the marketing power of aldi with its well-known brand name and 4,000 stores in which three out of every four germans frequent . still , when other cut rate competitors showed up on the market last year , mostly through the internet , average rates declined by half . aldi is reportedly able to offer such low prices because it has guaranteed 750,000 contracts to e-plus . others may join the fray and the wireless market may even face greater competition as reports of discounters lidl and plus are considering offering their own cell phone service at rock bottom prices . the cell phone market is an interesting one that lidl has watched for a long time , " a spokesman for the chain told tagesspiegel .

ahead of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels wednesday , the ratification of the european union budget looks unlikely .
should an agreement not be reached at next week 's summit , a crisis would ensue . british foreign minister jack straw can expect a rough ride when he meets with his eu peers at a special " conclave " in brussels wednesday .
the subject is his country 's budget proposal for the european union from 2007-2013 .
straw had presented on monday a budget plan drafted by his boss , prime minister tony blair , which would foresee a cut of some 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- . " this is a wonderful proposal but only for great britain , " said the spanish finance minister pedro solbes caustically .
spain is not alone in criticizing blair 's proposal .
both old and new member states have harshly disapproved of britain which holds the eu presidency until the end of 2005 .
the current suggestion has " little chance of being accepted " said germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück . the situation is reaching critical proportions as heads from around europe expressed their concern .
french president jacques chirac spoke with blair on the phone on tuesday to say that the proposals " pose a problem " and that they " would lead france to agree to the same financial sacrifices " like the ones paris rejected in june .
that , it was clear , would not happen . blair feeling the heat from eu , new members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just how euros should be redistributed in the eu is hotly disputed eu commission president jose manuel barroso also immediately rejected the proposal , calling it unacceptable .
much the same came from capitals in central and eastern europe as they would bear the biggest brunt of the belt-tightening measures offered by london .
already confronted with the potential smaller budget last week during a visit by blair , baltic states ' leaders said they could not support the british eu budget in the present form . that was reconfirmed by barroso after he met with estonian prime minister andrus ansip on tuesday .
the eu president pointed out that britain , whose current budget rebate would rise from five billion euros to eight billion in 2013 , should take a " small step " and show more willingness to compromise for the sake of the new states in the bloc . countries like estonia , hungary and poland are riding on the fact that a deal will be brokered .
ansip said that if the budget is not signed soon , then estonia would have difficulties financing numerous projects . pessimism is not the law of the union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic states , here tallin in estonia , enjoy their eu status but are still dependent on subsidies besides britain , wealthy , net contributors such as germany , the netherlands and austria would benefit from the british budget .
the tone of voice from these countries was correspondingly not one of prophetic gloom and doom . austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel called the proposal a " starting point " for negotiations .
in germany , the christian democratic parliamentary member for european affairs , matthias wissmann , judged the suggestion to be a " positive signal " and that it would be a springboard for more serious discussions . but on wednesday , jack straw must face the fact that he will be bombarded with more criticism than praise as the eu seeks to come to a budget solution .
in the eyes of commission vice president günter verheugen , the credibility and negotiating competency of the eu is at stake . bernd riegert -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british eu budget proposal shot down the uk suggested two options to solve one of the stickiest issues on the eu budget deadlock ahead of a mid-december summit .

should an agreement not be reached at next week 's summit , a crisis would ensue . british foreign minister jack straw can expect a rough ride when he meets with his eu peers at a special " conclave " in brussels wednesday .
the subject is his country 's budget proposal for the european union from 2007-2013 .
straw had presented on monday a budget plan drafted by his boss , prime minister tony blair , which would foresee a cut of some 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- . " this is a wonderful proposal but only for great britain , " said the spanish finance minister pedro solbes caustically .
spain is not alone in criticizing blair 's proposal .
both old and new member states have harshly disapproved of britain which holds the eu presidency until the end of 2005 .
the current suggestion has " little chance of being accepted " said germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück . the situation is reaching critical proportions as heads from around europe expressed their concern .
french president jacques chirac spoke with blair on the phone on tuesday to say that the proposals " pose a problem " and that they " would lead france to agree to the same financial sacrifices " like the ones paris rejected in june .
that , it was clear , would not happen . blair feeling the heat from eu , new members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just how euros should be redistributed in the eu is hotly disputed eu commission president jose manuel barroso also immediately rejected the proposal , calling it unacceptable .
much the same came from capitals in central and eastern europe as they would bear the biggest brunt of the belt-tightening measures offered by london .
already confronted with the potential smaller budget last week during a visit by blair , baltic states ' leaders said they could not support the british eu budget in the present form . that was reconfirmed by barroso after he met with estonian prime minister andrus ansip on tuesday .
the eu president pointed out that britain , whose current budget rebate would rise from five billion euros to eight billion in 2013 , should take a " small step " and show more willingness to compromise for the sake of the new states in the bloc . countries like estonia , hungary and poland are riding on the fact that a deal will be brokered .
ansip said that if the budget is not signed soon , then estonia would have difficulties financing numerous projects . pessimism is not the law of the union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic states , here tallin in estonia , enjoy their eu status but are still dependent on subsidies besides britain , wealthy , net contributors such as germany , the netherlands and austria would benefit from the british budget .
the tone of voice from these countries was correspondingly not one of prophetic gloom and doom . austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel called the proposal a " starting point " for negotiations .
in germany , the christian democratic parliamentary member for european affairs , matthias wissmann , judged the suggestion to be a " positive signal " and that it would be a springboard for more serious discussions . but on wednesday , jack straw must face the fact that he will be bombarded with more criticism than praise as the eu seeks to come to a budget solution .
in the eyes of commission vice president günter verheugen , the credibility and negotiating competency of the eu is at stake . bernd riegert -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british eu budget proposal shot down the uk suggested two options to solve one of the stickiest issues on the eu budget deadlock ahead of a mid-december summit .
the reaction was anything but warm .
-lrb- dec .
5 , 2005 -rrb- eu leaders deadlocked on budget despite a last-ditch bid friday to break a deadlock between britain and france over future eu financing , the uk rejected a french concession on an eu rebate , preventing the bloc from agreeing on a 2007 - 2013 budget .
-lrb- june 17 , 2005 -rrb- eu fights over agriculture subsidies two months before world trade organization talks on liberalizing trade , eu members are split over the issue of subsidies for farmers .
some subsidy backers say brussels is keeping them in the dark .

human rights groups claim the practice breaches the detainees ' fundamental rights . the united states is keen not to let the issue poison its revived ties with europe , nearly three years after the iraq war plunged transatlantic relations to a historic low . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meetings between merkel and rice have yielded few answers .
" clearly our hope is to make our position clear and be understood by our partners , so we can move on to the very important work ahead of us , " said a us diplomat , requesting anonymity . rice , who started her trip to europe on monday in germany , is expected in brussels late wednesday , for an informal dinner with her nato and eu counterparts before a formal nato meeting on thursday . even before leaving washington she set out the basis of her answer to the europeans , calling on them to make " tough choices " in the fight against terrorism , while insisting that the us would never accept torture . but she declined to respond specifically to questions about the existence of secret prisons in europe where islamist prisoners could be held , or the existence of secret central intelligence agency flights . a unique opportunity diplomats say rice could use wednesday evening 's closed-doors dinner - where ministers will not even be accompanied by aides - as a " unique opportunity " to explain the us position in detail . but dutch foreign minister ben bot said tuesday that rice 's comments so far " were not satisfactory , " and predicted " difficult discussions " thursday .
french officials have been more cautious , " taking note " of rice 's statements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european want clarification about secret prisons and flights on thursday rice will head for nato for a day of regular formal talks , starting with a breakfast gathering focused on the broader middle east , of increasing interest to the military alliance . but the main priority of the talks will be afghanistan , and the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
the ministers are expected to approve plans for expanding the force into the south of the war-scarred country next year . nato , which took command of isaf in 2003 , has extended the force 's presence progressively from kabul into the north and then the west this year .
eventually it is expected to cover the whole of afghanistan . thursday 's nato gathering will end with bilateral meetings with nato partners , notably central asian states , as well as regular talks with russia and ukraine . kiev would like one day to become a member of both nato and the eu , but ministers are expected to offer it only " cautious encouragement , " with no timetable , diplomats said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice aides slam comment that us made " mistake " after angela merkel said tuesday that the us admitted it erred in detaining a german national , rice 's aides challenged her comments , saying they were n't sure " what was in -lrb- merkel 's -rrb- head " when she said what she did .

upon the expansion of the bloc , the new states in the east have committed themselves to joining the currency union but the path is filled with numerous obstacles . one of the major goals of the 25 member european union is one day to have a single currency for the almost 460 million citizens .
currently , 12 countries have sacrificed their marks , francs and drachmas among other currencies , and assumed the euro as its unit of payment , while 13 have retained their currencies . britain , denmark and sweden have opted out of joining the continental currency .
yet , for the newest members who joined on may 1 , 2004 , they have obliged themselves to take on the euro .
they , like the original 12 , must fulfil the strict maastricht criteria in order to become a country in the euro zone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish membership in the eu , yes , but joining the common currency euro is more difficult the path to this ultimate goal is filled with obstacles that even financially strong countries like germany , france and italy are finding hard to adhere to .
the former communist states of poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , estonia , latvia , lithuania and slovenia are experiencing economic booms but the old , rusted infrastructure must be replaced and that is forcing many of the new eu countries to amass large debts . for estonia , lithuania , latvia and slovenia , progress is being made at an astonishingly fast rate .

this criterion is the most difficult to adhere to , " said jürgen matthes from the cologne-based institute for the german economy . indeed , sticking to the criteria drawn out at maastricht is not reason enough to get rid of the national currency for the euro . compliance with european policies the 12 current members in the euro zone have surrendered their individual monetary policies to the european central bank .
their robust economies can tolerate so-called external shocks , say from rapidly rising oil prices . the new eu members still must maintain some independence on how to deal with unexpected events .
slovakia , hungary and the czech republic need two to five times more oil per gdp unit compared to western europe .
they can still devalue their currency to a certain extent or lower interest rates in times of need according to matthes . the bigger countries are also fighting high unemployment .
to take up another burden , such as complying with euro monetary policies , would be too great for poland or slovakia .

the former communist states of poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , estonia , latvia , lithuania and slovenia are experiencing economic booms but the old , rusted infrastructure must be replaced and that is forcing many of the new eu countries to amass large debts . for estonia , lithuania , latvia and slovenia , progress is being made at an astonishingly fast rate .
they should be ready for the euro by 2007 , or 2008 at the latest .
lithuania stands alone in fulfilling the four maastricht demands of a budget deficit being less than three percent of gdp , total debt not exceeding 60 percent of gdp , and also keeping inflation under control along with low interest rates . big new members having problems while the smaller baltic states steam towards a new currency , their bigger cousins in central europe are riding rough waters .
poland , hungary , the czech republic and slovakia have the largest populations and the largest infrastructures that must be brought up to date .
the governments in these four countries are taking on new debts to finance that .
the likelihood of joining the euro zone any time soon is small . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian president vaira vike-freiberga is leading her country to the euro " these countries will probably continue to have their problems with budget deficits .
this criterion is the most difficult to adhere to , " said jürgen matthes from the cologne-based institute for the german economy . indeed , sticking to the criteria drawn out at maastricht is not reason enough to get rid of the national currency for the euro . compliance with european policies the 12 current members in the euro zone have surrendered their individual monetary policies to the european central bank .
their robust economies can tolerate so-called external shocks , say from rapidly rising oil prices . the new eu members still must maintain some independence on how to deal with unexpected events .
slovakia , hungary and the czech republic need two to five times more oil per gdp unit compared to western europe .
they can still devalue their currency to a certain extent or lower interest rates in times of need according to matthes . the bigger countries are also fighting high unemployment .
to take up another burden , such as complying with euro monetary policies , would be too great for poland or slovakia .
yet , the eight central and eastern european countries must one day join the euro zone .
it looks as though they will do this at various speeds , and some countries will have larger obstacles to overcome than others . rolf wenkel -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrations across eu mark historic enlargement when the european union welcomed 10 new members at midnight friday , parties kicked off across the continent .

reinhard mohn is the man behind the company . in the beginning was the word .
the origins of the bertelsmann empire go back to 1835 , when carl bertelsmann founded a combination print shop / publishing house in the small town of gütersloh , in western germany .
the small press was initially dedicated to the publishing of bibles and religious songs . mohn , 84 , is the great-great-grandson of bertelsmann .
the company , which was closed for a time during world war ii , was re-founded by mohn after the 1945 and began a steady course of expansion that is seen as a model for business development to this day . in 1950 , mohn began to enlarge the then-small publishing house by founding a " readers ring . "

the origins of the bertelsmann empire go back to 1835 , when carl bertelsmann founded a combination print shop / publishing house in the small town of gütersloh , in western germany .
the small press was initially dedicated to the publishing of bibles and religious songs . mohn , 84 , is the great-great-grandson of bertelsmann .
the company , which was closed for a time during world war ii , was re-founded by mohn after the 1945 and began a steady course of expansion that is seen as a model for business development to this day . in 1950 , mohn began to enlarge the then-small publishing house by founding a " readers ring . "
known as der club -lrb- the club -rrb- today , it made its first steps abroad in 1962 in spain with a reading circle there .
today it has 29 million members around the globe .

for all the flack german education gets at home from disgruntled students and dissatisifed politicians , it 's an export hit in the arab world . “ the standards of german education are very high , ” said edmond gebara , chancellor of wadi german syrian university , who himself studied in germany .
“ and this gives students the opportunity to such an education without having to go abroad . ” bypassing the french and americans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students study german in the shadows of the krak de chevalier the first collaboration , the german university cairo , opened in 2003 in cooperation with the university of ulm and the university of stuttgart .
it offers internationally-recognized degrees in the sciences and in business to the 3,000 students that study there . this past fall , the german jordanian university opened its doors to 100 students housed in a temporary location until its facilities can be finished .
officials say they plan to offer 5,000 students from the region a chance to study the humanities , sciences or business in their 5-year programs .
the university is supported by the german government and partners with the magdeburg-stendal college of the applied sciences . wadi officials looked at institutions both in france and in the us before deciding that a german one - the otto-von-guericke university in magdeburg - was the best model for them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the multicultural board of cairo 's german university is trying to grow the school “ we had the opportunity and the contacts and that made it come about quickly , ” said gebara .
" and the german model means that our degrees will be accepted across europe . " germany seen positively and even though there has been a tendency for arab students towards anglo-saxon education , germany is often seen in a very positive light in the arab world . “ germany is very highly regarded in education , industry , engineering , ” said nassifa sabongui , a german university cairo official .
“ and this university is attractive to students because it is particularly in the sciences that egyptian faculties are lacking . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german institutes are looking for ways to get into the emirates and locations like dubai city education officials say it is also important to offer opportunities for young people to stay in their own countries and study instead of going abroad where many often stay . “ schools like ours are turning out students with a high level of education , ” she added .
“ that means that we then don ’ t have to bring skilled people from abroad and can keep our students at home . ” unlike most german universities so far , they have decided to charge tuition fees .
it costs about 4,000 euros to study there .
that is true of the cairo school as well - tuition is as much as 3,500 euros with a reduction for good grades .
all schools offer scholarships . and all three universities teach english and german while courses are in english .
but german jordanian officials say they plan to also offer courses in german after students become more proficient .
professors at all schools hail from english-speaking countries such as the us and canada , germany and arab nations . serving a political goal germany 's increased educational presence serves a political goal as well . after the september 11 attacks , german officials wanted to increase contact with arab nations and improve ties , particularly through young people : 60 percent of the population in the arab world is between the ages of 15 and 30 . “ we wanted to get into the region and improve cultural and economic ties , ” said birgit ammann , project coordinator for the german jordanian university .
“ and we heard that there was a tendency on the part of the jordanians to expand their ties , for example , towards the germans and french . ” while german institutions have been gaining a presence in the mediterranean arab nations , the gulf states have been less represented . branching into the gulf states that will likely change in the near future .
the rhine-westfalian technical university aachen are considering opening a university branch in oman . “ we are in the planning stages and trying to reflect on what makes sense to offer there , ” said heide naderer , director of the university ’ s international office .
“ it is a huge project with a lot of things to consider . ” besides universities , other initiatives to bring germany closer to young arabs are in the works .
the goethe institute and german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- also want to expand into the gulf region .
for example , next year , the daad will open a branch of their office in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
goethe institute is opening a regional branch in april and will begin to offer german classes . “ the gulf region has only recently come into focus for germany very recently , ” said german ambassador jurgen stelzer .
“ before we were not too politically active but mostly our relationship was one as a supplier of consumer goods .
but as we want to make our relationship stronger , that has to also include the softer fields such as cultural and educational exchanges . ” jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hip hop culture in the holy land sponsored by the goethe institute , the german rap group blumentopf has embarked on a five-country tour designed to promote interest in german language and culture in the middle east .

for all the flack german education gets at home from disgruntled students and dissatisifed politicians , it 's an export hit in the arab world . “ the standards of german education are very high , ” said edmond gebara , chancellor of wadi german syrian university , who himself studied in germany .
“ and this gives students the opportunity to such an education without having to go abroad . ” bypassing the french and americans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students study german in the shadows of the krak de chevalier the first collaboration , the german university cairo , opened in 2003 in cooperation with the university of ulm and the university of stuttgart .
it offers internationally-recognized degrees in the sciences and in business to the 3,000 students that study there . this past fall , the german jordanian university opened its doors to 100 students housed in a temporary location until its facilities can be finished .
officials say they plan to offer 5,000 students from the region a chance to study the humanities , sciences or business in their 5-year programs .
the university is supported by the german government and partners with the magdeburg-stendal college of the applied sciences . wadi officials looked at institutions both in france and in the us before deciding that a german one - the otto-von-guericke university in magdeburg - was the best model for them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the multicultural board of cairo 's german university is trying to grow the school “ we had the opportunity and the contacts and that made it come about quickly , ” said gebara .
" and the german model means that our degrees will be accepted across europe . " germany seen positively and even though there has been a tendency for arab students towards anglo-saxon education , germany is often seen in a very positive light in the arab world . “ germany is very highly regarded in education , industry , engineering , ” said nassifa sabongui , a german university cairo official .
“ and this university is attractive to students because it is particularly in the sciences that egyptian faculties are lacking . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german institutes are looking for ways to get into the emirates and locations like dubai city education officials say it is also important to offer opportunities for young people to stay in their own countries and study instead of going abroad where many often stay . “ schools like ours are turning out students with a high level of education , ” she added .
“ that means that we then don ’ t have to bring skilled people from abroad and can keep our students at home . ” unlike most german universities so far , they have decided to charge tuition fees .
it costs about 4,000 euros to study there .
that is true of the cairo school as well - tuition is as much as 3,500 euros with a reduction for good grades .
all schools offer scholarships . and all three universities teach english and german while courses are in english .
but german jordanian officials say they plan to also offer courses in german after students become more proficient .
professors at all schools hail from english-speaking countries such as the us and canada , germany and arab nations . serving a political goal germany 's increased educational presence serves a political goal as well . after the september 11 attacks , german officials wanted to increase contact with arab nations and improve ties , particularly through young people : 60 percent of the population in the arab world is between the ages of 15 and 30 . “ we wanted to get into the region and improve cultural and economic ties , ” said birgit ammann , project coordinator for the german jordanian university .
“ and we heard that there was a tendency on the part of the jordanians to expand their ties , for example , towards the germans and french . ” while german institutions have been gaining a presence in the mediterranean arab nations , the gulf states have been less represented . branching into the gulf states that will likely change in the near future .
the rhine-westfalian technical university aachen are considering opening a university branch in oman . “ we are in the planning stages and trying to reflect on what makes sense to offer there , ” said heide naderer , director of the university ’ s international office .
“ it is a huge project with a lot of things to consider . ” besides universities , other initiatives to bring germany closer to young arabs are in the works .
the goethe institute and german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- also want to expand into the gulf region .
for example , next year , the daad will open a branch of their office in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
goethe institute is opening a regional branch in april and will begin to offer german classes . “ the gulf region has only recently come into focus for germany very recently , ” said german ambassador jurgen stelzer .
“ before we were not too politically active but mostly our relationship was one as a supplier of consumer goods .
but as we want to make our relationship stronger , that has to also include the softer fields such as cultural and educational exchanges . ” jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hip hop culture in the holy land sponsored by the goethe institute , the german rap group blumentopf has embarked on a five-country tour designed to promote interest in german language and culture in the middle east .

the university is supported by the german government and partners with the magdeburg-stendal college of the applied sciences . wadi officials looked at institutions both in france and in the us before deciding that a german one - the otto-von-guericke university in magdeburg - was the best model for them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the multicultural board of cairo 's german university is trying to grow the school “ we had the opportunity and the contacts and that made it come about quickly , ” said gebara .

upon the expansion of the bloc , the new states in the east have committed themselves to joining the currency union but the path is filled with numerous obstacles . one of the major goals of the 25 member european union is one day to have a single currency for the almost 460 million citizens .
currently , 12 countries have sacrificed their marks , francs and drachmas among other currencies , and assumed the euro as its unit of payment , while 13 have retained their currencies . britain , denmark and sweden have opted out of joining the continental currency .
yet , for the newest members who joined on may 1 , 2004 , they have obliged themselves to take on the euro .
they , like the original 12 , must fulfil the strict maastricht criteria in order to become a country in the euro zone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish membership in the eu , yes , but joining the common currency euro is more difficult the path to this ultimate goal is filled with obstacles that even financially strong countries like germany , france and italy are finding hard to adhere to .
the former communist states of poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , estonia , latvia , lithuania and slovenia are experiencing economic booms but the old , rusted infrastructure must be replaced and that is forcing many of the new eu countries to amass large debts . for estonia , lithuania , latvia and slovenia , progress is being made at an astonishingly fast rate .
they should be ready for the euro by 2007 , or 2008 at the latest .
lithuania stands alone in fulfilling the four maastricht demands of a budget deficit being less than three percent of gdp , total debt not exceeding 60 percent of gdp , and also keeping inflation under control along with low interest rates . big new members having problems while the smaller baltic states steam towards a new currency , their bigger cousins in central europe are riding rough waters .
poland , hungary , the czech republic and slovakia have the largest populations and the largest infrastructures that must be brought up to date .
the governments in these four countries are taking on new debts to finance that .
the likelihood of joining the euro zone any time soon is small . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian president vaira vike-freiberga is leading her country to the euro " these countries will probably continue to have their problems with budget deficits .
this criterion is the most difficult to adhere to , " said jürgen matthes from the cologne-based institute for the german economy . indeed , sticking to the criteria drawn out at maastricht is not reason enough to get rid of the national currency for the euro . compliance with european policies the 12 current members in the euro zone have surrendered their individual monetary policies to the european central bank .
their robust economies can tolerate so-called external shocks , say from rapidly rising oil prices . the new eu members still must maintain some independence on how to deal with unexpected events .
slovakia , hungary and the czech republic need two to five times more oil per gdp unit compared to western europe .
they can still devalue their currency to a certain extent or lower interest rates in times of need according to matthes . the bigger countries are also fighting high unemployment .
to take up another burden , such as complying with euro monetary policies , would be too great for poland or slovakia .
yet , the eight central and eastern european countries must one day join the euro zone .

but in germany , the hospitality industry is finding out that cultural blunders are easy to make when hosting chinese guests . after travel restrictions were relaxed in 2003 , around 29 million chinese took the opportunity to travel overseas in 2004 , and the figure is climbing steadily by 30 percent a year . chinese might still be barred from travelling independently , but groups of chinese tourists have become a common sight across europe - standing in line for the eiffel tower , admiring the crown jewels at the tower of london or enjoying the view at neuschwanstein in bavaria . but as they find themselves playing host to increasing numbers of visitors from china , many in the german travel industry have realized they ca n't expect everyone in the world to enjoy beer and sausage as much as they do . cultural sensitivities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tradition , the way tourists like it the black forest is one of the most popular tourist destinations in germany - easily reached by travellers whose long-haul flight has touched down at frankfurt airport .
a relatively short drive down one of germany 's legendary autobahns , and they 're in a picturesque , southwest corner of baden-württemberg famous for its cake and cuckoo clocks . but sometimes , the hordes of tourists descending on the region put the local hospitality to the test - especially when the visitors have less than a smattering of german and very specific cultural customs . the potential problems , ranging from their perpetual smoking to their seemingly insatiable thirst for tea , have n't escaped the attention of the chamber for industry and trade in freiburg , which recently hosted a seminar aimed at sensitizing local hotels and restaurants to the needs of their chinese guests . avoiding misunderstandings seminar leader annick guilhelm-ho describes the course first and foremost as a get-to-know exercise . " it 's about getting acquainted with the chinese and their customs in order to make their stay here as pleasant as possible and to avoid embarrassing misunderstandings , " she said .
" hotels need to know that the chinese prefer to take showers rather than baths , smoke a lot and would never take room numbers 4 , 14 or 44 , for reasons of superstition . " on the one hand , the chinese tourists want to explore european culture , but on the other , they 're not too keen to forfeit their creature comforts on their whistle-stop tour of the continent . " it might be a cliché , but the chinese really do drink excessive amounts of tea , " pointed out guilhelm-ho .
" they always have tea leaves and a thermos flask with them , and they need to be able to boil water whenever they want . " a kettle , therefore , is at least an important a feature of their hotel room as a lakeside view . having their cake - but not eating it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice with everything they also like a side order of rice with every meal , but on this count , they 're open to suggestion .
" wheat is the main crop grown in northern china , " said guilhelm-ho .
" so they do also eat steamed noodles , pasta and pastry , even though germans do n't cook them they way they 're used to . " unfortunately , one regional speciality that 's definitely not on the menu for chinese tourists is the world-famous black forest gateau .
asians find dairy products indigestible , so they can look at this slice of german tradition , but they ca n't touch . as for the cuckoo clocks - they 're also a no-no .

both rates are far lower than the average of 20 cents per minute airtime rate that most other providers charge . and while a few others do match those cheap rates , most do n't have the marketing power of aldi with its well-known brand name and 4,000 stores in which three out of every four germans frequent . still , when other cut rate competitors showed up on the market last year , mostly through the internet , average rates declined by half . aldi is reportedly able to offer such low prices because it has guaranteed 750,000 contracts to e-plus . others may join the fray and the wireless market may even face greater competition as reports of discounters lidl and plus are considering offering their own cell phone service at rock bottom prices . the cell phone market is an interesting one that lidl has watched for a long time , " a spokesman for the chain told tagesspiegel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.12.2005 european foreign ministers to meet over eu budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is tony blair listening to a different tune to the rest of europe ?
ahead of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels wednesday , the ratification of the european union budget looks unlikely .
should an agreement not be reached at next week 's summit , a crisis would ensue . british foreign minister jack straw can expect a rough ride when he meets with his eu peers at a special " conclave " in brussels wednesday .
the subject is his country 's budget proposal for the european union from 2007-2013 .
straw had presented on monday a budget plan drafted by his boss , prime minister tony blair , which would foresee a cut of some 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- . " this is a wonderful proposal but only for great britain , " said the spanish finance minister pedro solbes caustically .
spain is not alone in criticizing blair 's proposal .
both old and new member states have harshly disapproved of britain which holds the eu presidency until the end of 2005 .
the current suggestion has " little chance of being accepted " said germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück . the situation is reaching critical proportions as heads from around europe expressed their concern .
french president jacques chirac spoke with blair on the phone on tuesday to say that the proposals " pose a problem " and that they " would lead france to agree to the same financial sacrifices " like the ones paris rejected in june .
that , it was clear , would not happen . blair feeling the heat from eu , new members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just how euros should be redistributed in the eu is hotly disputed eu commission president jose manuel barroso also immediately rejected the proposal , calling it unacceptable .
much the same came from capitals in central and eastern europe as they would bear the biggest brunt of the belt-tightening measures offered by london .
already confronted with the potential smaller budget last week during a visit by blair , baltic states ' leaders said they could not support the british eu budget in the present form . that was reconfirmed by barroso after he met with estonian prime minister andrus ansip on tuesday .
the eu president pointed out that britain , whose current budget rebate would rise from five billion euros to eight billion in 2013 , should take a " small step " and show more willingness to compromise for the sake of the new states in the bloc . countries like estonia , hungary and poland are riding on the fact that a deal will be brokered .
ansip said that if the budget is not signed soon , then estonia would have difficulties financing numerous projects . pessimism is not the law of the union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic states , here tallin in estonia , enjoy their eu status but are still dependent on subsidies besides britain , wealthy , net contributors such as germany , the netherlands and austria would benefit from the british budget .
the tone of voice from these countries was correspondingly not one of prophetic gloom and doom . austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel called the proposal a " starting point " for negotiations .
in germany , the christian democratic parliamentary member for european affairs , matthias wissmann , judged the suggestion to be a " positive signal " and that it would be a springboard for more serious discussions . but on wednesday , jack straw must face the fact that he will be bombarded with more criticism than praise as the eu seeks to come to a budget solution .
in the eyes of commission vice president günter verheugen , the credibility and negotiating competency of the eu is at stake . bernd riegert -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british eu budget proposal shot down the uk suggested two options to solve one of the stickiest issues on the eu budget deadlock ahead of a mid-december summit .

ahead of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels wednesday , the ratification of the european union budget looks unlikely .
should an agreement not be reached at next week 's summit , a crisis would ensue . british foreign minister jack straw can expect a rough ride when he meets with his eu peers at a special " conclave " in brussels wednesday .
the subject is his country 's budget proposal for the european union from 2007-2013 .
straw had presented on monday a budget plan drafted by his boss , prime minister tony blair , which would foresee a cut of some 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- . " this is a wonderful proposal but only for great britain , " said the spanish finance minister pedro solbes caustically .
spain is not alone in criticizing blair 's proposal .
both old and new member states have harshly disapproved of britain which holds the eu presidency until the end of 2005 .
the current suggestion has " little chance of being accepted " said germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück . the situation is reaching critical proportions as heads from around europe expressed their concern .
french president jacques chirac spoke with blair on the phone on tuesday to say that the proposals " pose a problem " and that they " would lead france to agree to the same financial sacrifices " like the ones paris rejected in june .
that , it was clear , would not happen . blair feeling the heat from eu , new members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just how euros should be redistributed in the eu is hotly disputed eu commission president jose manuel barroso also immediately rejected the proposal , calling it unacceptable .
much the same came from capitals in central and eastern europe as they would bear the biggest brunt of the belt-tightening measures offered by london .
already confronted with the potential smaller budget last week during a visit by blair , baltic states ' leaders said they could not support the british eu budget in the present form . that was reconfirmed by barroso after he met with estonian prime minister andrus ansip on tuesday .
the eu president pointed out that britain , whose current budget rebate would rise from five billion euros to eight billion in 2013 , should take a " small step " and show more willingness to compromise for the sake of the new states in the bloc . countries like estonia , hungary and poland are riding on the fact that a deal will be brokered .
ansip said that if the budget is not signed soon , then estonia would have difficulties financing numerous projects . pessimism is not the law of the union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic states , here tallin in estonia , enjoy their eu status but are still dependent on subsidies besides britain , wealthy , net contributors such as germany , the netherlands and austria would benefit from the british budget .
the tone of voice from these countries was correspondingly not one of prophetic gloom and doom . austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel called the proposal a " starting point " for negotiations .
in germany , the christian democratic parliamentary member for european affairs , matthias wissmann , judged the suggestion to be a " positive signal " and that it would be a springboard for more serious discussions . but on wednesday , jack straw must face the fact that he will be bombarded with more criticism than praise as the eu seeks to come to a budget solution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.12.2005 controversy follows rice to brussels and nato großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no sweeping the cia controversy under the carpet in europe us secretary of state condoleezza rice will meet with her nato and eu counterparts in brussels on wednesday and thursday for talks under the shadow of alleged secret cia prison flights to europe . nato officials voiced confidence however that the rolling dispute would not derail plans to expand the alliance-led peacekeeping force in afghanistan , which will be the key item on the agenda at talks on thursday . the cia prison row appears all the more threatening , coming as transatlantic ties seem finally back on an even keel following a concerted diplomatic offensive by washington following us president george w. bush 's re-election . both sides are keen to play down the issue , diplomats say , despite a formal request by the european union - whose foreign ministers will also be meeting in brussels - for clarification over the affair . us does not want poisoned ties the row centers on allegations that the cia used european airports during the transport of islamist militant suspects .
human rights groups claim the practice breaches the detainees ' fundamental rights . the united states is keen not to let the issue poison its revived ties with europe , nearly three years after the iraq war plunged transatlantic relations to a historic low . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meetings between merkel and rice have yielded few answers .
" clearly our hope is to make our position clear and be understood by our partners , so we can move on to the very important work ahead of us , " said a us diplomat , requesting anonymity . rice , who started her trip to europe on monday in germany , is expected in brussels late wednesday , for an informal dinner with her nato and eu counterparts before a formal nato meeting on thursday . even before leaving washington she set out the basis of her answer to the europeans , calling on them to make " tough choices " in the fight against terrorism , while insisting that the us would never accept torture . but she declined to respond specifically to questions about the existence of secret prisons in europe where islamist prisoners could be held , or the existence of secret central intelligence agency flights . a unique opportunity diplomats say rice could use wednesday evening 's closed-doors dinner - where ministers will not even be accompanied by aides - as a " unique opportunity " to explain the us position in detail . but dutch foreign minister ben bot said tuesday that rice 's comments so far " were not satisfactory , " and predicted " difficult discussions " thursday .

" clearly our hope is to make our position clear and be understood by our partners , so we can move on to the very important work ahead of us , " said a us diplomat , requesting anonymity . rice , who started her trip to europe on monday in germany , is expected in brussels late wednesday , for an informal dinner with her nato and eu counterparts before a formal nato meeting on thursday . even before leaving washington she set out the basis of her answer to the europeans , calling on them to make " tough choices " in the fight against terrorism , while insisting that the us would never accept torture . but she declined to respond specifically to questions about the existence of secret prisons in europe where islamist prisoners could be held , or the existence of secret central intelligence agency flights . a unique opportunity diplomats say rice could use wednesday evening 's closed-doors dinner - where ministers will not even be accompanied by aides - as a " unique opportunity " to explain the us position in detail . but dutch foreign minister ben bot said tuesday that rice 's comments so far " were not satisfactory , " and predicted " difficult discussions " thursday .
french officials have been more cautious , " taking note " of rice 's statements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european want clarification about secret prisons and flights on thursday rice will head for nato for a day of regular formal talks , starting with a breakfast gathering focused on the broader middle east , of increasing interest to the military alliance . but the main priority of the talks will be afghanistan , and the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
the ministers are expected to approve plans for expanding the force into the south of the war-scarred country next year . nato , which took command of isaf in 2003 , has extended the force 's presence progressively from kabul into the north and then the west this year .
eventually it is expected to cover the whole of afghanistan . thursday 's nato gathering will end with bilateral meetings with nato partners , notably central asian states , as well as regular talks with russia and ukraine . kiev would like one day to become a member of both nato and the eu , but ministers are expected to offer it only " cautious encouragement , " with no timetable , diplomats said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice aides slam comment that us made " mistake " after angela merkel said tuesday that the us admitted it erred in detaining a german national , rice 's aides challenged her comments , saying they were n't sure " what was in -lrb- merkel 's -rrb- head " when she said what she did .

but in germany , the hospitality industry is finding out that cultural blunders are easy to make when hosting chinese guests . after travel restrictions were relaxed in 2003 , around 29 million chinese took the opportunity to travel overseas in 2004 , and the figure is climbing steadily by 30 percent a year . chinese might still be barred from travelling independently , but groups of chinese tourists have become a common sight across europe - standing in line for the eiffel tower , admiring the crown jewels at the tower of london or enjoying the view at neuschwanstein in bavaria . but as they find themselves playing host to increasing numbers of visitors from china , many in the german travel industry have realized they ca n't expect everyone in the world to enjoy beer and sausage as much as they do . cultural sensitivities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tradition , the way tourists like it the black forest is one of the most popular tourist destinations in germany - easily reached by travellers whose long-haul flight has touched down at frankfurt airport .
a relatively short drive down one of germany 's legendary autobahns , and they 're in a picturesque , southwest corner of baden-württemberg famous for its cake and cuckoo clocks . but sometimes , the hordes of tourists descending on the region put the local hospitality to the test - especially when the visitors have less than a smattering of german and very specific cultural customs . the potential problems , ranging from their perpetual smoking to their seemingly insatiable thirst for tea , have n't escaped the attention of the chamber for industry and trade in freiburg , which recently hosted a seminar aimed at sensitizing local hotels and restaurants to the needs of their chinese guests . avoiding misunderstandings seminar leader annick guilhelm-ho describes the course first and foremost as a get-to-know exercise . " it 's about getting acquainted with the chinese and their customs in order to make their stay here as pleasant as possible and to avoid embarrassing misunderstandings , " she said .
" hotels need to know that the chinese prefer to take showers rather than baths , smoke a lot and would never take room numbers 4 , 14 or 44 , for reasons of superstition . " on the one hand , the chinese tourists want to explore european culture , but on the other , they 're not too keen to forfeit their creature comforts on their whistle-stop tour of the continent . " it might be a cliché , but the chinese really do drink excessive amounts of tea , " pointed out guilhelm-ho .
" they always have tea leaves and a thermos flask with them , and they need to be able to boil water whenever they want . " a kettle , therefore , is at least an important a feature of their hotel room as a lakeside view . having their cake - but not eating it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice with everything they also like a side order of rice with every meal , but on this count , they 're open to suggestion .
" wheat is the main crop grown in northern china , " said guilhelm-ho .
" so they do also eat steamed noodles , pasta and pastry , even though germans do n't cook them they way they 're used to . " unfortunately , one regional speciality that 's definitely not on the menu for chinese tourists is the world-famous black forest gateau .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.12.2005 chinese etiquette lessons for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese tourists like germany 's sights more than its cuisine china 's economic boom has triggered a burgeoning travel industry .
but in germany , the hospitality industry is finding out that cultural blunders are easy to make when hosting chinese guests . after travel restrictions were relaxed in 2003 , around 29 million chinese took the opportunity to travel overseas in 2004 , and the figure is climbing steadily by 30 percent a year . chinese might still be barred from travelling independently , but groups of chinese tourists have become a common sight across europe - standing in line for the eiffel tower , admiring the crown jewels at the tower of london or enjoying the view at neuschwanstein in bavaria . but as they find themselves playing host to increasing numbers of visitors from china , many in the german travel industry have realized they ca n't expect everyone in the world to enjoy beer and sausage as much as they do . cultural sensitivities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tradition , the way tourists like it the black forest is one of the most popular tourist destinations in germany - easily reached by travellers whose long-haul flight has touched down at frankfurt airport .
a relatively short drive down one of germany 's legendary autobahns , and they 're in a picturesque , southwest corner of baden-württemberg famous for its cake and cuckoo clocks . but sometimes , the hordes of tourists descending on the region put the local hospitality to the test - especially when the visitors have less than a smattering of german and very specific cultural customs . the potential problems , ranging from their perpetual smoking to their seemingly insatiable thirst for tea , have n't escaped the attention of the chamber for industry and trade in freiburg , which recently hosted a seminar aimed at sensitizing local hotels and restaurants to the needs of their chinese guests . avoiding misunderstandings seminar leader annick guilhelm-ho describes the course first and foremost as a get-to-know exercise . " it 's about getting acquainted with the chinese and their customs in order to make their stay here as pleasant as possible and to avoid embarrassing misunderstandings , " she said .
" hotels need to know that the chinese prefer to take showers rather than baths , smoke a lot and would never take room numbers 4 , 14 or 44 , for reasons of superstition . " on the one hand , the chinese tourists want to explore european culture , but on the other , they 're not too keen to forfeit their creature comforts on their whistle-stop tour of the continent . " it might be a cliché , but the chinese really do drink excessive amounts of tea , " pointed out guilhelm-ho .
" they always have tea leaves and a thermos flask with them , and they need to be able to boil water whenever they want . " a kettle , therefore , is at least an important a feature of their hotel room as a lakeside view . having their cake - but not eating it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice with everything they also like a side order of rice with every meal , but on this count , they 're open to suggestion .
" wheat is the main crop grown in northern china , " said guilhelm-ho .
" so they do also eat steamed noodles , pasta and pastry , even though germans do n't cook them they way they 're used to . " unfortunately , one regional speciality that 's definitely not on the menu for chinese tourists is the world-famous black forest gateau .
asians find dairy products indigestible , so they can look at this slice of german tradition , but they ca n't touch . as for the cuckoo clocks - they 're also a no-no .
the chinese never give clocks as gifts , believing it suggests the end is nigh . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the dalai lama 's biggest german fan the dalai lama makes his second trip to germany in two months to visit one of his biggest fans , the conservative governor of hesse .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.12.2005 newest eu members tread a hard path to single currency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is a distant beacon for some new eu members the euro is the currency unit in 12 countries .
upon the expansion of the bloc , the new states in the east have committed themselves to joining the currency union but the path is filled with numerous obstacles . one of the major goals of the 25 member european union is one day to have a single currency for the almost 460 million citizens .
currently , 12 countries have sacrificed their marks , francs and drachmas among other currencies , and assumed the euro as its unit of payment , while 13 have retained their currencies . britain , denmark and sweden have opted out of joining the continental currency .
yet , for the newest members who joined on may 1 , 2004 , they have obliged themselves to take on the euro .
they , like the original 12 , must fulfil the strict maastricht criteria in order to become a country in the euro zone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish membership in the eu , yes , but joining the common currency euro is more difficult the path to this ultimate goal is filled with obstacles that even financially strong countries like germany , france and italy are finding hard to adhere to .
the former communist states of poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , estonia , latvia , lithuania and slovenia are experiencing economic booms but the old , rusted infrastructure must be replaced and that is forcing many of the new eu countries to amass large debts . for estonia , lithuania , latvia and slovenia , progress is being made at an astonishingly fast rate .
they should be ready for the euro by 2007 , or 2008 at the latest .
lithuania stands alone in fulfilling the four maastricht demands of a budget deficit being less than three percent of gdp , total debt not exceeding 60 percent of gdp , and also keeping inflation under control along with low interest rates . big new members having problems while the smaller baltic states steam towards a new currency , their bigger cousins in central europe are riding rough waters .
poland , hungary , the czech republic and slovakia have the largest populations and the largest infrastructures that must be brought up to date .
the governments in these four countries are taking on new debts to finance that .
the likelihood of joining the euro zone any time soon is small . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian president vaira vike-freiberga is leading her country to the euro " these countries will probably continue to have their problems with budget deficits .
this criterion is the most difficult to adhere to , " said jürgen matthes from the cologne-based institute for the german economy . indeed , sticking to the criteria drawn out at maastricht is not reason enough to get rid of the national currency for the euro . compliance with european policies the 12 current members in the euro zone have surrendered their individual monetary policies to the european central bank .
their robust economies can tolerate so-called external shocks , say from rapidly rising oil prices . the new eu members still must maintain some independence on how to deal with unexpected events .
slovakia , hungary and the czech republic need two to five times more oil per gdp unit compared to western europe .
they can still devalue their currency to a certain extent or lower interest rates in times of need according to matthes . the bigger countries are also fighting high unemployment .
to take up another burden , such as complying with euro monetary policies , would be too great for poland or slovakia .
yet , the eight central and eastern european countries must one day join the euro zone .
it looks as though they will do this at various speeds , and some countries will have larger obstacles to overcome than others . rolf wenkel -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrations across eu mark historic enlargement when the european union welcomed 10 new members at midnight friday , parties kicked off across the continent .

for all the flack german education gets at home from disgruntled students and dissatisifed politicians , it 's an export hit in the arab world . “ the standards of german education are very high , ” said edmond gebara , chancellor of wadi german syrian university , who himself studied in germany .
“ and this gives students the opportunity to such an education without having to go abroad . ” bypassing the french and americans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students study german in the shadows of the krak de chevalier the first collaboration , the german university cairo , opened in 2003 in cooperation with the university of ulm and the university of stuttgart .
it offers internationally-recognized degrees in the sciences and in business to the 3,000 students that study there . this past fall , the german jordanian university opened its doors to 100 students housed in a temporary location until its facilities can be finished .
officials say they plan to offer 5,000 students from the region a chance to study the humanities , sciences or business in their 5-year programs .
the university is supported by the german government and partners with the magdeburg-stendal college of the applied sciences . wadi officials looked at institutions both in france and in the us before deciding that a german one - the otto-von-guericke university in magdeburg - was the best model for them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the multicultural board of cairo 's german university is trying to grow the school “ we had the opportunity and the contacts and that made it come about quickly , ” said gebara .
" and the german model means that our degrees will be accepted across europe . " germany seen positively and even though there has been a tendency for arab students towards anglo-saxon education , germany is often seen in a very positive light in the arab world . “ germany is very highly regarded in education , industry , engineering , ” said nassifa sabongui , a german university cairo official .
“ and this university is attractive to students because it is particularly in the sciences that egyptian faculties are lacking . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german institutes are looking for ways to get into the emirates and locations like dubai city education officials say it is also important to offer opportunities for young people to stay in their own countries and study instead of going abroad where many often stay . “ schools like ours are turning out students with a high level of education , ” she added .
“ that means that we then don ’ t have to bring skilled people from abroad and can keep our students at home . ” unlike most german universities so far , they have decided to charge tuition fees .
it costs about 4,000 euros to study there .
that is true of the cairo school as well - tuition is as much as 3,500 euros with a reduction for good grades .
all schools offer scholarships . and all three universities teach english and german while courses are in english .
but german jordanian officials say they plan to also offer courses in german after students become more proficient .
professors at all schools hail from english-speaking countries such as the us and canada , germany and arab nations . serving a political goal germany 's increased educational presence serves a political goal as well . after the september 11 attacks , german officials wanted to increase contact with arab nations and improve ties , particularly through young people : 60 percent of the population in the arab world is between the ages of 15 and 30 . “ we wanted to get into the region and improve cultural and economic ties , ” said birgit ammann , project coordinator for the german jordanian university .
“ and we heard that there was a tendency on the part of the jordanians to expand their ties , for example , towards the germans and french . ” while german institutions have been gaining a presence in the mediterranean arab nations , the gulf states have been less represented . branching into the gulf states that will likely change in the near future .
the rhine-westfalian technical university aachen are considering opening a university branch in oman . “ we are in the planning stages and trying to reflect on what makes sense to offer there , ” said heide naderer , director of the university ’ s international office .
“ it is a huge project with a lot of things to consider . ” besides universities , other initiatives to bring germany closer to young arabs are in the works .
the goethe institute and german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- also want to expand into the gulf region .
for example , next year , the daad will open a branch of their office in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
goethe institute is opening a regional branch in april and will begin to offer german classes . “ the gulf region has only recently come into focus for germany very recently , ” said german ambassador jurgen stelzer .
“ before we were not too politically active but mostly our relationship was one as a supplier of consumer goods .
but as we want to make our relationship stronger , that has to also include the softer fields such as cultural and educational exchanges . ” jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hip hop culture in the holy land sponsored by the goethe institute , the german rap group blumentopf has embarked on a five-country tour designed to promote interest in german language and culture in the middle east .

but in germany , the hospitality industry is finding out that cultural blunders are easy to make when hosting chinese guests . after travel restrictions were relaxed in 2003 , around 29 million chinese took the opportunity to travel overseas in 2004 , and the figure is climbing steadily by 30 percent a year . chinese might still be barred from travelling independently , but groups of chinese tourists have become a common sight across europe - standing in line for the eiffel tower , admiring the crown jewels at the tower of london or enjoying the view at neuschwanstein in bavaria . but as they find themselves playing host to increasing numbers of visitors from china , many in the german travel industry have realized they ca n't expect everyone in the world to enjoy beer and sausage as much as they do . cultural sensitivities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tradition , the way tourists like it the black forest is one of the most popular tourist destinations in germany - easily reached by travellers whose long-haul flight has touched down at frankfurt airport .
a relatively short drive down one of germany 's legendary autobahns , and they 're in a picturesque , southwest corner of baden-württemberg famous for its cake and cuckoo clocks . but sometimes , the hordes of tourists descending on the region put the local hospitality to the test - especially when the visitors have less than a smattering of german and very specific cultural customs . the potential problems , ranging from their perpetual smoking to their seemingly insatiable thirst for tea , have n't escaped the attention of the chamber for industry and trade in freiburg , which recently hosted a seminar aimed at sensitizing local hotels and restaurants to the needs of their chinese guests . avoiding misunderstandings seminar leader annick guilhelm-ho describes the course first and foremost as a get-to-know exercise . " it 's about getting acquainted with the chinese and their customs in order to make their stay here as pleasant as possible and to avoid embarrassing misunderstandings , " she said .
" hotels need to know that the chinese prefer to take showers rather than baths , smoke a lot and would never take room numbers 4 , 14 or 44 , for reasons of superstition . " on the one hand , the chinese tourists want to explore european culture , but on the other , they 're not too keen to forfeit their creature comforts on their whistle-stop tour of the continent . " it might be a cliché , but the chinese really do drink excessive amounts of tea , " pointed out guilhelm-ho .
" they always have tea leaves and a thermos flask with them , and they need to be able to boil water whenever they want . " a kettle , therefore , is at least an important a feature of their hotel room as a lakeside view . having their cake - but not eating it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice with everything they also like a side order of rice with every meal , but on this count , they 're open to suggestion .
" wheat is the main crop grown in northern china , " said guilhelm-ho .
" so they do also eat steamed noodles , pasta and pastry , even though germans do n't cook them they way they 're used to . " unfortunately , one regional speciality that 's definitely not on the menu for chinese tourists is the world-famous black forest gateau .
asians find dairy products indigestible , so they can look at this slice of german tradition , but they ca n't touch . as for the cuckoo clocks - they 're also a no-no .
the chinese never give clocks as gifts , believing it suggests the end is nigh . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the dalai lama 's biggest german fan the dalai lama makes his second trip to germany in two months to visit one of his biggest fans , the conservative governor of hesse .

for all the flack german education gets at home from disgruntled students and dissatisifed politicians , it 's an export hit in the arab world . “ the standards of german education are very high , ” said edmond gebara , chancellor of wadi german syrian university , who himself studied in germany .
“ and this gives students the opportunity to such an education without having to go abroad . ” bypassing the french and americans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students study german in the shadows of the krak de chevalier the first collaboration , the german university cairo , opened in 2003 in cooperation with the university of ulm and the university of stuttgart .
it offers internationally-recognized degrees in the sciences and in business to the 3,000 students that study there . this past fall , the german jordanian university opened its doors to 100 students housed in a temporary location until its facilities can be finished .
officials say they plan to offer 5,000 students from the region a chance to study the humanities , sciences or business in their 5-year programs .

human rights groups claim the practice breaches the detainees ' fundamental rights . the united states is keen not to let the issue poison its revived ties with europe , nearly three years after the iraq war plunged transatlantic relations to a historic low . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meetings between merkel and rice have yielded few answers .
" clearly our hope is to make our position clear and be understood by our partners , so we can move on to the very important work ahead of us , " said a us diplomat , requesting anonymity . rice , who started her trip to europe on monday in germany , is expected in brussels late wednesday , for an informal dinner with her nato and eu counterparts before a formal nato meeting on thursday . even before leaving washington she set out the basis of her answer to the europeans , calling on them to make " tough choices " in the fight against terrorism , while insisting that the us would never accept torture . but she declined to respond specifically to questions about the existence of secret prisons in europe where islamist prisoners could be held , or the existence of secret central intelligence agency flights . a unique opportunity diplomats say rice could use wednesday evening 's closed-doors dinner - where ministers will not even be accompanied by aides - as a " unique opportunity " to explain the us position in detail . but dutch foreign minister ben bot said tuesday that rice 's comments so far " were not satisfactory , " and predicted " difficult discussions " thursday .
french officials have been more cautious , " taking note " of rice 's statements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european want clarification about secret prisons and flights on thursday rice will head for nato for a day of regular formal talks , starting with a breakfast gathering focused on the broader middle east , of increasing interest to the military alliance . but the main priority of the talks will be afghanistan , and the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
the ministers are expected to approve plans for expanding the force into the south of the war-scarred country next year . nato , which took command of isaf in 2003 , has extended the force 's presence progressively from kabul into the north and then the west this year .
eventually it is expected to cover the whole of afghanistan . thursday 's nato gathering will end with bilateral meetings with nato partners , notably central asian states , as well as regular talks with russia and ukraine . kiev would like one day to become a member of both nato and the eu , but ministers are expected to offer it only " cautious encouragement , " with no timetable , diplomats said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice aides slam comment that us made " mistake " after angela merkel said tuesday that the us admitted it erred in detaining a german national , rice 's aides challenged her comments , saying they were n't sure " what was in -lrb- merkel 's -rrb- head " when she said what she did .

human rights groups claim the practice breaches the detainees ' fundamental rights . the united states is keen not to let the issue poison its revived ties with europe , nearly three years after the iraq war plunged transatlantic relations to a historic low . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meetings between merkel and rice have yielded few answers .
" clearly our hope is to make our position clear and be understood by our partners , so we can move on to the very important work ahead of us , " said a us diplomat , requesting anonymity . rice , who started her trip to europe on monday in germany , is expected in brussels late wednesday , for an informal dinner with her nato and eu counterparts before a formal nato meeting on thursday . even before leaving washington she set out the basis of her answer to the europeans , calling on them to make " tough choices " in the fight against terrorism , while insisting that the us would never accept torture . but she declined to respond specifically to questions about the existence of secret prisons in europe where islamist prisoners could be held , or the existence of secret central intelligence agency flights . a unique opportunity diplomats say rice could use wednesday evening 's closed-doors dinner - where ministers will not even be accompanied by aides - as a " unique opportunity " to explain the us position in detail . but dutch foreign minister ben bot said tuesday that rice 's comments so far " were not satisfactory , " and predicted " difficult discussions " thursday .
french officials have been more cautious , " taking note " of rice 's statements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european want clarification about secret prisons and flights on thursday rice will head for nato for a day of regular formal talks , starting with a breakfast gathering focused on the broader middle east , of increasing interest to the military alliance . but the main priority of the talks will be afghanistan , and the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
the ministers are expected to approve plans for expanding the force into the south of the war-scarred country next year . nato , which took command of isaf in 2003 , has extended the force 's presence progressively from kabul into the north and then the west this year .
eventually it is expected to cover the whole of afghanistan . thursday 's nato gathering will end with bilateral meetings with nato partners , notably central asian states , as well as regular talks with russia and ukraine . kiev would like one day to become a member of both nato and the eu , but ministers are expected to offer it only " cautious encouragement , " with no timetable , diplomats said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice aides slam comment that us made " mistake " after angela merkel said tuesday that the us admitted it erred in detaining a german national , rice 's aides challenged her comments , saying they were n't sure " what was in -lrb- merkel 's -rrb- head " when she said what she did .

ahead of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels wednesday , the ratification of the european union budget looks unlikely .
should an agreement not be reached at next week 's summit , a crisis would ensue . british foreign minister jack straw can expect a rough ride when he meets with his eu peers at a special " conclave " in brussels wednesday .
the subject is his country 's budget proposal for the european union from 2007-2013 .
straw had presented on monday a budget plan drafted by his boss , prime minister tony blair , which would foresee a cut of some 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- . " this is a wonderful proposal but only for great britain , " said the spanish finance minister pedro solbes caustically .
spain is not alone in criticizing blair 's proposal .
both old and new member states have harshly disapproved of britain which holds the eu presidency until the end of 2005 .
the current suggestion has " little chance of being accepted " said germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück . the situation is reaching critical proportions as heads from around europe expressed their concern .
french president jacques chirac spoke with blair on the phone on tuesday to say that the proposals " pose a problem " and that they " would lead france to agree to the same financial sacrifices " like the ones paris rejected in june .
that , it was clear , would not happen . blair feeling the heat from eu , new members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just how euros should be redistributed in the eu is hotly disputed eu commission president jose manuel barroso also immediately rejected the proposal , calling it unacceptable .
much the same came from capitals in central and eastern europe as they would bear the biggest brunt of the belt-tightening measures offered by london .
already confronted with the potential smaller budget last week during a visit by blair , baltic states ' leaders said they could not support the british eu budget in the present form . that was reconfirmed by barroso after he met with estonian prime minister andrus ansip on tuesday .
the eu president pointed out that britain , whose current budget rebate would rise from five billion euros to eight billion in 2013 , should take a " small step " and show more willingness to compromise for the sake of the new states in the bloc . countries like estonia , hungary and poland are riding on the fact that a deal will be brokered .
ansip said that if the budget is not signed soon , then estonia would have difficulties financing numerous projects . pessimism is not the law of the union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic states , here tallin in estonia , enjoy their eu status but are still dependent on subsidies besides britain , wealthy , net contributors such as germany , the netherlands and austria would benefit from the british budget .
the tone of voice from these countries was correspondingly not one of prophetic gloom and doom . austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel called the proposal a " starting point " for negotiations .
in germany , the christian democratic parliamentary member for european affairs , matthias wissmann , judged the suggestion to be a " positive signal " and that it would be a springboard for more serious discussions . but on wednesday , jack straw must face the fact that he will be bombarded with more criticism than praise as the eu seeks to come to a budget solution .
in the eyes of commission vice president günter verheugen , the credibility and negotiating competency of the eu is at stake . bernd riegert -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british eu budget proposal shot down the uk suggested two options to solve one of the stickiest issues on the eu budget deadlock ahead of a mid-december summit .

ahead of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels wednesday , the ratification of the european union budget looks unlikely .
should an agreement not be reached at next week 's summit , a crisis would ensue . british foreign minister jack straw can expect a rough ride when he meets with his eu peers at a special " conclave " in brussels wednesday .
the subject is his country 's budget proposal for the european union from 2007-2013 .
straw had presented on monday a budget plan drafted by his boss , prime minister tony blair , which would foresee a cut of some 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- . " this is a wonderful proposal but only for great britain , " said the spanish finance minister pedro solbes caustically .
spain is not alone in criticizing blair 's proposal .
both old and new member states have harshly disapproved of britain which holds the eu presidency until the end of 2005 .
the current suggestion has " little chance of being accepted " said germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück . the situation is reaching critical proportions as heads from around europe expressed their concern .
french president jacques chirac spoke with blair on the phone on tuesday to say that the proposals " pose a problem " and that they " would lead france to agree to the same financial sacrifices " like the ones paris rejected in june .
that , it was clear , would not happen . blair feeling the heat from eu , new members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just how euros should be redistributed in the eu is hotly disputed eu commission president jose manuel barroso also immediately rejected the proposal , calling it unacceptable .
much the same came from capitals in central and eastern europe as they would bear the biggest brunt of the belt-tightening measures offered by london .
already confronted with the potential smaller budget last week during a visit by blair , baltic states ' leaders said they could not support the british eu budget in the present form . that was reconfirmed by barroso after he met with estonian prime minister andrus ansip on tuesday .
the eu president pointed out that britain , whose current budget rebate would rise from five billion euros to eight billion in 2013 , should take a " small step " and show more willingness to compromise for the sake of the new states in the bloc . countries like estonia , hungary and poland are riding on the fact that a deal will be brokered .
ansip said that if the budget is not signed soon , then estonia would have difficulties financing numerous projects . pessimism is not the law of the union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic states , here tallin in estonia , enjoy their eu status but are still dependent on subsidies besides britain , wealthy , net contributors such as germany , the netherlands and austria would benefit from the british budget .
the tone of voice from these countries was correspondingly not one of prophetic gloom and doom . austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel called the proposal a " starting point " for negotiations .
in germany , the christian democratic parliamentary member for european affairs , matthias wissmann , judged the suggestion to be a " positive signal " and that it would be a springboard for more serious discussions . but on wednesday , jack straw must face the fact that he will be bombarded with more criticism than praise as the eu seeks to come to a budget solution .
in the eyes of commission vice president günter verheugen , the credibility and negotiating competency of the eu is at stake . bernd riegert -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british eu budget proposal shot down the uk suggested two options to solve one of the stickiest issues on the eu budget deadlock ahead of a mid-december summit .
the reaction was anything but warm .

5 , 2005 -rrb- eu leaders deadlocked on budget despite a last-ditch bid friday to break a deadlock between britain and france over future eu financing , the uk rejected a french concession on an eu rebate , preventing the bloc from agreeing on a 2007 - 2013 budget .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.12.2005 newest eu members tread a hard path to single currency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is a distant beacon for some new eu members the euro is the currency unit in 12 countries .
upon the expansion of the bloc , the new states in the east have committed themselves to joining the currency union but the path is filled with numerous obstacles . one of the major goals of the 25 member european union is one day to have a single currency for the almost 460 million citizens .
currently , 12 countries have sacrificed their marks , francs and drachmas among other currencies , and assumed the euro as its unit of payment , while 13 have retained their currencies . britain , denmark and sweden have opted out of joining the continental currency .
yet , for the newest members who joined on may 1 , 2004 , they have obliged themselves to take on the euro .
they , like the original 12 , must fulfil the strict maastricht criteria in order to become a country in the euro zone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish membership in the eu , yes , but joining the common currency euro is more difficult the path to this ultimate goal is filled with obstacles that even financially strong countries like germany , france and italy are finding hard to adhere to .
the former communist states of poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , estonia , latvia , lithuania and slovenia are experiencing economic booms but the old , rusted infrastructure must be replaced and that is forcing many of the new eu countries to amass large debts . for estonia , lithuania , latvia and slovenia , progress is being made at an astonishingly fast rate .
they should be ready for the euro by 2007 , or 2008 at the latest .

upon the expansion of the bloc , the new states in the east have committed themselves to joining the currency union but the path is filled with numerous obstacles . one of the major goals of the 25 member european union is one day to have a single currency for the almost 460 million citizens .
currently , 12 countries have sacrificed their marks , francs and drachmas among other currencies , and assumed the euro as its unit of payment , while 13 have retained their currencies . britain , denmark and sweden have opted out of joining the continental currency .
yet , for the newest members who joined on may 1 , 2004 , they have obliged themselves to take on the euro .
they , like the original 12 , must fulfil the strict maastricht criteria in order to become a country in the euro zone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish membership in the eu , yes , but joining the common currency euro is more difficult the path to this ultimate goal is filled with obstacles that even financially strong countries like germany , france and italy are finding hard to adhere to .
the former communist states of poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , estonia , latvia , lithuania and slovenia are experiencing economic booms but the old , rusted infrastructure must be replaced and that is forcing many of the new eu countries to amass large debts . for estonia , lithuania , latvia and slovenia , progress is being made at an astonishingly fast rate .
they should be ready for the euro by 2007 , or 2008 at the latest .
lithuania stands alone in fulfilling the four maastricht demands of a budget deficit being less than three percent of gdp , total debt not exceeding 60 percent of gdp , and also keeping inflation under control along with low interest rates . big new members having problems while the smaller baltic states steam towards a new currency , their bigger cousins in central europe are riding rough waters .
poland , hungary , the czech republic and slovakia have the largest populations and the largest infrastructures that must be brought up to date .
the governments in these four countries are taking on new debts to finance that .
the likelihood of joining the euro zone any time soon is small . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian president vaira vike-freiberga is leading her country to the euro " these countries will probably continue to have their problems with budget deficits .
this criterion is the most difficult to adhere to , " said jürgen matthes from the cologne-based institute for the german economy . indeed , sticking to the criteria drawn out at maastricht is not reason enough to get rid of the national currency for the euro . compliance with european policies the 12 current members in the euro zone have surrendered their individual monetary policies to the european central bank .
their robust economies can tolerate so-called external shocks , say from rapidly rising oil prices . the new eu members still must maintain some independence on how to deal with unexpected events .
slovakia , hungary and the czech republic need two to five times more oil per gdp unit compared to western europe .
they can still devalue their currency to a certain extent or lower interest rates in times of need according to matthes . the bigger countries are also fighting high unemployment .
to take up another burden , such as complying with euro monetary policies , would be too great for poland or slovakia .
yet , the eight central and eastern european countries must one day join the euro zone .
it looks as though they will do this at various speeds , and some countries will have larger obstacles to overcome than others . rolf wenkel -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrations across eu mark historic enlargement when the european union welcomed 10 new members at midnight friday , parties kicked off across the continent .

both rates are far lower than the average of 20 cents per minute airtime rate that most other providers charge . and while a few others do match those cheap rates , most do n't have the marketing power of aldi with its well-known brand name and 4,000 stores in which three out of every four germans frequent . still , when other cut rate competitors showed up on the market last year , mostly through the internet , average rates declined by half . aldi is reportedly able to offer such low prices because it has guaranteed 750,000 contracts to e-plus . others may join the fray and the wireless market may even face greater competition as reports of discounters lidl and plus are considering offering their own cell phone service at rock bottom prices . the cell phone market is an interesting one that lidl has watched for a long time , " a spokesman for the chain told tagesspiegel .

" i learned of the case in june 2004 from a lawyer 's letter that was then passed on to us in the chancellery , " steinmeier said . before becoming foreign minister , steinmeier was chief of staff to then chancellor gerhard schroeder . press reports on wednesday said the case was examined by germany 's federal intelligence service , but it was not known what conclusion they reached . allegedly abducted and abused el-masri on tuesday filed a landmark lawsuit against the cia in a us federal court alleging he was wrongfully abducted and abused as a prisoner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mistakenly detained , he says the 42-year-old german of lebanese descent was seized in macedonia in december 2003 and flown to a prison in afghanistan for interrogation .
he was released five months later . the case is likely to focus more attention on the issue of the cia 's so-called " rendition " program in which they allegedly seize suspects in one country and take them to another for questioning . former german interior minister otto schily has been under pressure to explain press reports that he had been informed of the detention of masri but had been asked by washington to keep quiet about it . schily told german newspaper die zeit this week that he had received no information about masri 's detention " at a time when i could have done anything about it " , according to an advance extract of the newspaper released on wednesday . a misunderstanding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a mistake , us officials say us secretary of state condoleezza rice and german chancellor angela merkel discussed the case in berlin on tuesday , when merkel said the detention of masri " was accepted as a mistake by the us government .

for all the flack german education gets at home from disgruntled students and dissatisifed politicians , it 's an export hit in the arab world . “ the standards of german education are very high , ” said edmond gebara , chancellor of wadi german syrian university , who himself studied in germany .
“ and this gives students the opportunity to such an education without having to go abroad . ” bypassing the french and americans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students study german in the shadows of the krak de chevalier the first collaboration , the german university cairo , opened in 2003 in cooperation with the university of ulm and the university of stuttgart .
it offers internationally-recognized degrees in the sciences and in business to the 3,000 students that study there . this past fall , the german jordanian university opened its doors to 100 students housed in a temporary location until its facilities can be finished .
officials say they plan to offer 5,000 students from the region a chance to study the humanities , sciences or business in their 5-year programs .
the university is supported by the german government and partners with the magdeburg-stendal college of the applied sciences . wadi officials looked at institutions both in france and in the us before deciding that a german one - the otto-von-guericke university in magdeburg - was the best model for them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the multicultural board of cairo 's german university is trying to grow the school “ we had the opportunity and the contacts and that made it come about quickly , ” said gebara .
" and the german model means that our degrees will be accepted across europe . " germany seen positively and even though there has been a tendency for arab students towards anglo-saxon education , germany is often seen in a very positive light in the arab world . “ germany is very highly regarded in education , industry , engineering , ” said nassifa sabongui , a german university cairo official .
“ and this university is attractive to students because it is particularly in the sciences that egyptian faculties are lacking . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german institutes are looking for ways to get into the emirates and locations like dubai city education officials say it is also important to offer opportunities for young people to stay in their own countries and study instead of going abroad where many often stay . “ schools like ours are turning out students with a high level of education , ” she added .
“ that means that we then don ’ t have to bring skilled people from abroad and can keep our students at home . ” unlike most german universities so far , they have decided to charge tuition fees .
it costs about 4,000 euros to study there .
that is true of the cairo school as well - tuition is as much as 3,500 euros with a reduction for good grades .
all schools offer scholarships . and all three universities teach english and german while courses are in english .
but german jordanian officials say they plan to also offer courses in german after students become more proficient .
professors at all schools hail from english-speaking countries such as the us and canada , germany and arab nations . serving a political goal germany 's increased educational presence serves a political goal as well . after the september 11 attacks , german officials wanted to increase contact with arab nations and improve ties , particularly through young people : 60 percent of the population in the arab world is between the ages of 15 and 30 . “ we wanted to get into the region and improve cultural and economic ties , ” said birgit ammann , project coordinator for the german jordanian university .
“ and we heard that there was a tendency on the part of the jordanians to expand their ties , for example , towards the germans and french . ” while german institutions have been gaining a presence in the mediterranean arab nations , the gulf states have been less represented . branching into the gulf states that will likely change in the near future .
the rhine-westfalian technical university aachen are considering opening a university branch in oman . “ we are in the planning stages and trying to reflect on what makes sense to offer there , ” said heide naderer , director of the university ’ s international office .
“ it is a huge project with a lot of things to consider . ” besides universities , other initiatives to bring germany closer to young arabs are in the works .
the goethe institute and german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- also want to expand into the gulf region .
for example , next year , the daad will open a branch of their office in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
goethe institute is opening a regional branch in april and will begin to offer german classes . “ the gulf region has only recently come into focus for germany very recently , ” said german ambassador jurgen stelzer .
“ before we were not too politically active but mostly our relationship was one as a supplier of consumer goods .
but as we want to make our relationship stronger , that has to also include the softer fields such as cultural and educational exchanges . ” jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hip hop culture in the holy land sponsored by the goethe institute , the german rap group blumentopf has embarked on a five-country tour designed to promote interest in german language and culture in the middle east .

for all the flack german education gets at home from disgruntled students and dissatisifed politicians , it 's an export hit in the arab world . “ the standards of german education are very high , ” said edmond gebara , chancellor of wadi german syrian university , who himself studied in germany .
“ and this gives students the opportunity to such an education without having to go abroad . ” bypassing the french and americans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students study german in the shadows of the krak de chevalier the first collaboration , the german university cairo , opened in 2003 in cooperation with the university of ulm and the university of stuttgart .
it offers internationally-recognized degrees in the sciences and in business to the 3,000 students that study there . this past fall , the german jordanian university opened its doors to 100 students housed in a temporary location until its facilities can be finished .
officials say they plan to offer 5,000 students from the region a chance to study the humanities , sciences or business in their 5-year programs .
the university is supported by the german government and partners with the magdeburg-stendal college of the applied sciences . wadi officials looked at institutions both in france and in the us before deciding that a german one - the otto-von-guericke university in magdeburg - was the best model for them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the multicultural board of cairo 's german university is trying to grow the school “ we had the opportunity and the contacts and that made it come about quickly , ” said gebara .
" and the german model means that our degrees will be accepted across europe . " germany seen positively and even though there has been a tendency for arab students towards anglo-saxon education , germany is often seen in a very positive light in the arab world . “ germany is very highly regarded in education , industry , engineering , ” said nassifa sabongui , a german university cairo official .
“ and this university is attractive to students because it is particularly in the sciences that egyptian faculties are lacking . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german institutes are looking for ways to get into the emirates and locations like dubai city education officials say it is also important to offer opportunities for young people to stay in their own countries and study instead of going abroad where many often stay . “ schools like ours are turning out students with a high level of education , ” she added .
“ that means that we then don ’ t have to bring skilled people from abroad and can keep our students at home . ” unlike most german universities so far , they have decided to charge tuition fees .
it costs about 4,000 euros to study there .
that is true of the cairo school as well - tuition is as much as 3,500 euros with a reduction for good grades .
all schools offer scholarships . and all three universities teach english and german while courses are in english .
but german jordanian officials say they plan to also offer courses in german after students become more proficient .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.12.2005 european foreign ministers to meet over eu budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is tony blair listening to a different tune to the rest of europe ?
ahead of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels wednesday , the ratification of the european union budget looks unlikely .
should an agreement not be reached at next week 's summit , a crisis would ensue . british foreign minister jack straw can expect a rough ride when he meets with his eu peers at a special " conclave " in brussels wednesday .
the subject is his country 's budget proposal for the european union from 2007-2013 .
straw had presented on monday a budget plan drafted by his boss , prime minister tony blair , which would foresee a cut of some 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- . " this is a wonderful proposal but only for great britain , " said the spanish finance minister pedro solbes caustically .
spain is not alone in criticizing blair 's proposal .
both old and new member states have harshly disapproved of britain which holds the eu presidency until the end of 2005 .
the current suggestion has " little chance of being accepted " said germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück . the situation is reaching critical proportions as heads from around europe expressed their concern .
french president jacques chirac spoke with blair on the phone on tuesday to say that the proposals " pose a problem " and that they " would lead france to agree to the same financial sacrifices " like the ones paris rejected in june .
that , it was clear , would not happen . blair feeling the heat from eu , new members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just how euros should be redistributed in the eu is hotly disputed eu commission president jose manuel barroso also immediately rejected the proposal , calling it unacceptable .
much the same came from capitals in central and eastern europe as they would bear the biggest brunt of the belt-tightening measures offered by london .
already confronted with the potential smaller budget last week during a visit by blair , baltic states ' leaders said they could not support the british eu budget in the present form . that was reconfirmed by barroso after he met with estonian prime minister andrus ansip on tuesday .
the eu president pointed out that britain , whose current budget rebate would rise from five billion euros to eight billion in 2013 , should take a " small step " and show more willingness to compromise for the sake of the new states in the bloc . countries like estonia , hungary and poland are riding on the fact that a deal will be brokered .
ansip said that if the budget is not signed soon , then estonia would have difficulties financing numerous projects . pessimism is not the law of the union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic states , here tallin in estonia , enjoy their eu status but are still dependent on subsidies besides britain , wealthy , net contributors such as germany , the netherlands and austria would benefit from the british budget .
the tone of voice from these countries was correspondingly not one of prophetic gloom and doom . austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel called the proposal a " starting point " for negotiations .
in germany , the christian democratic parliamentary member for european affairs , matthias wissmann , judged the suggestion to be a " positive signal " and that it would be a springboard for more serious discussions . but on wednesday , jack straw must face the fact that he will be bombarded with more criticism than praise as the eu seeks to come to a budget solution .
in the eyes of commission vice president günter verheugen , the credibility and negotiating competency of the eu is at stake . bernd riegert -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british eu budget proposal shot down the uk suggested two options to solve one of the stickiest issues on the eu budget deadlock ahead of a mid-december summit .
the reaction was anything but warm .
-lrb- dec .
5 , 2005 -rrb- eu leaders deadlocked on budget despite a last-ditch bid friday to break a deadlock between britain and france over future eu financing , the uk rejected a french concession on an eu rebate , preventing the bloc from agreeing on a 2007 - 2013 budget .

ahead of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels wednesday , the ratification of the european union budget looks unlikely .
should an agreement not be reached at next week 's summit , a crisis would ensue . british foreign minister jack straw can expect a rough ride when he meets with his eu peers at a special " conclave " in brussels wednesday .
the subject is his country 's budget proposal for the european union from 2007-2013 .
straw had presented on monday a budget plan drafted by his boss , prime minister tony blair , which would foresee a cut of some 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- . " this is a wonderful proposal but only for great britain , " said the spanish finance minister pedro solbes caustically .
spain is not alone in criticizing blair 's proposal .
both old and new member states have harshly disapproved of britain which holds the eu presidency until the end of 2005 .
the current suggestion has " little chance of being accepted " said germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück . the situation is reaching critical proportions as heads from around europe expressed their concern .
french president jacques chirac spoke with blair on the phone on tuesday to say that the proposals " pose a problem " and that they " would lead france to agree to the same financial sacrifices " like the ones paris rejected in june .
that , it was clear , would not happen . blair feeling the heat from eu , new members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just how euros should be redistributed in the eu is hotly disputed eu commission president jose manuel barroso also immediately rejected the proposal , calling it unacceptable .
much the same came from capitals in central and eastern europe as they would bear the biggest brunt of the belt-tightening measures offered by london .
already confronted with the potential smaller budget last week during a visit by blair , baltic states ' leaders said they could not support the british eu budget in the present form . that was reconfirmed by barroso after he met with estonian prime minister andrus ansip on tuesday .
the eu president pointed out that britain , whose current budget rebate would rise from five billion euros to eight billion in 2013 , should take a " small step " and show more willingness to compromise for the sake of the new states in the bloc . countries like estonia , hungary and poland are riding on the fact that a deal will be brokered .
ansip said that if the budget is not signed soon , then estonia would have difficulties financing numerous projects . pessimism is not the law of the union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic states , here tallin in estonia , enjoy their eu status but are still dependent on subsidies besides britain , wealthy , net contributors such as germany , the netherlands and austria would benefit from the british budget .
the tone of voice from these countries was correspondingly not one of prophetic gloom and doom . austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel called the proposal a " starting point " for negotiations .
in germany , the christian democratic parliamentary member for european affairs , matthias wissmann , judged the suggestion to be a " positive signal " and that it would be a springboard for more serious discussions . but on wednesday , jack straw must face the fact that he will be bombarded with more criticism than praise as the eu seeks to come to a budget solution .

upon the expansion of the bloc , the new states in the east have committed themselves to joining the currency union but the path is filled with numerous obstacles . one of the major goals of the 25 member european union is one day to have a single currency for the almost 460 million citizens .
currently , 12 countries have sacrificed their marks , francs and drachmas among other currencies , and assumed the euro as its unit of payment , while 13 have retained their currencies . britain , denmark and sweden have opted out of joining the continental currency .
yet , for the newest members who joined on may 1 , 2004 , they have obliged themselves to take on the euro .
they , like the original 12 , must fulfil the strict maastricht criteria in order to become a country in the euro zone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish membership in the eu , yes , but joining the common currency euro is more difficult the path to this ultimate goal is filled with obstacles that even financially strong countries like germany , france and italy are finding hard to adhere to .
the former communist states of poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , estonia , latvia , lithuania and slovenia are experiencing economic booms but the old , rusted infrastructure must be replaced and that is forcing many of the new eu countries to amass large debts . for estonia , lithuania , latvia and slovenia , progress is being made at an astonishingly fast rate .
they should be ready for the euro by 2007 , or 2008 at the latest .
lithuania stands alone in fulfilling the four maastricht demands of a budget deficit being less than three percent of gdp , total debt not exceeding 60 percent of gdp , and also keeping inflation under control along with low interest rates . big new members having problems while the smaller baltic states steam towards a new currency , their bigger cousins in central europe are riding rough waters .
poland , hungary , the czech republic and slovakia have the largest populations and the largest infrastructures that must be brought up to date .
the governments in these four countries are taking on new debts to finance that .
the likelihood of joining the euro zone any time soon is small . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian president vaira vike-freiberga is leading her country to the euro " these countries will probably continue to have their problems with budget deficits .
this criterion is the most difficult to adhere to , " said jürgen matthes from the cologne-based institute for the german economy . indeed , sticking to the criteria drawn out at maastricht is not reason enough to get rid of the national currency for the euro . compliance with european policies the 12 current members in the euro zone have surrendered their individual monetary policies to the european central bank .
their robust economies can tolerate so-called external shocks , say from rapidly rising oil prices . the new eu members still must maintain some independence on how to deal with unexpected events .
slovakia , hungary and the czech republic need two to five times more oil per gdp unit compared to western europe .
they can still devalue their currency to a certain extent or lower interest rates in times of need according to matthes . the bigger countries are also fighting high unemployment .
to take up another burden , such as complying with euro monetary policies , would be too great for poland or slovakia .
yet , the eight central and eastern european countries must one day join the euro zone .
it looks as though they will do this at various speeds , and some countries will have larger obstacles to overcome than others . rolf wenkel -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrations across eu mark historic enlargement when the european union welcomed 10 new members at midnight friday , parties kicked off across the continent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 07.12.2005 chinese etiquette lessons for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese tourists like germany 's sights more than its cuisine china 's economic boom has triggered a burgeoning travel industry .
but in germany , the hospitality industry is finding out that cultural blunders are easy to make when hosting chinese guests . after travel restrictions were relaxed in 2003 , around 29 million chinese took the opportunity to travel overseas in 2004 , and the figure is climbing steadily by 30 percent a year . chinese might still be barred from travelling independently , but groups of chinese tourists have become a common sight across europe - standing in line for the eiffel tower , admiring the crown jewels at the tower of london or enjoying the view at neuschwanstein in bavaria . but as they find themselves playing host to increasing numbers of visitors from china , many in the german travel industry have realized they ca n't expect everyone in the world to enjoy beer and sausage as much as they do . cultural sensitivities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tradition , the way tourists like it the black forest is one of the most popular tourist destinations in germany - easily reached by travellers whose long-haul flight has touched down at frankfurt airport .
a relatively short drive down one of germany 's legendary autobahns , and they 're in a picturesque , southwest corner of baden-württemberg famous for its cake and cuckoo clocks . but sometimes , the hordes of tourists descending on the region put the local hospitality to the test - especially when the visitors have less than a smattering of german and very specific cultural customs . the potential problems , ranging from their perpetual smoking to their seemingly insatiable thirst for tea , have n't escaped the attention of the chamber for industry and trade in freiburg , which recently hosted a seminar aimed at sensitizing local hotels and restaurants to the needs of their chinese guests . avoiding misunderstandings seminar leader annick guilhelm-ho describes the course first and foremost as a get-to-know exercise . " it 's about getting acquainted with the chinese and their customs in order to make their stay here as pleasant as possible and to avoid embarrassing misunderstandings , " she said .
" hotels need to know that the chinese prefer to take showers rather than baths , smoke a lot and would never take room numbers 4 , 14 or 44 , for reasons of superstition . " on the one hand , the chinese tourists want to explore european culture , but on the other , they 're not too keen to forfeit their creature comforts on their whistle-stop tour of the continent . " it might be a cliché , but the chinese really do drink excessive amounts of tea , " pointed out guilhelm-ho .
" they always have tea leaves and a thermos flask with them , and they need to be able to boil water whenever they want . " a kettle , therefore , is at least an important a feature of their hotel room as a lakeside view . having their cake - but not eating it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice with everything they also like a side order of rice with every meal , but on this count , they 're open to suggestion .
" wheat is the main crop grown in northern china , " said guilhelm-ho .
" so they do also eat steamed noodles , pasta and pastry , even though germans do n't cook them they way they 're used to . " unfortunately , one regional speciality that 's definitely not on the menu for chinese tourists is the world-famous black forest gateau .
asians find dairy products indigestible , so they can look at this slice of german tradition , but they ca n't touch . as for the cuckoo clocks - they 're also a no-no .
the chinese never give clocks as gifts , believing it suggests the end is nigh . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the dalai lama 's biggest german fan the dalai lama makes his second trip to germany in two months to visit one of his biggest fans , the conservative governor of hesse .

but in germany , the hospitality industry is finding out that cultural blunders are easy to make when hosting chinese guests . after travel restrictions were relaxed in 2003 , around 29 million chinese took the opportunity to travel overseas in 2004 , and the figure is climbing steadily by 30 percent a year . chinese might still be barred from travelling independently , but groups of chinese tourists have become a common sight across europe - standing in line for the eiffel tower , admiring the crown jewels at the tower of london or enjoying the view at neuschwanstein in bavaria . but as they find themselves playing host to increasing numbers of visitors from china , many in the german travel industry have realized they ca n't expect everyone in the world to enjoy beer and sausage as much as they do . cultural sensitivities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german tradition , the way tourists like it the black forest is one of the most popular tourist destinations in germany - easily reached by travellers whose long-haul flight has touched down at frankfurt airport .
a relatively short drive down one of germany 's legendary autobahns , and they 're in a picturesque , southwest corner of baden-württemberg famous for its cake and cuckoo clocks . but sometimes , the hordes of tourists descending on the region put the local hospitality to the test - especially when the visitors have less than a smattering of german and very specific cultural customs . the potential problems , ranging from their perpetual smoking to their seemingly insatiable thirst for tea , have n't escaped the attention of the chamber for industry and trade in freiburg , which recently hosted a seminar aimed at sensitizing local hotels and restaurants to the needs of their chinese guests . avoiding misunderstandings seminar leader annick guilhelm-ho describes the course first and foremost as a get-to-know exercise . " it 's about getting acquainted with the chinese and their customs in order to make their stay here as pleasant as possible and to avoid embarrassing misunderstandings , " she said .
" hotels need to know that the chinese prefer to take showers rather than baths , smoke a lot and would never take room numbers 4 , 14 or 44 , for reasons of superstition . " on the one hand , the chinese tourists want to explore european culture , but on the other , they 're not too keen to forfeit their creature comforts on their whistle-stop tour of the continent . " it might be a cliché , but the chinese really do drink excessive amounts of tea , " pointed out guilhelm-ho .
" they always have tea leaves and a thermos flask with them , and they need to be able to boil water whenever they want . " a kettle , therefore , is at least an important a feature of their hotel room as a lakeside view . having their cake - but not eating it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice with everything they also like a side order of rice with every meal , but on this count , they 're open to suggestion .
" wheat is the main crop grown in northern china , " said guilhelm-ho .
" so they do also eat steamed noodles , pasta and pastry , even though germans do n't cook them they way they 're used to . " unfortunately , one regional speciality that 's definitely not on the menu for chinese tourists is the world-famous black forest gateau .
asians find dairy products indigestible , so they can look at this slice of german tradition , but they ca n't touch . as for the cuckoo clocks - they 're also a no-no .
the chinese never give clocks as gifts , believing it suggests the end is nigh . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the dalai lama 's biggest german fan the dalai lama makes his second trip to germany in two months to visit one of his biggest fans , the conservative governor of hesse .

he was heard to say it was a pity he did n't have a better command on the language .
while he could make small talk with international guests , when it came to affairs of state , he had to call in the interpreters . now he 's trying to change all that .
according to several news reports , schröder is taking intensive english at an elegant 18th century country house in the bucolic welsh countryside .
the school , which is located in the town montgomery , near the border with england , offers courses for top business professionals and promises quick results . but it 's not all grammar drills and reading comprehension for the 61-year-old jovial social democrat .
all work and no play , after all , makes gerd a dull boy .
he and his german body guards have been spotted making several visits to the local pub , the dragon hotel , enjoying a pint after school is out . it could be , however , that residents of the peaceful town of montgomery are not anxious to have the international media descending on them to watch the former world leader have a tipple or two .
although the pub 's owner robert williams confirmed the story for the dpa news agency , when deutsche welle called , a female staff member gave a quick denial that schröder had ever showed his face in the establishment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cafe client reading " blick , " a ringier paper the former chancellor is pepping up his english in preparation for a post-politics career as an executive and high-powered lobbyist for ringier , a swiss-based media group with holdings in switzerland and several eastern european countries . while he 'll be pulling in a pretty salary with that firm , schröder is also preparing to write his memoirs .
they are supposed to come out in the fall and bring the former chancellor a cool million or two .
life after the chancellery is looking very lucrative indeed . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german brewers court women drinkers beer consumption - and sales - in germany have been on the skids for years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.12.2005 newest eu members tread a hard path to single currency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is a distant beacon for some new eu members the euro is the currency unit in 12 countries .
upon the expansion of the bloc , the new states in the east have committed themselves to joining the currency union but the path is filled with numerous obstacles . one of the major goals of the 25 member european union is one day to have a single currency for the almost 460 million citizens .
currently , 12 countries have sacrificed their marks , francs and drachmas among other currencies , and assumed the euro as its unit of payment , while 13 have retained their currencies . britain , denmark and sweden have opted out of joining the continental currency .
yet , for the newest members who joined on may 1 , 2004 , they have obliged themselves to take on the euro .
they , like the original 12 , must fulfil the strict maastricht criteria in order to become a country in the euro zone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish membership in the eu , yes , but joining the common currency euro is more difficult the path to this ultimate goal is filled with obstacles that even financially strong countries like germany , france and italy are finding hard to adhere to .
the former communist states of poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , estonia , latvia , lithuania and slovenia are experiencing economic booms but the old , rusted infrastructure must be replaced and that is forcing many of the new eu countries to amass large debts . for estonia , lithuania , latvia and slovenia , progress is being made at an astonishingly fast rate .
they should be ready for the euro by 2007 , or 2008 at the latest .
lithuania stands alone in fulfilling the four maastricht demands of a budget deficit being less than three percent of gdp , total debt not exceeding 60 percent of gdp , and also keeping inflation under control along with low interest rates . big new members having problems while the smaller baltic states steam towards a new currency , their bigger cousins in central europe are riding rough waters .
poland , hungary , the czech republic and slovakia have the largest populations and the largest infrastructures that must be brought up to date .
the governments in these four countries are taking on new debts to finance that .
the likelihood of joining the euro zone any time soon is small . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian president vaira vike-freiberga is leading her country to the euro " these countries will probably continue to have their problems with budget deficits .
this criterion is the most difficult to adhere to , " said jürgen matthes from the cologne-based institute for the german economy . indeed , sticking to the criteria drawn out at maastricht is not reason enough to get rid of the national currency for the euro . compliance with european policies the 12 current members in the euro zone have surrendered their individual monetary policies to the european central bank .

upon the expansion of the bloc , the new states in the east have committed themselves to joining the currency union but the path is filled with numerous obstacles . one of the major goals of the 25 member european union is one day to have a single currency for the almost 460 million citizens .
currently , 12 countries have sacrificed their marks , francs and drachmas among other currencies , and assumed the euro as its unit of payment , while 13 have retained their currencies . britain , denmark and sweden have opted out of joining the continental currency .
yet , for the newest members who joined on may 1 , 2004 , they have obliged themselves to take on the euro .
they , like the original 12 , must fulfil the strict maastricht criteria in order to become a country in the euro zone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish membership in the eu , yes , but joining the common currency euro is more difficult the path to this ultimate goal is filled with obstacles that even financially strong countries like germany , france and italy are finding hard to adhere to .
the former communist states of poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , estonia , latvia , lithuania and slovenia are experiencing economic booms but the old , rusted infrastructure must be replaced and that is forcing many of the new eu countries to amass large debts . for estonia , lithuania , latvia and slovenia , progress is being made at an astonishingly fast rate .
they should be ready for the euro by 2007 , or 2008 at the latest .
lithuania stands alone in fulfilling the four maastricht demands of a budget deficit being less than three percent of gdp , total debt not exceeding 60 percent of gdp , and also keeping inflation under control along with low interest rates . big new members having problems while the smaller baltic states steam towards a new currency , their bigger cousins in central europe are riding rough waters .
poland , hungary , the czech republic and slovakia have the largest populations and the largest infrastructures that must be brought up to date .
the governments in these four countries are taking on new debts to finance that .
the likelihood of joining the euro zone any time soon is small . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian president vaira vike-freiberga is leading her country to the euro " these countries will probably continue to have their problems with budget deficits .
this criterion is the most difficult to adhere to , " said jürgen matthes from the cologne-based institute for the german economy . indeed , sticking to the criteria drawn out at maastricht is not reason enough to get rid of the national currency for the euro . compliance with european policies the 12 current members in the euro zone have surrendered their individual monetary policies to the european central bank .

he was heard to say it was a pity he did n't have a better command on the language .
while he could make small talk with international guests , when it came to affairs of state , he had to call in the interpreters . now he 's trying to change all that .
according to several news reports , schröder is taking intensive english at an elegant 18th century country house in the bucolic welsh countryside .
the school , which is located in the town montgomery , near the border with england , offers courses for top business professionals and promises quick results . but it 's not all grammar drills and reading comprehension for the 61-year-old jovial social democrat .

ahead of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels wednesday , the ratification of the european union budget looks unlikely .
should an agreement not be reached at next week 's summit , a crisis would ensue . british foreign minister jack straw can expect a rough ride when he meets with his eu peers at a special " conclave " in brussels wednesday .
the subject is his country 's budget proposal for the european union from 2007-2013 .
straw had presented on monday a budget plan drafted by his boss , prime minister tony blair , which would foresee a cut of some 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- . " this is a wonderful proposal but only for great britain , " said the spanish finance minister pedro solbes caustically .
spain is not alone in criticizing blair 's proposal .
both old and new member states have harshly disapproved of britain which holds the eu presidency until the end of 2005 .
the current suggestion has " little chance of being accepted " said germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück . the situation is reaching critical proportions as heads from around europe expressed their concern .
french president jacques chirac spoke with blair on the phone on tuesday to say that the proposals " pose a problem " and that they " would lead france to agree to the same financial sacrifices " like the ones paris rejected in june .
that , it was clear , would not happen . blair feeling the heat from eu , new members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just how euros should be redistributed in the eu is hotly disputed eu commission president jose manuel barroso also immediately rejected the proposal , calling it unacceptable .
much the same came from capitals in central and eastern europe as they would bear the biggest brunt of the belt-tightening measures offered by london .
already confronted with the potential smaller budget last week during a visit by blair , baltic states ' leaders said they could not support the british eu budget in the present form . that was reconfirmed by barroso after he met with estonian prime minister andrus ansip on tuesday .
the eu president pointed out that britain , whose current budget rebate would rise from five billion euros to eight billion in 2013 , should take a " small step " and show more willingness to compromise for the sake of the new states in the bloc . countries like estonia , hungary and poland are riding on the fact that a deal will be brokered .
ansip said that if the budget is not signed soon , then estonia would have difficulties financing numerous projects . pessimism is not the law of the union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic states , here tallin in estonia , enjoy their eu status but are still dependent on subsidies besides britain , wealthy , net contributors such as germany , the netherlands and austria would benefit from the british budget .
the tone of voice from these countries was correspondingly not one of prophetic gloom and doom . austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel called the proposal a " starting point " for negotiations .
in germany , the christian democratic parliamentary member for european affairs , matthias wissmann , judged the suggestion to be a " positive signal " and that it would be a springboard for more serious discussions . but on wednesday , jack straw must face the fact that he will be bombarded with more criticism than praise as the eu seeks to come to a budget solution .

eventually it is expected to cover the whole of afghanistan . thursday 's nato gathering will end with bilateral meetings with nato partners , notably central asian states , as well as regular talks with russia and ukraine . kiev would like one day to become a member of both nato and the eu , but ministers are expected to offer it only " cautious encouragement , " with no timetable , diplomats said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice aides slam comment that us made " mistake " after angela merkel said tuesday that the us admitted it erred in detaining a german national , rice 's aides challenged her comments , saying they were n't sure " what was in -lrb- merkel 's -rrb- head " when she said what she did .

for all the flack german education gets at home from disgruntled students and dissatisifed politicians , it 's an export hit in the arab world . “ the standards of german education are very high , ” said edmond gebara , chancellor of wadi german syrian university , who himself studied in germany .
“ and this gives students the opportunity to such an education without having to go abroad . ” bypassing the french and americans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students study german in the shadows of the krak de chevalier the first collaboration , the german university cairo , opened in 2003 in cooperation with the university of ulm and the university of stuttgart .
it offers internationally-recognized degrees in the sciences and in business to the 3,000 students that study there . this past fall , the german jordanian university opened its doors to 100 students housed in a temporary location until its facilities can be finished .
officials say they plan to offer 5,000 students from the region a chance to study the humanities , sciences or business in their 5-year programs .
the university is supported by the german government and partners with the magdeburg-stendal college of the applied sciences . wadi officials looked at institutions both in france and in the us before deciding that a german one - the otto-von-guericke university in magdeburg - was the best model for them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the multicultural board of cairo 's german university is trying to grow the school “ we had the opportunity and the contacts and that made it come about quickly , ” said gebara .
" and the german model means that our degrees will be accepted across europe . " germany seen positively and even though there has been a tendency for arab students towards anglo-saxon education , germany is often seen in a very positive light in the arab world . “ germany is very highly regarded in education , industry , engineering , ” said nassifa sabongui , a german university cairo official .
“ and this university is attractive to students because it is particularly in the sciences that egyptian faculties are lacking . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german institutes are looking for ways to get into the emirates and locations like dubai city education officials say it is also important to offer opportunities for young people to stay in their own countries and study instead of going abroad where many often stay . “ schools like ours are turning out students with a high level of education , ” she added .
“ that means that we then don ’ t have to bring skilled people from abroad and can keep our students at home . ” unlike most german universities so far , they have decided to charge tuition fees .
it costs about 4,000 euros to study there .
that is true of the cairo school as well - tuition is as much as 3,500 euros with a reduction for good grades .
all schools offer scholarships . and all three universities teach english and german while courses are in english .
but german jordanian officials say they plan to also offer courses in german after students become more proficient .
professors at all schools hail from english-speaking countries such as the us and canada , germany and arab nations . serving a political goal germany 's increased educational presence serves a political goal as well . after the september 11 attacks , german officials wanted to increase contact with arab nations and improve ties , particularly through young people : 60 percent of the population in the arab world is between the ages of 15 and 30 . “ we wanted to get into the region and improve cultural and economic ties , ” said birgit ammann , project coordinator for the german jordanian university .
“ and we heard that there was a tendency on the part of the jordanians to expand their ties , for example , towards the germans and french . ” while german institutions have been gaining a presence in the mediterranean arab nations , the gulf states have been less represented . branching into the gulf states that will likely change in the near future .
the rhine-westfalian technical university aachen are considering opening a university branch in oman . “ we are in the planning stages and trying to reflect on what makes sense to offer there , ” said heide naderer , director of the university ’ s international office .
“ it is a huge project with a lot of things to consider . ” besides universities , other initiatives to bring germany closer to young arabs are in the works .
the goethe institute and german academic exchange service -lrb- daad -rrb- also want to expand into the gulf region .
for example , next year , the daad will open a branch of their office in abu dhabi in the united arab emirates .
goethe institute is opening a regional branch in april and will begin to offer german classes . “ the gulf region has only recently come into focus for germany very recently , ” said german ambassador jurgen stelzer .
“ before we were not too politically active but mostly our relationship was one as a supplier of consumer goods .
but as we want to make our relationship stronger , that has to also include the softer fields such as cultural and educational exchanges . ” jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hip hop culture in the holy land sponsored by the goethe institute , the german rap group blumentopf has embarked on a five-country tour designed to promote interest in german language and culture in the middle east .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.12.2005 newest eu members tread a hard path to single currency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro is a distant beacon for some new eu members the euro is the currency unit in 12 countries .
upon the expansion of the bloc , the new states in the east have committed themselves to joining the currency union but the path is filled with numerous obstacles . one of the major goals of the 25 member european union is one day to have a single currency for the almost 460 million citizens .
currently , 12 countries have sacrificed their marks , francs and drachmas among other currencies , and assumed the euro as its unit of payment , while 13 have retained their currencies . britain , denmark and sweden have opted out of joining the continental currency .
yet , for the newest members who joined on may 1 , 2004 , they have obliged themselves to take on the euro .
they , like the original 12 , must fulfil the strict maastricht criteria in order to become a country in the euro zone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish membership in the eu , yes , but joining the common currency euro is more difficult the path to this ultimate goal is filled with obstacles that even financially strong countries like germany , france and italy are finding hard to adhere to .
the former communist states of poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , estonia , latvia , lithuania and slovenia are experiencing economic booms but the old , rusted infrastructure must be replaced and that is forcing many of the new eu countries to amass large debts . for estonia , lithuania , latvia and slovenia , progress is being made at an astonishingly fast rate .
they should be ready for the euro by 2007 , or 2008 at the latest .
lithuania stands alone in fulfilling the four maastricht demands of a budget deficit being less than three percent of gdp , total debt not exceeding 60 percent of gdp , and also keeping inflation under control along with low interest rates . big new members having problems while the smaller baltic states steam towards a new currency , their bigger cousins in central europe are riding rough waters .
poland , hungary , the czech republic and slovakia have the largest populations and the largest infrastructures that must be brought up to date .
the governments in these four countries are taking on new debts to finance that .
the likelihood of joining the euro zone any time soon is small . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian president vaira vike-freiberga is leading her country to the euro " these countries will probably continue to have their problems with budget deficits .
this criterion is the most difficult to adhere to , " said jürgen matthes from the cologne-based institute for the german economy . indeed , sticking to the criteria drawn out at maastricht is not reason enough to get rid of the national currency for the euro . compliance with european policies the 12 current members in the euro zone have surrendered their individual monetary policies to the european central bank .
their robust economies can tolerate so-called external shocks , say from rapidly rising oil prices . the new eu members still must maintain some independence on how to deal with unexpected events .
slovakia , hungary and the czech republic need two to five times more oil per gdp unit compared to western europe .
they can still devalue their currency to a certain extent or lower interest rates in times of need according to matthes . the bigger countries are also fighting high unemployment .
to take up another burden , such as complying with euro monetary policies , would be too great for poland or slovakia .
yet , the eight central and eastern european countries must one day join the euro zone .
it looks as though they will do this at various speeds , and some countries will have larger obstacles to overcome than others . rolf wenkel -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrations across eu mark historic enlargement when the european union welcomed 10 new members at midnight friday , parties kicked off across the continent .

both rates are far lower than the average of 20 cents per minute airtime rate that most other providers charge . and while a few others do match those cheap rates , most do n't have the marketing power of aldi with its well-known brand name and 4,000 stores in which three out of every four germans frequent . still , when other cut rate competitors showed up on the market last year , mostly through the internet , average rates declined by half . aldi is reportedly able to offer such low prices because it has guaranteed 750,000 contracts to e-plus . others may join the fray and the wireless market may even face greater competition as reports of discounters lidl and plus are considering offering their own cell phone service at rock bottom prices . the cell phone market is an interesting one that lidl has watched for a long time , " a spokesman for the chain told tagesspiegel .

he was heard to say it was a pity he did n't have a better command on the language .
while he could make small talk with international guests , when it came to affairs of state , he had to call in the interpreters . now he 's trying to change all that .
according to several news reports , schröder is taking intensive english at an elegant 18th century country house in the bucolic welsh countryside .
the school , which is located in the town montgomery , near the border with england , offers courses for top business professionals and promises quick results . but it 's not all grammar drills and reading comprehension for the 61-year-old jovial social democrat .
all work and no play , after all , makes gerd a dull boy .
he and his german body guards have been spotted making several visits to the local pub , the dragon hotel , enjoying a pint after school is out . it could be , however , that residents of the peaceful town of montgomery are not anxious to have the international media descending on them to watch the former world leader have a tipple or two .
although the pub 's owner robert williams confirmed the story for the dpa news agency , when deutsche welle called , a female staff member gave a quick denial that schröder had ever showed his face in the establishment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a cafe client reading " blick , " a ringier paper the former chancellor is pepping up his english in preparation for a post-politics career as an executive and high-powered lobbyist for ringier , a swiss-based media group with holdings in switzerland and several eastern european countries . while he 'll be pulling in a pretty salary with that firm , schröder is also preparing to write his memoirs .
they are supposed to come out in the fall and bring the former chancellor a cool million or two .

" i learned of the case in june 2004 from a lawyer 's letter that was then passed on to us in the chancellery , " steinmeier said . before becoming foreign minister , steinmeier was chief of staff to then chancellor gerhard schroeder . press reports on wednesday said the case was examined by germany 's federal intelligence service , but it was not known what conclusion they reached . allegedly abducted and abused el-masri on tuesday filed a landmark lawsuit against the cia in a us federal court alleging he was wrongfully abducted and abused as a prisoner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mistakenly detained , he says the 42-year-old german of lebanese descent was seized in macedonia in december 2003 and flown to a prison in afghanistan for interrogation .

both rates are far lower than the average of 20 cents per minute airtime rate that most other providers charge . and while a few others do match those cheap rates , most do n't have the marketing power of aldi with its well-known brand name and 4,000 stores in which three out of every four germans frequent . still , when other cut rate competitors showed up on the market last year , mostly through the internet , average rates declined by half . aldi is reportedly able to offer such low prices because it has guaranteed 750,000 contracts to e-plus . others may join the fray and the wireless market may even face greater competition as reports of discounters lidl and plus are considering offering their own cell phone service at rock bottom prices . the cell phone market is an interesting one that lidl has watched for a long time , " a spokesman for the chain told tagesspiegel .

upon the expansion of the bloc , the new states in the east have committed themselves to joining the currency union but the path is filled with numerous obstacles . one of the major goals of the 25 member european union is one day to have a single currency for the almost 460 million citizens .
currently , 12 countries have sacrificed their marks , francs and drachmas among other currencies , and assumed the euro as its unit of payment , while 13 have retained their currencies . britain , denmark and sweden have opted out of joining the continental currency .
yet , for the newest members who joined on may 1 , 2004 , they have obliged themselves to take on the euro .
they , like the original 12 , must fulfil the strict maastricht criteria in order to become a country in the euro zone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish membership in the eu , yes , but joining the common currency euro is more difficult the path to this ultimate goal is filled with obstacles that even financially strong countries like germany , france and italy are finding hard to adhere to .
the former communist states of poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , estonia , latvia , lithuania and slovenia are experiencing economic booms but the old , rusted infrastructure must be replaced and that is forcing many of the new eu countries to amass large debts . for estonia , lithuania , latvia and slovenia , progress is being made at an astonishingly fast rate .
they should be ready for the euro by 2007 , or 2008 at the latest .
lithuania stands alone in fulfilling the four maastricht demands of a budget deficit being less than three percent of gdp , total debt not exceeding 60 percent of gdp , and also keeping inflation under control along with low interest rates . big new members having problems while the smaller baltic states steam towards a new currency , their bigger cousins in central europe are riding rough waters .
poland , hungary , the czech republic and slovakia have the largest populations and the largest infrastructures that must be brought up to date .
the governments in these four countries are taking on new debts to finance that .
the likelihood of joining the euro zone any time soon is small . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian president vaira vike-freiberga is leading her country to the euro " these countries will probably continue to have their problems with budget deficits .
this criterion is the most difficult to adhere to , " said jürgen matthes from the cologne-based institute for the german economy . indeed , sticking to the criteria drawn out at maastricht is not reason enough to get rid of the national currency for the euro . compliance with european policies the 12 current members in the euro zone have surrendered their individual monetary policies to the european central bank .
their robust economies can tolerate so-called external shocks , say from rapidly rising oil prices . the new eu members still must maintain some independence on how to deal with unexpected events .
slovakia , hungary and the czech republic need two to five times more oil per gdp unit compared to western europe .
they can still devalue their currency to a certain extent or lower interest rates in times of need according to matthes . the bigger countries are also fighting high unemployment .
to take up another burden , such as complying with euro monetary policies , would be too great for poland or slovakia .
yet , the eight central and eastern european countries must one day join the euro zone .
it looks as though they will do this at various speeds , and some countries will have larger obstacles to overcome than others . rolf wenkel -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de celebrations across eu mark historic enlargement when the european union welcomed 10 new members at midnight friday , parties kicked off across the continent .

upon the expansion of the bloc , the new states in the east have committed themselves to joining the currency union but the path is filled with numerous obstacles . one of the major goals of the 25 member european union is one day to have a single currency for the almost 460 million citizens .
currently , 12 countries have sacrificed their marks , francs and drachmas among other currencies , and assumed the euro as its unit of payment , while 13 have retained their currencies . britain , denmark and sweden have opted out of joining the continental currency .
yet , for the newest members who joined on may 1 , 2004 , they have obliged themselves to take on the euro .
they , like the original 12 , must fulfil the strict maastricht criteria in order to become a country in the euro zone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish membership in the eu , yes , but joining the common currency euro is more difficult the path to this ultimate goal is filled with obstacles that even financially strong countries like germany , france and italy are finding hard to adhere to .
the former communist states of poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , estonia , latvia , lithuania and slovenia are experiencing economic booms but the old , rusted infrastructure must be replaced and that is forcing many of the new eu countries to amass large debts . for estonia , lithuania , latvia and slovenia , progress is being made at an astonishingly fast rate .
they should be ready for the euro by 2007 , or 2008 at the latest .
lithuania stands alone in fulfilling the four maastricht demands of a budget deficit being less than three percent of gdp , total debt not exceeding 60 percent of gdp , and also keeping inflation under control along with low interest rates . big new members having problems while the smaller baltic states steam towards a new currency , their bigger cousins in central europe are riding rough waters .
poland , hungary , the czech republic and slovakia have the largest populations and the largest infrastructures that must be brought up to date .
the governments in these four countries are taking on new debts to finance that .
the likelihood of joining the euro zone any time soon is small . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : latvian president vaira vike-freiberga is leading her country to the euro " these countries will probably continue to have their problems with budget deficits .
this criterion is the most difficult to adhere to , " said jürgen matthes from the cologne-based institute for the german economy . indeed , sticking to the criteria drawn out at maastricht is not reason enough to get rid of the national currency for the euro . compliance with european policies the 12 current members in the euro zone have surrendered their individual monetary policies to the european central bank .
their robust economies can tolerate so-called external shocks , say from rapidly rising oil prices . the new eu members still must maintain some independence on how to deal with unexpected events .
slovakia , hungary and the czech republic need two to five times more oil per gdp unit compared to western europe .
they can still devalue their currency to a certain extent or lower interest rates in times of need according to matthes . the bigger countries are also fighting high unemployment .
to take up another burden , such as complying with euro monetary policies , would be too great for poland or slovakia .
yet , the eight central and eastern european countries must one day join the euro zone .

ahead of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels wednesday , the ratification of the european union budget looks unlikely .
should an agreement not be reached at next week 's summit , a crisis would ensue . british foreign minister jack straw can expect a rough ride when he meets with his eu peers at a special " conclave " in brussels wednesday .
the subject is his country 's budget proposal for the european union from 2007-2013 .
straw had presented on monday a budget plan drafted by his boss , prime minister tony blair , which would foresee a cut of some 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- . " this is a wonderful proposal but only for great britain , " said the spanish finance minister pedro solbes caustically .
spain is not alone in criticizing blair 's proposal .
both old and new member states have harshly disapproved of britain which holds the eu presidency until the end of 2005 .
the current suggestion has " little chance of being accepted " said germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück . the situation is reaching critical proportions as heads from around europe expressed their concern .
french president jacques chirac spoke with blair on the phone on tuesday to say that the proposals " pose a problem " and that they " would lead france to agree to the same financial sacrifices " like the ones paris rejected in june .
that , it was clear , would not happen . blair feeling the heat from eu , new members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just how euros should be redistributed in the eu is hotly disputed eu commission president jose manuel barroso also immediately rejected the proposal , calling it unacceptable .
much the same came from capitals in central and eastern europe as they would bear the biggest brunt of the belt-tightening measures offered by london .
already confronted with the potential smaller budget last week during a visit by blair , baltic states ' leaders said they could not support the british eu budget in the present form . that was reconfirmed by barroso after he met with estonian prime minister andrus ansip on tuesday .
the eu president pointed out that britain , whose current budget rebate would rise from five billion euros to eight billion in 2013 , should take a " small step " and show more willingness to compromise for the sake of the new states in the bloc . countries like estonia , hungary and poland are riding on the fact that a deal will be brokered .
ansip said that if the budget is not signed soon , then estonia would have difficulties financing numerous projects . pessimism is not the law of the union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic states , here tallin in estonia , enjoy their eu status but are still dependent on subsidies besides britain , wealthy , net contributors such as germany , the netherlands and austria would benefit from the british budget .
the tone of voice from these countries was correspondingly not one of prophetic gloom and doom . austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel called the proposal a " starting point " for negotiations .
in germany , the christian democratic parliamentary member for european affairs , matthias wissmann , judged the suggestion to be a " positive signal " and that it would be a springboard for more serious discussions . but on wednesday , jack straw must face the fact that he will be bombarded with more criticism than praise as the eu seeks to come to a budget solution .

ahead of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels wednesday , the ratification of the european union budget looks unlikely .
should an agreement not be reached at next week 's summit , a crisis would ensue . british foreign minister jack straw can expect a rough ride when he meets with his eu peers at a special " conclave " in brussels wednesday .
the subject is his country 's budget proposal for the european union from 2007-2013 .
straw had presented on monday a budget plan drafted by his boss , prime minister tony blair , which would foresee a cut of some 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 28 billion -rrb- . " this is a wonderful proposal but only for great britain , " said the spanish finance minister pedro solbes caustically .
spain is not alone in criticizing blair 's proposal .
both old and new member states have harshly disapproved of britain which holds the eu presidency until the end of 2005 .
the current suggestion has " little chance of being accepted " said germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück . the situation is reaching critical proportions as heads from around europe expressed their concern .
french president jacques chirac spoke with blair on the phone on tuesday to say that the proposals " pose a problem " and that they " would lead france to agree to the same financial sacrifices " like the ones paris rejected in june .
that , it was clear , would not happen . blair feeling the heat from eu , new members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just how euros should be redistributed in the eu is hotly disputed eu commission president jose manuel barroso also immediately rejected the proposal , calling it unacceptable .
much the same came from capitals in central and eastern europe as they would bear the biggest brunt of the belt-tightening measures offered by london .
already confronted with the potential smaller budget last week during a visit by blair , baltic states ' leaders said they could not support the british eu budget in the present form . that was reconfirmed by barroso after he met with estonian prime minister andrus ansip on tuesday .
the eu president pointed out that britain , whose current budget rebate would rise from five billion euros to eight billion in 2013 , should take a " small step " and show more willingness to compromise for the sake of the new states in the bloc . countries like estonia , hungary and poland are riding on the fact that a deal will be brokered .
ansip said that if the budget is not signed soon , then estonia would have difficulties financing numerous projects . pessimism is not the law of the union bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic states , here tallin in estonia , enjoy their eu status but are still dependent on subsidies besides britain , wealthy , net contributors such as germany , the netherlands and austria would benefit from the british budget .
the tone of voice from these countries was correspondingly not one of prophetic gloom and doom . austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel called the proposal a " starting point " for negotiations .
in germany , the christian democratic parliamentary member for european affairs , matthias wissmann , judged the suggestion to be a " positive signal " and that it would be a springboard for more serious discussions . but on wednesday , jack straw must face the fact that he will be bombarded with more criticism than praise as the eu seeks to come to a budget solution .

human rights groups claim the practice breaches the detainees ' fundamental rights . the united states is keen not to let the issue poison its revived ties with europe , nearly three years after the iraq war plunged transatlantic relations to a historic low . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the meetings between merkel and rice have yielded few answers .
" clearly our hope is to make our position clear and be understood by our partners , so we can move on to the very important work ahead of us , " said a us diplomat , requesting anonymity . rice , who started her trip to europe on monday in germany , is expected in brussels late wednesday , for an informal dinner with her nato and eu counterparts before a formal nato meeting on thursday . even before leaving washington she set out the basis of her answer to the europeans , calling on them to make " tough choices " in the fight against terrorism , while insisting that the us would never accept torture . but she declined to respond specifically to questions about the existence of secret prisons in europe where islamist prisoners could be held , or the existence of secret central intelligence agency flights . a unique opportunity diplomats say rice could use wednesday evening 's closed-doors dinner - where ministers will not even be accompanied by aides - as a " unique opportunity " to explain the us position in detail . but dutch foreign minister ben bot said tuesday that rice 's comments so far " were not satisfactory , " and predicted " difficult discussions " thursday .
french officials have been more cautious , " taking note " of rice 's statements . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european want clarification about secret prisons and flights on thursday rice will head for nato for a day of regular formal talks , starting with a breakfast gathering focused on the broader middle east , of increasing interest to the military alliance . but the main priority of the talks will be afghanistan , and the nato-led international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
the ministers are expected to approve plans for expanding the force into the south of the war-scarred country next year . nato , which took command of isaf in 2003 , has extended the force 's presence progressively from kabul into the north and then the west this year .
eventually it is expected to cover the whole of afghanistan . thursday 's nato gathering will end with bilateral meetings with nato partners , notably central asian states , as well as regular talks with russia and ukraine . kiev would like one day to become a member of both nato and the eu , but ministers are expected to offer it only " cautious encouragement , " with no timetable , diplomats said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rice aides slam comment that us made " mistake " after angela merkel said tuesday that the us admitted it erred in detaining a german national , rice 's aides challenged her comments , saying they were n't sure " what was in -lrb- merkel 's -rrb- head " when she said what she did .

for all the flack german education gets at home from disgruntled students and dissatisifed politicians , it 's an export hit in the arab world . “ the standards of german education are very high , ” said edmond gebara , chancellor of wadi german syrian university , who himself studied in germany .
“ and this gives students the opportunity to such an education without having to go abroad . ” bypassing the french and americans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students study german in the shadows of the krak de chevalier the first collaboration , the german university cairo , opened in 2003 in cooperation with the university of ulm and the university of stuttgart .
it offers internationally-recognized degrees in the sciences and in business to the 3,000 students that study there . this past fall , the german jordanian university opened its doors to 100 students housed in a temporary location until its facilities can be finished .
officials say they plan to offer 5,000 students from the region a chance to study the humanities , sciences or business in their 5-year programs .
the university is supported by the german government and partners with the magdeburg-stendal college of the applied sciences . wadi officials looked at institutions both in france and in the us before deciding that a german one - the otto-von-guericke university in magdeburg - was the best model for them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the multicultural board of cairo 's german university is trying to grow the school “ we had the opportunity and the contacts and that made it come about quickly , ” said gebara .
" and the german model means that our degrees will be accepted across europe . " germany seen positively and even though there has been a tendency for arab students towards anglo-saxon education , germany is often seen in a very positive light in the arab world . “ germany is very highly regarded in education , industry , engineering , ” said nassifa sabongui , a german university cairo official .
“ and this university is attractive to students because it is particularly in the sciences that egyptian faculties are lacking . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german institutes are looking for ways to get into the emirates and locations like dubai city education officials say it is also important to offer opportunities for young people to stay in their own countries and study instead of going abroad where many often stay . “ schools like ours are turning out students with a high level of education , ” she added .
“ that means that we then don ’ t have to bring skilled people from abroad and can keep our students at home . ” unlike most german universities so far , they have decided to charge tuition fees .
it costs about 4,000 euros to study there .
that is true of the cairo school as well - tuition is as much as 3,500 euros with a reduction for good grades .

for all the flack german education gets at home from disgruntled students and dissatisifed politicians , it 's an export hit in the arab world . “ the standards of german education are very high , ” said edmond gebara , chancellor of wadi german syrian university , who himself studied in germany .
“ and this gives students the opportunity to such an education without having to go abroad . ” bypassing the french and americans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students study german in the shadows of the krak de chevalier the first collaboration , the german university cairo , opened in 2003 in cooperation with the university of ulm and the university of stuttgart .
it offers internationally-recognized degrees in the sciences and in business to the 3,000 students that study there . this past fall , the german jordanian university opened its doors to 100 students housed in a temporary location until its facilities can be finished .
officials say they plan to offer 5,000 students from the region a chance to study the humanities , sciences or business in their 5-year programs .
the university is supported by the german government and partners with the magdeburg-stendal college of the applied sciences . wadi officials looked at institutions both in france and in the us before deciding that a german one - the otto-von-guericke university in magdeburg - was the best model for them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the multicultural board of cairo 's german university is trying to grow the school “ we had the opportunity and the contacts and that made it come about quickly , ” said gebara .
" and the german model means that our degrees will be accepted across europe . " germany seen positively and even though there has been a tendency for arab students towards anglo-saxon education , germany is often seen in a very positive light in the arab world . “ germany is very highly regarded in education , industry , engineering , ” said nassifa sabongui , a german university cairo official .
“ and this university is attractive to students because it is particularly in the sciences that egyptian faculties are lacking . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german institutes are looking for ways to get into the emirates and locations like dubai city education officials say it is also important to offer opportunities for young people to stay in their own countries and study instead of going abroad where many often stay . “ schools like ours are turning out students with a high level of education , ” she added .
“ that means that we then don ’ t have to bring skilled people from abroad and can keep our students at home . ” unlike most german universities so far , they have decided to charge tuition fees .
it costs about 4,000 euros to study there .
that is true of the cairo school as well - tuition is as much as 3,500 euros with a reduction for good grades .
all schools offer scholarships . and all three universities teach english and german while courses are in english .

last month he was removed from his post as india 's foreign minister following allegations that he benefited from the iraq oil-for-food scandal .
but he continued to remain in cabinet as a minister-without-portfolio , a position that became untenable following fresh allegations levelled against him by a fellow congress party member and indian ambassador , aneil matherani .
natwar singh has consistently denied the allegations , which were first raised in a un report .
mr matherani 's allegations in a magazine interview however , in which he suggested that mr singh had facilitated the procurement of oil vouchers during a visit to iraq in 2001 , gave the opposition a fresh opportunity to target the government .
in the end , mr singh had to go at the very least to insulate the congress party - and its president sonia gandhi - from the charges .
congress was also named in the un report .
it too has dismissed the charges as false .
quick action when the un 's volcker report was made public last month , the exact role the foreign minister played was still unclear . "
since the allegations were already in the public domain there was nothing they could do " amit baruah , diplomatic correspondent , the hindu profile : natwar singh but the indian government wasted little time trying to contain the political fallout from what is undeniably one of the biggest embarrassments it has faced since coming to power .
it was helped in part by an outburst by the foreign minister which further embarrassed the government .
in a television interview , mr singh said the allegations were made by an iraqi regime that had no international credibility and likened it to the failed us hunt for weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
his comments would have left red faces in an administration that has publicly come out in support of the recently elected iraqi government and which has very strong ties with the united states .
analysts say the government had little choice but to act since the allegations were made in an international report and were directed against a very senior minister who led the country 's foreign policy .
" since the allegations were already in the public domain there was nothing they could do , " says amit baruah , diplomatic correspondent of the hindu newspaper .
" the charges relate to a period when he was not even in government .
despite that he had to be removed . "
congress fears the congress party is particularly sensitive to allegations of corruption .
in 1989 , allegations over a defence deal - the infamous bofors scandal - helped bring down the government of former prime minister rajiv gandhi .
mr gandhi was later cleared of any wrongdoing but the stigma has never been fully removed .
with his widow , sonia , now heading the party , it is clear that it needs to distance itself from the latest allegations .
it is not surprising therefore that natwar singh 's decision to quit was made after a late-night meeting with mrs gandhi on monday .
mr singh is very loyal to the gandhi family and the decision to remove him would have come from the very top .
the controversy has had a fallout in parliament with very little business being conducted over the past few days , as opposition mps demanded that mr singh step down .
but there is little danger that the allegations surrounding the former foreign minister or his removal will bring down the government .
several key coalition partners and supporters , including the influential communist parties , have spoken out against the allegations and questioned the credibility of the report .

since the allegations were already in the public domain there was nothing they could do amit baruah , diplomatic correspondent , the hindu profile : natwar singh but the indian government wasted little time trying to contain the political fallout from what is undeniably one of the biggest embarrassments it has faced since coming to power .
it was helped in part by an outburst by the foreign minister which further embarrassed the government .
in a television interview , mr singh said the allegations were made by an iraqi regime that had no international credibility and likened it to the failed us hunt for weapons of mass destruction in iraq .
his comments would have left red faces in an administration that has publicly come out in support of the recently elected iraqi government and which has very strong ties with the united states .
analysts say the government had little choice but to act since the allegations were made in an international report and were directed against a very senior minister who led the country 's foreign policy .
the congress party is sensitive to allegations of corruption " since the allegations were already in the public domain there was nothing they could do , " says amit baruah , diplomatic correspondent of the hindu newspaper .
" the charges relate to a period when he was not even in government .
despite that he had to be removed . "
congress fears the congress party is particularly sensitive to allegations of corruption .
in 1989 , allegations over a defence deal - the infamous bofors scandal - helped bring down the government of former prime minister rajiv gandhi .
mr gandhi was later cleared of any wrongdoing but the stigma has never been fully removed .
with his widow , sonia , now heading the party , it is clear that it needs to distance itself from the latest allegations .
it is not surprising therefore that natwar singh 's decision to quit was made after a late-night meeting with mrs gandhi on monday .
mr singh is very loyal to the gandhi family and the decision to remove him would have come from the very top .
the controversy has had a fallout in parliament with very little business being conducted over the past few days , as opposition mps demanded that mr singh step down .
but there is little danger that the allegations surrounding the former foreign minister or his removal will bring down the government .
several key coalition partners and supporters , including the influential communist parties , have spoken out against the allegations and questioned the credibility of the report .

national savings and investments -lrb- ns & i -rrb- said rising house prices meant new buyers typically take four-and-a-half years to save a 5 % deposit on a home .
it said the average price first-time buyers paid rose by 7.8 % in wales in 2005 compared to a uk average of 6.5 % .
a typical first home rose from £ 115,000 in 2004 to £ 124,000 in 2005 , it said the report by the savings and investment body said the income of a typical first time buyer had risen by only 3.2 % , while wales enjoyed particularly strong growth in property prices over the year .
it said the time taken for first-time buyers to save a 5 % deposit was six months longer than a year ago .
dax harkins , senior savings strategist at national savings and investments , said : " the deposit for the average first time property in wales is now just over £ 6,000 .
" as house prices have continued to outstrip both savings rates and incomes , potential first time buyers need to start saving sooner and harder to get into the market . "
savings account in comparison , ns & i said a typical house in wales in 1994 cost £ 39,952 , and the time needed to save a £ 1,998 deposit for it was two-and-a-half years .
the 2005 report assumed first-time buyers save 5 % of their income in an interest-paying savings account .
it found new buyers in northern ireland needed to save for the shortest time of four years .
the national average time it takes first-time buyers to save a deposit was four years and nine months - the same for new buyers in london .

first class stamps would rise 2p to 32p and second class stamps by 1p to 22p , with the possibility of them rising to 36p and 25p respectively by 2010 .
the royal mail had wanted to push stamps up to 39p and 27p to help pay for modernisation and to plug a £ 4bn hole in its pension fund .
postcomm said april 's rises should provide an extra £ 1.2bn next year .
consumer group postwatch said it was disappointed with what it described as a " generous settlement " for the royal mail .
gregor mcgregor , its chief executive , told the bbc : " with a very steep increase in prices and quality of service staying very more or less the same , it 's difficult to conclude that this is going to be a value for money package . "
time for change from 1 january , the royal mail will lose its 350-year monopoly of delivering letters to residential addresses . "
no one should regard today 's proposals as anything other than tough " adam crozier royal mail chief executive call for increase in wages it is particularly worried that competitors may " cherry pick " the most profitable bits of its letter delivery service when full competition starts .
nigel stapleton , chairman of postcomm , said the agreed new prices were a fair deal .
" the rises in stamp prices are substantially less than royal mail wanted and a little more than we planned , " he said .
" postwatch have described the proposals as generous -lrb- to royal mail -rrb- , royal mail have described them as tough , " mr stapleton told the bbc .
postcomm said it had to take into account a larger-than-expected pensions deficit but had not softened its line on all other aspects of the report .
" royal mail needs to radically transform its business in order to face up to competition .
they accept that , " mr stapleton said .
' tough proposals ' according to postcomm , next year 's rise should give the royal mail an extra £ 1.2bn a year to spend on new sorting office equipment and vehicles , and to make extra pension contributions .
the royal mail said it had not yet fully evaluated the impact of the new rises .
" no one should regard today 's proposals as anything other than tough , " said chief executive adam crozier .
last month , the chairman of the royal mail , allan leighton , warned the company might go bust if it could not raise sufficient extra funds to fill a £ 4bn deficit in its pension fund .
that was despite the company returning to profit this year .
in april it reported full-year profits of £ 537m , and last month said half year profits had come in at £ 159m .
the latest stamp price rise announcement reflects a slight softening of the regulator 's stance .
previously , postcomm had said that first class stamps should rise to no more than 34p by 2010 .
now it says its preferred price limit is 36p for first class and 25p for second .
stamp prices last went up in april this year .

stamp prices are set to rise in april under a compromise deal between regulator postcomm and the royal mail .
first class stamps would rise 2p to 32p and second class stamps by 1p to 22p , with the possibility of them rising to 36p and 25p respectively by 2010 .
the royal mail had wanted to push stamps up to 39p and 27p to help pay for modernisation and to plug a £ 4bn hole in its pension fund .
postcomm said april 's rises should provide an extra £ 1.2bn next year .
consumer group postwatch said it was disappointed with what it described as a " generous settlement " for the royal mail .
gregor mcgregor , its chief executive , told the bbc : " with a very steep increase in prices and quality of service staying very more or less the same , it 's difficult to conclude that this is going to be a value for money package . "
time for change from 1 january , the royal mail will lose its 350-year monopoly of delivering letters to residential addresses .
no one should regard today 's proposals as anything other than tough adam crozier royal mail chief executive call for increase in wages it is particularly worried that competitors may " cherry pick " the most profitable bits of its letter delivery service when full competition starts .
nigel stapleton , chairman of postcomm , said the agreed new prices were a fair deal .
" the rises in stamp prices are substantially less than royal mail wanted and a little more than we planned , " he said .
" postwatch have described the proposals as generous -lrb- to royal mail -rrb- , royal mail have described them as tough , " mr stapleton told the bbc .
postcomm said it had to take into account a larger-than-expected pensions deficit but had not softened its line on all other aspects of the report .
" royal mail needs to radically transform its business in order to face up to competition .
they accept that , " mr stapleton said .
' tough proposals ' according to postcomm , next year 's rise should give the royal mail an extra £ 1.2bn a year to spend on new sorting office equipment and vehicles , and to make extra pension contributions .
the royal mail said it had not yet fully evaluated the impact of the new rises .

chief constable sean price of cleveland police will outline his opposition at a meeting with charles clarke at the home office in london on wednesday .
northumbria and durham police favour the creation of a " superforce " .
but the cleveland force , which claims local people are against the move , has said it will fight merger plans .
the chairman of the cleveland police authority , councillor dave mcluckie , and teesside mps have also been invited to the meeting .
a spokesman for the authority said the meeting was being held to raise concerns over the " current review of police structures " .
three forces mr clarke is backing the three-force merger as part of a restructuring project which could see the number of uk police forces drop from 43 to just 12 .
a recent poll carried out for the cleveland authority found a single regional force was the first choice of only 8 % .
the poll questioned 2,402 people in the tees valley and county durham areas .
findings were that retaining the existing three forces was the first preference of 70 % and second preference for 17 % .
an option of two new forces was favoured by 18 % as a first preference and 60 % as a second .

his image and music are still extremely potent and popular - but how does his widow yoko ono control his legacy ?
john lennon 's widow yoko ono is in charge of the late star 's estate when musician ian watts put together a stage musical to tell john lennon 's life story , he thought he was paying harmless tribute to the greatest artist of the last century .
but ono was not willing to put her late husband 's reputation in the hands of a project she had not approved .
mr watts was about to give lennon : a day in the life two low-key test performances when ono and sony / atv , who own publishing rights to the music , found out and stopped him in his tracks .
" your head 's above the parapet and yoko 's crosshairs are firmly fixed on your forehead , " he was told by their lawyers .
" it was a very , very scary time , " mr watts says .
" i was amazed that they found out about this .
' blown away ' " i was absolutely blown away by how hot they are , how quick they were off the mark and how solid it was . "
mr watts says he was merely " naive " about needing permission from lennon 's estate .
but he now agrees they are right to keep a firm grip on lennon 's legacy .
" what they 're doing is protecting the names of the beatles , john lennon and paul mccartney .
and they have to be really looked after .
yoko ono backed an ill-fated john lennon broadway musical " so it 's important that people like me do n't come along and make a mess of it .
of course , we were n't intending to make a mess of it . "
he was told to take out any trace of storyline - and so a new tribute band-style concert show , come together right now , finishes its uk tour at the liverpool empire on sunday .
ono is notoriously protective of her late husband , threatening to sue a painter and taking legal action against a tokyo underground operator for using his image .
but , as any beatles fan will know , products and projects using his name and music are hardly thin on the ground .
us magazine forbes estimates lennon 's estate earns $ 22m -lrb- £ 12.7m -rrb- per year - mainly from cd sales .
ono has just put together a new greatest hits compilation , working class hero , which was released in october .
she also backed a broadway musical that closed after just six weeks following poor reviews .
john does n't belong to the world any more - he belongs completely to yoko bill harry john lennon 's friend and writer lennon merchandise such as sunglasses , figurines , plates , watches , trainers and baby accessories has also been approved .
but proceeds from many of these go to charity and ono has also donated some rights to organisations like amnesty international .
ono 's representatives declined to comment on her activities .
bill harry , a friend of lennon who ran the mersey beat newspaper in the 1960s and wrote the john lennon encyclopaedia , says ono has an " iron grip " over what is released .
" yoko controls everything , " he says .
" john does n't belong to the world any more .
he belongs completely to yoko , who is able to filter anything that goes out .
ono named liverpool airport after her late husband in 2001 " everybody has to have her permission for anything - which is why we have the most abominable stuff coming out on john . "
the beatles were the first band to create their own merchandise industry , according to the times chief rock critic pete paphides .
but now , ono is devaluing lennon 's messages by using lyrics on products such as nike 's converse peace trainers , which feature words from imagine , he says .
" i think it 's probably a misguided attempt to keep him remembered , " mr paphides says .
" i think in yoko 's world there 's no major conflict between licensing someone 's name and keeping their memory alive .
' cliche ' " there 's this sense that by buying a converse trainer you might somehow be tapping into the message of songs like imagine and i think that 's what sticks in the craw slightly .
" i do n't think her intentions are malign , i just think she does n't see any great conflict in all of this . "
but her actions have reduced lennon to a cliche , he says .
" i guess that 's part and parcel of iconhood - maybe in order to become an icon you do have to be reduced to this cliched , more well-rounded , smoother version of what you were . "

walt disney and walden media have adapted cs lewis ' most famous book , using the latest technology to bring to life the author 's fauns , unicorns , centaurs and talking animals .
set in world war ii , the film 's plot centres on the four pevensie children - peter , susan , edmund and lucy - who are evacuated from london to a country house .
during their stay with an eccentric professor -lrb- jim broadbent -rrb- , they stumble upon a hidden parallel world , which is entered by walking through the wardrobe of the title .
this other land , narnia , has been frozen in a permanent winter for 100 years .
religious allusions it is ruled by the evil white witch -lrb- tilda swinton -rrb- but the arrival of the four children raises hopes among the creatures who populate narnia that benevolent aslan will return to power .
after lord of the rings and the recent harry potter movies clocked up the hours , narnia 's makers have kept it to a comparatively trim two hours and 20 minutes .
it is mostly a simple chase movie as the queen 's forces try to catch the children , before culminating in an almighty showdown with the battle between good and evil at the end , which boasts 20,000 animated creatures .
reports that christian groups are being encouraged to see narnia has made non-believers suspicious .
lewis ' family say such suspicions are wrong as the books drew upon stories of self-sacrifice from many religions and myths .
modern children while there are clear similarities with the story of christ , anyone who avoids it for fear of being brainwashed into joining a religious sect will be missing out on an entertaining tale of betrayal , courage and redemption .
lovers of the original books , who are fearful of modernisation , can also relax .
much of the film is very british , if not ever so slightly middle class .
the best received line with the london preview audience was when susan says : " we 're not heroes - we 're from finchley . "
such references may not translate so well outside of the m25 , let alone abroad , but they mean narnia stays faithful to lewis ' books .
however , the script is a lot slicker than the rather stiff bbc teatime adaptations of the 1980s .
likely success the pevensie children cause disturbance like modern kids , bicker like today 's teenagers and exchange some decent one liners .
viewed as a kind of lord of the rings for kids , it works .
with harry potter and king kong out in cinemas at the same time , there are suspicions that narnia will struggle to find an audience to spawn a franchise of movies .
but it has the formula to be a success .
there are some genuine thrills , moments of great poignancy as well as laughs for children and adults alike , mostly from the animated mr and mrs beaver -lrb- voiced by ray winstone and dawn french -rrb- .
if it gets a high turnout from the same christian audience who made passion of the christ such a hit , then it could prove a bigger success than many critics expect .

walt disney and walden media have adapted cs lewis ' most famous book , using the latest technology to bring to life the author 's fauns , unicorns , centaurs and talking animals .
set in world war ii , the film 's plot centres on the four pevensie children - peter , susan , edmund and lucy - who are evacuated from london to a country house .

much of the film is very british , if not ever so slightly middle class .
the best received line with the london preview audience was when susan says : " we 're not heroes - we 're from finchley . "
