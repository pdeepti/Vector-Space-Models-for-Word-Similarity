but it also happens on their doorstep .
according to the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- study " human trafficking and exploitation in germany , " 360,000 of the 12.3 million people worldwide categorized as modern slaves live in industrialized countries , and an estimated 15,000 of them in germany - a country that has no fixed minimum wage . the ilo is now stepping up pressure for a global alliance to improve laws and raise awareness of what it calls a " hidden " issue . defining modern slavery " the term ' forced labor ' refers to a situation in which a person is being exploited against their will - forced to work under conditions they do not voluntarily accept , " explained norbert cyrus , author of the report .
it depicts the plight of poor or powerless victims , cowed by intimidation and sometimes even violence .
in germany 's worst cases , migrants are housed in basic , unhygienic accommodation with twenty people per room , working 80-hour weeks for negligible wages they have to wait months for - if they 're paid at all . globally , profits amassed on the back on forced labor amount to $ 32 billion -lrb- 25 billion euros -rrb- a year , 50 percent of which is pocketed in the western industrialized nations . in germany , two-thirds of this workforce are women .
approximately 60 percent of forced labor occurs within the country 's sex industry , with women from countries such as columbia , ghana , thailand and ukraine forced into prostitution after being lured to germany with false promises , then robbed of their papers . identifying the problem , helping the victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the coordination center against female trafficking -lrb- kok -rrb- in potsdam , one way of tackling the problem is to improve police awareness so that more instances of modern slavery are identified .
" during a police raid on a brothel , officers might realize that some of the women are not there voluntarily , but it 's very difficult to recognize such cases , " said kok 's manager .
" police need to be sensitized to these situations with further training options .

" a lot of these women are traumatized , and help centers can provide them with protection and social support .
alone , they 're not usually in a position to seek help - they do n't speak the language , they 're not able to make contact with the outside world , " explained tanis from the kok .
as usual , however , " funding for these expert advice centers is facing ongoing cuts and they ca n't keep up with the number of cases they have to deal with . " labor as a commodity but muddying the waters is the fact that - like many foreign prostitutes - not all the people working in conditions that amount to modern slavery necessarily feel the need to escape .

" hope of improvement and change keeps them going , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.05.2005 germany 's slaves to globalization großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant laborers work in the meat industry for a pittance against a backdrop of stubborn unemployment figures and wage-dumping concerns , a recent study has revealed that some 15,000 people in germany can be described as modern-day slaves . most germans fondly imagine that forced labor is a problem restricted to developing nations .
but it also happens on their doorstep .
according to the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- study " human trafficking and exploitation in germany , " 360,000 of the 12.3 million people worldwide categorized as modern slaves live in industrialized countries , and an estimated 15,000 of them in germany - a country that has no fixed minimum wage . the ilo is now stepping up pressure for a global alliance to improve laws and raise awareness of what it calls a " hidden " issue . defining modern slavery " the term ' forced labor ' refers to a situation in which a person is being exploited against their will - forced to work under conditions they do not voluntarily accept , " explained norbert cyrus , author of the report .
it depicts the plight of poor or powerless victims , cowed by intimidation and sometimes even violence .
in germany 's worst cases , migrants are housed in basic , unhygienic accommodation with twenty people per room , working 80-hour weeks for negligible wages they have to wait months for - if they 're paid at all . globally , profits amassed on the back on forced labor amount to $ 32 billion -lrb- 25 billion euros -rrb- a year , 50 percent of which is pocketed in the western industrialized nations . in germany , two-thirds of this workforce are women .
approximately 60 percent of forced labor occurs within the country 's sex industry , with women from countries such as columbia , ghana , thailand and ukraine forced into prostitution after being lured to germany with false promises , then robbed of their papers . identifying the problem , helping the victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the coordination center against female trafficking -lrb- kok -rrb- in potsdam , one way of tackling the problem is to improve police awareness so that more instances of modern slavery are identified .
" during a police raid on a brothel , officers might realize that some of the women are not there voluntarily , but it 's very difficult to recognize such cases , " said kok 's manager .
" police need to be sensitized to these situations with further training options .
then these women can be referred to advice centers , which can provide them with support throughout a court case , if they 're required to give evidence - which is a key aspect of clamping down on the problem , because taking legal action hinges almost entirely on personal testimonies .

but analysts say tackling unemployment and slow economic growth will be a tough ride for the opposition . a day after the crushing defeat of chancellor gerhard schroeder 's social democrat spd party in key regional elections in the state of north rhine-westphalia , the german stock market was in a cautiously optimistic mood , with the blue-chip dax 30 index showing a gain of 37.46 points or 0.86 percent at 4,398.14 points . investors were relieved that , following the spd 's landslide defeat in its former stronghold , schröder wanted to hold the next general election this fall , a year ahead of schedule . analysts say the move will avoid long months of economic and political paralysis as the conservative cdu / csu and liberal fdp parties block reform spd-green coalition reform initiatives in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat . " without this move , the time between now and fall 2006 would simply have been filled with empty political posturing , " said hypovereinsbank economist andreas rees .
he added that the reform process was more likely to be restarted if the opposition were to win the general election , because the christian union and liberal parties already hold the majority in the bundesrat . the prospect of additional reforms - including the further liberalization of the labor markets and a drastic simplification of the tax system - would buoy sentiment on the stock markets . industry applause the automobile industry has also welcomed the prospect of an early election .
" germany needs a strong government , " said the head of the vda auto industry federation , bernd gottschalk .
the decision to bring forward the elections " must be seen as a chance , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has been plaguing germany for years the zdh handworkers ' association agreed .

hvb economist rees noted that the cdu in north rhine-westphalia had won more by default than on the argument for its own reform programs . ubs economist holger fahrinkrug agreed .
" the conservative parties do n't have an election platform as yet and , like the spd , they also have internal struggles on key policy issues , especially in the fields of social and labor market reforms , " he said . bildunterschrift : angela merkel gernot nerb , chief economist of the influential ifo think tank , also believed that the mere prospect of a change in government would not necessarily lead to a lasting improvement in economic sentiment in germany . concrete progress would have to be made in reforms first , nerb argued .
but banking and stock market professor wolfgang gerke disagreed .
" after the elections , there 's more chance that policies will become more reliable , more calculable , " he said .

but analysts say tackling unemployment and slow economic growth will be a tough ride for the opposition . a day after the crushing defeat of chancellor gerhard schroeder 's social democrat spd party in key regional elections in the state of north rhine-westphalia , the german stock market was in a cautiously optimistic mood , with the blue-chip dax 30 index showing a gain of 37.46 points or 0.86 percent at 4,398.14 points . investors were relieved that , following the spd 's landslide defeat in its former stronghold , schröder wanted to hold the next general election this fall , a year ahead of schedule . analysts say the move will avoid long months of economic and political paralysis as the conservative cdu / csu and liberal fdp parties block reform spd-green coalition reform initiatives in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat . " without this move , the time between now and fall 2006 would simply have been filled with empty political posturing , " said hypovereinsbank economist andreas rees .
he added that the reform process was more likely to be restarted if the opposition were to win the general election , because the christian union and liberal parties already hold the majority in the bundesrat . the prospect of additional reforms - including the further liberalization of the labor markets and a drastic simplification of the tax system - would buoy sentiment on the stock markets . industry applause the automobile industry has also welcomed the prospect of an early election .
" germany needs a strong government , " said the head of the vda auto industry federation , bernd gottschalk .
the decision to bring forward the elections " must be seen as a chance , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has been plaguing germany for years the zdh handworkers ' association agreed .

hvb economist rees noted that the cdu in north rhine-westphalia had won more by default than on the argument for its own reform programs . ubs economist holger fahrinkrug agreed .
" the conservative parties do n't have an election platform as yet and , like the spd , they also have internal struggles on key policy issues , especially in the fields of social and labor market reforms , " he said . bildunterschrift : angela merkel gernot nerb , chief economist of the influential ifo think tank , also believed that the mere prospect of a change in government would not necessarily lead to a lasting improvement in economic sentiment in germany . concrete progress would have to be made in reforms first , nerb argued .
but banking and stock market professor wolfgang gerke disagreed .
" after the elections , there 's more chance that policies will become more reliable , more calculable , " he said .

he added that the reform process was more likely to be restarted if the opposition were to win the general election , because the christian union and liberal parties already hold the majority in the bundesrat . the prospect of additional reforms - including the further liberalization of the labor markets and a drastic simplification of the tax system - would buoy sentiment on the stock markets . industry applause the automobile industry has also welcomed the prospect of an early election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.05.2005 early elections in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stormy times ahead leaders of all german mainstream parties are meeting today to discuss the ramifications of early national elections this fall after the ruling social democrats suffered a blow in crucial state elections sunday . the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- won about 45 percent of the votes in germany 's most popular state of north rhine-westphalia , with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- trailing behind with just 37.2 percent . the defeat was the latest in a series of state election bungles for schröder 's spd . but this historic win for the cdu was one blow too many for chancellor gerhard schröder who sees himself deprived of enough political support for his reform drive . he is now calling for early elections , originally scheduled for 2006 to be brought forward to this autumn . " i deem it necessary to seek majority support for continued social and economic reforms , " the german chancellor said on sunday evening .
" i see it as my responsibility and duty to persuade the federal president to call early elections at the national level as quickly as possible , realistically by autumn 2005 . " strategic maneuver bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder as he made the announcement on sunday the chancellor 's announcement came as a surprise to both his friends and foes . and with voters still reeling from schröder 's much-loathed incisions into the generous state welfare system , this call for an early ballot is nothing short of a gamble for both the chancellor and his party . record high unemployment rates have gradually been eating away at voter confidence in the spd-green coalition .
dieter wiefelspütz , the party 's interior affairs spokesman , said that the chancellor has to find out as quickly as possible whether his reform course still has the backing of the population at national level .
he added that calling for early elections is the logical consequence . " i think this is an interesting move to avoid political stagnation in the country , " he said .
" i must say the announcement came as a big surprise to me .
we 'll have thrilling weeks and months ahead of us . " strategic move but under the german constitution , the chancellor can not simply call fresh elections .
schröder will have to hold a vote of confidence in the national parliament and have his followers turn him down deliberately in order to pave the way for early elections . the president , horst köhler then has 21 days to decide whether or not to dissolve parliament , but constitutional experts doubt the legality of this step . should his call for early elections , however , be heeded , schröder would use the coming months to sharpen the profile of his party and convince the german people that the opposition christian democrats have even more painful reforms up their sleeves , and have no regard for workers ' rights . there is widespread agreement among germans that early elections in may would help to get the country out of the doldrums . industry leaders emphasize that germany can not afford to continue doing nothing until the scheduled date for a national poll at the end of 2006 . schröder versus merkel ? if fresh elections are set for the autumn , schröder will run as the spd 's candidate just weeks after having been given a vote of no confidence in the bundestag . bildunterschrift : angela merkel is schröder 's most likely challenger at the moment , success at national level seems unlikely for the chancellor and his crew , which is lacking cohesion . for the opposition christian democrats , the task ahead is somewhat easier . cdu leader angela merkel , who is likely to challenge schröder in the general election in a bid to become germany 's first woman leader , described sunday 's north rhine-westphalia as a " sensational result . " " the voters ... have shown hope in us and in the future state leader jürgen rüttgers because the problems are so great and they want us to shape a policy that will bring down unemployment , " merkel said . she welcomed the possibility of an early election . " every day without the red-green coalition will be a good day for germany , " she said . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats ousted in state election exit polls in the north rhine-westphalia state election show that gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- have lost control of their stronghold state after 39 years .

"
new elections , the paper said , represent " a gamble on power .
the social democrats saw the disaster coming , they were ready for it and they tried to weather it .
but it was far greater than expected , and the psychological and political repercussions for the red-green coalition government only began to emerge as the results were revealed on the television screens .
but as long as there can be an election , there can be hope - even if it is hope for a miracle . " the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote that " after this tectonic shift , schröder has little choice but to make a virtue of necessity , if he wants to avoid a crushing defeat in the next bundestag elections .
the box of tricks he 's been using until now is more or less empty .
the fact that schröder missed his chance to secure his position against the worst consequences of losing his majority in the bundesrat with a reform of the federal system has come back to haunt him .
if the government now tried renegotiating in order to win back some room to maneuver , it would inevitably be in a worse position than it was in december .
schröder would have to swallow a bitter pill : a change of coalition , resignation , new elections . "
schröder 's move after sunday 's devastating loss in germany 's most populous state was " an admission of defeat " , said the financial times .
" the scale of the spd 's defeat reflected popular resentment at mr schröder 's economic policy - viewed as far too business-friendly - and his cuts to the country 's traditionally generous welfare state .
with many in the spd demanding a shift to the left in a bid to win back core voters , mr schröder could face a bruising battle with his grassroots as he draws up the party 's election platform .
-lrb- a general election in four months -rrb- could mean the resumption of economic reforms as soon as the autumn - either by a freshly legitimized mr schröder or by a conservative-led government .
it would also dispel fears that the nation could be doomed to spend the next 16 months in a paralysing pre-election limbo . "
the center-left guardian noted that calling early elections was not accepted practice in germany and quoted a social democrat , furious at the chancellor 's decision , calling it " political suicide . "
schröder 's chances of winning a third term as chancellor appear bleak , commented the daily .
" while it is too early to write him off entirely , germany appears to be heading for another period of center-right government , and its first ever woman chancellor - the christian democrats ' leader , angela merkel .
before last night 's disaster , mr schröder was facing growing pressure to dump some of his controversial reforms to the country 's social welfare system .
instead of changing course , he appears to be trying to regain the initiative by going to the polls . "
the center-right times said a " humbled " schröder had taken a " panicked decision , " which clearly shows how deeply the defeat has hurt the government .
analysts quoted by the paper said the election might pave the way " for a grand coalition between the christian democrats and the social democrats in some form of broad cross-party reforming alliance .
it will paralyze germany , the world 's third-largest economy , unless schröder can win a new mandate for his unpopular program to overhaul its stagnant economy and lumbering welfare state .
on yesterday ’ s showing , his chances are slight .
his popular mandate is melting by the day and left-wingers within his party are demanding that he perform a u-turn .

" the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote that " after this tectonic shift , schröder has little choice but to make a virtue of necessity , if he wants to avoid a crushing defeat in the next bundestag elections .
the box of tricks he 's been using until now is more or less empty .
the fact that schröder missed his chance to secure his position against the worst consequences of losing his majority in the bundesrat with a reform of the federal system has come back to haunt him .
if the government now tried renegotiating in order to win back some room to maneuver , it would inevitably be in a worse position than it was in december .
schröder would have to swallow a bitter pill : a change of coalition , resignation , new elections . "
schröder 's move after sunday 's devastating loss in germany 's most populous state was " an admission of defeat " , said the financial times .
" the scale of the spd 's defeat reflected popular resentment at mr schröder 's economic policy - viewed as far too business-friendly - and his cuts to the country 's traditionally generous welfare state .
with many in the spd demanding a shift to the left in a bid to win back core voters , mr schröder could face a bruising battle with his grassroots as he draws up the party 's election platform .
-lrb- a general election in four months -rrb- could mean the resumption of economic reforms as soon as the autumn - either by a freshly legitimized mr schröder or by a conservative-led government .
it would also dispel fears that the nation could be doomed to spend the next 16 months in a paralysing pre-election limbo . "
the center-left guardian noted that calling early elections was not accepted practice in germany and quoted a social democrat , furious at the chancellor 's decision , calling it " political suicide . "
schröder 's chances of winning a third term as chancellor appear bleak , commented the daily .
" while it is too early to write him off entirely , germany appears to be heading for another period of center-right government , and its first ever woman chancellor - the christian democrats ' leader , angela merkel .
before last night 's disaster , mr schröder was facing growing pressure to dump some of his controversial reforms to the country 's social welfare system .
instead of changing course , he appears to be trying to regain the initiative by going to the polls . "
the center-right times said a " humbled " schröder had taken a " panicked decision , " which clearly shows how deeply the defeat has hurt the government .
analysts quoted by the paper said the election might pave the way " for a grand coalition between the christian democrats and the social democrats in some form of broad cross-party reforming alliance .
it will paralyze germany , the world 's third-largest economy , unless schröder can win a new mandate for his unpopular program to overhaul its stagnant economy and lumbering welfare state .
on yesterday ’ s showing , his chances are slight .
his popular mandate is melting by the day and left-wingers within his party are demanding that he perform a u-turn .

such were the primary issues that drove the spd from power in germany 's largest state after 39 years at the helm .
and such are the issues which raise their heads in connection with public opposition to the european constitution which faces key votes in france and the netherlands next week . the bombshell defeat suffered by the social democrats here in germany on sunday could not have come at a worse time for the pro-european camp . what if ... ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is already a large " no " camp waiting to vote in france the consequences could be monumental and pundits everywhere are now asking the " what if " questions : what if this election signals to voters in france and holland that germans , too , do n't want the constitution ?
what if talks on key eu budget issues break down because finance ministers view schröder 's government as a lame duck ?
and what if schröder and his social democrats ultimately lose the early election he hopes to call ? most commentators agree that the election loss in north rhine-westphalia is a strong indicator that schröder 's party will be ousted from office in the next election .
and already , budget talks in brussels have been clouded because of germany 's decision to hold early elections . whether germany will continue to foot such a large portion of eu expenditure is now more uncertain than ever , and the implications of a potential shift in policy extend far beyond berlin . budget issues the eu is currently trying to convince britain to forego its budget rebate , but the prospect of a power switch in germany could sway london to resist the pressure to pay more into eu coffers . the battle lines over the budget are roughly drawn between the eu commission which wants as much money as possible , and the six biggest net contributors - germany , france , britain , the netherlands , sweden and austria - which want to limit the budget .
voters in germany , at least , see too much of their tax money disappearing down black holes in brussels while their own standards of living are diminishing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration is an ongoing issue in europe the commission also wants money to help fund eu eastward expansion .
but this is another sticking point in germany and elsewhere in europe , where voters fear further job losses and increased immigration . a change of government in berlin would be a big victory for the anti-immigration camp . as far as the new european constitution is concerned , if the referendums in france and the netherlands fail to win support for europe , this will almost certainly seal the defeat of schröder and the greens at an early federal election later this year . essentially , if the constitutional referendums fail , voters will be saying that europe must stop where it is and clean up the mess before moving on . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections in germany leaders of all german mainstream parties are meeting today to discuss the ramifications of early national elections this fall after the ruling social democrats suffered a blow in crucial state elections sunday .

" i deem it necessary to seek majority support for continued social and economic reforms , " the german chancellor said on sunday evening .
" i see it as my responsibility and duty to persuade the federal president to call early elections at the national level as quickly as possible , realistically by autumn 2005 . " strategic maneuver bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder as he made the announcement on sunday the chancellor 's announcement came as a surprise to both his friends and foes . and with voters still reeling from schröder 's much-loathed incisions into the generous state welfare system , this call for an early ballot is nothing short of a gamble for both the chancellor and his party . record high unemployment rates have gradually been eating away at voter confidence in the spd-green coalition .
dieter wiefelspütz , the party 's interior affairs spokesman , said that the chancellor has to find out as quickly as possible whether his reform course still has the backing of the population at national level .
he added that calling for early elections is the logical consequence . " i think this is an interesting move to avoid political stagnation in the country , " he said .
" i must say the announcement came as a big surprise to me .
we 'll have thrilling weeks and months ahead of us . " strategic move but under the german constitution , the chancellor can not simply call fresh elections .
schröder will have to hold a vote of confidence in the national parliament and have his followers turn him down deliberately in order to pave the way for early elections . the president , horst köhler then has 21 days to decide whether or not to dissolve parliament , but constitutional experts doubt the legality of this step . should his call for early elections , however , be heeded , schröder would use the coming months to sharpen the profile of his party and convince the german people that the opposition christian democrats have even more painful reforms up their sleeves , and have no regard for workers ' rights . there is widespread agreement among germans that early elections in may would help to get the country out of the doldrums . industry leaders emphasize that germany can not afford to continue doing nothing until the scheduled date for a national poll at the end of 2006 . schröder versus merkel ? if fresh elections are set for the autumn , schröder will run as the spd 's candidate just weeks after having been given a vote of no confidence in the bundestag . bildunterschrift : angela merkel is schröder 's most likely challenger at the moment , success at national level seems unlikely for the chancellor and his crew , which is lacking cohesion . for the opposition christian democrats , the task ahead is somewhat easier . cdu leader angela merkel , who is likely to challenge schröder in the general election in a bid to become germany 's first woman leader , described sunday 's north rhine-westphalia as a " sensational result . " " the voters ... have shown hope in us and in the future state leader jürgen rüttgers because the problems are so great and they want us to shape a policy that will bring down unemployment , " merkel said . she welcomed the possibility of an early election .

eu foreign ministers sparred sunday over budget questions , as the prospect of early general elections in germany injected fresh uncertainty into the talks , already dogged by britain 's vow to hold onto its budget rebate . the ministers met over dinner in brussels to sound each other out over their positions on the eu 's long-term budget , before getting down to bargaining at an official gathering on monday . luxembourg , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , was aiming to broker a deal between the union 's 25 members that can be signed at a summit here on june 16 and 17 , but the negotiations were being held up by britain 's refusal to reconsider the rebate on budget contributions that former prime minister margaret thatcher won in 1984 . repercussions of german elections the announcement sunday of early elections in germany raised new questions about the negotiating position of the biggest contributor to the budget . " it 's an important point that should not automatically make things easy , but that 's up to germany to decide , " nicolas schmidt , luxembourg 's deputy foreign minister , said . luxembourg was trying to bring minds together with a proposal that includes a suggestion to freeze and then reduce the british rebate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , that proposition raised the ire of britain who , through the voice of foreign secretary jack straw , insisted that his government aimed to keep the rebate , which is supposed to compensate for the fact britain receives less from eu agricultural funds than other nations . it was justified in 1984 when it was agreed , it is justified today and we will not hesitate to use our veto if it is necessary , " straw said in the face of growing opposition to the rebate by other countries . limiting the budget luxembourg wants an agreement before britain takes over the presidency for six months in july , during which the budget issue is likely to languish if there is no deal beforehand .
with that aim , luxembourg was to sound out eu leaders on their positions in order to make progress at a foreign ministers meeting planned for june 13 . the battle lines over the budget for the period from 2007 to 2013 were roughly drawn between the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , which wants to have as much money available as possible , and the six biggest net contributors - britain , france , germany , austria , sweden and the netherlands , which want to limit the budget . the commission was angling for a budget of one trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.26 trillion -rrb- while the six countries have demanded that the budget be capped at 815 billion euros , or 1.0 percent of gross national income as a compromise , luxembourg has proposed an overall budget ranging from 865 billion euros to 900 billion euros , representing the equivalent of 1.06 to 1.09 percent of gni . policy consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso gave a lukewarm reaction to the luxembourg proposal , saying it was " a step forward in some ways because for the first time we have all the key elements of the package set out for negotiations , " but was not " a proposal capable of moving the union forward over the next few years .

" it 's an important point that should not automatically make things easy , but that 's up to germany to decide , " nicolas schmidt , luxembourg 's deputy foreign minister , said . luxembourg was trying to bring minds together with a proposal that includes a suggestion to freeze and then reduce the british rebate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , that proposition raised the ire of britain who , through the voice of foreign secretary jack straw , insisted that his government aimed to keep the rebate , which is supposed to compensate for the fact britain receives less from eu agricultural funds than other nations . it was justified in 1984 when it was agreed , it is justified today and we will not hesitate to use our veto if it is necessary , " straw said in the face of growing opposition to the rebate by other countries . limiting the budget luxembourg wants an agreement before britain takes over the presidency for six months in july , during which the budget issue is likely to languish if there is no deal beforehand .
with that aim , luxembourg was to sound out eu leaders on their positions in order to make progress at a foreign ministers meeting planned for june 13 . the battle lines over the budget for the period from 2007 to 2013 were roughly drawn between the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , which wants to have as much money available as possible , and the six biggest net contributors - britain , france , germany , austria , sweden and the netherlands , which want to limit the budget . the commission was angling for a budget of one trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.26 trillion -rrb- while the six countries have demanded that the budget be capped at 815 billion euros , or 1.0 percent of gross national income as a compromise , luxembourg has proposed an overall budget ranging from 865 billion euros to 900 billion euros , representing the equivalent of 1.06 to 1.09 percent of gni . policy consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso gave a lukewarm reaction to the luxembourg proposal , saying it was " a step forward in some ways because for the first time we have all the key elements of the package set out for negotiations , " but was not " a proposal capable of moving the union forward over the next few years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.05.2005 early elections : strategy or slow suicide ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder -lrb- right -rrb- are likely to face off in real life soon the chancellor 's call to germans to seal his fate is one of his greatest political gambles yet .
public opinion is behind early elections , but does gerhard schröder really stand any chance of being re-elected ? opinion polls ahead of sunday 's ballot gave the social democrats , who had ruled in germany 's largest federal state of north rhine-westphalia for 39 years , little hope of holding onto the reins of power . but even in the face of that bitter expectation , politicians and public alike were nothing if not unprepared for gerhard schröder 's announcement . bildunterschrift : schröder on monday his political ambush is viewed as a scrambling attempt to cling to what power he has left by catching his opponents off-guard .
but analysts are predicting a foregone conclusion in favor of the conservative cdu .
the loss of the spd stronghold was a clear statement to the government in berlin that the country is prepared to invest more faith in the opposition than in the current leadership . cabinet stays as is although the clarity of the message moved the chancellor to plead the case of a premature poll , it did not prompt him to consider passing the gauntlet to anyone else .
just hours after the election defeat , schröder said he would not reshuffle his cabinet before leading the party , which voted unanimously in favor of early elections , to the fall campaign . and when he bangs the drum for his red-green coalition later this year , his most likely challenger will be germany 's first female chancellor candidate , christian democrat angela merkel . roland koch , state premier of hesse , said it " goes without saying " that angela merkel will be the elected cdu candidate . " i do n't know anyone in the party who is of a different opinion , " he added . bildunterschrift : angela merkel although merkel has not been officially elected , the decision is expected when the cdu and csu sister party executive boards meet next monday . other cdu members said they shared koch 's optimism .
christian wulff , the state premier of lower saxony , said he " would be surprised if merkel were not elected as the party 's chancellor candidate . " and speaking on germany 's zdf public broadcaster , cdu general secretary volker kauder said the " message of the north rhine-westphalia election results was that the union would win with angela merkel . " a one-woman show or a coalition ? but what would await germany under its first ever woman leader ?
the conservatives have some way to go to flesh out their policies , and after schröder 's surprise announcement yesterday , they have less time to get their agenda in order . another question on the country 's lips is whether the conservative cdu / csu would rule alone or whether they would form a coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle the neoliberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , led by guido westerwelle , on monday said they would join forces with the conservatives in a coalition should they win the election . welcomed all round schröder 's announcement has been very widely accepted with open arms .
green party coalition partners see it as a chance to start a new offensive .
reinhard bütikofer , the party 's co-chairman , spoke to german public television zdf about the advantages of early elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bütikofer -lrb- right -rrb- and greens co-chairwoman claudia roth " the cdu will no longer be able to use its strategy of blocking everything and simultaneously complaining that there is no progress , " he said . in an interview with the sächsische zeitung , environment minister jürgen trittin said he was certain that the green party would fight the election campaign with joschka fischer at the helm .
he said he thought the coalition stood a good chance of being re-elected in a federal ballot . in a flash poll conducted on the back of sunday 's election debacle , 70 percent of those asked said they thought that a fresh ballot this year would be more beneficial to the opposition than the ruling coalition .
and 54 percent said getting rid of the devil they know could be the answer to heaving germany out of its current misery . election on sept .
18 ? the latest date for a general election would be sept .
18 as schröder will present a motion of confidence in his government to parliament on july 1 , officials said on monday . the leader of schröder 's social democratic party , franz münterfering , said that july 1 was the last sitting of the bundestag , or lower house of parliament , before the summer recess . if the motion of confidence is rejected , german president horst köhler then has 21 days in which to dissolve parliament .
the general election must take place within 60 days of the dissolution of parliament . an election in september would be 12 months ahead of the scheduled date of september 2006 . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections in germany leaders of all german mainstream parties are meeting today to discuss the ramifications of early national elections this fall after the ruling social democrats suffered a blow in crucial state elections sunday .

the new aid targets are part of an agenda being discussed by european union foreign ministers in brussels on monday and tuesday . the news that germany and italy , two of britain 's european allies in the g8 , are resisting calls to contribute to the new targets has put the brakes on blair 's plan to secure an historic deal for africa before his expected stepping-down sometime in this his third and touted final term in office . the revelation that the two european forces are unwilling to get on board with blair 's project will do nothing to help in the struggle to get the most financially powerful partner , the united states , involved in the new initiative to alleviate africa 's crippling debt and double the continent 's aid package . increased contributions could mean billions for aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new aid targets for 2010 project that each member state would be required to increase the amount paid from 0.33 percent of gross national income to an average of 0.56 percent . this , according to european commission figures , would mean an increase of 20 billion euros on current levels .
anti-poverty campaigners would prefer to see an increase to 0.7 per cent , a figure agreed by european countries in 1970 but still to be introduced . the british government is already facing a tough task to persuade us president george w. bush to sign up and a further sign of division within the european union will do nothing to help the situation , officials fear . according to campaigners for debt relief and the fight against poverty in africa , the german and italian stance in the run-up to the july summit of the eight most influential industrialized countries in gleneagles , scotland , may mean a unique opportunity to help africa is lost for ever . united europe would have power to persuade us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only with a united eu front can blair expect to persuade bush to help africa .
if europe can deliver on an improved aid deal , the prime minister will command the political and moral authority to pressure less-than-convinced g8 countries - namely the us , canada and japan - that the initiative can work .
blair has a powerful ally in french president jacques chirac and has been boosted by the support of the russian federation . but the major stumbling block to the united european effort appears to be of berlin origin .

the new aid targets are part of an agenda being discussed by european union foreign ministers in brussels on monday and tuesday . the news that germany and italy , two of britain 's european allies in the g8 , are resisting calls to contribute to the new targets has put the brakes on blair 's plan to secure an historic deal for africa before his expected stepping-down sometime in this his third and touted final term in office . the revelation that the two european forces are unwilling to get on board with blair 's project will do nothing to help in the struggle to get the most financially powerful partner , the united states , involved in the new initiative to alleviate africa 's crippling debt and double the continent 's aid package . increased contributions could mean billions for aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new aid targets for 2010 project that each member state would be required to increase the amount paid from 0.33 percent of gross national income to an average of 0.56 percent . this , according to european commission figures , would mean an increase of 20 billion euros on current levels .
anti-poverty campaigners would prefer to see an increase to 0.7 per cent , a figure agreed by european countries in 1970 but still to be introduced . the british government is already facing a tough task to persuade us president george w. bush to sign up and a further sign of division within the european union will do nothing to help the situation , officials fear . according to campaigners for debt relief and the fight against poverty in africa , the german and italian stance in the run-up to the july summit of the eight most influential industrialized countries in gleneagles , scotland , may mean a unique opportunity to help africa is lost for ever . united europe would have power to persuade us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only with a united eu front can blair expect to persuade bush to help africa .
if europe can deliver on an improved aid deal , the prime minister will command the political and moral authority to pressure less-than-convinced g8 countries - namely the us , canada and japan - that the initiative can work .
blair has a powerful ally in french president jacques chirac and has been boosted by the support of the russian federation . but the major stumbling block to the united european effort appears to be of berlin origin .

the new aid targets are part of an agenda being discussed by european union foreign ministers in brussels on monday and tuesday . the news that germany and italy , two of britain 's european allies in the g8 , are resisting calls to contribute to the new targets has put the brakes on blair 's plan to secure an historic deal for africa before his expected stepping-down sometime in this his third and touted final term in office . the revelation that the two european forces are unwilling to get on board with blair 's project will do nothing to help in the struggle to get the most financially powerful partner , the united states , involved in the new initiative to alleviate africa 's crippling debt and double the continent 's aid package . increased contributions could mean billions for aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new aid targets for 2010 project that each member state would be required to increase the amount paid from 0.33 percent of gross national income to an average of 0.56 percent . this , according to european commission figures , would mean an increase of 20 billion euros on current levels .
anti-poverty campaigners would prefer to see an increase to 0.7 per cent , a figure agreed by european countries in 1970 but still to be introduced . the british government is already facing a tough task to persuade us president george w. bush to sign up and a further sign of division within the european union will do nothing to help the situation , officials fear . according to campaigners for debt relief and the fight against poverty in africa , the german and italian stance in the run-up to the july summit of the eight most influential industrialized countries in gleneagles , scotland , may mean a unique opportunity to help africa is lost for ever . united europe would have power to persuade us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only with a united eu front can blair expect to persuade bush to help africa .
if europe can deliver on an improved aid deal , the prime minister will command the political and moral authority to pressure less-than-convinced g8 countries - namely the us , canada and japan - that the initiative can work .
blair has a powerful ally in french president jacques chirac and has been boosted by the support of the russian federation . but the major stumbling block to the united european effort appears to be of berlin origin .
observers believe that italy might be climbing down from threats to also block a deal and growing pressure may sway the decision before the summit in july . domestic woes may spell disaster for africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , germany claims it is currently more preoccupied with domestic economic problems to expend much energy and cash in blair 's project for africa . " if germany and the others block the deal , hundreds of millions of poor women , children and men will pay the price , " anna collins , eu policy adviser at oxfam , told the observer .

"
new elections , the paper said , represent " a gamble on power .
the social democrats saw the disaster coming , they were ready for it and they tried to weather it .
but it was far greater than expected , and the psychological and political repercussions for the red-green coalition government only began to emerge as the results were revealed on the television screens .
but as long as there can be an election , there can be hope - even if it is hope for a miracle . " the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote that " after this tectonic shift , schröder has little choice but to make a virtue of necessity , if he wants to avoid a crushing defeat in the next bundestag elections .
the box of tricks he 's been using until now is more or less empty .
the fact that schröder missed his chance to secure his position against the worst consequences of losing his majority in the bundesrat with a reform of the federal system has come back to haunt him .
if the government now tried renegotiating in order to win back some room to maneuver , it would inevitably be in a worse position than it was in december .
schröder would have to swallow a bitter pill : a change of coalition , resignation , new elections . "
schröder 's move after sunday 's devastating loss in germany 's most populous state was " an admission of defeat " , said the financial times .
" the scale of the spd 's defeat reflected popular resentment at mr schröder 's economic policy - viewed as far too business-friendly - and his cuts to the country 's traditionally generous welfare state .
with many in the spd demanding a shift to the left in a bid to win back core voters , mr schröder could face a bruising battle with his grassroots as he draws up the party 's election platform .
-lrb- a general election in four months -rrb- could mean the resumption of economic reforms as soon as the autumn - either by a freshly legitimized mr schröder or by a conservative-led government .
it would also dispel fears that the nation could be doomed to spend the next 16 months in a paralysing pre-election limbo . "
the center-left guardian noted that calling early elections was not accepted practice in germany and quoted a social democrat , furious at the chancellor 's decision , calling it " political suicide . "
schröder 's chances of winning a third term as chancellor appear bleak , commented the daily .
" while it is too early to write him off entirely , germany appears to be heading for another period of center-right government , and its first ever woman chancellor - the christian democrats ' leader , angela merkel .
before last night 's disaster , mr schröder was facing growing pressure to dump some of his controversial reforms to the country 's social welfare system .
instead of changing course , he appears to be trying to regain the initiative by going to the polls . "
the center-right times said a " humbled " schröder had taken a " panicked decision , " which clearly shows how deeply the defeat has hurt the government .
analysts quoted by the paper said the election might pave the way " for a grand coalition between the christian democrats and the social democrats in some form of broad cross-party reforming alliance .
it will paralyze germany , the world 's third-largest economy , unless schröder can win a new mandate for his unpopular program to overhaul its stagnant economy and lumbering welfare state .

" if it is not satisfied , the commission will activate procedures for imposing daily fines " on the group , he added . in march 2004 , the commission , which polices antitrust issues in the european union , fined the software group a record 497 million euros -lrb- $ 623 million -rrb- for abusing its dominant market position . the commission also called on microsoft to market a version of its leading operating system windows without bundling it to its software media player and required the company to divulge information about its product operating system needed by manufacturers of competing products . commission " unsatisfied " the commission has also called for an independent " monitoring trustee " to be named to make sure that microsoft applies the ruling correctly . despite " regular contacts " between brussels and the group , todd said the commission was unsatisfied on all of its demands . under eu rules , a company that fails to comply with a commission competition ruling could in theory be fined up to five percent of its daily global turnover per day for each day the ruling is not respected . the commission has never before inflicted such harsh punishment on a company that did not bow to its will . playing down its defiance , a microsoft spokesman in brussels said : " we continue to work out with the commission towards an agreement on full compliance with the decision .

she may have no qualms about germany 's catastrophic capitulation at the end of world war ii , but neither she nor her husband was appalled by efforts to humanize evil . " the germans deserved what happened to them , " male said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz as hitler swiss actor bruno ganz 's brilliant warts-and-all portrayal shows hitler in previously unimaginable scenes : charming his secretaries , sharing a passionate kiss with eva braun , frothing at the mouth over the latest reports of the encroaching red army , spilling sauce at dinner down his steel-gray uniform . " the film does n't show hitler in such a human light , " male said .
" the environment around him is humanized by children , the dog and women , but not hitler himself .
he was completely indifferent to his people suffering the allied bombings . " the wider tragedy accepted by some viewers raviv , a 30-year-old social worker , had the same reaction . " what happened to them was deserved , but what a tragedy , " he said .
although he was born in israel , his family comes from austria - annexed to hitler 's third reich in 1938 - and the personal resonance also hit home . " one of my grannies was the only one in the family to survive , " he added .
" although i certainly always felt a victim , this film also made me see the germans as victims .
i felt that too , when i went to berlin . " press divided on human portrayal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the press , as anywhere else , there are those who laud its merits and those deeply critical of director oliver hirschbiegel 's -lrb- photo -rrb- portrayal of the nazi führer . " i 'm not recommending this film to holocaust survivors , but it should be compulsory for everyone else , " wrote avner hopstein in yediot aharonot tabloid .
" it teaches us that even sensitive human beings can become execrable killers . " in the same newspaper , yehuda steve complained about the film 's technical flaws that left hitler less of a human being and " more of a museum wax work . " public response led to realse of film in israel a tel aviv cinema , lev , was initially reluctant to show the film , aware that the intense debate it sparked in europe may prove just too sensitive in israel . to decide , it screened a private viewing to a test audience , 91 percent of which agreed the film should be aired nationwide . " this was a very specific , short and transient time in history , but the film does not glorify hitler as some people said , " said brazilian jewish emigre noah milstein , 66 .

" why does nobody like us anymore ? " it asked in its monday edition .
" we have no friends . " there may be little genuine substance to the claim , but perhaps germany and its gracia have some grounds to feel the throb of a disjointed nose .
in fact if , as the paper suggests , the depth of euro friendship is indeed measured by the number of points awarded on contest night , then germany has but two - monaco and moldavia - and not very good ones at that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " even the granny from moldavia did better than us , " said the paper two points from each and a pathetic 24th-place defeat triggered a tirade of " is this all the thanks we get " comments from germany 's boulevard press . " we pay for everyone , will soon even be paying for rumania too , but even they give us ' zero points . '
welcome to europe , " the paper said . and as the rant continued , it asked " what about spain which gets our holiday money ?
or poland , whose workers earn their wages from us ?
or turkey , whose kebabs we consume ?
or england , which we allow to win the battle for the sun-loungers around the holiday pool ? " it must be hard to be so generous , and even more so to maintain such levels of graciousness .

" i deem it necessary to seek majority support for continued social and economic reforms , " the german chancellor said on sunday evening .
" i see it as my responsibility and duty to persuade the federal president to call early elections at the national level as quickly as possible , realistically by autumn 2005 . " strategic maneuver bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder as he made the announcement on sunday the chancellor 's announcement came as a surprise to both his friends and foes . and with voters still reeling from schröder 's much-loathed incisions into the generous state welfare system , this call for an early ballot is nothing short of a gamble for both the chancellor and his party . record high unemployment rates have gradually been eating away at voter confidence in the spd-green coalition .
dieter wiefelspütz , the party 's interior affairs spokesman , said that the chancellor has to find out as quickly as possible whether his reform course still has the backing of the population at national level .
he added that calling for early elections is the logical consequence . " i think this is an interesting move to avoid political stagnation in the country , " he said .
" i must say the announcement came as a big surprise to me .
we 'll have thrilling weeks and months ahead of us . " strategic move but under the german constitution , the chancellor can not simply call fresh elections .
schröder will have to hold a vote of confidence in the national parliament and have his followers turn him down deliberately in order to pave the way for early elections . the president , horst köhler then has 21 days to decide whether or not to dissolve parliament , but constitutional experts doubt the legality of this step . should his call for early elections , however , be heeded , schröder would use the coming months to sharpen the profile of his party and convince the german people that the opposition christian democrats have even more painful reforms up their sleeves , and have no regard for workers ' rights . there is widespread agreement among germans that early elections in may would help to get the country out of the doldrums . industry leaders emphasize that germany can not afford to continue doing nothing until the scheduled date for a national poll at the end of 2006 . schröder versus merkel ? if fresh elections are set for the autumn , schröder will run as the spd 's candidate just weeks after having been given a vote of no confidence in the bundestag . bildunterschrift : angela merkel is schröder 's most likely challenger at the moment , success at national level seems unlikely for the chancellor and his crew , which is lacking cohesion . for the opposition christian democrats , the task ahead is somewhat easier . cdu leader angela merkel , who is likely to challenge schröder in the general election in a bid to become germany 's first woman leader , described sunday 's north rhine-westphalia as a " sensational result . " " the voters ... have shown hope in us and in the future state leader jürgen rüttgers because the problems are so great and they want us to shape a policy that will bring down unemployment , " merkel said . she welcomed the possibility of an early election .

"
new elections , the paper said , represent " a gamble on power .
the social democrats saw the disaster coming , they were ready for it and they tried to weather it .
but it was far greater than expected , and the psychological and political repercussions for the red-green coalition government only began to emerge as the results were revealed on the television screens .
but as long as there can be an election , there can be hope - even if it is hope for a miracle . " the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote that " after this tectonic shift , schröder has little choice but to make a virtue of necessity , if he wants to avoid a crushing defeat in the next bundestag elections .
the box of tricks he 's been using until now is more or less empty .
the fact that schröder missed his chance to secure his position against the worst consequences of losing his majority in the bundesrat with a reform of the federal system has come back to haunt him .
if the government now tried renegotiating in order to win back some room to maneuver , it would inevitably be in a worse position than it was in december .
schröder would have to swallow a bitter pill : a change of coalition , resignation , new elections . "
schröder 's move after sunday 's devastating loss in germany 's most populous state was " an admission of defeat " , said the financial times .
" the scale of the spd 's defeat reflected popular resentment at mr schröder 's economic policy - viewed as far too business-friendly - and his cuts to the country 's traditionally generous welfare state .
with many in the spd demanding a shift to the left in a bid to win back core voters , mr schröder could face a bruising battle with his grassroots as he draws up the party 's election platform .
-lrb- a general election in four months -rrb- could mean the resumption of economic reforms as soon as the autumn - either by a freshly legitimized mr schröder or by a conservative-led government .
it would also dispel fears that the nation could be doomed to spend the next 16 months in a paralysing pre-election limbo . "
the center-left guardian noted that calling early elections was not accepted practice in germany and quoted a social democrat , furious at the chancellor 's decision , calling it " political suicide . "
schröder 's chances of winning a third term as chancellor appear bleak , commented the daily .
" while it is too early to write him off entirely , germany appears to be heading for another period of center-right government , and its first ever woman chancellor - the christian democrats ' leader , angela merkel .
before last night 's disaster , mr schröder was facing growing pressure to dump some of his controversial reforms to the country 's social welfare system .
instead of changing course , he appears to be trying to regain the initiative by going to the polls . "
the center-right times said a " humbled " schröder had taken a " panicked decision , " which clearly shows how deeply the defeat has hurt the government .
analysts quoted by the paper said the election might pave the way " for a grand coalition between the christian democrats and the social democrats in some form of broad cross-party reforming alliance .
it will paralyze germany , the world 's third-largest economy , unless schröder can win a new mandate for his unpopular program to overhaul its stagnant economy and lumbering welfare state .
on yesterday ’ s showing , his chances are slight .
his popular mandate is melting by the day and left-wingers within his party are demanding that he perform a u-turn .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.05.2005 germany 's slaves to globalization großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant laborers work in the meat industry for a pittance against a backdrop of stubborn unemployment figures and wage-dumping concerns , a recent study has revealed that some 15,000 people in germany can be described as modern-day slaves . most germans fondly imagine that forced labor is a problem restricted to developing nations .
but it also happens on their doorstep .
according to the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- study " human trafficking and exploitation in germany , " 360,000 of the 12.3 million people worldwide categorized as modern slaves live in industrialized countries , and an estimated 15,000 of them in germany - a country that has no fixed minimum wage . the ilo is now stepping up pressure for a global alliance to improve laws and raise awareness of what it calls a " hidden " issue . defining modern slavery " the term ' forced labor ' refers to a situation in which a person is being exploited against their will - forced to work under conditions they do not voluntarily accept , " explained norbert cyrus , author of the report .
it depicts the plight of poor or powerless victims , cowed by intimidation and sometimes even violence .
in germany 's worst cases , migrants are housed in basic , unhygienic accommodation with twenty people per room , working 80-hour weeks for negligible wages they have to wait months for - if they 're paid at all . globally , profits amassed on the back on forced labor amount to $ 32 billion -lrb- 25 billion euros -rrb- a year , 50 percent of which is pocketed in the western industrialized nations . in germany , two-thirds of this workforce are women .
approximately 60 percent of forced labor occurs within the country 's sex industry , with women from countries such as columbia , ghana , thailand and ukraine forced into prostitution after being lured to germany with false promises , then robbed of their papers . identifying the problem , helping the victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the coordination center against female trafficking -lrb- kok -rrb- in potsdam , one way of tackling the problem is to improve police awareness so that more instances of modern slavery are identified .
" during a police raid on a brothel , officers might realize that some of the women are not there voluntarily , but it 's very difficult to recognize such cases , " said kok 's manager .
" police need to be sensitized to these situations with further training options .
then these women can be referred to advice centers , which can provide them with support throughout a court case , if they 're required to give evidence - which is a key aspect of clamping down on the problem , because taking legal action hinges almost entirely on personal testimonies . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fear of reprisals , and , crucially , deportation , is one factor preventing people trapped in a condition of enforced dependency from seeking help .
" a lot of these women are traumatized , and help centers can provide them with protection and social support .
alone , they 're not usually in a position to seek help - they do n't speak the language , they 're not able to make contact with the outside world , " explained tanis from the kok .
as usual , however , " funding for these expert advice centers is facing ongoing cuts and they ca n't keep up with the number of cases they have to deal with . " labor as a commodity but muddying the waters is the fact that - like many foreign prostitutes - not all the people working in conditions that amount to modern slavery necessarily feel the need to escape .
" they do n't always see themselves as victims , " said tanis .
" they think they 're making money they can save or send home . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other industries where the problem exists include meatpacking , construction , agriculture , gastronomy , and the textile industry - although germany has been spared the latter 's notorious sweatshops , unlike the uk and france .
spurious agencies across eastern europe , for example , recruit workers eager to earn more in germany than they can at home .
but the picture painted of what awaits them bears little to resemblance to the harsh reality they actually encounter . norbert cyrus explained that many submit to their situation in the belief that any job is better than no job .
" hope of improvement and change keeps them going , " he said .
" another reason these people accept inhumane working conditions is because they feel they lack any alternative .
they end up feeling very fatalistic about their situation , so one thing that needs to change is their willingness to become more confrontational towards employers who are failing to implement prescribed standards . " fair globalization in germany , the meatpacking business in particular is riddled with what is essentially slave labor , on account of cut-throat price wars among germany 's discount supermarkets and a highly competitive , saturated market .
in the last year , some 26,000 jobs have been lost in the industry , with workers from hungary , poland , romania and slovakia picking up the slack for as little as two euros an hour . " a billion euro business -lrb- within the meatpacking industry -rrb- with mafia-like structures , salary dumping and modern slavery has developed , " said matthias brümmer from the ngg trade union in an interview with a local newspaper . but cyrus was quick to stress that eu enlargement is not the root of the problem .
referring to the need for " fair globalization , " he underlined the challenge of lifting restrictions while upholding workers ' rights .
" the problem is not the eu 's free circulation of services , but maintaining standards of fairness within that framework . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the statistics tell us that we need better protection for victims , " said cyrus .
" we need to improve their legal position , we need to inform them about their rights . "
police identify some 1000 victims of human trafficking a year .
" but often , these cases are simply treated as law-breakers , " he observed .
the ilo wants to see breaches of residency permits categorized as a misdemeanor rather than a criminal offense . " people do n't have to be victims of forced labor , " said cyrus .

according to the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- study " human trafficking and exploitation in germany , " 360,000 of the 12.3 million people worldwide categorized as modern slaves live in industrialized countries , and an estimated 15,000 of them in germany - a country that has no fixed minimum wage . the ilo is now stepping up pressure for a global alliance to improve laws and raise awareness of what it calls a " hidden " issue . defining modern slavery " the term ' forced labor ' refers to a situation in which a person is being exploited against their will - forced to work under conditions they do not voluntarily accept , " explained norbert cyrus , author of the report .
it depicts the plight of poor or powerless victims , cowed by intimidation and sometimes even violence .
in germany 's worst cases , migrants are housed in basic , unhygienic accommodation with twenty people per room , working 80-hour weeks for negligible wages they have to wait months for - if they 're paid at all . globally , profits amassed on the back on forced labor amount to $ 32 billion -lrb- 25 billion euros -rrb- a year , 50 percent of which is pocketed in the western industrialized nations . in germany , two-thirds of this workforce are women .
approximately 60 percent of forced labor occurs within the country 's sex industry , with women from countries such as columbia , ghana , thailand and ukraine forced into prostitution after being lured to germany with false promises , then robbed of their papers . identifying the problem , helping the victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the coordination center against female trafficking -lrb- kok -rrb- in potsdam , one way of tackling the problem is to improve police awareness so that more instances of modern slavery are identified .
" during a police raid on a brothel , officers might realize that some of the women are not there voluntarily , but it 's very difficult to recognize such cases , " said kok 's manager .
" police need to be sensitized to these situations with further training options .
then these women can be referred to advice centers , which can provide them with support throughout a court case , if they 're required to give evidence - which is a key aspect of clamping down on the problem , because taking legal action hinges almost entirely on personal testimonies . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fear of reprisals , and , crucially , deportation , is one factor preventing people trapped in a condition of enforced dependency from seeking help .
" a lot of these women are traumatized , and help centers can provide them with protection and social support .
alone , they 're not usually in a position to seek help - they do n't speak the language , they 're not able to make contact with the outside world , " explained tanis from the kok .
as usual , however , " funding for these expert advice centers is facing ongoing cuts and they ca n't keep up with the number of cases they have to deal with . " labor as a commodity but muddying the waters is the fact that - like many foreign prostitutes - not all the people working in conditions that amount to modern slavery necessarily feel the need to escape .
" they do n't always see themselves as victims , " said tanis .
" they think they 're making money they can save or send home . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other industries where the problem exists include meatpacking , construction , agriculture , gastronomy , and the textile industry - although germany has been spared the latter 's notorious sweatshops , unlike the uk and france .
spurious agencies across eastern europe , for example , recruit workers eager to earn more in germany than they can at home .
but the picture painted of what awaits them bears little to resemblance to the harsh reality they actually encounter . norbert cyrus explained that many submit to their situation in the belief that any job is better than no job .
" hope of improvement and change keeps them going , " he said .
" another reason these people accept inhumane working conditions is because they feel they lack any alternative .
they end up feeling very fatalistic about their situation , so one thing that needs to change is their willingness to become more confrontational towards employers who are failing to implement prescribed standards . " fair globalization in germany , the meatpacking business in particular is riddled with what is essentially slave labor , on account of cut-throat price wars among germany 's discount supermarkets and a highly competitive , saturated market .
in the last year , some 26,000 jobs have been lost in the industry , with workers from hungary , poland , romania and slovakia picking up the slack for as little as two euros an hour . " a billion euro business -lrb- within the meatpacking industry -rrb- with mafia-like structures , salary dumping and modern slavery has developed , " said matthias brümmer from the ngg trade union in an interview with a local newspaper . but cyrus was quick to stress that eu enlargement is not the root of the problem .
referring to the need for " fair globalization , " he underlined the challenge of lifting restrictions while upholding workers ' rights .
" the problem is not the eu 's free circulation of services , but maintaining standards of fairness within that framework . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the statistics tell us that we need better protection for victims , " said cyrus .

but analysts say tackling unemployment and slow economic growth will be a tough ride for the opposition . a day after the crushing defeat of chancellor gerhard schroeder 's social democrat spd party in key regional elections in the state of north rhine-westphalia , the german stock market was in a cautiously optimistic mood , with the blue-chip dax 30 index showing a gain of 37.46 points or 0.86 percent at 4,398.14 points . investors were relieved that , following the spd 's landslide defeat in its former stronghold , schröder wanted to hold the next general election this fall , a year ahead of schedule . analysts say the move will avoid long months of economic and political paralysis as the conservative cdu / csu and liberal fdp parties block reform spd-green coalition reform initiatives in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat . " without this move , the time between now and fall 2006 would simply have been filled with empty political posturing , " said hypovereinsbank economist andreas rees .
he added that the reform process was more likely to be restarted if the opposition were to win the general election , because the christian union and liberal parties already hold the majority in the bundesrat . the prospect of additional reforms - including the further liberalization of the labor markets and a drastic simplification of the tax system - would buoy sentiment on the stock markets . industry applause the automobile industry has also welcomed the prospect of an early election .
" germany needs a strong government , " said the head of the vda auto industry federation , bernd gottschalk .
the decision to bring forward the elections " must be seen as a chance , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has been plaguing germany for years the zdh handworkers ' association agreed .
" any decision that puts an end to the political lethargy and economic stagnation is good , " said zdh chief otto kentzler .
" an early election could be the right step . " during its two terms in power , schröder 's red-green administration has failed to make any inroads into unemployment , currently at a post-war high of around five million , or steer the euro zone 's biggest economy out of the doldrums . merkel 's alternatives the question is whether the conservative opposition under cdu leader angela merkel will be able to handle the economy any better .
hvb economist rees noted that the cdu in north rhine-westphalia had won more by default than on the argument for its own reform programs . ubs economist holger fahrinkrug agreed .
" the conservative parties do n't have an election platform as yet and , like the spd , they also have internal struggles on key policy issues , especially in the fields of social and labor market reforms , " he said . bildunterschrift : angela merkel gernot nerb , chief economist of the influential ifo think tank , also believed that the mere prospect of a change in government would not necessarily lead to a lasting improvement in economic sentiment in germany . concrete progress would have to be made in reforms first , nerb argued .
but banking and stock market professor wolfgang gerke disagreed .
" after the elections , there 's more chance that policies will become more reliable , more calculable , " he said .
" it 's not so important for many companies whether the spd or the cdu is in power .
they just want an end to the endless political manoeuvering and the political blockades . " window of opportunity ? morgan stanley economist elga bartsch said the cdu would have to show it meant business in pressing ahead with reforms if it were to win the election . " it is a regular feature of the german political landscape for the bundesrat to be dominated by the opposition parties after a few years of the new government being in office , " she said .
" an incoming cdu-led government would therefore have to make the most of the window of opportunity to push through reforms while it still enjoys a broad majority in both houses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.05.2005 early elections : strategy or slow suicide ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- left -rrb- and schröder -lrb- right -rrb- are likely to face off in real life soon the chancellor 's call to germans to seal his fate is one of his greatest political gambles yet .
public opinion is behind early elections , but does gerhard schröder really stand any chance of being re-elected ? opinion polls ahead of sunday 's ballot gave the social democrats , who had ruled in germany 's largest federal state of north rhine-westphalia for 39 years , little hope of holding onto the reins of power . but even in the face of that bitter expectation , politicians and public alike were nothing if not unprepared for gerhard schröder 's announcement . bildunterschrift : schröder on monday his political ambush is viewed as a scrambling attempt to cling to what power he has left by catching his opponents off-guard .
but analysts are predicting a foregone conclusion in favor of the conservative cdu .
the loss of the spd stronghold was a clear statement to the government in berlin that the country is prepared to invest more faith in the opposition than in the current leadership . cabinet stays as is although the clarity of the message moved the chancellor to plead the case of a premature poll , it did not prompt him to consider passing the gauntlet to anyone else .
just hours after the election defeat , schröder said he would not reshuffle his cabinet before leading the party , which voted unanimously in favor of early elections , to the fall campaign . and when he bangs the drum for his red-green coalition later this year , his most likely challenger will be germany 's first female chancellor candidate , christian democrat angela merkel . roland koch , state premier of hesse , said it " goes without saying " that angela merkel will be the elected cdu candidate . " i do n't know anyone in the party who is of a different opinion , " he added . bildunterschrift : angela merkel although merkel has not been officially elected , the decision is expected when the cdu and csu sister party executive boards meet next monday . other cdu members said they shared koch 's optimism .
christian wulff , the state premier of lower saxony , said he " would be surprised if merkel were not elected as the party 's chancellor candidate . " and speaking on germany 's zdf public broadcaster , cdu general secretary volker kauder said the " message of the north rhine-westphalia election results was that the union would win with angela merkel . " a one-woman show or a coalition ? but what would await germany under its first ever woman leader ?
the conservatives have some way to go to flesh out their policies , and after schröder 's surprise announcement yesterday , they have less time to get their agenda in order . another question on the country 's lips is whether the conservative cdu / csu would rule alone or whether they would form a coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle the neoliberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , led by guido westerwelle , on monday said they would join forces with the conservatives in a coalition should they win the election . welcomed all round schröder 's announcement has been very widely accepted with open arms .
green party coalition partners see it as a chance to start a new offensive .
reinhard bütikofer , the party 's co-chairman , spoke to german public television zdf about the advantages of early elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bütikofer -lrb- right -rrb- and greens co-chairwoman claudia roth " the cdu will no longer be able to use its strategy of blocking everything and simultaneously complaining that there is no progress , " he said . in an interview with the sächsische zeitung , environment minister jürgen trittin said he was certain that the green party would fight the election campaign with joschka fischer at the helm .
he said he thought the coalition stood a good chance of being re-elected in a federal ballot . in a flash poll conducted on the back of sunday 's election debacle , 70 percent of those asked said they thought that a fresh ballot this year would be more beneficial to the opposition than the ruling coalition .
and 54 percent said getting rid of the devil they know could be the answer to heaving germany out of its current misery . election on sept .
18 ? the latest date for a general election would be sept .
18 as schröder will present a motion of confidence in his government to parliament on july 1 , officials said on monday . the leader of schröder 's social democratic party , franz münterfering , said that july 1 was the last sitting of the bundestag , or lower house of parliament , before the summer recess . if the motion of confidence is rejected , german president horst köhler then has 21 days in which to dissolve parliament .
the general election must take place within 60 days of the dissolution of parliament . an election in september would be 12 months ahead of the scheduled date of september 2006 . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections in germany leaders of all german mainstream parties are meeting today to discuss the ramifications of early national elections this fall after the ruling social democrats suffered a blow in crucial state elections sunday .

the bundestag vote then has to take place 48 hours after schröder puts forward what 's known as the vote of confidence , set to take place on july 1 .
if the chancellor loses this vote , new elections can take place earlier than planned , in accordance with article 68 of the constitution , which states that " if a motion of a federal chancellor for a vote of confidence is not assented to by the majority of the members of the bundestag , the federal president may , upon the proposal of the federal chancellor , dissolve the bundestag within twenty-one days .
the right to dissolve shall lapse as soon as the bundestag with the majority of its members elects another federal chancellor . "
presidential discretion the operative word here is " may . "
the president can act upon the chancellor 's proposal to dissolve the bundestag , but he does n't have to .
it 's up to him to decide whether the chancellor 's decision is in keeping with constitutional principles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for the time being , president horst köhler -lrb- photo -rrb- has remained silent on the issue .
according to his spokesperson , he was carefully considering the matter before meeting with schröder on monday .
a further option available to berlin is the constructive vote of no confidence laid out in article 67 , which states that " the bundestag can express its lack of confidence in the federal chancellor only by electing a successor with the majority of its members and by requesting the federal president to dismiss the federal chancellor .
the federal president must comply with the request and appoint the person elected . "
this , however , presupposes a candidate for office is already waiting in the wings , who can depend on the support of a bundestag majority .
the constructive no-confidence vote makes it harder to remove a chancellor because opponents of the chancellor not only must disagree with his or her governing but also must agree on a replacement historical precedents early elections in germany are highly unusual .
the first time they took place was in 1972 , initiated by chancellor willy brandt .
he forced the premature dissolution of the bundestag by president gustav heinemann in order to secure a stable majority in the ensuing election , which he won with an impressive relative majority of nearly 45 percent .

she may have no qualms about germany 's catastrophic capitulation at the end of world war ii , but neither she nor her husband was appalled by efforts to humanize evil . " the germans deserved what happened to them , " male said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz as hitler swiss actor bruno ganz 's brilliant warts-and-all portrayal shows hitler in previously unimaginable scenes : charming his secretaries , sharing a passionate kiss with eva braun , frothing at the mouth over the latest reports of the encroaching red army , spilling sauce at dinner down his steel-gray uniform . " the film does n't show hitler in such a human light , " male said .
" the environment around him is humanized by children , the dog and women , but not hitler himself .
he was completely indifferent to his people suffering the allied bombings . " the wider tragedy accepted by some viewers raviv , a 30-year-old social worker , had the same reaction . " what happened to them was deserved , but what a tragedy , " he said .
although he was born in israel , his family comes from austria - annexed to hitler 's third reich in 1938 - and the personal resonance also hit home . " one of my grannies was the only one in the family to survive , " he added .
" although i certainly always felt a victim , this film also made me see the germans as victims .
i felt that too , when i went to berlin . " press divided on human portrayal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the press , as anywhere else , there are those who laud its merits and those deeply critical of director oliver hirschbiegel 's -lrb- photo -rrb- portrayal of the nazi führer . " i 'm not recommending this film to holocaust survivors , but it should be compulsory for everyone else , " wrote avner hopstein in yediot aharonot tabloid .

but it also happens on their doorstep .
according to the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- study " human trafficking and exploitation in germany , " 360,000 of the 12.3 million people worldwide categorized as modern slaves live in industrialized countries , and an estimated 15,000 of them in germany - a country that has no fixed minimum wage . the ilo is now stepping up pressure for a global alliance to improve laws and raise awareness of what it calls a " hidden " issue . defining modern slavery " the term ' forced labor ' refers to a situation in which a person is being exploited against their will - forced to work under conditions they do not voluntarily accept , " explained norbert cyrus , author of the report .
it depicts the plight of poor or powerless victims , cowed by intimidation and sometimes even violence .
in germany 's worst cases , migrants are housed in basic , unhygienic accommodation with twenty people per room , working 80-hour weeks for negligible wages they have to wait months for - if they 're paid at all . globally , profits amassed on the back on forced labor amount to $ 32 billion -lrb- 25 billion euros -rrb- a year , 50 percent of which is pocketed in the western industrialized nations . in germany , two-thirds of this workforce are women .
approximately 60 percent of forced labor occurs within the country 's sex industry , with women from countries such as columbia , ghana , thailand and ukraine forced into prostitution after being lured to germany with false promises , then robbed of their papers . identifying the problem , helping the victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the coordination center against female trafficking -lrb- kok -rrb- in potsdam , one way of tackling the problem is to improve police awareness so that more instances of modern slavery are identified .
" during a police raid on a brothel , officers might realize that some of the women are not there voluntarily , but it 's very difficult to recognize such cases , " said kok 's manager .
" police need to be sensitized to these situations with further training options .
then these women can be referred to advice centers , which can provide them with support throughout a court case , if they 're required to give evidence - which is a key aspect of clamping down on the problem , because taking legal action hinges almost entirely on personal testimonies . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fear of reprisals , and , crucially , deportation , is one factor preventing people trapped in a condition of enforced dependency from seeking help .
" a lot of these women are traumatized , and help centers can provide them with protection and social support .
alone , they 're not usually in a position to seek help - they do n't speak the language , they 're not able to make contact with the outside world , " explained tanis from the kok .
as usual , however , " funding for these expert advice centers is facing ongoing cuts and they ca n't keep up with the number of cases they have to deal with . " labor as a commodity but muddying the waters is the fact that - like many foreign prostitutes - not all the people working in conditions that amount to modern slavery necessarily feel the need to escape .
" they do n't always see themselves as victims , " said tanis .
" they think they 're making money they can save or send home . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other industries where the problem exists include meatpacking , construction , agriculture , gastronomy , and the textile industry - although germany has been spared the latter 's notorious sweatshops , unlike the uk and france .
spurious agencies across eastern europe , for example , recruit workers eager to earn more in germany than they can at home .
but the picture painted of what awaits them bears little to resemblance to the harsh reality they actually encounter . norbert cyrus explained that many submit to their situation in the belief that any job is better than no job .
" hope of improvement and change keeps them going , " he said .
" another reason these people accept inhumane working conditions is because they feel they lack any alternative .
they end up feeling very fatalistic about their situation , so one thing that needs to change is their willingness to become more confrontational towards employers who are failing to implement prescribed standards . " fair globalization in germany , the meatpacking business in particular is riddled with what is essentially slave labor , on account of cut-throat price wars among germany 's discount supermarkets and a highly competitive , saturated market .
in the last year , some 26,000 jobs have been lost in the industry , with workers from hungary , poland , romania and slovakia picking up the slack for as little as two euros an hour . " a billion euro business -lrb- within the meatpacking industry -rrb- with mafia-like structures , salary dumping and modern slavery has developed , " said matthias brümmer from the ngg trade union in an interview with a local newspaper . but cyrus was quick to stress that eu enlargement is not the root of the problem .
referring to the need for " fair globalization , " he underlined the challenge of lifting restrictions while upholding workers ' rights .
" the problem is not the eu 's free circulation of services , but maintaining standards of fairness within that framework . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the statistics tell us that we need better protection for victims , " said cyrus .

the bundestag vote then has to take place 48 hours after schröder puts forward what 's known as the vote of confidence , set to take place on july 1 .
if the chancellor loses this vote , new elections can take place earlier than planned , in accordance with article 68 of the constitution , which states that " if a motion of a federal chancellor for a vote of confidence is not assented to by the majority of the members of the bundestag , the federal president may , upon the proposal of the federal chancellor , dissolve the bundestag within twenty-one days .
the right to dissolve shall lapse as soon as the bundestag with the majority of its members elects another federal chancellor . "
presidential discretion the operative word here is " may . "
the president can act upon the chancellor 's proposal to dissolve the bundestag , but he does n't have to .
it 's up to him to decide whether the chancellor 's decision is in keeping with constitutional principles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for the time being , president horst köhler -lrb- photo -rrb- has remained silent on the issue .
according to his spokesperson , he was carefully considering the matter before meeting with schröder on monday .
a further option available to berlin is the constructive vote of no confidence laid out in article 67 , which states that " the bundestag can express its lack of confidence in the federal chancellor only by electing a successor with the majority of its members and by requesting the federal president to dismiss the federal chancellor .
the federal president must comply with the request and appoint the person elected . "
this , however , presupposes a candidate for office is already waiting in the wings , who can depend on the support of a bundestag majority .
the constructive no-confidence vote makes it harder to remove a chancellor because opponents of the chancellor not only must disagree with his or her governing but also must agree on a replacement historical precedents early elections in germany are highly unusual .
the first time they took place was in 1972 , initiated by chancellor willy brandt .
he forced the premature dissolution of the bundestag by president gustav heinemann in order to secure a stable majority in the ensuing election , which he won with an impressive relative majority of nearly 45 percent .

social democrat german chancellor gerhard schroeder linked parliament 's vote on the german deployment in the war against terrorism on friday , nov .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.05.2005 germany 's slaves to globalization großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant laborers work in the meat industry for a pittance against a backdrop of stubborn unemployment figures and wage-dumping concerns , a recent study has revealed that some 15,000 people in germany can be described as modern-day slaves . most germans fondly imagine that forced labor is a problem restricted to developing nations .
but it also happens on their doorstep .
according to the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- study " human trafficking and exploitation in germany , " 360,000 of the 12.3 million people worldwide categorized as modern slaves live in industrialized countries , and an estimated 15,000 of them in germany - a country that has no fixed minimum wage . the ilo is now stepping up pressure for a global alliance to improve laws and raise awareness of what it calls a " hidden " issue . defining modern slavery " the term ' forced labor ' refers to a situation in which a person is being exploited against their will - forced to work under conditions they do not voluntarily accept , " explained norbert cyrus , author of the report .
it depicts the plight of poor or powerless victims , cowed by intimidation and sometimes even violence .
in germany 's worst cases , migrants are housed in basic , unhygienic accommodation with twenty people per room , working 80-hour weeks for negligible wages they have to wait months for - if they 're paid at all . globally , profits amassed on the back on forced labor amount to $ 32 billion -lrb- 25 billion euros -rrb- a year , 50 percent of which is pocketed in the western industrialized nations . in germany , two-thirds of this workforce are women .
approximately 60 percent of forced labor occurs within the country 's sex industry , with women from countries such as columbia , ghana , thailand and ukraine forced into prostitution after being lured to germany with false promises , then robbed of their papers . identifying the problem , helping the victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the coordination center against female trafficking -lrb- kok -rrb- in potsdam , one way of tackling the problem is to improve police awareness so that more instances of modern slavery are identified .
" during a police raid on a brothel , officers might realize that some of the women are not there voluntarily , but it 's very difficult to recognize such cases , " said kok 's manager .
" police need to be sensitized to these situations with further training options .
then these women can be referred to advice centers , which can provide them with support throughout a court case , if they 're required to give evidence - which is a key aspect of clamping down on the problem , because taking legal action hinges almost entirely on personal testimonies . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fear of reprisals , and , crucially , deportation , is one factor preventing people trapped in a condition of enforced dependency from seeking help .
" a lot of these women are traumatized , and help centers can provide them with protection and social support .
alone , they 're not usually in a position to seek help - they do n't speak the language , they 're not able to make contact with the outside world , " explained tanis from the kok .
as usual , however , " funding for these expert advice centers is facing ongoing cuts and they ca n't keep up with the number of cases they have to deal with . " labor as a commodity but muddying the waters is the fact that - like many foreign prostitutes - not all the people working in conditions that amount to modern slavery necessarily feel the need to escape .
" they do n't always see themselves as victims , " said tanis .
" they think they 're making money they can save or send home . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other industries where the problem exists include meatpacking , construction , agriculture , gastronomy , and the textile industry - although germany has been spared the latter 's notorious sweatshops , unlike the uk and france .
spurious agencies across eastern europe , for example , recruit workers eager to earn more in germany than they can at home .
but the picture painted of what awaits them bears little to resemblance to the harsh reality they actually encounter . norbert cyrus explained that many submit to their situation in the belief that any job is better than no job .
" hope of improvement and change keeps them going , " he said .
" another reason these people accept inhumane working conditions is because they feel they lack any alternative .
they end up feeling very fatalistic about their situation , so one thing that needs to change is their willingness to become more confrontational towards employers who are failing to implement prescribed standards . " fair globalization in germany , the meatpacking business in particular is riddled with what is essentially slave labor , on account of cut-throat price wars among germany 's discount supermarkets and a highly competitive , saturated market .
in the last year , some 26,000 jobs have been lost in the industry , with workers from hungary , poland , romania and slovakia picking up the slack for as little as two euros an hour . " a billion euro business -lrb- within the meatpacking industry -rrb- with mafia-like structures , salary dumping and modern slavery has developed , " said matthias brümmer from the ngg trade union in an interview with a local newspaper . but cyrus was quick to stress that eu enlargement is not the root of the problem .
referring to the need for " fair globalization , " he underlined the challenge of lifting restrictions while upholding workers ' rights .
" the problem is not the eu 's free circulation of services , but maintaining standards of fairness within that framework . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the statistics tell us that we need better protection for victims , " said cyrus .
" we need to improve their legal position , we need to inform them about their rights . "
police identify some 1000 victims of human trafficking a year .
" but often , these cases are simply treated as law-breakers , " he observed .
the ilo wants to see breaches of residency permits categorized as a misdemeanor rather than a criminal offense . " people do n't have to be victims of forced labor , " said cyrus .
" they 're made victims of forced labor . " jane paulick , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an expanded union - one year later one year ago , the eu suddenly grew by some 75 million people when 10 nations joined the fold .

she may have no qualms about germany 's catastrophic capitulation at the end of world war ii , but neither she nor her husband was appalled by efforts to humanize evil . " the germans deserved what happened to them , " male said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz as hitler swiss actor bruno ganz 's brilliant warts-and-all portrayal shows hitler in previously unimaginable scenes : charming his secretaries , sharing a passionate kiss with eva braun , frothing at the mouth over the latest reports of the encroaching red army , spilling sauce at dinner down his steel-gray uniform . " the film does n't show hitler in such a human light , " male said .
" the environment around him is humanized by children , the dog and women , but not hitler himself .
he was completely indifferent to his people suffering the allied bombings . " the wider tragedy accepted by some viewers raviv , a 30-year-old social worker , had the same reaction . " what happened to them was deserved , but what a tragedy , " he said .
although he was born in israel , his family comes from austria - annexed to hitler 's third reich in 1938 - and the personal resonance also hit home . " one of my grannies was the only one in the family to survive , " he added .
" although i certainly always felt a victim , this film also made me see the germans as victims .
i felt that too , when i went to berlin . " press divided on human portrayal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the press , as anywhere else , there are those who laud its merits and those deeply critical of director oliver hirschbiegel 's -lrb- photo -rrb- portrayal of the nazi führer . " i 'm not recommending this film to holocaust survivors , but it should be compulsory for everyone else , " wrote avner hopstein in yediot aharonot tabloid .
" it teaches us that even sensitive human beings can become execrable killers . " in the same newspaper , yehuda steve complained about the film 's technical flaws that left hitler less of a human being and " more of a museum wax work . " public response led to realse of film in israel a tel aviv cinema , lev , was initially reluctant to show the film , aware that the intense debate it sparked in europe may prove just too sensitive in israel . to decide , it screened a private viewing to a test audience , 91 percent of which agreed the film should be aired nationwide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.05.2005 press review : schröder 's bitter pill großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : feeling down chancellor gerhard schröder 's decision to call early general elections after his social democrats suffered heavy losses in the key state of north rhine-westphalia was widely seen by the press as a humiliating defeat . according to the süddeutsche zeitung , the chancellor has turned to " desperate measures . "
new elections , the paper said , represent " a gamble on power .
the social democrats saw the disaster coming , they were ready for it and they tried to weather it .
but it was far greater than expected , and the psychological and political repercussions for the red-green coalition government only began to emerge as the results were revealed on the television screens .
but as long as there can be an election , there can be hope - even if it is hope for a miracle . " the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote that " after this tectonic shift , schröder has little choice but to make a virtue of necessity , if he wants to avoid a crushing defeat in the next bundestag elections .
the box of tricks he 's been using until now is more or less empty .
the fact that schröder missed his chance to secure his position against the worst consequences of losing his majority in the bundesrat with a reform of the federal system has come back to haunt him .
if the government now tried renegotiating in order to win back some room to maneuver , it would inevitably be in a worse position than it was in december .
schröder would have to swallow a bitter pill : a change of coalition , resignation , new elections . "
schröder 's move after sunday 's devastating loss in germany 's most populous state was " an admission of defeat " , said the financial times .
" the scale of the spd 's defeat reflected popular resentment at mr schröder 's economic policy - viewed as far too business-friendly - and his cuts to the country 's traditionally generous welfare state .
with many in the spd demanding a shift to the left in a bid to win back core voters , mr schröder could face a bruising battle with his grassroots as he draws up the party 's election platform .
-lrb- a general election in four months -rrb- could mean the resumption of economic reforms as soon as the autumn - either by a freshly legitimized mr schröder or by a conservative-led government .
it would also dispel fears that the nation could be doomed to spend the next 16 months in a paralysing pre-election limbo . "
the center-left guardian noted that calling early elections was not accepted practice in germany and quoted a social democrat , furious at the chancellor 's decision , calling it " political suicide . "
schröder 's chances of winning a third term as chancellor appear bleak , commented the daily .
" while it is too early to write him off entirely , germany appears to be heading for another period of center-right government , and its first ever woman chancellor - the christian democrats ' leader , angela merkel .
before last night 's disaster , mr schröder was facing growing pressure to dump some of his controversial reforms to the country 's social welfare system .
instead of changing course , he appears to be trying to regain the initiative by going to the polls . "
the center-right times said a " humbled " schröder had taken a " panicked decision , " which clearly shows how deeply the defeat has hurt the government .
analysts quoted by the paper said the election might pave the way " for a grand coalition between the christian democrats and the social democrats in some form of broad cross-party reforming alliance .
it will paralyze germany , the world 's third-largest economy , unless schröder can win a new mandate for his unpopular program to overhaul its stagnant economy and lumbering welfare state .
on yesterday ’ s showing , his chances are slight .
his popular mandate is melting by the day and left-wingers within his party are demanding that he perform a u-turn .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.05.2005 germany 's early election affects eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's gamble could have far-reaching consequences for the eu german chancellor gerhard schröder 's call for early federal elections this fall is a high-stakes gamble not only for schröder and his social democrats at home , but for the european union as a whole . in responding to his party 's crippling defeat in its stronghold state of north rhine-westphalia with a call for a fresh ballot , the chancellor has essentially admitted defeat . his social democrat-green government coalition in berlin has long been facing an uphill battle against rampant unemployment , budget deficits , bad schools , and social problems connected to immigration .
such were the primary issues that drove the spd from power in germany 's largest state after 39 years at the helm .
and such are the issues which raise their heads in connection with public opposition to the european constitution which faces key votes in france and the netherlands next week . the bombshell defeat suffered by the social democrats here in germany on sunday could not have come at a worse time for the pro-european camp . what if ... ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is already a large " no " camp waiting to vote in france the consequences could be monumental and pundits everywhere are now asking the " what if " questions : what if this election signals to voters in france and holland that germans , too , do n't want the constitution ?
what if talks on key eu budget issues break down because finance ministers view schröder 's government as a lame duck ?
and what if schröder and his social democrats ultimately lose the early election he hopes to call ? most commentators agree that the election loss in north rhine-westphalia is a strong indicator that schröder 's party will be ousted from office in the next election .
and already , budget talks in brussels have been clouded because of germany 's decision to hold early elections . whether germany will continue to foot such a large portion of eu expenditure is now more uncertain than ever , and the implications of a potential shift in policy extend far beyond berlin . budget issues the eu is currently trying to convince britain to forego its budget rebate , but the prospect of a power switch in germany could sway london to resist the pressure to pay more into eu coffers . the battle lines over the budget are roughly drawn between the eu commission which wants as much money as possible , and the six biggest net contributors - germany , france , britain , the netherlands , sweden and austria - which want to limit the budget .
voters in germany , at least , see too much of their tax money disappearing down black holes in brussels while their own standards of living are diminishing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration is an ongoing issue in europe the commission also wants money to help fund eu eastward expansion .
but this is another sticking point in germany and elsewhere in europe , where voters fear further job losses and increased immigration . a change of government in berlin would be a big victory for the anti-immigration camp . as far as the new european constitution is concerned , if the referendums in france and the netherlands fail to win support for europe , this will almost certainly seal the defeat of schröder and the greens at an early federal election later this year . essentially , if the constitutional referendums fail , voters will be saying that europe must stop where it is and clean up the mess before moving on . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections in germany leaders of all german mainstream parties are meeting today to discuss the ramifications of early national elections this fall after the ruling social democrats suffered a blow in crucial state elections sunday .

she may have no qualms about germany 's catastrophic capitulation at the end of world war ii , but neither she nor her husband was appalled by efforts to humanize evil . " the germans deserved what happened to them , " male said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz as hitler swiss actor bruno ganz 's brilliant warts-and-all portrayal shows hitler in previously unimaginable scenes : charming his secretaries , sharing a passionate kiss with eva braun , frothing at the mouth over the latest reports of the encroaching red army , spilling sauce at dinner down his steel-gray uniform . " the film does n't show hitler in such a human light , " male said .
" the environment around him is humanized by children , the dog and women , but not hitler himself .
he was completely indifferent to his people suffering the allied bombings . " the wider tragedy accepted by some viewers raviv , a 30-year-old social worker , had the same reaction . " what happened to them was deserved , but what a tragedy , " he said .
although he was born in israel , his family comes from austria - annexed to hitler 's third reich in 1938 - and the personal resonance also hit home . " one of my grannies was the only one in the family to survive , " he added .
" although i certainly always felt a victim , this film also made me see the germans as victims .
i felt that too , when i went to berlin . " press divided on human portrayal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the press , as anywhere else , there are those who laud its merits and those deeply critical of director oliver hirschbiegel 's -lrb- photo -rrb- portrayal of the nazi führer .

such were the primary issues that drove the spd from power in germany 's largest state after 39 years at the helm .

and what if schröder and his social democrats ultimately lose the early election he hopes to call ? most commentators agree that the election loss in north rhine-westphalia is a strong indicator that schröder 's party will be ousted from office in the next election .
and already , budget talks in brussels have been clouded because of germany 's decision to hold early elections . whether germany will continue to foot such a large portion of eu expenditure is now more uncertain than ever , and the implications of a potential shift in policy extend far beyond berlin . budget issues the eu is currently trying to convince britain to forego its budget rebate , but the prospect of a power switch in germany could sway london to resist the pressure to pay more into eu coffers . the battle lines over the budget are roughly drawn between the eu commission which wants as much money as possible , and the six biggest net contributors - germany , france , britain , the netherlands , sweden and austria - which want to limit the budget .
voters in germany , at least , see too much of their tax money disappearing down black holes in brussels while their own standards of living are diminishing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration is an ongoing issue in europe the commission also wants money to help fund eu eastward expansion .
but this is another sticking point in germany and elsewhere in europe , where voters fear further job losses and increased immigration . a change of government in berlin would be a big victory for the anti-immigration camp . as far as the new european constitution is concerned , if the referendums in france and the netherlands fail to win support for europe , this will almost certainly seal the defeat of schröder and the greens at an early federal election later this year . essentially , if the constitutional referendums fail , voters will be saying that europe must stop where it is and clean up the mess before moving on . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections in germany leaders of all german mainstream parties are meeting today to discuss the ramifications of early national elections this fall after the ruling social democrats suffered a blow in crucial state elections sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.05.2005 germany , italy block aid for africa initiative großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu will try to set new targets for aid to africa despite opposition germany has been accused along with italy of trying to block britain 's plans to tackle poverty in africa , according to a report published in the british press on sunday . according to the observer newspaper , british prime minister tony blair 's initiative to eradicate debt and poverty on the african continent is in danger due to the refusal of germany and italy to increase aid packages ahead of the vital g8 talks . both the german and italian governments are accused of stone-walling over an extra 21.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 27.4 billion -rrb- in aid , which would alleviate poverty for around 50 percent of the world 's poor , due to the unwillingness of the two countries to back the ambitious upgrade in spending .
the new aid targets are part of an agenda being discussed by european union foreign ministers in brussels on monday and tuesday . the news that germany and italy , two of britain 's european allies in the g8 , are resisting calls to contribute to the new targets has put the brakes on blair 's plan to secure an historic deal for africa before his expected stepping-down sometime in this his third and touted final term in office . the revelation that the two european forces are unwilling to get on board with blair 's project will do nothing to help in the struggle to get the most financially powerful partner , the united states , involved in the new initiative to alleviate africa 's crippling debt and double the continent 's aid package . increased contributions could mean billions for aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new aid targets for 2010 project that each member state would be required to increase the amount paid from 0.33 percent of gross national income to an average of 0.56 percent . this , according to european commission figures , would mean an increase of 20 billion euros on current levels .
anti-poverty campaigners would prefer to see an increase to 0.7 per cent , a figure agreed by european countries in 1970 but still to be introduced . the british government is already facing a tough task to persuade us president george w. bush to sign up and a further sign of division within the european union will do nothing to help the situation , officials fear . according to campaigners for debt relief and the fight against poverty in africa , the german and italian stance in the run-up to the july summit of the eight most influential industrialized countries in gleneagles , scotland , may mean a unique opportunity to help africa is lost for ever . united europe would have power to persuade us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only with a united eu front can blair expect to persuade bush to help africa .
if europe can deliver on an improved aid deal , the prime minister will command the political and moral authority to pressure less-than-convinced g8 countries - namely the us , canada and japan - that the initiative can work .
blair has a powerful ally in french president jacques chirac and has been boosted by the support of the russian federation . but the major stumbling block to the united european effort appears to be of berlin origin .
observers believe that italy might be climbing down from threats to also block a deal and growing pressure may sway the decision before the summit in july . domestic woes may spell disaster for africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , germany claims it is currently more preoccupied with domestic economic problems to expend much energy and cash in blair 's project for africa . " if germany and the others block the deal , hundreds of millions of poor women , children and men will pay the price , " anna collins , eu policy adviser at oxfam , told the observer .
" the eu faces a critical decision this week .

such were the primary issues that drove the spd from power in germany 's largest state after 39 years at the helm .
and such are the issues which raise their heads in connection with public opposition to the european constitution which faces key votes in france and the netherlands next week . the bombshell defeat suffered by the social democrats here in germany on sunday could not have come at a worse time for the pro-european camp . what if ... ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is already a large " no " camp waiting to vote in france the consequences could be monumental and pundits everywhere are now asking the " what if " questions : what if this election signals to voters in france and holland that germans , too , do n't want the constitution ?

the new aid targets are part of an agenda being discussed by european union foreign ministers in brussels on monday and tuesday . the news that germany and italy , two of britain 's european allies in the g8 , are resisting calls to contribute to the new targets has put the brakes on blair 's plan to secure an historic deal for africa before his expected stepping-down sometime in this his third and touted final term in office . the revelation that the two european forces are unwilling to get on board with blair 's project will do nothing to help in the struggle to get the most financially powerful partner , the united states , involved in the new initiative to alleviate africa 's crippling debt and double the continent 's aid package . increased contributions could mean billions for aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new aid targets for 2010 project that each member state would be required to increase the amount paid from 0.33 percent of gross national income to an average of 0.56 percent . this , according to european commission figures , would mean an increase of 20 billion euros on current levels .
anti-poverty campaigners would prefer to see an increase to 0.7 per cent , a figure agreed by european countries in 1970 but still to be introduced . the british government is already facing a tough task to persuade us president george w. bush to sign up and a further sign of division within the european union will do nothing to help the situation , officials fear . according to campaigners for debt relief and the fight against poverty in africa , the german and italian stance in the run-up to the july summit of the eight most influential industrialized countries in gleneagles , scotland , may mean a unique opportunity to help africa is lost for ever . united europe would have power to persuade us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only with a united eu front can blair expect to persuade bush to help africa .
if europe can deliver on an improved aid deal , the prime minister will command the political and moral authority to pressure less-than-convinced g8 countries - namely the us , canada and japan - that the initiative can work .
blair has a powerful ally in french president jacques chirac and has been boosted by the support of the russian federation . but the major stumbling block to the united european effort appears to be of berlin origin .
observers believe that italy might be climbing down from threats to also block a deal and growing pressure may sway the decision before the summit in july . domestic woes may spell disaster for africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , germany claims it is currently more preoccupied with domestic economic problems to expend much energy and cash in blair 's project for africa .

the new aid targets are part of an agenda being discussed by european union foreign ministers in brussels on monday and tuesday . the news that germany and italy , two of britain 's european allies in the g8 , are resisting calls to contribute to the new targets has put the brakes on blair 's plan to secure an historic deal for africa before his expected stepping-down sometime in this his third and touted final term in office . the revelation that the two european forces are unwilling to get on board with blair 's project will do nothing to help in the struggle to get the most financially powerful partner , the united states , involved in the new initiative to alleviate africa 's crippling debt and double the continent 's aid package . increased contributions could mean billions for aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new aid targets for 2010 project that each member state would be required to increase the amount paid from 0.33 percent of gross national income to an average of 0.56 percent . this , according to european commission figures , would mean an increase of 20 billion euros on current levels .
anti-poverty campaigners would prefer to see an increase to 0.7 per cent , a figure agreed by european countries in 1970 but still to be introduced . the british government is already facing a tough task to persuade us president george w. bush to sign up and a further sign of division within the european union will do nothing to help the situation , officials fear . according to campaigners for debt relief and the fight against poverty in africa , the german and italian stance in the run-up to the july summit of the eight most influential industrialized countries in gleneagles , scotland , may mean a unique opportunity to help africa is lost for ever . united europe would have power to persuade us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only with a united eu front can blair expect to persuade bush to help africa .
if europe can deliver on an improved aid deal , the prime minister will command the political and moral authority to pressure less-than-convinced g8 countries - namely the us , canada and japan - that the initiative can work .
blair has a powerful ally in french president jacques chirac and has been boosted by the support of the russian federation . but the major stumbling block to the united european effort appears to be of berlin origin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.05.2005 germany 's slaves to globalization großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : migrant laborers work in the meat industry for a pittance against a backdrop of stubborn unemployment figures and wage-dumping concerns , a recent study has revealed that some 15,000 people in germany can be described as modern-day slaves . most germans fondly imagine that forced labor is a problem restricted to developing nations .
but it also happens on their doorstep .
according to the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- study " human trafficking and exploitation in germany , " 360,000 of the 12.3 million people worldwide categorized as modern slaves live in industrialized countries , and an estimated 15,000 of them in germany - a country that has no fixed minimum wage . the ilo is now stepping up pressure for a global alliance to improve laws and raise awareness of what it calls a " hidden " issue . defining modern slavery " the term ' forced labor ' refers to a situation in which a person is being exploited against their will - forced to work under conditions they do not voluntarily accept , " explained norbert cyrus , author of the report .
it depicts the plight of poor or powerless victims , cowed by intimidation and sometimes even violence .
in germany 's worst cases , migrants are housed in basic , unhygienic accommodation with twenty people per room , working 80-hour weeks for negligible wages they have to wait months for - if they 're paid at all . globally , profits amassed on the back on forced labor amount to $ 32 billion -lrb- 25 billion euros -rrb- a year , 50 percent of which is pocketed in the western industrialized nations . in germany , two-thirds of this workforce are women .
approximately 60 percent of forced labor occurs within the country 's sex industry , with women from countries such as columbia , ghana , thailand and ukraine forced into prostitution after being lured to germany with false promises , then robbed of their papers . identifying the problem , helping the victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the coordination center against female trafficking -lrb- kok -rrb- in potsdam , one way of tackling the problem is to improve police awareness so that more instances of modern slavery are identified .
" during a police raid on a brothel , officers might realize that some of the women are not there voluntarily , but it 's very difficult to recognize such cases , " said kok 's manager .
" police need to be sensitized to these situations with further training options .
then these women can be referred to advice centers , which can provide them with support throughout a court case , if they 're required to give evidence - which is a key aspect of clamping down on the problem , because taking legal action hinges almost entirely on personal testimonies . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fear of reprisals , and , crucially , deportation , is one factor preventing people trapped in a condition of enforced dependency from seeking help .
" a lot of these women are traumatized , and help centers can provide them with protection and social support .
alone , they 're not usually in a position to seek help - they do n't speak the language , they 're not able to make contact with the outside world , " explained tanis from the kok .
as usual , however , " funding for these expert advice centers is facing ongoing cuts and they ca n't keep up with the number of cases they have to deal with . " labor as a commodity but muddying the waters is the fact that - like many foreign prostitutes - not all the people working in conditions that amount to modern slavery necessarily feel the need to escape .
" they do n't always see themselves as victims , " said tanis .
" they think they 're making money they can save or send home . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other industries where the problem exists include meatpacking , construction , agriculture , gastronomy , and the textile industry - although germany has been spared the latter 's notorious sweatshops , unlike the uk and france .
spurious agencies across eastern europe , for example , recruit workers eager to earn more in germany than they can at home .
but the picture painted of what awaits them bears little to resemblance to the harsh reality they actually encounter . norbert cyrus explained that many submit to their situation in the belief that any job is better than no job .
" hope of improvement and change keeps them going , " he said .
" another reason these people accept inhumane working conditions is because they feel they lack any alternative .
they end up feeling very fatalistic about their situation , so one thing that needs to change is their willingness to become more confrontational towards employers who are failing to implement prescribed standards . " fair globalization in germany , the meatpacking business in particular is riddled with what is essentially slave labor , on account of cut-throat price wars among germany 's discount supermarkets and a highly competitive , saturated market .
in the last year , some 26,000 jobs have been lost in the industry , with workers from hungary , poland , romania and slovakia picking up the slack for as little as two euros an hour . " a billion euro business -lrb- within the meatpacking industry -rrb- with mafia-like structures , salary dumping and modern slavery has developed , " said matthias brümmer from the ngg trade union in an interview with a local newspaper . but cyrus was quick to stress that eu enlargement is not the root of the problem .
referring to the need for " fair globalization , " he underlined the challenge of lifting restrictions while upholding workers ' rights .
" the problem is not the eu 's free circulation of services , but maintaining standards of fairness within that framework . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the statistics tell us that we need better protection for victims , " said cyrus .
" we need to improve their legal position , we need to inform them about their rights . "
police identify some 1000 victims of human trafficking a year .
" but often , these cases are simply treated as law-breakers , " he observed .

"
new elections , the paper said , represent " a gamble on power .
the social democrats saw the disaster coming , they were ready for it and they tried to weather it .
but it was far greater than expected , and the psychological and political repercussions for the red-green coalition government only began to emerge as the results were revealed on the television screens .
but as long as there can be an election , there can be hope - even if it is hope for a miracle . " the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote that " after this tectonic shift , schröder has little choice but to make a virtue of necessity , if he wants to avoid a crushing defeat in the next bundestag elections .
the box of tricks he 's been using until now is more or less empty .
the fact that schröder missed his chance to secure his position against the worst consequences of losing his majority in the bundesrat with a reform of the federal system has come back to haunt him .
if the government now tried renegotiating in order to win back some room to maneuver , it would inevitably be in a worse position than it was in december .
schröder would have to swallow a bitter pill : a change of coalition , resignation , new elections . "
schröder 's move after sunday 's devastating loss in germany 's most populous state was " an admission of defeat " , said the financial times .
" the scale of the spd 's defeat reflected popular resentment at mr schröder 's economic policy - viewed as far too business-friendly - and his cuts to the country 's traditionally generous welfare state .
with many in the spd demanding a shift to the left in a bid to win back core voters , mr schröder could face a bruising battle with his grassroots as he draws up the party 's election platform .
-lrb- a general election in four months -rrb- could mean the resumption of economic reforms as soon as the autumn - either by a freshly legitimized mr schröder or by a conservative-led government .
it would also dispel fears that the nation could be doomed to spend the next 16 months in a paralysing pre-election limbo . "
the center-left guardian noted that calling early elections was not accepted practice in germany and quoted a social democrat , furious at the chancellor 's decision , calling it " political suicide . "
schröder 's chances of winning a third term as chancellor appear bleak , commented the daily .
" while it is too early to write him off entirely , germany appears to be heading for another period of center-right government , and its first ever woman chancellor - the christian democrats ' leader , angela merkel .
before last night 's disaster , mr schröder was facing growing pressure to dump some of his controversial reforms to the country 's social welfare system .
instead of changing course , he appears to be trying to regain the initiative by going to the polls . "
the center-right times said a " humbled " schröder had taken a " panicked decision , " which clearly shows how deeply the defeat has hurt the government .
analysts quoted by the paper said the election might pave the way " for a grand coalition between the christian democrats and the social democrats in some form of broad cross-party reforming alliance .
it will paralyze germany , the world 's third-largest economy , unless schröder can win a new mandate for his unpopular program to overhaul its stagnant economy and lumbering welfare state .
on yesterday ’ s showing , his chances are slight .
his popular mandate is melting by the day and left-wingers within his party are demanding that he perform a u-turn .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.05.2005 germany 's early election affects eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's gamble could have far-reaching consequences for the eu german chancellor gerhard schröder 's call for early federal elections this fall is a high-stakes gamble not only for schröder and his social democrats at home , but for the european union as a whole . in responding to his party 's crippling defeat in its stronghold state of north rhine-westphalia with a call for a fresh ballot , the chancellor has essentially admitted defeat . his social democrat-green government coalition in berlin has long been facing an uphill battle against rampant unemployment , budget deficits , bad schools , and social problems connected to immigration .
such were the primary issues that drove the spd from power in germany 's largest state after 39 years at the helm .
and such are the issues which raise their heads in connection with public opposition to the european constitution which faces key votes in france and the netherlands next week . the bombshell defeat suffered by the social democrats here in germany on sunday could not have come at a worse time for the pro-european camp . what if ... ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is already a large " no " camp waiting to vote in france the consequences could be monumental and pundits everywhere are now asking the " what if " questions : what if this election signals to voters in france and holland that germans , too , do n't want the constitution ?
what if talks on key eu budget issues break down because finance ministers view schröder 's government as a lame duck ?
and what if schröder and his social democrats ultimately lose the early election he hopes to call ? most commentators agree that the election loss in north rhine-westphalia is a strong indicator that schröder 's party will be ousted from office in the next election .
and already , budget talks in brussels have been clouded because of germany 's decision to hold early elections . whether germany will continue to foot such a large portion of eu expenditure is now more uncertain than ever , and the implications of a potential shift in policy extend far beyond berlin . budget issues the eu is currently trying to convince britain to forego its budget rebate , but the prospect of a power switch in germany could sway london to resist the pressure to pay more into eu coffers . the battle lines over the budget are roughly drawn between the eu commission which wants as much money as possible , and the six biggest net contributors - germany , france , britain , the netherlands , sweden and austria - which want to limit the budget .
voters in germany , at least , see too much of their tax money disappearing down black holes in brussels while their own standards of living are diminishing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration is an ongoing issue in europe the commission also wants money to help fund eu eastward expansion .
but this is another sticking point in germany and elsewhere in europe , where voters fear further job losses and increased immigration . a change of government in berlin would be a big victory for the anti-immigration camp . as far as the new european constitution is concerned , if the referendums in france and the netherlands fail to win support for europe , this will almost certainly seal the defeat of schröder and the greens at an early federal election later this year . essentially , if the constitutional referendums fail , voters will be saying that europe must stop where it is and clean up the mess before moving on . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections in germany leaders of all german mainstream parties are meeting today to discuss the ramifications of early national elections this fall after the ruling social democrats suffered a blow in crucial state elections sunday .

"
new elections , the paper said , represent " a gamble on power .
the social democrats saw the disaster coming , they were ready for it and they tried to weather it .
but it was far greater than expected , and the psychological and political repercussions for the red-green coalition government only began to emerge as the results were revealed on the television screens .
but as long as there can be an election , there can be hope - even if it is hope for a miracle . " the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote that " after this tectonic shift , schröder has little choice but to make a virtue of necessity , if he wants to avoid a crushing defeat in the next bundestag elections .
the box of tricks he 's been using until now is more or less empty .
the fact that schröder missed his chance to secure his position against the worst consequences of losing his majority in the bundesrat with a reform of the federal system has come back to haunt him .
if the government now tried renegotiating in order to win back some room to maneuver , it would inevitably be in a worse position than it was in december .
schröder would have to swallow a bitter pill : a change of coalition , resignation , new elections . "
schröder 's move after sunday 's devastating loss in germany 's most populous state was " an admission of defeat " , said the financial times .
" the scale of the spd 's defeat reflected popular resentment at mr schröder 's economic policy - viewed as far too business-friendly - and his cuts to the country 's traditionally generous welfare state .
with many in the spd demanding a shift to the left in a bid to win back core voters , mr schröder could face a bruising battle with his grassroots as he draws up the party 's election platform .
-lrb- a general election in four months -rrb- could mean the resumption of economic reforms as soon as the autumn - either by a freshly legitimized mr schröder or by a conservative-led government .
it would also dispel fears that the nation could be doomed to spend the next 16 months in a paralysing pre-election limbo . "
the center-left guardian noted that calling early elections was not accepted practice in germany and quoted a social democrat , furious at the chancellor 's decision , calling it " political suicide . "
schröder 's chances of winning a third term as chancellor appear bleak , commented the daily .
" while it is too early to write him off entirely , germany appears to be heading for another period of center-right government , and its first ever woman chancellor - the christian democrats ' leader , angela merkel .
before last night 's disaster , mr schröder was facing growing pressure to dump some of his controversial reforms to the country 's social welfare system .

but it also happens on their doorstep .
according to the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- study " human trafficking and exploitation in germany , " 360,000 of the 12.3 million people worldwide categorized as modern slaves live in industrialized countries , and an estimated 15,000 of them in germany - a country that has no fixed minimum wage . the ilo is now stepping up pressure for a global alliance to improve laws and raise awareness of what it calls a " hidden " issue . defining modern slavery " the term ' forced labor ' refers to a situation in which a person is being exploited against their will - forced to work under conditions they do not voluntarily accept , " explained norbert cyrus , author of the report .
it depicts the plight of poor or powerless victims , cowed by intimidation and sometimes even violence .
in germany 's worst cases , migrants are housed in basic , unhygienic accommodation with twenty people per room , working 80-hour weeks for negligible wages they have to wait months for - if they 're paid at all . globally , profits amassed on the back on forced labor amount to $ 32 billion -lrb- 25 billion euros -rrb- a year , 50 percent of which is pocketed in the western industrialized nations . in germany , two-thirds of this workforce are women .
approximately 60 percent of forced labor occurs within the country 's sex industry , with women from countries such as columbia , ghana , thailand and ukraine forced into prostitution after being lured to germany with false promises , then robbed of their papers . identifying the problem , helping the victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the coordination center against female trafficking -lrb- kok -rrb- in potsdam , one way of tackling the problem is to improve police awareness so that more instances of modern slavery are identified .
" during a police raid on a brothel , officers might realize that some of the women are not there voluntarily , but it 's very difficult to recognize such cases , " said kok 's manager .
" police need to be sensitized to these situations with further training options .
then these women can be referred to advice centers , which can provide them with support throughout a court case , if they 're required to give evidence - which is a key aspect of clamping down on the problem , because taking legal action hinges almost entirely on personal testimonies . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fear of reprisals , and , crucially , deportation , is one factor preventing people trapped in a condition of enforced dependency from seeking help .
" a lot of these women are traumatized , and help centers can provide them with protection and social support .
alone , they 're not usually in a position to seek help - they do n't speak the language , they 're not able to make contact with the outside world , " explained tanis from the kok .
as usual , however , " funding for these expert advice centers is facing ongoing cuts and they ca n't keep up with the number of cases they have to deal with . " labor as a commodity but muddying the waters is the fact that - like many foreign prostitutes - not all the people working in conditions that amount to modern slavery necessarily feel the need to escape .

but the picture painted of what awaits them bears little to resemblance to the harsh reality they actually encounter . norbert cyrus explained that many submit to their situation in the belief that any job is better than no job .
" hope of improvement and change keeps them going , " he said .
" another reason these people accept inhumane working conditions is because they feel they lack any alternative .
they end up feeling very fatalistic about their situation , so one thing that needs to change is their willingness to become more confrontational towards employers who are failing to implement prescribed standards . " fair globalization in germany , the meatpacking business in particular is riddled with what is essentially slave labor , on account of cut-throat price wars among germany 's discount supermarkets and a highly competitive , saturated market .
in the last year , some 26,000 jobs have been lost in the industry , with workers from hungary , poland , romania and slovakia picking up the slack for as little as two euros an hour . " a billion euro business -lrb- within the meatpacking industry -rrb- with mafia-like structures , salary dumping and modern slavery has developed , " said matthias brümmer from the ngg trade union in an interview with a local newspaper . but cyrus was quick to stress that eu enlargement is not the root of the problem .
referring to the need for " fair globalization , " he underlined the challenge of lifting restrictions while upholding workers ' rights .
" the problem is not the eu 's free circulation of services , but maintaining standards of fairness within that framework . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the statistics tell us that we need better protection for victims , " said cyrus .

but it also happens on their doorstep .
according to the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- study " human trafficking and exploitation in germany , " 360,000 of the 12.3 million people worldwide categorized as modern slaves live in industrialized countries , and an estimated 15,000 of them in germany - a country that has no fixed minimum wage . the ilo is now stepping up pressure for a global alliance to improve laws and raise awareness of what it calls a " hidden " issue . defining modern slavery " the term ' forced labor ' refers to a situation in which a person is being exploited against their will - forced to work under conditions they do not voluntarily accept , " explained norbert cyrus , author of the report .
it depicts the plight of poor or powerless victims , cowed by intimidation and sometimes even violence .
in germany 's worst cases , migrants are housed in basic , unhygienic accommodation with twenty people per room , working 80-hour weeks for negligible wages they have to wait months for - if they 're paid at all . globally , profits amassed on the back on forced labor amount to $ 32 billion -lrb- 25 billion euros -rrb- a year , 50 percent of which is pocketed in the western industrialized nations . in germany , two-thirds of this workforce are women .

" during a police raid on a brothel , officers might realize that some of the women are not there voluntarily , but it 's very difficult to recognize such cases , " said kok 's manager .
" police need to be sensitized to these situations with further training options .
then these women can be referred to advice centers , which can provide them with support throughout a court case , if they 're required to give evidence - which is a key aspect of clamping down on the problem , because taking legal action hinges almost entirely on personal testimonies .

but it was far greater than expected , and the psychological and political repercussions for the red-green coalition government only began to emerge as the results were revealed on the television screens .
but as long as there can be an election , there can be hope - even if it is hope for a miracle . " the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote that " after this tectonic shift , schröder has little choice but to make a virtue of necessity , if he wants to avoid a crushing defeat in the next bundestag elections .
the box of tricks he 's been using until now is more or less empty .
the fact that schröder missed his chance to secure his position against the worst consequences of losing his majority in the bundesrat with a reform of the federal system has come back to haunt him .
if the government now tried renegotiating in order to win back some room to maneuver , it would inevitably be in a worse position than it was in december .
schröder would have to swallow a bitter pill : a change of coalition , resignation , new elections . "
schröder 's move after sunday 's devastating loss in germany 's most populous state was " an admission of defeat " , said the financial times .
" the scale of the spd 's defeat reflected popular resentment at mr schröder 's economic policy - viewed as far too business-friendly - and his cuts to the country 's traditionally generous welfare state .
with many in the spd demanding a shift to the left in a bid to win back core voters , mr schröder could face a bruising battle with his grassroots as he draws up the party 's election platform .
-lrb- a general election in four months -rrb- could mean the resumption of economic reforms as soon as the autumn - either by a freshly legitimized mr schröder or by a conservative-led government .
it would also dispel fears that the nation could be doomed to spend the next 16 months in a paralysing pre-election limbo . "
the center-left guardian noted that calling early elections was not accepted practice in germany and quoted a social democrat , furious at the chancellor 's decision , calling it " political suicide . "
schröder 's chances of winning a third term as chancellor appear bleak , commented the daily .
" while it is too early to write him off entirely , germany appears to be heading for another period of center-right government , and its first ever woman chancellor - the christian democrats ' leader , angela merkel .
before last night 's disaster , mr schröder was facing growing pressure to dump some of his controversial reforms to the country 's social welfare system .
instead of changing course , he appears to be trying to regain the initiative by going to the polls . "
the center-right times said a " humbled " schröder had taken a " panicked decision , " which clearly shows how deeply the defeat has hurt the government .
analysts quoted by the paper said the election might pave the way " for a grand coalition between the christian democrats and the social democrats in some form of broad cross-party reforming alliance .
it will paralyze germany , the world 's third-largest economy , unless schröder can win a new mandate for his unpopular program to overhaul its stagnant economy and lumbering welfare state .

eu foreign ministers sparred sunday over budget questions , as the prospect of early general elections in germany injected fresh uncertainty into the talks , already dogged by britain 's vow to hold onto its budget rebate . the ministers met over dinner in brussels to sound each other out over their positions on the eu 's long-term budget , before getting down to bargaining at an official gathering on monday . luxembourg , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , was aiming to broker a deal between the union 's 25 members that can be signed at a summit here on june 16 and 17 , but the negotiations were being held up by britain 's refusal to reconsider the rebate on budget contributions that former prime minister margaret thatcher won in 1984 . repercussions of german elections the announcement sunday of early elections in germany raised new questions about the negotiating position of the biggest contributor to the budget . " it 's an important point that should not automatically make things easy , but that 's up to germany to decide , " nicolas schmidt , luxembourg 's deputy foreign minister , said . luxembourg was trying to bring minds together with a proposal that includes a suggestion to freeze and then reduce the british rebate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , that proposition raised the ire of britain who , through the voice of foreign secretary jack straw , insisted that his government aimed to keep the rebate , which is supposed to compensate for the fact britain receives less from eu agricultural funds than other nations . it was justified in 1984 when it was agreed , it is justified today and we will not hesitate to use our veto if it is necessary , " straw said in the face of growing opposition to the rebate by other countries . limiting the budget luxembourg wants an agreement before britain takes over the presidency for six months in july , during which the budget issue is likely to languish if there is no deal beforehand .
with that aim , luxembourg was to sound out eu leaders on their positions in order to make progress at a foreign ministers meeting planned for june 13 . the battle lines over the budget for the period from 2007 to 2013 were roughly drawn between the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , which wants to have as much money available as possible , and the six biggest net contributors - britain , france , germany , austria , sweden and the netherlands , which want to limit the budget . the commission was angling for a budget of one trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.26 trillion -rrb- while the six countries have demanded that the budget be capped at 815 billion euros , or 1.0 percent of gross national income as a compromise , luxembourg has proposed an overall budget ranging from 865 billion euros to 900 billion euros , representing the equivalent of 1.06 to 1.09 percent of gni . policy consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso gave a lukewarm reaction to the luxembourg proposal , saying it was " a step forward in some ways because for the first time we have all the key elements of the package set out for negotiations , " but was not " a proposal capable of moving the union forward over the next few years .

the bundestag vote then has to take place 48 hours after schröder puts forward what 's known as the vote of confidence , set to take place on july 1 .
if the chancellor loses this vote , new elections can take place earlier than planned , in accordance with article 68 of the constitution , which states that " if a motion of a federal chancellor for a vote of confidence is not assented to by the majority of the members of the bundestag , the federal president may , upon the proposal of the federal chancellor , dissolve the bundestag within twenty-one days .
the right to dissolve shall lapse as soon as the bundestag with the majority of its members elects another federal chancellor . "

a further option available to berlin is the constructive vote of no confidence laid out in article 67 , which states that " the bundestag can express its lack of confidence in the federal chancellor only by electing a successor with the majority of its members and by requesting the federal president to dismiss the federal chancellor .
the federal president must comply with the request and appoint the person elected . "
this , however , presupposes a candidate for office is already waiting in the wings , who can depend on the support of a bundestag majority .
the constructive no-confidence vote makes it harder to remove a chancellor because opponents of the chancellor not only must disagree with his or her governing but also must agree on a replacement historical precedents early elections in germany are highly unusual .

the bundestag vote then has to take place 48 hours after schröder puts forward what 's known as the vote of confidence , set to take place on july 1 .
if the chancellor loses this vote , new elections can take place earlier than planned , in accordance with article 68 of the constitution , which states that " if a motion of a federal chancellor for a vote of confidence is not assented to by the majority of the members of the bundestag , the federal president may , upon the proposal of the federal chancellor , dissolve the bundestag within twenty-one days .
the right to dissolve shall lapse as soon as the bundestag with the majority of its members elects another federal chancellor . "

the federal president must comply with the request and appoint the person elected . "
this , however , presupposes a candidate for office is already waiting in the wings , who can depend on the support of a bundestag majority .
the constructive no-confidence vote makes it harder to remove a chancellor because opponents of the chancellor not only must disagree with his or her governing but also must agree on a replacement historical precedents early elections in germany are highly unusual .
the first time they took place was in 1972 , initiated by chancellor willy brandt .

the loss of the spd stronghold was a clear statement to the government in berlin that the country is prepared to invest more faith in the opposition than in the current leadership . cabinet stays as is although the clarity of the message moved the chancellor to plead the case of a premature poll , it did not prompt him to consider passing the gauntlet to anyone else .
just hours after the election defeat , schröder said he would not reshuffle his cabinet before leading the party , which voted unanimously in favor of early elections , to the fall campaign . and when he bangs the drum for his red-green coalition later this year , his most likely challenger will be germany 's first female chancellor candidate , christian democrat angela merkel . roland koch , state premier of hesse , said it " goes without saying " that angela merkel will be the elected cdu candidate . " i do n't know anyone in the party who is of a different opinion , " he added . bildunterschrift : angela merkel although merkel has not been officially elected , the decision is expected when the cdu and csu sister party executive boards meet next monday . other cdu members said they shared koch 's optimism .

" and speaking on germany 's zdf public broadcaster , cdu general secretary volker kauder said the " message of the north rhine-westphalia election results was that the union would win with angela merkel . " a one-woman show or a coalition ? but what would await germany under its first ever woman leader ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.05.2005 german business hails early election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the news of fresh elections stimulated the stock exchange investors and industrialists in germany see a change in government as a way out of the country 's economic woes .
but analysts say tackling unemployment and slow economic growth will be a tough ride for the opposition . a day after the crushing defeat of chancellor gerhard schroeder 's social democrat spd party in key regional elections in the state of north rhine-westphalia , the german stock market was in a cautiously optimistic mood , with the blue-chip dax 30 index showing a gain of 37.46 points or 0.86 percent at 4,398.14 points . investors were relieved that , following the spd 's landslide defeat in its former stronghold , schröder wanted to hold the next general election this fall , a year ahead of schedule . analysts say the move will avoid long months of economic and political paralysis as the conservative cdu / csu and liberal fdp parties block reform spd-green coalition reform initiatives in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat . " without this move , the time between now and fall 2006 would simply have been filled with empty political posturing , " said hypovereinsbank economist andreas rees .
he added that the reform process was more likely to be restarted if the opposition were to win the general election , because the christian union and liberal parties already hold the majority in the bundesrat . the prospect of additional reforms - including the further liberalization of the labor markets and a drastic simplification of the tax system - would buoy sentiment on the stock markets . industry applause the automobile industry has also welcomed the prospect of an early election .
" germany needs a strong government , " said the head of the vda auto industry federation , bernd gottschalk .
the decision to bring forward the elections " must be seen as a chance , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has been plaguing germany for years the zdh handworkers ' association agreed .
" any decision that puts an end to the political lethargy and economic stagnation is good , " said zdh chief otto kentzler .
" an early election could be the right step .

but analysts say tackling unemployment and slow economic growth will be a tough ride for the opposition . a day after the crushing defeat of chancellor gerhard schroeder 's social democrat spd party in key regional elections in the state of north rhine-westphalia , the german stock market was in a cautiously optimistic mood , with the blue-chip dax 30 index showing a gain of 37.46 points or 0.86 percent at 4,398.14 points . investors were relieved that , following the spd 's landslide defeat in its former stronghold , schröder wanted to hold the next general election this fall , a year ahead of schedule . analysts say the move will avoid long months of economic and political paralysis as the conservative cdu / csu and liberal fdp parties block reform spd-green coalition reform initiatives in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat . " without this move , the time between now and fall 2006 would simply have been filled with empty political posturing , " said hypovereinsbank economist andreas rees .
he added that the reform process was more likely to be restarted if the opposition were to win the general election , because the christian union and liberal parties already hold the majority in the bundesrat . the prospect of additional reforms - including the further liberalization of the labor markets and a drastic simplification of the tax system - would buoy sentiment on the stock markets . industry applause the automobile industry has also welcomed the prospect of an early election .
" germany needs a strong government , " said the head of the vda auto industry federation , bernd gottschalk .
the decision to bring forward the elections " must be seen as a chance , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has been plaguing germany for years the zdh handworkers ' association agreed .
" any decision that puts an end to the political lethargy and economic stagnation is good , " said zdh chief otto kentzler .
" an early election could be the right step . " during its two terms in power , schröder 's red-green administration has failed to make any inroads into unemployment , currently at a post-war high of around five million , or steer the euro zone 's biggest economy out of the doldrums . merkel 's alternatives the question is whether the conservative opposition under cdu leader angela merkel will be able to handle the economy any better .
hvb economist rees noted that the cdu in north rhine-westphalia had won more by default than on the argument for its own reform programs . ubs economist holger fahrinkrug agreed .
" the conservative parties do n't have an election platform as yet and , like the spd , they also have internal struggles on key policy issues , especially in the fields of social and labor market reforms , " he said . bildunterschrift : angela merkel gernot nerb , chief economist of the influential ifo think tank , also believed that the mere prospect of a change in government would not necessarily lead to a lasting improvement in economic sentiment in germany . concrete progress would have to be made in reforms first , nerb argued .
but banking and stock market professor wolfgang gerke disagreed .
" after the elections , there 's more chance that policies will become more reliable , more calculable , " he said .
" it 's not so important for many companies whether the spd or the cdu is in power .
they just want an end to the endless political manoeuvering and the political blockades . " window of opportunity ? morgan stanley economist elga bartsch said the cdu would have to show it meant business in pressing ahead with reforms if it were to win the election . " it is a regular feature of the german political landscape for the bundesrat to be dominated by the opposition parties after a few years of the new government being in office , " she said .
" an incoming cdu-led government would therefore have to make the most of the window of opportunity to push through reforms while it still enjoys a broad majority in both houses .

the new aid targets are part of an agenda being discussed by european union foreign ministers in brussels on monday and tuesday . the news that germany and italy , two of britain 's european allies in the g8 , are resisting calls to contribute to the new targets has put the brakes on blair 's plan to secure an historic deal for africa before his expected stepping-down sometime in this his third and touted final term in office . the revelation that the two european forces are unwilling to get on board with blair 's project will do nothing to help in the struggle to get the most financially powerful partner , the united states , involved in the new initiative to alleviate africa 's crippling debt and double the continent 's aid package . increased contributions could mean billions for aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new aid targets for 2010 project that each member state would be required to increase the amount paid from 0.33 percent of gross national income to an average of 0.56 percent . this , according to european commission figures , would mean an increase of 20 billion euros on current levels .

the new aid targets are part of an agenda being discussed by european union foreign ministers in brussels on monday and tuesday . the news that germany and italy , two of britain 's european allies in the g8 , are resisting calls to contribute to the new targets has put the brakes on blair 's plan to secure an historic deal for africa before his expected stepping-down sometime in this his third and touted final term in office . the revelation that the two european forces are unwilling to get on board with blair 's project will do nothing to help in the struggle to get the most financially powerful partner , the united states , involved in the new initiative to alleviate africa 's crippling debt and double the continent 's aid package . increased contributions could mean billions for aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new aid targets for 2010 project that each member state would be required to increase the amount paid from 0.33 percent of gross national income to an average of 0.56 percent . this , according to european commission figures , would mean an increase of 20 billion euros on current levels .
anti-poverty campaigners would prefer to see an increase to 0.7 per cent , a figure agreed by european countries in 1970 but still to be introduced . the british government is already facing a tough task to persuade us president george w. bush to sign up and a further sign of division within the european union will do nothing to help the situation , officials fear . according to campaigners for debt relief and the fight against poverty in africa , the german and italian stance in the run-up to the july summit of the eight most influential industrialized countries in gleneagles , scotland , may mean a unique opportunity to help africa is lost for ever . united europe would have power to persuade us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only with a united eu front can blair expect to persuade bush to help africa .
if europe can deliver on an improved aid deal , the prime minister will command the political and moral authority to pressure less-than-convinced g8 countries - namely the us , canada and japan - that the initiative can work .
blair has a powerful ally in french president jacques chirac and has been boosted by the support of the russian federation . but the major stumbling block to the united european effort appears to be of berlin origin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.05.2005 early elections in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stormy times ahead leaders of all german mainstream parties are meeting today to discuss the ramifications of early national elections this fall after the ruling social democrats suffered a blow in crucial state elections sunday . the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- won about 45 percent of the votes in germany 's most popular state of north rhine-westphalia , with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- trailing behind with just 37.2 percent . the defeat was the latest in a series of state election bungles for schröder 's spd . but this historic win for the cdu was one blow too many for chancellor gerhard schröder who sees himself deprived of enough political support for his reform drive . he is now calling for early elections , originally scheduled for 2006 to be brought forward to this autumn . " i deem it necessary to seek majority support for continued social and economic reforms , " the german chancellor said on sunday evening .
" i see it as my responsibility and duty to persuade the federal president to call early elections at the national level as quickly as possible , realistically by autumn 2005 . " strategic maneuver bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder as he made the announcement on sunday the chancellor 's announcement came as a surprise to both his friends and foes . and with voters still reeling from schröder 's much-loathed incisions into the generous state welfare system , this call for an early ballot is nothing short of a gamble for both the chancellor and his party . record high unemployment rates have gradually been eating away at voter confidence in the spd-green coalition .
dieter wiefelspütz , the party 's interior affairs spokesman , said that the chancellor has to find out as quickly as possible whether his reform course still has the backing of the population at national level .
he added that calling for early elections is the logical consequence . " i think this is an interesting move to avoid political stagnation in the country , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.05.2005 early elections in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stormy times ahead leaders of all german mainstream parties are meeting today to discuss the ramifications of early national elections this fall after the ruling social democrats suffered a blow in crucial state elections sunday . the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- won about 45 percent of the votes in germany 's most popular state of north rhine-westphalia , with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- trailing behind with just 37.2 percent . the defeat was the latest in a series of state election bungles for schröder 's spd . but this historic win for the cdu was one blow too many for chancellor gerhard schröder who sees himself deprived of enough political support for his reform drive . he is now calling for early elections , originally scheduled for 2006 to be brought forward to this autumn . " i deem it necessary to seek majority support for continued social and economic reforms , " the german chancellor said on sunday evening .
" i see it as my responsibility and duty to persuade the federal president to call early elections at the national level as quickly as possible , realistically by autumn 2005 . " strategic maneuver bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder as he made the announcement on sunday the chancellor 's announcement came as a surprise to both his friends and foes . and with voters still reeling from schröder 's much-loathed incisions into the generous state welfare system , this call for an early ballot is nothing short of a gamble for both the chancellor and his party . record high unemployment rates have gradually been eating away at voter confidence in the spd-green coalition .
dieter wiefelspütz , the party 's interior affairs spokesman , said that the chancellor has to find out as quickly as possible whether his reform course still has the backing of the population at national level .
he added that calling for early elections is the logical consequence . " i think this is an interesting move to avoid political stagnation in the country , " he said .
" i must say the announcement came as a big surprise to me .
we 'll have thrilling weeks and months ahead of us . " strategic move but under the german constitution , the chancellor can not simply call fresh elections .
schröder will have to hold a vote of confidence in the national parliament and have his followers turn him down deliberately in order to pave the way for early elections . the president , horst köhler then has 21 days to decide whether or not to dissolve parliament , but constitutional experts doubt the legality of this step . should his call for early elections , however , be heeded , schröder would use the coming months to sharpen the profile of his party and convince the german people that the opposition christian democrats have even more painful reforms up their sleeves , and have no regard for workers ' rights . there is widespread agreement among germans that early elections in may would help to get the country out of the doldrums . industry leaders emphasize that germany can not afford to continue doing nothing until the scheduled date for a national poll at the end of 2006 . schröder versus merkel ? if fresh elections are set for the autumn , schröder will run as the spd 's candidate just weeks after having been given a vote of no confidence in the bundestag . bildunterschrift : angela merkel is schröder 's most likely challenger at the moment , success at national level seems unlikely for the chancellor and his crew , which is lacking cohesion . for the opposition christian democrats , the task ahead is somewhat easier . cdu leader angela merkel , who is likely to challenge schröder in the general election in a bid to become germany 's first woman leader , described sunday 's north rhine-westphalia as a " sensational result . " " the voters ... have shown hope in us and in the future state leader jürgen rüttgers because the problems are so great and they want us to shape a policy that will bring down unemployment , " merkel said . she welcomed the possibility of an early election . " every day without the red-green coalition will be a good day for germany , " she said . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats ousted in state election exit polls in the north rhine-westphalia state election show that gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- have lost control of their stronghold state after 39 years .

"
new elections , the paper said , represent " a gamble on power .
the social democrats saw the disaster coming , they were ready for it and they tried to weather it .
but it was far greater than expected , and the psychological and political repercussions for the red-green coalition government only began to emerge as the results were revealed on the television screens .
but as long as there can be an election , there can be hope - even if it is hope for a miracle . " the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote that " after this tectonic shift , schröder has little choice but to make a virtue of necessity , if he wants to avoid a crushing defeat in the next bundestag elections .
the box of tricks he 's been using until now is more or less empty .
the fact that schröder missed his chance to secure his position against the worst consequences of losing his majority in the bundesrat with a reform of the federal system has come back to haunt him .
if the government now tried renegotiating in order to win back some room to maneuver , it would inevitably be in a worse position than it was in december .
schröder would have to swallow a bitter pill : a change of coalition , resignation , new elections . "
schröder 's move after sunday 's devastating loss in germany 's most populous state was " an admission of defeat " , said the financial times .
" the scale of the spd 's defeat reflected popular resentment at mr schröder 's economic policy - viewed as far too business-friendly - and his cuts to the country 's traditionally generous welfare state .
with many in the spd demanding a shift to the left in a bid to win back core voters , mr schröder could face a bruising battle with his grassroots as he draws up the party 's election platform .
-lrb- a general election in four months -rrb- could mean the resumption of economic reforms as soon as the autumn - either by a freshly legitimized mr schröder or by a conservative-led government .
it would also dispel fears that the nation could be doomed to spend the next 16 months in a paralysing pre-election limbo . "
the center-left guardian noted that calling early elections was not accepted practice in germany and quoted a social democrat , furious at the chancellor 's decision , calling it " political suicide . "
schröder 's chances of winning a third term as chancellor appear bleak , commented the daily .
" while it is too early to write him off entirely , germany appears to be heading for another period of center-right government , and its first ever woman chancellor - the christian democrats ' leader , angela merkel .
before last night 's disaster , mr schröder was facing growing pressure to dump some of his controversial reforms to the country 's social welfare system .
instead of changing course , he appears to be trying to regain the initiative by going to the polls . "
the center-right times said a " humbled " schröder had taken a " panicked decision , " which clearly shows how deeply the defeat has hurt the government .
analysts quoted by the paper said the election might pave the way " for a grand coalition between the christian democrats and the social democrats in some form of broad cross-party reforming alliance .
it will paralyze germany , the world 's third-largest economy , unless schröder can win a new mandate for his unpopular program to overhaul its stagnant economy and lumbering welfare state .
on yesterday ’ s showing , his chances are slight .
his popular mandate is melting by the day and left-wingers within his party are demanding that he perform a u-turn .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.05.2005 early elections in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stormy times ahead leaders of all german mainstream parties are meeting today to discuss the ramifications of early national elections this fall after the ruling social democrats suffered a blow in crucial state elections sunday . the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- won about 45 percent of the votes in germany 's most popular state of north rhine-westphalia , with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- trailing behind with just 37.2 percent . the defeat was the latest in a series of state election bungles for schröder 's spd . but this historic win for the cdu was one blow too many for chancellor gerhard schröder who sees himself deprived of enough political support for his reform drive . he is now calling for early elections , originally scheduled for 2006 to be brought forward to this autumn . " i deem it necessary to seek majority support for continued social and economic reforms , " the german chancellor said on sunday evening .
" i see it as my responsibility and duty to persuade the federal president to call early elections at the national level as quickly as possible , realistically by autumn 2005 . " strategic maneuver bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder as he made the announcement on sunday the chancellor 's announcement came as a surprise to both his friends and foes . and with voters still reeling from schröder 's much-loathed incisions into the generous state welfare system , this call for an early ballot is nothing short of a gamble for both the chancellor and his party . record high unemployment rates have gradually been eating away at voter confidence in the spd-green coalition .
dieter wiefelspütz , the party 's interior affairs spokesman , said that the chancellor has to find out as quickly as possible whether his reform course still has the backing of the population at national level .
he added that calling for early elections is the logical consequence . " i think this is an interesting move to avoid political stagnation in the country , " he said .
" i must say the announcement came as a big surprise to me .
we 'll have thrilling weeks and months ahead of us . " strategic move but under the german constitution , the chancellor can not simply call fresh elections .
schröder will have to hold a vote of confidence in the national parliament and have his followers turn him down deliberately in order to pave the way for early elections . the president , horst köhler then has 21 days to decide whether or not to dissolve parliament , but constitutional experts doubt the legality of this step . should his call for early elections , however , be heeded , schröder would use the coming months to sharpen the profile of his party and convince the german people that the opposition christian democrats have even more painful reforms up their sleeves , and have no regard for workers ' rights . there is widespread agreement among germans that early elections in may would help to get the country out of the doldrums . industry leaders emphasize that germany can not afford to continue doing nothing until the scheduled date for a national poll at the end of 2006 . schröder versus merkel ? if fresh elections are set for the autumn , schröder will run as the spd 's candidate just weeks after having been given a vote of no confidence in the bundestag . bildunterschrift : angela merkel is schröder 's most likely challenger at the moment , success at national level seems unlikely for the chancellor and his crew , which is lacking cohesion . for the opposition christian democrats , the task ahead is somewhat easier . cdu leader angela merkel , who is likely to challenge schröder in the general election in a bid to become germany 's first woman leader , described sunday 's north rhine-westphalia as a " sensational result . " " the voters ... have shown hope in us and in the future state leader jürgen rüttgers because the problems are so great and they want us to shape a policy that will bring down unemployment , " merkel said . she welcomed the possibility of an early election . " every day without the red-green coalition will be a good day for germany , " she said . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats ousted in state election exit polls in the north rhine-westphalia state election show that gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- have lost control of their stronghold state after 39 years .

" i deem it necessary to seek majority support for continued social and economic reforms , " the german chancellor said on sunday evening .

dieter wiefelspütz , the party 's interior affairs spokesman , said that the chancellor has to find out as quickly as possible whether his reform course still has the backing of the population at national level .

she may have no qualms about germany 's catastrophic capitulation at the end of world war ii , but neither she nor her husband was appalled by efforts to humanize evil . " the germans deserved what happened to them , " male said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz as hitler swiss actor bruno ganz 's brilliant warts-and-all portrayal shows hitler in previously unimaginable scenes : charming his secretaries , sharing a passionate kiss with eva braun , frothing at the mouth over the latest reports of the encroaching red army , spilling sauce at dinner down his steel-gray uniform . " the film does n't show hitler in such a human light , " male said .
" the environment around him is humanized by children , the dog and women , but not hitler himself .
he was completely indifferent to his people suffering the allied bombings . " the wider tragedy accepted by some viewers raviv , a 30-year-old social worker , had the same reaction . " what happened to them was deserved , but what a tragedy , " he said .
although he was born in israel , his family comes from austria - annexed to hitler 's third reich in 1938 - and the personal resonance also hit home . " one of my grannies was the only one in the family to survive , " he added .
" although i certainly always felt a victim , this film also made me see the germans as victims .
i felt that too , when i went to berlin . " press divided on human portrayal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the press , as anywhere else , there are those who laud its merits and those deeply critical of director oliver hirschbiegel 's -lrb- photo -rrb- portrayal of the nazi führer . " i 'm not recommending this film to holocaust survivors , but it should be compulsory for everyone else , " wrote avner hopstein in yediot aharonot tabloid .
" it teaches us that even sensitive human beings can become execrable killers . " in the same newspaper , yehuda steve complained about the film 's technical flaws that left hitler less of a human being and " more of a museum wax work . " public response led to realse of film in israel a tel aviv cinema , lev , was initially reluctant to show the film , aware that the intense debate it sparked in europe may prove just too sensitive in israel . to decide , it screened a private viewing to a test audience , 91 percent of which agreed the film should be aired nationwide . " this was a very specific , short and transient time in history , but the film does not glorify hitler as some people said , " said brazilian jewish emigre noah milstein , 66 .

public opinion is behind early elections , but does gerhard schröder really stand any chance of being re-elected ? opinion polls ahead of sunday 's ballot gave the social democrats , who had ruled in germany 's largest federal state of north rhine-westphalia for 39 years , little hope of holding onto the reins of power . but even in the face of that bitter expectation , politicians and public alike were nothing if not unprepared for gerhard schröder 's announcement . bildunterschrift : schröder on monday his political ambush is viewed as a scrambling attempt to cling to what power he has left by catching his opponents off-guard .
but analysts are predicting a foregone conclusion in favor of the conservative cdu .
the loss of the spd stronghold was a clear statement to the government in berlin that the country is prepared to invest more faith in the opposition than in the current leadership . cabinet stays as is although the clarity of the message moved the chancellor to plead the case of a premature poll , it did not prompt him to consider passing the gauntlet to anyone else .
just hours after the election defeat , schröder said he would not reshuffle his cabinet before leading the party , which voted unanimously in favor of early elections , to the fall campaign . and when he bangs the drum for his red-green coalition later this year , his most likely challenger will be germany 's first female chancellor candidate , christian democrat angela merkel . roland koch , state premier of hesse , said it " goes without saying " that angela merkel will be the elected cdu candidate . " i do n't know anyone in the party who is of a different opinion , " he added . bildunterschrift : angela merkel although merkel has not been officially elected , the decision is expected when the cdu and csu sister party executive boards meet next monday . other cdu members said they shared koch 's optimism .

" i deem it necessary to seek majority support for continued social and economic reforms , " the german chancellor said on sunday evening .
" i see it as my responsibility and duty to persuade the federal president to call early elections at the national level as quickly as possible , realistically by autumn 2005 . " strategic maneuver bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder as he made the announcement on sunday the chancellor 's announcement came as a surprise to both his friends and foes . and with voters still reeling from schröder 's much-loathed incisions into the generous state welfare system , this call for an early ballot is nothing short of a gamble for both the chancellor and his party . record high unemployment rates have gradually been eating away at voter confidence in the spd-green coalition .
dieter wiefelspütz , the party 's interior affairs spokesman , said that the chancellor has to find out as quickly as possible whether his reform course still has the backing of the population at national level .
he added that calling for early elections is the logical consequence . " i think this is an interesting move to avoid political stagnation in the country , " he said .
" i must say the announcement came as a big surprise to me .
we 'll have thrilling weeks and months ahead of us . " strategic move but under the german constitution , the chancellor can not simply call fresh elections .
schröder will have to hold a vote of confidence in the national parliament and have his followers turn him down deliberately in order to pave the way for early elections . the president , horst köhler then has 21 days to decide whether or not to dissolve parliament , but constitutional experts doubt the legality of this step . should his call for early elections , however , be heeded , schröder would use the coming months to sharpen the profile of his party and convince the german people that the opposition christian democrats have even more painful reforms up their sleeves , and have no regard for workers ' rights . there is widespread agreement among germans that early elections in may would help to get the country out of the doldrums . industry leaders emphasize that germany can not afford to continue doing nothing until the scheduled date for a national poll at the end of 2006 . schröder versus merkel ? if fresh elections are set for the autumn , schröder will run as the spd 's candidate just weeks after having been given a vote of no confidence in the bundestag . bildunterschrift : angela merkel is schröder 's most likely challenger at the moment , success at national level seems unlikely for the chancellor and his crew , which is lacking cohesion . for the opposition christian democrats , the task ahead is somewhat easier . cdu leader angela merkel , who is likely to challenge schröder in the general election in a bid to become germany 's first woman leader , described sunday 's north rhine-westphalia as a " sensational result . " " the voters ... have shown hope in us and in the future state leader jürgen rüttgers because the problems are so great and they want us to shape a policy that will bring down unemployment , " merkel said . she welcomed the possibility of an early election . " every day without the red-green coalition will be a good day for germany , " she said . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats ousted in state election exit polls in the north rhine-westphalia state election show that gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- have lost control of their stronghold state after 39 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.05.2005 germany 's early election affects eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's gamble could have far-reaching consequences for the eu german chancellor gerhard schröder 's call for early federal elections this fall is a high-stakes gamble not only for schröder and his social democrats at home , but for the european union as a whole . in responding to his party 's crippling defeat in its stronghold state of north rhine-westphalia with a call for a fresh ballot , the chancellor has essentially admitted defeat . his social democrat-green government coalition in berlin has long been facing an uphill battle against rampant unemployment , budget deficits , bad schools , and social problems connected to immigration .
such were the primary issues that drove the spd from power in germany 's largest state after 39 years at the helm .
and such are the issues which raise their heads in connection with public opposition to the european constitution which faces key votes in france and the netherlands next week . the bombshell defeat suffered by the social democrats here in germany on sunday could not have come at a worse time for the pro-european camp . what if ... ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is already a large " no " camp waiting to vote in france the consequences could be monumental and pundits everywhere are now asking the " what if " questions : what if this election signals to voters in france and holland that germans , too , do n't want the constitution ?
what if talks on key eu budget issues break down because finance ministers view schröder 's government as a lame duck ?
and what if schröder and his social democrats ultimately lose the early election he hopes to call ? most commentators agree that the election loss in north rhine-westphalia is a strong indicator that schröder 's party will be ousted from office in the next election .
and already , budget talks in brussels have been clouded because of germany 's decision to hold early elections . whether germany will continue to foot such a large portion of eu expenditure is now more uncertain than ever , and the implications of a potential shift in policy extend far beyond berlin . budget issues the eu is currently trying to convince britain to forego its budget rebate , but the prospect of a power switch in germany could sway london to resist the pressure to pay more into eu coffers . the battle lines over the budget are roughly drawn between the eu commission which wants as much money as possible , and the six biggest net contributors - germany , france , britain , the netherlands , sweden and austria - which want to limit the budget .
voters in germany , at least , see too much of their tax money disappearing down black holes in brussels while their own standards of living are diminishing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration is an ongoing issue in europe the commission also wants money to help fund eu eastward expansion .
but this is another sticking point in germany and elsewhere in europe , where voters fear further job losses and increased immigration . a change of government in berlin would be a big victory for the anti-immigration camp . as far as the new european constitution is concerned , if the referendums in france and the netherlands fail to win support for europe , this will almost certainly seal the defeat of schröder and the greens at an early federal election later this year . essentially , if the constitutional referendums fail , voters will be saying that europe must stop where it is and clean up the mess before moving on . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections in germany leaders of all german mainstream parties are meeting today to discuss the ramifications of early national elections this fall after the ruling social democrats suffered a blow in crucial state elections sunday .

"
new elections , the paper said , represent " a gamble on power .
the social democrats saw the disaster coming , they were ready for it and they tried to weather it .
but it was far greater than expected , and the psychological and political repercussions for the red-green coalition government only began to emerge as the results were revealed on the television screens .
but as long as there can be an election , there can be hope - even if it is hope for a miracle . " the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote that " after this tectonic shift , schröder has little choice but to make a virtue of necessity , if he wants to avoid a crushing defeat in the next bundestag elections .
the box of tricks he 's been using until now is more or less empty .
the fact that schröder missed his chance to secure his position against the worst consequences of losing his majority in the bundesrat with a reform of the federal system has come back to haunt him .
if the government now tried renegotiating in order to win back some room to maneuver , it would inevitably be in a worse position than it was in december .
schröder would have to swallow a bitter pill : a change of coalition , resignation , new elections . "
schröder 's move after sunday 's devastating loss in germany 's most populous state was " an admission of defeat " , said the financial times .
" the scale of the spd 's defeat reflected popular resentment at mr schröder 's economic policy - viewed as far too business-friendly - and his cuts to the country 's traditionally generous welfare state .
with many in the spd demanding a shift to the left in a bid to win back core voters , mr schröder could face a bruising battle with his grassroots as he draws up the party 's election platform .
-lrb- a general election in four months -rrb- could mean the resumption of economic reforms as soon as the autumn - either by a freshly legitimized mr schröder or by a conservative-led government .
it would also dispel fears that the nation could be doomed to spend the next 16 months in a paralysing pre-election limbo . "
the center-left guardian noted that calling early elections was not accepted practice in germany and quoted a social democrat , furious at the chancellor 's decision , calling it " political suicide . "
schröder 's chances of winning a third term as chancellor appear bleak , commented the daily .
" while it is too early to write him off entirely , germany appears to be heading for another period of center-right government , and its first ever woman chancellor - the christian democrats ' leader , angela merkel .
before last night 's disaster , mr schröder was facing growing pressure to dump some of his controversial reforms to the country 's social welfare system .
instead of changing course , he appears to be trying to regain the initiative by going to the polls . "
the center-right times said a " humbled " schröder had taken a " panicked decision , " which clearly shows how deeply the defeat has hurt the government .
analysts quoted by the paper said the election might pave the way " for a grand coalition between the christian democrats and the social democrats in some form of broad cross-party reforming alliance .
it will paralyze germany , the world 's third-largest economy , unless schröder can win a new mandate for his unpopular program to overhaul its stagnant economy and lumbering welfare state .
on yesterday ’ s showing , his chances are slight .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.05.2005 german business hails early election großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the news of fresh elections stimulated the stock exchange investors and industrialists in germany see a change in government as a way out of the country 's economic woes .
but analysts say tackling unemployment and slow economic growth will be a tough ride for the opposition . a day after the crushing defeat of chancellor gerhard schroeder 's social democrat spd party in key regional elections in the state of north rhine-westphalia , the german stock market was in a cautiously optimistic mood , with the blue-chip dax 30 index showing a gain of 37.46 points or 0.86 percent at 4,398.14 points . investors were relieved that , following the spd 's landslide defeat in its former stronghold , schröder wanted to hold the next general election this fall , a year ahead of schedule . analysts say the move will avoid long months of economic and political paralysis as the conservative cdu / csu and liberal fdp parties block reform spd-green coalition reform initiatives in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat . " without this move , the time between now and fall 2006 would simply have been filled with empty political posturing , " said hypovereinsbank economist andreas rees .
he added that the reform process was more likely to be restarted if the opposition were to win the general election , because the christian union and liberal parties already hold the majority in the bundesrat . the prospect of additional reforms - including the further liberalization of the labor markets and a drastic simplification of the tax system - would buoy sentiment on the stock markets . industry applause the automobile industry has also welcomed the prospect of an early election .
" germany needs a strong government , " said the head of the vda auto industry federation , bernd gottschalk .
the decision to bring forward the elections " must be seen as a chance , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has been plaguing germany for years the zdh handworkers ' association agreed .
" any decision that puts an end to the political lethargy and economic stagnation is good , " said zdh chief otto kentzler .
" an early election could be the right step . " during its two terms in power , schröder 's red-green administration has failed to make any inroads into unemployment , currently at a post-war high of around five million , or steer the euro zone 's biggest economy out of the doldrums . merkel 's alternatives the question is whether the conservative opposition under cdu leader angela merkel will be able to handle the economy any better .
hvb economist rees noted that the cdu in north rhine-westphalia had won more by default than on the argument for its own reform programs . ubs economist holger fahrinkrug agreed .
" the conservative parties do n't have an election platform as yet and , like the spd , they also have internal struggles on key policy issues , especially in the fields of social and labor market reforms , " he said . bildunterschrift : angela merkel gernot nerb , chief economist of the influential ifo think tank , also believed that the mere prospect of a change in government would not necessarily lead to a lasting improvement in economic sentiment in germany . concrete progress would have to be made in reforms first , nerb argued .
but banking and stock market professor wolfgang gerke disagreed .
" after the elections , there 's more chance that policies will become more reliable , more calculable , " he said .
" it 's not so important for many companies whether the spd or the cdu is in power .
they just want an end to the endless political manoeuvering and the political blockades . " window of opportunity ? morgan stanley economist elga bartsch said the cdu would have to show it meant business in pressing ahead with reforms if it were to win the election . " it is a regular feature of the german political landscape for the bundesrat to be dominated by the opposition parties after a few years of the new government being in office , " she said .
" an incoming cdu-led government would therefore have to make the most of the window of opportunity to push through reforms while it still enjoys a broad majority in both houses .

they just want an end to the endless political manoeuvering and the political blockades . " window of opportunity ? morgan stanley economist elga bartsch said the cdu would have to show it meant business in pressing ahead with reforms if it were to win the election . " it is a regular feature of the german political landscape for the bundesrat to be dominated by the opposition parties after a few years of the new government being in office , " she said .
" an incoming cdu-led government would therefore have to make the most of the window of opportunity to push through reforms while it still enjoys a broad majority in both houses .

"
new elections , the paper said , represent " a gamble on power .
the social democrats saw the disaster coming , they were ready for it and they tried to weather it .
but it was far greater than expected , and the psychological and political repercussions for the red-green coalition government only began to emerge as the results were revealed on the television screens .
but as long as there can be an election , there can be hope - even if it is hope for a miracle . " the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote that " after this tectonic shift , schröder has little choice but to make a virtue of necessity , if he wants to avoid a crushing defeat in the next bundestag elections .
the box of tricks he 's been using until now is more or less empty .
the fact that schröder missed his chance to secure his position against the worst consequences of losing his majority in the bundesrat with a reform of the federal system has come back to haunt him .
if the government now tried renegotiating in order to win back some room to maneuver , it would inevitably be in a worse position than it was in december .
schröder would have to swallow a bitter pill : a change of coalition , resignation , new elections . "
schröder 's move after sunday 's devastating loss in germany 's most populous state was " an admission of defeat " , said the financial times .
" the scale of the spd 's defeat reflected popular resentment at mr schröder 's economic policy - viewed as far too business-friendly - and his cuts to the country 's traditionally generous welfare state .
with many in the spd demanding a shift to the left in a bid to win back core voters , mr schröder could face a bruising battle with his grassroots as he draws up the party 's election platform .
-lrb- a general election in four months -rrb- could mean the resumption of economic reforms as soon as the autumn - either by a freshly legitimized mr schröder or by a conservative-led government .
it would also dispel fears that the nation could be doomed to spend the next 16 months in a paralysing pre-election limbo . "
the center-left guardian noted that calling early elections was not accepted practice in germany and quoted a social democrat , furious at the chancellor 's decision , calling it " political suicide . "
schröder 's chances of winning a third term as chancellor appear bleak , commented the daily .
" while it is too early to write him off entirely , germany appears to be heading for another period of center-right government , and its first ever woman chancellor - the christian democrats ' leader , angela merkel .
before last night 's disaster , mr schröder was facing growing pressure to dump some of his controversial reforms to the country 's social welfare system .
instead of changing course , he appears to be trying to regain the initiative by going to the polls . "
the center-right times said a " humbled " schröder had taken a " panicked decision , " which clearly shows how deeply the defeat has hurt the government .
analysts quoted by the paper said the election might pave the way " for a grand coalition between the christian democrats and the social democrats in some form of broad cross-party reforming alliance .
it will paralyze germany , the world 's third-largest economy , unless schröder can win a new mandate for his unpopular program to overhaul its stagnant economy and lumbering welfare state .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.05.2005 schröder pins hopes on vote of confidence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resorting to desperate measures if germany is to go to the polls this autumn , chancellor schröder will have to set in motion a complex constitutional mechanism for bringing the elections forward . first of all , the chancellor has to submit a motion to parliament to establish whether he still has majority support .
the bundestag vote then has to take place 48 hours after schröder puts forward what 's known as the vote of confidence , set to take place on july 1 .
if the chancellor loses this vote , new elections can take place earlier than planned , in accordance with article 68 of the constitution , which states that " if a motion of a federal chancellor for a vote of confidence is not assented to by the majority of the members of the bundestag , the federal president may , upon the proposal of the federal chancellor , dissolve the bundestag within twenty-one days .
the right to dissolve shall lapse as soon as the bundestag with the majority of its members elects another federal chancellor . "
presidential discretion the operative word here is " may . "
the president can act upon the chancellor 's proposal to dissolve the bundestag , but he does n't have to .
it 's up to him to decide whether the chancellor 's decision is in keeping with constitutional principles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for the time being , president horst köhler -lrb- photo -rrb- has remained silent on the issue .
according to his spokesperson , he was carefully considering the matter before meeting with schröder on monday .
a further option available to berlin is the constructive vote of no confidence laid out in article 67 , which states that " the bundestag can express its lack of confidence in the federal chancellor only by electing a successor with the majority of its members and by requesting the federal president to dismiss the federal chancellor .
the federal president must comply with the request and appoint the person elected . "
this , however , presupposes a candidate for office is already waiting in the wings , who can depend on the support of a bundestag majority .
the constructive no-confidence vote makes it harder to remove a chancellor because opponents of the chancellor not only must disagree with his or her governing but also must agree on a replacement historical precedents early elections in germany are highly unusual .
the first time they took place was in 1972 , initiated by chancellor willy brandt .
he forced the premature dissolution of the bundestag by president gustav heinemann in order to secure a stable majority in the ensuing election , which he won with an impressive relative majority of nearly 45 percent .

then , in february 1982 , chancellor helmut schmidt called a vote of confidence , winning by 269-224 votes - despite tensions between the coalition partners , the sdp and the fdp . the bundestag remained unchanged , but the coalition collapsed seven months later when the liberals joined forces with the cdu .
he was subsequently voted out of office in october 1982 through a constructive vote of no confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december 1982 , it was helmut kohl 's turn .
he lost by 8-218 votes , with cdu and fdp mps abstaining .
germany went to the polls and voted kohl back for a second term .
in november 2001 , gerhard schröder called for a vote of confidence on german participation in the us-led " enduring freedom " mission in afghanistan - the largest ever military intervention by the bundeswehr .

the bundestag vote then has to take place 48 hours after schröder puts forward what 's known as the vote of confidence , set to take place on july 1 .
if the chancellor loses this vote , new elections can take place earlier than planned , in accordance with article 68 of the constitution , which states that " if a motion of a federal chancellor for a vote of confidence is not assented to by the majority of the members of the bundestag , the federal president may , upon the proposal of the federal chancellor , dissolve the bundestag within twenty-one days .
the right to dissolve shall lapse as soon as the bundestag with the majority of its members elects another federal chancellor . "

the federal president must comply with the request and appoint the person elected . "
this , however , presupposes a candidate for office is already waiting in the wings , who can depend on the support of a bundestag majority .
the constructive no-confidence vote makes it harder to remove a chancellor because opponents of the chancellor not only must disagree with his or her governing but also must agree on a replacement historical precedents early elections in germany are highly unusual .

she may have no qualms about germany 's catastrophic capitulation at the end of world war ii , but neither she nor her husband was appalled by efforts to humanize evil . " the germans deserved what happened to them , " male said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz as hitler swiss actor bruno ganz 's brilliant warts-and-all portrayal shows hitler in previously unimaginable scenes : charming his secretaries , sharing a passionate kiss with eva braun , frothing at the mouth over the latest reports of the encroaching red army , spilling sauce at dinner down his steel-gray uniform . " the film does n't show hitler in such a human light , " male said .
" the environment around him is humanized by children , the dog and women , but not hitler himself .
he was completely indifferent to his people suffering the allied bombings . " the wider tragedy accepted by some viewers raviv , a 30-year-old social worker , had the same reaction . " what happened to them was deserved , but what a tragedy , " he said .
although he was born in israel , his family comes from austria - annexed to hitler 's third reich in 1938 - and the personal resonance also hit home . " one of my grannies was the only one in the family to survive , " he added .
" although i certainly always felt a victim , this film also made me see the germans as victims .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.05.2005 schröder pins hopes on vote of confidence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resorting to desperate measures if germany is to go to the polls this autumn , chancellor schröder will have to set in motion a complex constitutional mechanism for bringing the elections forward . first of all , the chancellor has to submit a motion to parliament to establish whether he still has majority support .
the bundestag vote then has to take place 48 hours after schröder puts forward what 's known as the vote of confidence , set to take place on july 1 .
if the chancellor loses this vote , new elections can take place earlier than planned , in accordance with article 68 of the constitution , which states that " if a motion of a federal chancellor for a vote of confidence is not assented to by the majority of the members of the bundestag , the federal president may , upon the proposal of the federal chancellor , dissolve the bundestag within twenty-one days .
the right to dissolve shall lapse as soon as the bundestag with the majority of its members elects another federal chancellor . "
presidential discretion the operative word here is " may . "
the president can act upon the chancellor 's proposal to dissolve the bundestag , but he does n't have to .
it 's up to him to decide whether the chancellor 's decision is in keeping with constitutional principles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for the time being , president horst köhler -lrb- photo -rrb- has remained silent on the issue .
according to his spokesperson , he was carefully considering the matter before meeting with schröder on monday .
a further option available to berlin is the constructive vote of no confidence laid out in article 67 , which states that " the bundestag can express its lack of confidence in the federal chancellor only by electing a successor with the majority of its members and by requesting the federal president to dismiss the federal chancellor .
the federal president must comply with the request and appoint the person elected . "
this , however , presupposes a candidate for office is already waiting in the wings , who can depend on the support of a bundestag majority .
the constructive no-confidence vote makes it harder to remove a chancellor because opponents of the chancellor not only must disagree with his or her governing but also must agree on a replacement historical precedents early elections in germany are highly unusual .
the first time they took place was in 1972 , initiated by chancellor willy brandt .
he forced the premature dissolution of the bundestag by president gustav heinemann in order to secure a stable majority in the ensuing election , which he won with an impressive relative majority of nearly 45 percent .

then , in february 1982 , chancellor helmut schmidt called a vote of confidence , winning by 269-224 votes - despite tensions between the coalition partners , the sdp and the fdp . the bundestag remained unchanged , but the coalition collapsed seven months later when the liberals joined forces with the cdu .
he was subsequently voted out of office in october 1982 through a constructive vote of no confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december 1982 , it was helmut kohl 's turn .
he lost by 8-218 votes , with cdu and fdp mps abstaining .
germany went to the polls and voted kohl back for a second term .
in november 2001 , gerhard schröder called for a vote of confidence on german participation in the us-led " enduring freedom " mission in afghanistan - the largest ever military intervention by the bundeswehr .

" if it is not satisfied , the commission will activate procedures for imposing daily fines " on the group , he added . in march 2004 , the commission , which polices antitrust issues in the european union , fined the software group a record 497 million euros -lrb- $ 623 million -rrb- for abusing its dominant market position . the commission also called on microsoft to market a version of its leading operating system windows without bundling it to its software media player and required the company to divulge information about its product operating system needed by manufacturers of competing products . commission " unsatisfied " the commission has also called for an independent " monitoring trustee " to be named to make sure that microsoft applies the ruling correctly . despite " regular contacts " between brussels and the group , todd said the commission was unsatisfied on all of its demands . under eu rules , a company that fails to comply with a commission competition ruling could in theory be fined up to five percent of its daily global turnover per day for each day the ruling is not respected . the commission has never before inflicted such harsh punishment on a company that did not bow to its will . playing down its defiance , a microsoft spokesman in brussels said : " we continue to work out with the commission towards an agreement on full compliance with the decision .

the new aid targets are part of an agenda being discussed by european union foreign ministers in brussels on monday and tuesday . the news that germany and italy , two of britain 's european allies in the g8 , are resisting calls to contribute to the new targets has put the brakes on blair 's plan to secure an historic deal for africa before his expected stepping-down sometime in this his third and touted final term in office . the revelation that the two european forces are unwilling to get on board with blair 's project will do nothing to help in the struggle to get the most financially powerful partner , the united states , involved in the new initiative to alleviate africa 's crippling debt and double the continent 's aid package . increased contributions could mean billions for aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new aid targets for 2010 project that each member state would be required to increase the amount paid from 0.33 percent of gross national income to an average of 0.56 percent . this , according to european commission figures , would mean an increase of 20 billion euros on current levels .
anti-poverty campaigners would prefer to see an increase to 0.7 per cent , a figure agreed by european countries in 1970 but still to be introduced . the british government is already facing a tough task to persuade us president george w. bush to sign up and a further sign of division within the european union will do nothing to help the situation , officials fear . according to campaigners for debt relief and the fight against poverty in africa , the german and italian stance in the run-up to the july summit of the eight most influential industrialized countries in gleneagles , scotland , may mean a unique opportunity to help africa is lost for ever . united europe would have power to persuade us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only with a united eu front can blair expect to persuade bush to help africa .
if europe can deliver on an improved aid deal , the prime minister will command the political and moral authority to pressure less-than-convinced g8 countries - namely the us , canada and japan - that the initiative can work .
blair has a powerful ally in french president jacques chirac and has been boosted by the support of the russian federation . but the major stumbling block to the united european effort appears to be of berlin origin .
observers believe that italy might be climbing down from threats to also block a deal and growing pressure may sway the decision before the summit in july . domestic woes may spell disaster for africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , germany claims it is currently more preoccupied with domestic economic problems to expend much energy and cash in blair 's project for africa .

the new aid targets are part of an agenda being discussed by european union foreign ministers in brussels on monday and tuesday . the news that germany and italy , two of britain 's european allies in the g8 , are resisting calls to contribute to the new targets has put the brakes on blair 's plan to secure an historic deal for africa before his expected stepping-down sometime in this his third and touted final term in office . the revelation that the two european forces are unwilling to get on board with blair 's project will do nothing to help in the struggle to get the most financially powerful partner , the united states , involved in the new initiative to alleviate africa 's crippling debt and double the continent 's aid package . increased contributions could mean billions for aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new aid targets for 2010 project that each member state would be required to increase the amount paid from 0.33 percent of gross national income to an average of 0.56 percent . this , according to european commission figures , would mean an increase of 20 billion euros on current levels .
anti-poverty campaigners would prefer to see an increase to 0.7 per cent , a figure agreed by european countries in 1970 but still to be introduced . the british government is already facing a tough task to persuade us president george w. bush to sign up and a further sign of division within the european union will do nothing to help the situation , officials fear . according to campaigners for debt relief and the fight against poverty in africa , the german and italian stance in the run-up to the july summit of the eight most influential industrialized countries in gleneagles , scotland , may mean a unique opportunity to help africa is lost for ever . united europe would have power to persuade us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only with a united eu front can blair expect to persuade bush to help africa .
if europe can deliver on an improved aid deal , the prime minister will command the political and moral authority to pressure less-than-convinced g8 countries - namely the us , canada and japan - that the initiative can work .
blair has a powerful ally in french president jacques chirac and has been boosted by the support of the russian federation . but the major stumbling block to the united european effort appears to be of berlin origin .

eu foreign ministers sparred sunday over budget questions , as the prospect of early general elections in germany injected fresh uncertainty into the talks , already dogged by britain 's vow to hold onto its budget rebate . the ministers met over dinner in brussels to sound each other out over their positions on the eu 's long-term budget , before getting down to bargaining at an official gathering on monday . luxembourg , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , was aiming to broker a deal between the union 's 25 members that can be signed at a summit here on june 16 and 17 , but the negotiations were being held up by britain 's refusal to reconsider the rebate on budget contributions that former prime minister margaret thatcher won in 1984 . repercussions of german elections the announcement sunday of early elections in germany raised new questions about the negotiating position of the biggest contributor to the budget . " it 's an important point that should not automatically make things easy , but that 's up to germany to decide , " nicolas schmidt , luxembourg 's deputy foreign minister , said . luxembourg was trying to bring minds together with a proposal that includes a suggestion to freeze and then reduce the british rebate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , that proposition raised the ire of britain who , through the voice of foreign secretary jack straw , insisted that his government aimed to keep the rebate , which is supposed to compensate for the fact britain receives less from eu agricultural funds than other nations . it was justified in 1984 when it was agreed , it is justified today and we will not hesitate to use our veto if it is necessary , " straw said in the face of growing opposition to the rebate by other countries . limiting the budget luxembourg wants an agreement before britain takes over the presidency for six months in july , during which the budget issue is likely to languish if there is no deal beforehand .
with that aim , luxembourg was to sound out eu leaders on their positions in order to make progress at a foreign ministers meeting planned for june 13 . the battle lines over the budget for the period from 2007 to 2013 were roughly drawn between the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , which wants to have as much money available as possible , and the six biggest net contributors - britain , france , germany , austria , sweden and the netherlands , which want to limit the budget . the commission was angling for a budget of one trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.26 trillion -rrb- while the six countries have demanded that the budget be capped at 815 billion euros , or 1.0 percent of gross national income as a compromise , luxembourg has proposed an overall budget ranging from 865 billion euros to 900 billion euros , representing the equivalent of 1.06 to 1.09 percent of gni . policy consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso gave a lukewarm reaction to the luxembourg proposal , saying it was " a step forward in some ways because for the first time we have all the key elements of the package set out for negotiations , " but was not " a proposal capable of moving the union forward over the next few years .

eu foreign ministers sparred sunday over budget questions , as the prospect of early general elections in germany injected fresh uncertainty into the talks , already dogged by britain 's vow to hold onto its budget rebate . the ministers met over dinner in brussels to sound each other out over their positions on the eu 's long-term budget , before getting down to bargaining at an official gathering on monday . luxembourg , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , was aiming to broker a deal between the union 's 25 members that can be signed at a summit here on june 16 and 17 , but the negotiations were being held up by britain 's refusal to reconsider the rebate on budget contributions that former prime minister margaret thatcher won in 1984 . repercussions of german elections the announcement sunday of early elections in germany raised new questions about the negotiating position of the biggest contributor to the budget . " it 's an important point that should not automatically make things easy , but that 's up to germany to decide , " nicolas schmidt , luxembourg 's deputy foreign minister , said . luxembourg was trying to bring minds together with a proposal that includes a suggestion to freeze and then reduce the british rebate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , that proposition raised the ire of britain who , through the voice of foreign secretary jack straw , insisted that his government aimed to keep the rebate , which is supposed to compensate for the fact britain receives less from eu agricultural funds than other nations . it was justified in 1984 when it was agreed , it is justified today and we will not hesitate to use our veto if it is necessary , " straw said in the face of growing opposition to the rebate by other countries . limiting the budget luxembourg wants an agreement before britain takes over the presidency for six months in july , during which the budget issue is likely to languish if there is no deal beforehand .
with that aim , luxembourg was to sound out eu leaders on their positions in order to make progress at a foreign ministers meeting planned for june 13 . the battle lines over the budget for the period from 2007 to 2013 were roughly drawn between the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , which wants to have as much money available as possible , and the six biggest net contributors - britain , france , germany , austria , sweden and the netherlands , which want to limit the budget . the commission was angling for a budget of one trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.26 trillion -rrb- while the six countries have demanded that the budget be capped at 815 billion euros , or 1.0 percent of gross national income as a compromise , luxembourg has proposed an overall budget ranging from 865 billion euros to 900 billion euros , representing the equivalent of 1.06 to 1.09 percent of gni . policy consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso gave a lukewarm reaction to the luxembourg proposal , saying it was " a step forward in some ways because for the first time we have all the key elements of the package set out for negotiations , " but was not " a proposal capable of moving the union forward over the next few years . " the luxembourg proposals showed an " underlying lack of ambition which is disappointing ... and could cost us very much in terms of credibility when judged against commitments we have already made , " barroso said .
" the budget is not an abstract set of figures , it has hard policy consequences .

" why does nobody like us anymore ? " it asked in its monday edition .
" we have no friends . " there may be little genuine substance to the claim , but perhaps germany and its gracia have some grounds to feel the throb of a disjointed nose .
in fact if , as the paper suggests , the depth of euro friendship is indeed measured by the number of points awarded on contest night , then germany has but two - monaco and moldavia - and not very good ones at that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " even the granny from moldavia did better than us , " said the paper two points from each and a pathetic 24th-place defeat triggered a tirade of " is this all the thanks we get " comments from germany 's boulevard press . " we pay for everyone , will soon even be paying for rumania too , but even they give us ' zero points . '
welcome to europe , " the paper said . and as the rant continued , it asked " what about spain which gets our holiday money ?
or poland , whose workers earn their wages from us ?
or turkey , whose kebabs we consume ?
or england , which we allow to win the battle for the sun-loungers around the holiday pool ? " it must be hard to be so generous , and even more so to maintain such levels of graciousness .

eu foreign ministers sparred sunday over budget questions , as the prospect of early general elections in germany injected fresh uncertainty into the talks , already dogged by britain 's vow to hold onto its budget rebate . the ministers met over dinner in brussels to sound each other out over their positions on the eu 's long-term budget , before getting down to bargaining at an official gathering on monday . luxembourg , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , was aiming to broker a deal between the union 's 25 members that can be signed at a summit here on june 16 and 17 , but the negotiations were being held up by britain 's refusal to reconsider the rebate on budget contributions that former prime minister margaret thatcher won in 1984 . repercussions of german elections the announcement sunday of early elections in germany raised new questions about the negotiating position of the biggest contributor to the budget . " it 's an important point that should not automatically make things easy , but that 's up to germany to decide , " nicolas schmidt , luxembourg 's deputy foreign minister , said . luxembourg was trying to bring minds together with a proposal that includes a suggestion to freeze and then reduce the british rebate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , that proposition raised the ire of britain who , through the voice of foreign secretary jack straw , insisted that his government aimed to keep the rebate , which is supposed to compensate for the fact britain receives less from eu agricultural funds than other nations . it was justified in 1984 when it was agreed , it is justified today and we will not hesitate to use our veto if it is necessary , " straw said in the face of growing opposition to the rebate by other countries . limiting the budget luxembourg wants an agreement before britain takes over the presidency for six months in july , during which the budget issue is likely to languish if there is no deal beforehand .
with that aim , luxembourg was to sound out eu leaders on their positions in order to make progress at a foreign ministers meeting planned for june 13 . the battle lines over the budget for the period from 2007 to 2013 were roughly drawn between the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , which wants to have as much money available as possible , and the six biggest net contributors - britain , france , germany , austria , sweden and the netherlands , which want to limit the budget . the commission was angling for a budget of one trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.26 trillion -rrb- while the six countries have demanded that the budget be capped at 815 billion euros , or 1.0 percent of gross national income as a compromise , luxembourg has proposed an overall budget ranging from 865 billion euros to 900 billion euros , representing the equivalent of 1.06 to 1.09 percent of gni . policy consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso gave a lukewarm reaction to the luxembourg proposal , saying it was " a step forward in some ways because for the first time we have all the key elements of the package set out for negotiations , " but was not " a proposal capable of moving the union forward over the next few years . " the luxembourg proposals showed an " underlying lack of ambition which is disappointing ... and could cost us very much in terms of credibility when judged against commitments we have already made , " barroso said .

the bundestag vote then has to take place 48 hours after schröder puts forward what 's known as the vote of confidence , set to take place on july 1 .
if the chancellor loses this vote , new elections can take place earlier than planned , in accordance with article 68 of the constitution , which states that " if a motion of a federal chancellor for a vote of confidence is not assented to by the majority of the members of the bundestag , the federal president may , upon the proposal of the federal chancellor , dissolve the bundestag within twenty-one days .
the right to dissolve shall lapse as soon as the bundestag with the majority of its members elects another federal chancellor . "

this , however , presupposes a candidate for office is already waiting in the wings , who can depend on the support of a bundestag majority .
the constructive no-confidence vote makes it harder to remove a chancellor because opponents of the chancellor not only must disagree with his or her governing but also must agree on a replacement historical precedents early elections in germany are highly unusual .

the bundestag vote then has to take place 48 hours after schröder puts forward what 's known as the vote of confidence , set to take place on july 1 .
if the chancellor loses this vote , new elections can take place earlier than planned , in accordance with article 68 of the constitution , which states that " if a motion of a federal chancellor for a vote of confidence is not assented to by the majority of the members of the bundestag , the federal president may , upon the proposal of the federal chancellor , dissolve the bundestag within twenty-one days .
the right to dissolve shall lapse as soon as the bundestag with the majority of its members elects another federal chancellor . "

the federal president must comply with the request and appoint the person elected . "
this , however , presupposes a candidate for office is already waiting in the wings , who can depend on the support of a bundestag majority .
the constructive no-confidence vote makes it harder to remove a chancellor because opponents of the chancellor not only must disagree with his or her governing but also must agree on a replacement historical precedents early elections in germany are highly unusual .
the first time they took place was in 1972 , initiated by chancellor willy brandt .

germany 's public deficit is expected to hit 3.6 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- this year , well in excess of the 3.0 percent limit required under the eu stability and growth pact , according to a government document quoted by the press .
the sunday paper die welt am sonntag said the shortfall in tax revenues would total five billion euros -lrb- $ 6.3 billion -rrb- , while 10 billion would be needed to combat unemployment .
a finance ministry spokesman saturday queried the figures given by the paper , but admitted this year 's budget would have problems .
on may 12 finance minister hans eichel admitted it was becoming " more and more difficult " to bring the deficit back within european union limits .
germany , the euro zone 's biggest economy , has been in breach of the 3.0 percent barrier for the past three years and , despite government pledges to rein in the deficit , observers believe the ratio will again be exceeded .
the problem for the government is that slow growth and high unemployment are tearing big holes in its public finances . dw-world.de eu reviews stability pact sinners eu finance ministers at their meeting tuesday discussed the status of countries in violation of the stability and growth pact : while germany and greece seem to be improving , italy might face sanctions in the near future .

the new aid targets are part of an agenda being discussed by european union foreign ministers in brussels on monday and tuesday . the news that germany and italy , two of britain 's european allies in the g8 , are resisting calls to contribute to the new targets has put the brakes on blair 's plan to secure an historic deal for africa before his expected stepping-down sometime in this his third and touted final term in office . the revelation that the two european forces are unwilling to get on board with blair 's project will do nothing to help in the struggle to get the most financially powerful partner , the united states , involved in the new initiative to alleviate africa 's crippling debt and double the continent 's aid package . increased contributions could mean billions for aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new aid targets for 2010 project that each member state would be required to increase the amount paid from 0.33 percent of gross national income to an average of 0.56 percent . this , according to european commission figures , would mean an increase of 20 billion euros on current levels .
anti-poverty campaigners would prefer to see an increase to 0.7 per cent , a figure agreed by european countries in 1970 but still to be introduced . the british government is already facing a tough task to persuade us president george w. bush to sign up and a further sign of division within the european union will do nothing to help the situation , officials fear . according to campaigners for debt relief and the fight against poverty in africa , the german and italian stance in the run-up to the july summit of the eight most influential industrialized countries in gleneagles , scotland , may mean a unique opportunity to help africa is lost for ever . united europe would have power to persuade us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only with a united eu front can blair expect to persuade bush to help africa .
if europe can deliver on an improved aid deal , the prime minister will command the political and moral authority to pressure less-than-convinced g8 countries - namely the us , canada and japan - that the initiative can work .
blair has a powerful ally in french president jacques chirac and has been boosted by the support of the russian federation . but the major stumbling block to the united european effort appears to be of berlin origin .
observers believe that italy might be climbing down from threats to also block a deal and growing pressure may sway the decision before the summit in july . domestic woes may spell disaster for africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , germany claims it is currently more preoccupied with domestic economic problems to expend much energy and cash in blair 's project for africa .

the new aid targets are part of an agenda being discussed by european union foreign ministers in brussels on monday and tuesday . the news that germany and italy , two of britain 's european allies in the g8 , are resisting calls to contribute to the new targets has put the brakes on blair 's plan to secure an historic deal for africa before his expected stepping-down sometime in this his third and touted final term in office . the revelation that the two european forces are unwilling to get on board with blair 's project will do nothing to help in the struggle to get the most financially powerful partner , the united states , involved in the new initiative to alleviate africa 's crippling debt and double the continent 's aid package . increased contributions could mean billions for aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new aid targets for 2010 project that each member state would be required to increase the amount paid from 0.33 percent of gross national income to an average of 0.56 percent . this , according to european commission figures , would mean an increase of 20 billion euros on current levels .
anti-poverty campaigners would prefer to see an increase to 0.7 per cent , a figure agreed by european countries in 1970 but still to be introduced . the british government is already facing a tough task to persuade us president george w. bush to sign up and a further sign of division within the european union will do nothing to help the situation , officials fear . according to campaigners for debt relief and the fight against poverty in africa , the german and italian stance in the run-up to the july summit of the eight most influential industrialized countries in gleneagles , scotland , may mean a unique opportunity to help africa is lost for ever . united europe would have power to persuade us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only with a united eu front can blair expect to persuade bush to help africa .
if europe can deliver on an improved aid deal , the prime minister will command the political and moral authority to pressure less-than-convinced g8 countries - namely the us , canada and japan - that the initiative can work .
blair has a powerful ally in french president jacques chirac and has been boosted by the support of the russian federation . but the major stumbling block to the united european effort appears to be of berlin origin .
observers believe that italy might be climbing down from threats to also block a deal and growing pressure may sway the decision before the summit in july . domestic woes may spell disaster for africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , germany claims it is currently more preoccupied with domestic economic problems to expend much energy and cash in blair 's project for africa .

germany 's public deficit is expected to hit 3.6 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- this year , well in excess of the 3.0 percent limit required under the eu stability and growth pact , according to a government document quoted by the press .
the sunday paper die welt am sonntag said the shortfall in tax revenues would total five billion euros -lrb- $ 6.3 billion -rrb- , while 10 billion would be needed to combat unemployment .
a finance ministry spokesman saturday queried the figures given by the paper , but admitted this year 's budget would have problems .
on may 12 finance minister hans eichel admitted it was becoming " more and more difficult " to bring the deficit back within european union limits .
germany , the euro zone 's biggest economy , has been in breach of the 3.0 percent barrier for the past three years and , despite government pledges to rein in the deficit , observers believe the ratio will again be exceeded .
the problem for the government is that slow growth and high unemployment are tearing big holes in its public finances . dw-world.de eu reviews stability pact sinners eu finance ministers at their meeting tuesday discussed the status of countries in violation of the stability and growth pact : while germany and greece seem to be improving , italy might face sanctions in the near future .

germany 's public deficit is expected to hit 3.6 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- this year , well in excess of the 3.0 percent limit required under the eu stability and growth pact , according to a government document quoted by the press .
the sunday paper die welt am sonntag said the shortfall in tax revenues would total five billion euros -lrb- $ 6.3 billion -rrb- , while 10 billion would be needed to combat unemployment .
a finance ministry spokesman saturday queried the figures given by the paper , but admitted this year 's budget would have problems .
on may 12 finance minister hans eichel admitted it was becoming " more and more difficult " to bring the deficit back within european union limits .
germany , the euro zone 's biggest economy , has been in breach of the 3.0 percent barrier for the past three years and , despite government pledges to rein in the deficit , observers believe the ratio will again be exceeded .
the problem for the government is that slow growth and high unemployment are tearing big holes in its public finances . dw-world.de eu reviews stability pact sinners eu finance ministers at their meeting tuesday discussed the status of countries in violation of the stability and growth pact : while germany and greece seem to be improving , italy might face sanctions in the near future .

germany 's public deficit is expected to hit 3.6 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- this year , well in excess of the 3.0 percent limit required under the eu stability and growth pact , according to a government document quoted by the press .
the sunday paper die welt am sonntag said the shortfall in tax revenues would total five billion euros -lrb- $ 6.3 billion -rrb- , while 10 billion would be needed to combat unemployment .
a finance ministry spokesman saturday queried the figures given by the paper , but admitted this year 's budget would have problems .
on may 12 finance minister hans eichel admitted it was becoming " more and more difficult " to bring the deficit back within european union limits .
germany , the euro zone 's biggest economy , has been in breach of the 3.0 percent barrier for the past three years and , despite government pledges to rein in the deficit , observers believe the ratio will again be exceeded .
the problem for the government is that slow growth and high unemployment are tearing big holes in its public finances . dw-world.de eu reviews stability pact sinners eu finance ministers at their meeting tuesday discussed the status of countries in violation of the stability and growth pact : while germany and greece seem to be improving , italy might face sanctions in the near future .

germany 's public deficit is expected to hit 3.6 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- this year , well in excess of the 3.0 percent limit required under the eu stability and growth pact , according to a government document quoted by the press .
the sunday paper die welt am sonntag said the shortfall in tax revenues would total five billion euros -lrb- $ 6.3 billion -rrb- , while 10 billion would be needed to combat unemployment .
a finance ministry spokesman saturday queried the figures given by the paper , but admitted this year 's budget would have problems .
on may 12 finance minister hans eichel admitted it was becoming " more and more difficult " to bring the deficit back within european union limits .
germany , the euro zone 's biggest economy , has been in breach of the 3.0 percent barrier for the past three years and , despite government pledges to rein in the deficit , observers believe the ratio will again be exceeded .
the problem for the government is that slow growth and high unemployment are tearing big holes in its public finances . dw-world.de eu reviews stability pact sinners eu finance ministers at their meeting tuesday discussed the status of countries in violation of the stability and growth pact : while germany and greece seem to be improving , italy might face sanctions in the near future .

and in the period from january to april , around eight billion euros -lrb- $ 10 billion -rrb- were paid out in benefits , already more than half of the 14.6 billion euros budgeted for the whole of 2005 , the ministry revealed in its latest monthly report .

a figure of that magnitude would be disastrous for the government 's efforts to bring the public deficit back within eu limits .
the shortfall would widen to 17.1 billion euros next year and amount to a total 66.8 billion euros for the whole period from 2005 to 2008 . dw-world.de gloomy news again for german economy instead of building on last year 's recovery , the german economy appears to be heading downhill again .

"
new elections , the paper said , represent " a gamble on power .
the social democrats saw the disaster coming , they were ready for it and they tried to weather it .
but it was far greater than expected , and the psychological and political repercussions for the red-green coalition government only began to emerge as the results were revealed on the television screens .
but as long as there can be an election , there can be hope - even if it is hope for a miracle . " the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote that " after this tectonic shift , schröder has little choice but to make a virtue of necessity , if he wants to avoid a crushing defeat in the next bundestag elections .
the box of tricks he 's been using until now is more or less empty .
the fact that schröder missed his chance to secure his position against the worst consequences of losing his majority in the bundesrat with a reform of the federal system has come back to haunt him .
if the government now tried renegotiating in order to win back some room to maneuver , it would inevitably be in a worse position than it was in december .
schröder would have to swallow a bitter pill : a change of coalition , resignation , new elections . "
schröder 's move after sunday 's devastating loss in germany 's most populous state was " an admission of defeat " , said the financial times .
" the scale of the spd 's defeat reflected popular resentment at mr schröder 's economic policy - viewed as far too business-friendly - and his cuts to the country 's traditionally generous welfare state .
with many in the spd demanding a shift to the left in a bid to win back core voters , mr schröder could face a bruising battle with his grassroots as he draws up the party 's election platform .
-lrb- a general election in four months -rrb- could mean the resumption of economic reforms as soon as the autumn - either by a freshly legitimized mr schröder or by a conservative-led government .
it would also dispel fears that the nation could be doomed to spend the next 16 months in a paralysing pre-election limbo . "
the center-left guardian noted that calling early elections was not accepted practice in germany and quoted a social democrat , furious at the chancellor 's decision , calling it " political suicide . "
schröder 's chances of winning a third term as chancellor appear bleak , commented the daily .
" while it is too early to write him off entirely , germany appears to be heading for another period of center-right government , and its first ever woman chancellor - the christian democrats ' leader , angela merkel .
before last night 's disaster , mr schröder was facing growing pressure to dump some of his controversial reforms to the country 's social welfare system .
instead of changing course , he appears to be trying to regain the initiative by going to the polls . "
the center-right times said a " humbled " schröder had taken a " panicked decision , " which clearly shows how deeply the defeat has hurt the government .
analysts quoted by the paper said the election might pave the way " for a grand coalition between the christian democrats and the social democrats in some form of broad cross-party reforming alliance .
it will paralyze germany , the world 's third-largest economy , unless schröder can win a new mandate for his unpopular program to overhaul its stagnant economy and lumbering welfare state .
on yesterday ’ s showing , his chances are slight .
his popular mandate is melting by the day and left-wingers within his party are demanding that he perform a u-turn .

the box of tricks he 's been using until now is more or less empty .
the fact that schröder missed his chance to secure his position against the worst consequences of losing his majority in the bundesrat with a reform of the federal system has come back to haunt him .
if the government now tried renegotiating in order to win back some room to maneuver , it would inevitably be in a worse position than it was in december .
schröder would have to swallow a bitter pill : a change of coalition , resignation , new elections . "
schröder 's move after sunday 's devastating loss in germany 's most populous state was " an admission of defeat " , said the financial times .
" the scale of the spd 's defeat reflected popular resentment at mr schröder 's economic policy - viewed as far too business-friendly - and his cuts to the country 's traditionally generous welfare state .
with many in the spd demanding a shift to the left in a bid to win back core voters , mr schröder could face a bruising battle with his grassroots as he draws up the party 's election platform .
-lrb- a general election in four months -rrb- could mean the resumption of economic reforms as soon as the autumn - either by a freshly legitimized mr schröder or by a conservative-led government .
it would also dispel fears that the nation could be doomed to spend the next 16 months in a paralysing pre-election limbo . "
the center-left guardian noted that calling early elections was not accepted practice in germany and quoted a social democrat , furious at the chancellor 's decision , calling it " political suicide . "
schröder 's chances of winning a third term as chancellor appear bleak , commented the daily .
" while it is too early to write him off entirely , germany appears to be heading for another period of center-right government , and its first ever woman chancellor - the christian democrats ' leader , angela merkel .
before last night 's disaster , mr schröder was facing growing pressure to dump some of his controversial reforms to the country 's social welfare system .
instead of changing course , he appears to be trying to regain the initiative by going to the polls . "
the center-right times said a " humbled " schröder had taken a " panicked decision , " which clearly shows how deeply the defeat has hurt the government .
analysts quoted by the paper said the election might pave the way " for a grand coalition between the christian democrats and the social democrats in some form of broad cross-party reforming alliance .
it will paralyze germany , the world 's third-largest economy , unless schröder can win a new mandate for his unpopular program to overhaul its stagnant economy and lumbering welfare state .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.05.2005 germany 's early election affects eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder 's gamble could have far-reaching consequences for the eu german chancellor gerhard schröder 's call for early federal elections this fall is a high-stakes gamble not only for schröder and his social democrats at home , but for the european union as a whole . in responding to his party 's crippling defeat in its stronghold state of north rhine-westphalia with a call for a fresh ballot , the chancellor has essentially admitted defeat . his social democrat-green government coalition in berlin has long been facing an uphill battle against rampant unemployment , budget deficits , bad schools , and social problems connected to immigration .
such were the primary issues that drove the spd from power in germany 's largest state after 39 years at the helm .
and such are the issues which raise their heads in connection with public opposition to the european constitution which faces key votes in france and the netherlands next week . the bombshell defeat suffered by the social democrats here in germany on sunday could not have come at a worse time for the pro-european camp . what if ... ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is already a large " no " camp waiting to vote in france the consequences could be monumental and pundits everywhere are now asking the " what if " questions : what if this election signals to voters in france and holland that germans , too , do n't want the constitution ?
what if talks on key eu budget issues break down because finance ministers view schröder 's government as a lame duck ?
and what if schröder and his social democrats ultimately lose the early election he hopes to call ? most commentators agree that the election loss in north rhine-westphalia is a strong indicator that schröder 's party will be ousted from office in the next election .
and already , budget talks in brussels have been clouded because of germany 's decision to hold early elections . whether germany will continue to foot such a large portion of eu expenditure is now more uncertain than ever , and the implications of a potential shift in policy extend far beyond berlin . budget issues the eu is currently trying to convince britain to forego its budget rebate , but the prospect of a power switch in germany could sway london to resist the pressure to pay more into eu coffers . the battle lines over the budget are roughly drawn between the eu commission which wants as much money as possible , and the six biggest net contributors - germany , france , britain , the netherlands , sweden and austria - which want to limit the budget .
voters in germany , at least , see too much of their tax money disappearing down black holes in brussels while their own standards of living are diminishing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration is an ongoing issue in europe the commission also wants money to help fund eu eastward expansion .
but this is another sticking point in germany and elsewhere in europe , where voters fear further job losses and increased immigration . a change of government in berlin would be a big victory for the anti-immigration camp . as far as the new european constitution is concerned , if the referendums in france and the netherlands fail to win support for europe , this will almost certainly seal the defeat of schröder and the greens at an early federal election later this year . essentially , if the constitutional referendums fail , voters will be saying that europe must stop where it is and clean up the mess before moving on . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections in germany leaders of all german mainstream parties are meeting today to discuss the ramifications of early national elections this fall after the ruling social democrats suffered a blow in crucial state elections sunday .

"
new elections , the paper said , represent " a gamble on power .
the social democrats saw the disaster coming , they were ready for it and they tried to weather it .
but it was far greater than expected , and the psychological and political repercussions for the red-green coalition government only began to emerge as the results were revealed on the television screens .
but as long as there can be an election , there can be hope - even if it is hope for a miracle . " the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote that " after this tectonic shift , schröder has little choice but to make a virtue of necessity , if he wants to avoid a crushing defeat in the next bundestag elections .
the box of tricks he 's been using until now is more or less empty .
the fact that schröder missed his chance to secure his position against the worst consequences of losing his majority in the bundesrat with a reform of the federal system has come back to haunt him .
if the government now tried renegotiating in order to win back some room to maneuver , it would inevitably be in a worse position than it was in december .
schröder would have to swallow a bitter pill : a change of coalition , resignation , new elections . "
schröder 's move after sunday 's devastating loss in germany 's most populous state was " an admission of defeat " , said the financial times .
" the scale of the spd 's defeat reflected popular resentment at mr schröder 's economic policy - viewed as far too business-friendly - and his cuts to the country 's traditionally generous welfare state .
with many in the spd demanding a shift to the left in a bid to win back core voters , mr schröder could face a bruising battle with his grassroots as he draws up the party 's election platform .
-lrb- a general election in four months -rrb- could mean the resumption of economic reforms as soon as the autumn - either by a freshly legitimized mr schröder or by a conservative-led government .
it would also dispel fears that the nation could be doomed to spend the next 16 months in a paralysing pre-election limbo . "
the center-left guardian noted that calling early elections was not accepted practice in germany and quoted a social democrat , furious at the chancellor 's decision , calling it " political suicide . "
schröder 's chances of winning a third term as chancellor appear bleak , commented the daily .
" while it is too early to write him off entirely , germany appears to be heading for another period of center-right government , and its first ever woman chancellor - the christian democrats ' leader , angela merkel .
before last night 's disaster , mr schröder was facing growing pressure to dump some of his controversial reforms to the country 's social welfare system .
instead of changing course , he appears to be trying to regain the initiative by going to the polls . "
the center-right times said a " humbled " schröder had taken a " panicked decision , " which clearly shows how deeply the defeat has hurt the government .
analysts quoted by the paper said the election might pave the way " for a grand coalition between the christian democrats and the social democrats in some form of broad cross-party reforming alliance .
it will paralyze germany , the world 's third-largest economy , unless schröder can win a new mandate for his unpopular program to overhaul its stagnant economy and lumbering welfare state .
on yesterday ’ s showing , his chances are slight .
his popular mandate is melting by the day and left-wingers within his party are demanding that he perform a u-turn .

the bundestag vote then has to take place 48 hours after schröder puts forward what 's known as the vote of confidence , set to take place on july 1 .
if the chancellor loses this vote , new elections can take place earlier than planned , in accordance with article 68 of the constitution , which states that " if a motion of a federal chancellor for a vote of confidence is not assented to by the majority of the members of the bundestag , the federal president may , upon the proposal of the federal chancellor , dissolve the bundestag within twenty-one days .
the right to dissolve shall lapse as soon as the bundestag with the majority of its members elects another federal chancellor . "
presidential discretion the operative word here is " may . "
the president can act upon the chancellor 's proposal to dissolve the bundestag , but he does n't have to .
it 's up to him to decide whether the chancellor 's decision is in keeping with constitutional principles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for the time being , president horst köhler -lrb- photo -rrb- has remained silent on the issue .
according to his spokesperson , he was carefully considering the matter before meeting with schröder on monday .
a further option available to berlin is the constructive vote of no confidence laid out in article 67 , which states that " the bundestag can express its lack of confidence in the federal chancellor only by electing a successor with the majority of its members and by requesting the federal president to dismiss the federal chancellor .
the federal president must comply with the request and appoint the person elected . "
this , however , presupposes a candidate for office is already waiting in the wings , who can depend on the support of a bundestag majority .
the constructive no-confidence vote makes it harder to remove a chancellor because opponents of the chancellor not only must disagree with his or her governing but also must agree on a replacement historical precedents early elections in germany are highly unusual .
the first time they took place was in 1972 , initiated by chancellor willy brandt .
he forced the premature dissolution of the bundestag by president gustav heinemann in order to secure a stable majority in the ensuing election , which he won with an impressive relative majority of nearly 45 percent .

he was subsequently voted out of office in october 1982 through a constructive vote of no confidence .

" i deem it necessary to seek majority support for continued social and economic reforms , " the german chancellor said on sunday evening .
" i see it as my responsibility and duty to persuade the federal president to call early elections at the national level as quickly as possible , realistically by autumn 2005 . " strategic maneuver bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder as he made the announcement on sunday the chancellor 's announcement came as a surprise to both his friends and foes . and with voters still reeling from schröder 's much-loathed incisions into the generous state welfare system , this call for an early ballot is nothing short of a gamble for both the chancellor and his party . record high unemployment rates have gradually been eating away at voter confidence in the spd-green coalition .
dieter wiefelspütz , the party 's interior affairs spokesman , said that the chancellor has to find out as quickly as possible whether his reform course still has the backing of the population at national level .
he added that calling for early elections is the logical consequence . " i think this is an interesting move to avoid political stagnation in the country , " he said .
" i must say the announcement came as a big surprise to me .
we 'll have thrilling weeks and months ahead of us . " strategic move but under the german constitution , the chancellor can not simply call fresh elections .
schröder will have to hold a vote of confidence in the national parliament and have his followers turn him down deliberately in order to pave the way for early elections . the president , horst köhler then has 21 days to decide whether or not to dissolve parliament , but constitutional experts doubt the legality of this step . should his call for early elections , however , be heeded , schröder would use the coming months to sharpen the profile of his party and convince the german people that the opposition christian democrats have even more painful reforms up their sleeves , and have no regard for workers ' rights . there is widespread agreement among germans that early elections in may would help to get the country out of the doldrums . industry leaders emphasize that germany can not afford to continue doing nothing until the scheduled date for a national poll at the end of 2006 . schröder versus merkel ? if fresh elections are set for the autumn , schröder will run as the spd 's candidate just weeks after having been given a vote of no confidence in the bundestag . bildunterschrift : angela merkel is schröder 's most likely challenger at the moment , success at national level seems unlikely for the chancellor and his crew , which is lacking cohesion . for the opposition christian democrats , the task ahead is somewhat easier . cdu leader angela merkel , who is likely to challenge schröder in the general election in a bid to become germany 's first woman leader , described sunday 's north rhine-westphalia as a " sensational result . " " the voters ... have shown hope in us and in the future state leader jürgen rüttgers because the problems are so great and they want us to shape a policy that will bring down unemployment , " merkel said . she welcomed the possibility of an early election .

"
new elections , the paper said , represent " a gamble on power .
the social democrats saw the disaster coming , they were ready for it and they tried to weather it .
but it was far greater than expected , and the psychological and political repercussions for the red-green coalition government only began to emerge as the results were revealed on the television screens .
but as long as there can be an election , there can be hope - even if it is hope for a miracle . " the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote that " after this tectonic shift , schröder has little choice but to make a virtue of necessity , if he wants to avoid a crushing defeat in the next bundestag elections .
the box of tricks he 's been using until now is more or less empty .
the fact that schröder missed his chance to secure his position against the worst consequences of losing his majority in the bundesrat with a reform of the federal system has come back to haunt him .
if the government now tried renegotiating in order to win back some room to maneuver , it would inevitably be in a worse position than it was in december .
schröder would have to swallow a bitter pill : a change of coalition , resignation , new elections . "
schröder 's move after sunday 's devastating loss in germany 's most populous state was " an admission of defeat " , said the financial times .
" the scale of the spd 's defeat reflected popular resentment at mr schröder 's economic policy - viewed as far too business-friendly - and his cuts to the country 's traditionally generous welfare state .
with many in the spd demanding a shift to the left in a bid to win back core voters , mr schröder could face a bruising battle with his grassroots as he draws up the party 's election platform .
-lrb- a general election in four months -rrb- could mean the resumption of economic reforms as soon as the autumn - either by a freshly legitimized mr schröder or by a conservative-led government .
it would also dispel fears that the nation could be doomed to spend the next 16 months in a paralysing pre-election limbo . "
the center-left guardian noted that calling early elections was not accepted practice in germany and quoted a social democrat , furious at the chancellor 's decision , calling it " political suicide . "
schröder 's chances of winning a third term as chancellor appear bleak , commented the daily .
" while it is too early to write him off entirely , germany appears to be heading for another period of center-right government , and its first ever woman chancellor - the christian democrats ' leader , angela merkel .
before last night 's disaster , mr schröder was facing growing pressure to dump some of his controversial reforms to the country 's social welfare system .
instead of changing course , he appears to be trying to regain the initiative by going to the polls . "
the center-right times said a " humbled " schröder had taken a " panicked decision , " which clearly shows how deeply the defeat has hurt the government .
analysts quoted by the paper said the election might pave the way " for a grand coalition between the christian democrats and the social democrats in some form of broad cross-party reforming alliance .
it will paralyze germany , the world 's third-largest economy , unless schröder can win a new mandate for his unpopular program to overhaul its stagnant economy and lumbering welfare state .
on yesterday ’ s showing , his chances are slight .
his popular mandate is melting by the day and left-wingers within his party are demanding that he perform a u-turn .

the center-left guardian noted that calling early elections was not accepted practice in germany and quoted a social democrat , furious at the chancellor 's decision , calling it " political suicide . "
schröder 's chances of winning a third term as chancellor appear bleak , commented the daily .
" while it is too early to write him off entirely , germany appears to be heading for another period of center-right government , and its first ever woman chancellor - the christian democrats ' leader , angela merkel .
before last night 's disaster , mr schröder was facing growing pressure to dump some of his controversial reforms to the country 's social welfare system .
instead of changing course , he appears to be trying to regain the initiative by going to the polls . "
the center-right times said a " humbled " schröder had taken a " panicked decision , " which clearly shows how deeply the defeat has hurt the government .
analysts quoted by the paper said the election might pave the way " for a grand coalition between the christian democrats and the social democrats in some form of broad cross-party reforming alliance .
it will paralyze germany , the world 's third-largest economy , unless schröder can win a new mandate for his unpopular program to overhaul its stagnant economy and lumbering welfare state .
on yesterday ’ s showing , his chances are slight .
his popular mandate is melting by the day and left-wingers within his party are demanding that he perform a u-turn .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.05.2005 schröder pins hopes on vote of confidence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resorting to desperate measures if germany is to go to the polls this autumn , chancellor schröder will have to set in motion a complex constitutional mechanism for bringing the elections forward . first of all , the chancellor has to submit a motion to parliament to establish whether he still has majority support .
the bundestag vote then has to take place 48 hours after schröder puts forward what 's known as the vote of confidence , set to take place on july 1 .
if the chancellor loses this vote , new elections can take place earlier than planned , in accordance with article 68 of the constitution , which states that " if a motion of a federal chancellor for a vote of confidence is not assented to by the majority of the members of the bundestag , the federal president may , upon the proposal of the federal chancellor , dissolve the bundestag within twenty-one days .
the right to dissolve shall lapse as soon as the bundestag with the majority of its members elects another federal chancellor . "
presidential discretion the operative word here is " may . "
the president can act upon the chancellor 's proposal to dissolve the bundestag , but he does n't have to .
it 's up to him to decide whether the chancellor 's decision is in keeping with constitutional principles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for the time being , president horst köhler -lrb- photo -rrb- has remained silent on the issue .
according to his spokesperson , he was carefully considering the matter before meeting with schröder on monday .
a further option available to berlin is the constructive vote of no confidence laid out in article 67 , which states that " the bundestag can express its lack of confidence in the federal chancellor only by electing a successor with the majority of its members and by requesting the federal president to dismiss the federal chancellor .
the federal president must comply with the request and appoint the person elected . "
this , however , presupposes a candidate for office is already waiting in the wings , who can depend on the support of a bundestag majority .
the constructive no-confidence vote makes it harder to remove a chancellor because opponents of the chancellor not only must disagree with his or her governing but also must agree on a replacement historical precedents early elections in germany are highly unusual .
the first time they took place was in 1972 , initiated by chancellor willy brandt .
he forced the premature dissolution of the bundestag by president gustav heinemann in order to secure a stable majority in the ensuing election , which he won with an impressive relative majority of nearly 45 percent .

then , in february 1982 , chancellor helmut schmidt called a vote of confidence , winning by 269-224 votes - despite tensions between the coalition partners , the sdp and the fdp . the bundestag remained unchanged , but the coalition collapsed seven months later when the liberals joined forces with the cdu .
he was subsequently voted out of office in october 1982 through a constructive vote of no confidence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in december 1982 , it was helmut kohl 's turn .
he lost by 8-218 votes , with cdu and fdp mps abstaining .
germany went to the polls and voted kohl back for a second term .
in november 2001 , gerhard schröder called for a vote of confidence on german participation in the us-led " enduring freedom " mission in afghanistan - the largest ever military intervention by the bundeswehr .

the bundestag vote then has to take place 48 hours after schröder puts forward what 's known as the vote of confidence , set to take place on july 1 .
if the chancellor loses this vote , new elections can take place earlier than planned , in accordance with article 68 of the constitution , which states that " if a motion of a federal chancellor for a vote of confidence is not assented to by the majority of the members of the bundestag , the federal president may , upon the proposal of the federal chancellor , dissolve the bundestag within twenty-one days .
the right to dissolve shall lapse as soon as the bundestag with the majority of its members elects another federal chancellor . "

the federal president must comply with the request and appoint the person elected . "
this , however , presupposes a candidate for office is already waiting in the wings , who can depend on the support of a bundestag majority .
the constructive no-confidence vote makes it harder to remove a chancellor because opponents of the chancellor not only must disagree with his or her governing but also must agree on a replacement historical precedents early elections in germany are highly unusual .
the first time they took place was in 1972 , initiated by chancellor willy brandt .

" why does nobody like us anymore ? " it asked in its monday edition .
" we have no friends . " there may be little genuine substance to the claim , but perhaps germany and its gracia have some grounds to feel the throb of a disjointed nose .
in fact if , as the paper suggests , the depth of euro friendship is indeed measured by the number of points awarded on contest night , then germany has but two - monaco and moldavia - and not very good ones at that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " even the granny from moldavia did better than us , " said the paper two points from each and a pathetic 24th-place defeat triggered a tirade of " is this all the thanks we get " comments from germany 's boulevard press . " we pay for everyone , will soon even be paying for rumania too , but even they give us ' zero points . '
welcome to europe , " the paper said . and as the rant continued , it asked " what about spain which gets our holiday money ?
or poland , whose workers earn their wages from us ?
or turkey , whose kebabs we consume ?
or england , which we allow to win the battle for the sun-loungers around the holiday pool ? " it must be hard to be so generous , and even more so to maintain such levels of graciousness .

such were the primary issues that drove the spd from power in germany 's largest state after 39 years at the helm .
and such are the issues which raise their heads in connection with public opposition to the european constitution which faces key votes in france and the netherlands next week . the bombshell defeat suffered by the social democrats here in germany on sunday could not have come at a worse time for the pro-european camp . what if ... ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is already a large " no " camp waiting to vote in france the consequences could be monumental and pundits everywhere are now asking the " what if " questions : what if this election signals to voters in france and holland that germans , too , do n't want the constitution ?
what if talks on key eu budget issues break down because finance ministers view schröder 's government as a lame duck ?
and what if schröder and his social democrats ultimately lose the early election he hopes to call ? most commentators agree that the election loss in north rhine-westphalia is a strong indicator that schröder 's party will be ousted from office in the next election .
and already , budget talks in brussels have been clouded because of germany 's decision to hold early elections . whether germany will continue to foot such a large portion of eu expenditure is now more uncertain than ever , and the implications of a potential shift in policy extend far beyond berlin . budget issues the eu is currently trying to convince britain to forego its budget rebate , but the prospect of a power switch in germany could sway london to resist the pressure to pay more into eu coffers . the battle lines over the budget are roughly drawn between the eu commission which wants as much money as possible , and the six biggest net contributors - germany , france , britain , the netherlands , sweden and austria - which want to limit the budget .
voters in germany , at least , see too much of their tax money disappearing down black holes in brussels while their own standards of living are diminishing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : illegal immigration is an ongoing issue in europe the commission also wants money to help fund eu eastward expansion .
but this is another sticking point in germany and elsewhere in europe , where voters fear further job losses and increased immigration . a change of government in berlin would be a big victory for the anti-immigration camp . as far as the new european constitution is concerned , if the referendums in france and the netherlands fail to win support for europe , this will almost certainly seal the defeat of schröder and the greens at an early federal election later this year . essentially , if the constitutional referendums fail , voters will be saying that europe must stop where it is and clean up the mess before moving on . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections in germany leaders of all german mainstream parties are meeting today to discuss the ramifications of early national elections this fall after the ruling social democrats suffered a blow in crucial state elections sunday .

the bundestag vote then has to take place 48 hours after schröder puts forward what 's known as the vote of confidence , set to take place on july 1 .
if the chancellor loses this vote , new elections can take place earlier than planned , in accordance with article 68 of the constitution , which states that " if a motion of a federal chancellor for a vote of confidence is not assented to by the majority of the members of the bundestag , the federal president may , upon the proposal of the federal chancellor , dissolve the bundestag within twenty-one days .
the right to dissolve shall lapse as soon as the bundestag with the majority of its members elects another federal chancellor . "

this , however , presupposes a candidate for office is already waiting in the wings , who can depend on the support of a bundestag majority .
the constructive no-confidence vote makes it harder to remove a chancellor because opponents of the chancellor not only must disagree with his or her governing but also must agree on a replacement historical precedents early elections in germany are highly unusual .

public opinion is behind early elections , but does gerhard schröder really stand any chance of being re-elected ? opinion polls ahead of sunday 's ballot gave the social democrats , who had ruled in germany 's largest federal state of north rhine-westphalia for 39 years , little hope of holding onto the reins of power . but even in the face of that bitter expectation , politicians and public alike were nothing if not unprepared for gerhard schröder 's announcement . bildunterschrift : schröder on monday his political ambush is viewed as a scrambling attempt to cling to what power he has left by catching his opponents off-guard .

eu foreign ministers sparred sunday over budget questions , as the prospect of early general elections in germany injected fresh uncertainty into the talks , already dogged by britain 's vow to hold onto its budget rebate . the ministers met over dinner in brussels to sound each other out over their positions on the eu 's long-term budget , before getting down to bargaining at an official gathering on monday . luxembourg , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , was aiming to broker a deal between the union 's 25 members that can be signed at a summit here on june 16 and 17 , but the negotiations were being held up by britain 's refusal to reconsider the rebate on budget contributions that former prime minister margaret thatcher won in 1984 . repercussions of german elections the announcement sunday of early elections in germany raised new questions about the negotiating position of the biggest contributor to the budget . " it 's an important point that should not automatically make things easy , but that 's up to germany to decide , " nicolas schmidt , luxembourg 's deputy foreign minister , said . luxembourg was trying to bring minds together with a proposal that includes a suggestion to freeze and then reduce the british rebate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , that proposition raised the ire of britain who , through the voice of foreign secretary jack straw , insisted that his government aimed to keep the rebate , which is supposed to compensate for the fact britain receives less from eu agricultural funds than other nations . it was justified in 1984 when it was agreed , it is justified today and we will not hesitate to use our veto if it is necessary , " straw said in the face of growing opposition to the rebate by other countries . limiting the budget luxembourg wants an agreement before britain takes over the presidency for six months in july , during which the budget issue is likely to languish if there is no deal beforehand .
with that aim , luxembourg was to sound out eu leaders on their positions in order to make progress at a foreign ministers meeting planned for june 13 . the battle lines over the budget for the period from 2007 to 2013 were roughly drawn between the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , which wants to have as much money available as possible , and the six biggest net contributors - britain , france , germany , austria , sweden and the netherlands , which want to limit the budget . the commission was angling for a budget of one trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.26 trillion -rrb- while the six countries have demanded that the budget be capped at 815 billion euros , or 1.0 percent of gross national income as a compromise , luxembourg has proposed an overall budget ranging from 865 billion euros to 900 billion euros , representing the equivalent of 1.06 to 1.09 percent of gni . policy consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso gave a lukewarm reaction to the luxembourg proposal , saying it was " a step forward in some ways because for the first time we have all the key elements of the package set out for negotiations , " but was not " a proposal capable of moving the union forward over the next few years . " the luxembourg proposals showed an " underlying lack of ambition which is disappointing ... and could cost us very much in terms of credibility when judged against commitments we have already made , " barroso said .
" the budget is not an abstract set of figures , it has hard policy consequences .

" without this move , the time between now and fall 2006 would simply have been filled with empty political posturing , " said hypovereinsbank economist andreas rees .
he added that the reform process was more likely to be restarted if the opposition were to win the general election , because the christian union and liberal parties already hold the majority in the bundesrat . the prospect of additional reforms - including the further liberalization of the labor markets and a drastic simplification of the tax system - would buoy sentiment on the stock markets . industry applause the automobile industry has also welcomed the prospect of an early election .

but analysts say tackling unemployment and slow economic growth will be a tough ride for the opposition . a day after the crushing defeat of chancellor gerhard schroeder 's social democrat spd party in key regional elections in the state of north rhine-westphalia , the german stock market was in a cautiously optimistic mood , with the blue-chip dax 30 index showing a gain of 37.46 points or 0.86 percent at 4,398.14 points . investors were relieved that , following the spd 's landslide defeat in its former stronghold , schröder wanted to hold the next general election this fall , a year ahead of schedule . analysts say the move will avoid long months of economic and political paralysis as the conservative cdu / csu and liberal fdp parties block reform spd-green coalition reform initiatives in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat . " without this move , the time between now and fall 2006 would simply have been filled with empty political posturing , " said hypovereinsbank economist andreas rees .
he added that the reform process was more likely to be restarted if the opposition were to win the general election , because the christian union and liberal parties already hold the majority in the bundesrat . the prospect of additional reforms - including the further liberalization of the labor markets and a drastic simplification of the tax system - would buoy sentiment on the stock markets . industry applause the automobile industry has also welcomed the prospect of an early election .

hvb economist rees noted that the cdu in north rhine-westphalia had won more by default than on the argument for its own reform programs . ubs economist holger fahrinkrug agreed .
" the conservative parties do n't have an election platform as yet and , like the spd , they also have internal struggles on key policy issues , especially in the fields of social and labor market reforms , " he said . bildunterschrift : angela merkel gernot nerb , chief economist of the influential ifo think tank , also believed that the mere prospect of a change in government would not necessarily lead to a lasting improvement in economic sentiment in germany . concrete progress would have to be made in reforms first , nerb argued .
but banking and stock market professor wolfgang gerke disagreed .
" after the elections , there 's more chance that policies will become more reliable , more calculable , " he said .
" it 's not so important for many companies whether the spd or the cdu is in power .
they just want an end to the endless political manoeuvering and the political blockades .

eu foreign ministers sparred sunday over budget questions , as the prospect of early general elections in germany injected fresh uncertainty into the talks , already dogged by britain 's vow to hold onto its budget rebate . the ministers met over dinner in brussels to sound each other out over their positions on the eu 's long-term budget , before getting down to bargaining at an official gathering on monday . luxembourg , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , was aiming to broker a deal between the union 's 25 members that can be signed at a summit here on june 16 and 17 , but the negotiations were being held up by britain 's refusal to reconsider the rebate on budget contributions that former prime minister margaret thatcher won in 1984 . repercussions of german elections the announcement sunday of early elections in germany raised new questions about the negotiating position of the biggest contributor to the budget . " it 's an important point that should not automatically make things easy , but that 's up to germany to decide , " nicolas schmidt , luxembourg 's deputy foreign minister , said . luxembourg was trying to bring minds together with a proposal that includes a suggestion to freeze and then reduce the british rebate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , that proposition raised the ire of britain who , through the voice of foreign secretary jack straw , insisted that his government aimed to keep the rebate , which is supposed to compensate for the fact britain receives less from eu agricultural funds than other nations . it was justified in 1984 when it was agreed , it is justified today and we will not hesitate to use our veto if it is necessary , " straw said in the face of growing opposition to the rebate by other countries . limiting the budget luxembourg wants an agreement before britain takes over the presidency for six months in july , during which the budget issue is likely to languish if there is no deal beforehand .
with that aim , luxembourg was to sound out eu leaders on their positions in order to make progress at a foreign ministers meeting planned for june 13 . the battle lines over the budget for the period from 2007 to 2013 were roughly drawn between the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , which wants to have as much money available as possible , and the six biggest net contributors - britain , france , germany , austria , sweden and the netherlands , which want to limit the budget . the commission was angling for a budget of one trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.26 trillion -rrb- while the six countries have demanded that the budget be capped at 815 billion euros , or 1.0 percent of gross national income as a compromise , luxembourg has proposed an overall budget ranging from 865 billion euros to 900 billion euros , representing the equivalent of 1.06 to 1.09 percent of gni . policy consequences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president jose manuel barroso gave a lukewarm reaction to the luxembourg proposal , saying it was " a step forward in some ways because for the first time we have all the key elements of the package set out for negotiations , " but was not " a proposal capable of moving the union forward over the next few years .

but analysts say tackling unemployment and slow economic growth will be a tough ride for the opposition . a day after the crushing defeat of chancellor gerhard schroeder 's social democrat spd party in key regional elections in the state of north rhine-westphalia , the german stock market was in a cautiously optimistic mood , with the blue-chip dax 30 index showing a gain of 37.46 points or 0.86 percent at 4,398.14 points . investors were relieved that , following the spd 's landslide defeat in its former stronghold , schröder wanted to hold the next general election this fall , a year ahead of schedule . analysts say the move will avoid long months of economic and political paralysis as the conservative cdu / csu and liberal fdp parties block reform spd-green coalition reform initiatives in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.05.2005 schröder pins hopes on vote of confidence großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : resorting to desperate measures if germany is to go to the polls this autumn , chancellor schröder will have to set in motion a complex constitutional mechanism for bringing the elections forward . first of all , the chancellor has to submit a motion to parliament to establish whether he still has majority support .
the bundestag vote then has to take place 48 hours after schröder puts forward what 's known as the vote of confidence , set to take place on july 1 .
if the chancellor loses this vote , new elections can take place earlier than planned , in accordance with article 68 of the constitution , which states that " if a motion of a federal chancellor for a vote of confidence is not assented to by the majority of the members of the bundestag , the federal president may , upon the proposal of the federal chancellor , dissolve the bundestag within twenty-one days .
the right to dissolve shall lapse as soon as the bundestag with the majority of its members elects another federal chancellor . "
presidential discretion the operative word here is " may . "
the president can act upon the chancellor 's proposal to dissolve the bundestag , but he does n't have to .
it 's up to him to decide whether the chancellor 's decision is in keeping with constitutional principles .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : for the time being , president horst köhler -lrb- photo -rrb- has remained silent on the issue .
according to his spokesperson , he was carefully considering the matter before meeting with schröder on monday .
a further option available to berlin is the constructive vote of no confidence laid out in article 67 , which states that " the bundestag can express its lack of confidence in the federal chancellor only by electing a successor with the majority of its members and by requesting the federal president to dismiss the federal chancellor .
the federal president must comply with the request and appoint the person elected . "
this , however , presupposes a candidate for office is already waiting in the wings , who can depend on the support of a bundestag majority .
the constructive no-confidence vote makes it harder to remove a chancellor because opponents of the chancellor not only must disagree with his or her governing but also must agree on a replacement historical precedents early elections in germany are highly unusual .
the first time they took place was in 1972 , initiated by chancellor willy brandt .
he forced the premature dissolution of the bundestag by president gustav heinemann in order to secure a stable majority in the ensuing election , which he won with an impressive relative majority of nearly 45 percent .

but it also happens on their doorstep .
according to the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- study " human trafficking and exploitation in germany , " 360,000 of the 12.3 million people worldwide categorized as modern slaves live in industrialized countries , and an estimated 15,000 of them in germany - a country that has no fixed minimum wage . the ilo is now stepping up pressure for a global alliance to improve laws and raise awareness of what it calls a " hidden " issue . defining modern slavery " the term ' forced labor ' refers to a situation in which a person is being exploited against their will - forced to work under conditions they do not voluntarily accept , " explained norbert cyrus , author of the report .
it depicts the plight of poor or powerless victims , cowed by intimidation and sometimes even violence .
in germany 's worst cases , migrants are housed in basic , unhygienic accommodation with twenty people per room , working 80-hour weeks for negligible wages they have to wait months for - if they 're paid at all . globally , profits amassed on the back on forced labor amount to $ 32 billion -lrb- 25 billion euros -rrb- a year , 50 percent of which is pocketed in the western industrialized nations . in germany , two-thirds of this workforce are women .

" during a police raid on a brothel , officers might realize that some of the women are not there voluntarily , but it 's very difficult to recognize such cases , " said kok 's manager .
" police need to be sensitized to these situations with further training options .
then these women can be referred to advice centers , which can provide them with support throughout a court case , if they 're required to give evidence - which is a key aspect of clamping down on the problem , because taking legal action hinges almost entirely on personal testimonies .

" a lot of these women are traumatized , and help centers can provide them with protection and social support .
alone , they 're not usually in a position to seek help - they do n't speak the language , they 're not able to make contact with the outside world , " explained tanis from the kok .
as usual , however , " funding for these expert advice centers is facing ongoing cuts and they ca n't keep up with the number of cases they have to deal with .

but the picture painted of what awaits them bears little to resemblance to the harsh reality they actually encounter . norbert cyrus explained that many submit to their situation in the belief that any job is better than no job .
" hope of improvement and change keeps them going , " he said .

but it also happens on their doorstep .
according to the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- study " human trafficking and exploitation in germany , " 360,000 of the 12.3 million people worldwide categorized as modern slaves live in industrialized countries , and an estimated 15,000 of them in germany - a country that has no fixed minimum wage . the ilo is now stepping up pressure for a global alliance to improve laws and raise awareness of what it calls a " hidden " issue . defining modern slavery " the term ' forced labor ' refers to a situation in which a person is being exploited against their will - forced to work under conditions they do not voluntarily accept , " explained norbert cyrus , author of the report .
it depicts the plight of poor or powerless victims , cowed by intimidation and sometimes even violence .
in germany 's worst cases , migrants are housed in basic , unhygienic accommodation with twenty people per room , working 80-hour weeks for negligible wages they have to wait months for - if they 're paid at all . globally , profits amassed on the back on forced labor amount to $ 32 billion -lrb- 25 billion euros -rrb- a year , 50 percent of which is pocketed in the western industrialized nations . in germany , two-thirds of this workforce are women .

the new aid targets are part of an agenda being discussed by european union foreign ministers in brussels on monday and tuesday . the news that germany and italy , two of britain 's european allies in the g8 , are resisting calls to contribute to the new targets has put the brakes on blair 's plan to secure an historic deal for africa before his expected stepping-down sometime in this his third and touted final term in office . the revelation that the two european forces are unwilling to get on board with blair 's project will do nothing to help in the struggle to get the most financially powerful partner , the united states , involved in the new initiative to alleviate africa 's crippling debt and double the continent 's aid package . increased contributions could mean billions for aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new aid targets for 2010 project that each member state would be required to increase the amount paid from 0.33 percent of gross national income to an average of 0.56 percent . this , according to european commission figures , would mean an increase of 20 billion euros on current levels .
anti-poverty campaigners would prefer to see an increase to 0.7 per cent , a figure agreed by european countries in 1970 but still to be introduced . the british government is already facing a tough task to persuade us president george w. bush to sign up and a further sign of division within the european union will do nothing to help the situation , officials fear . according to campaigners for debt relief and the fight against poverty in africa , the german and italian stance in the run-up to the july summit of the eight most influential industrialized countries in gleneagles , scotland , may mean a unique opportunity to help africa is lost for ever . united europe would have power to persuade us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only with a united eu front can blair expect to persuade bush to help africa .
if europe can deliver on an improved aid deal , the prime minister will command the political and moral authority to pressure less-than-convinced g8 countries - namely the us , canada and japan - that the initiative can work .
blair has a powerful ally in french president jacques chirac and has been boosted by the support of the russian federation . but the major stumbling block to the united european effort appears to be of berlin origin .

the new aid targets are part of an agenda being discussed by european union foreign ministers in brussels on monday and tuesday . the news that germany and italy , two of britain 's european allies in the g8 , are resisting calls to contribute to the new targets has put the brakes on blair 's plan to secure an historic deal for africa before his expected stepping-down sometime in this his third and touted final term in office . the revelation that the two european forces are unwilling to get on board with blair 's project will do nothing to help in the struggle to get the most financially powerful partner , the united states , involved in the new initiative to alleviate africa 's crippling debt and double the continent 's aid package . increased contributions could mean billions for aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new aid targets for 2010 project that each member state would be required to increase the amount paid from 0.33 percent of gross national income to an average of 0.56 percent . this , according to european commission figures , would mean an increase of 20 billion euros on current levels .
anti-poverty campaigners would prefer to see an increase to 0.7 per cent , a figure agreed by european countries in 1970 but still to be introduced . the british government is already facing a tough task to persuade us president george w. bush to sign up and a further sign of division within the european union will do nothing to help the situation , officials fear . according to campaigners for debt relief and the fight against poverty in africa , the german and italian stance in the run-up to the july summit of the eight most influential industrialized countries in gleneagles , scotland , may mean a unique opportunity to help africa is lost for ever . united europe would have power to persuade us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only with a united eu front can blair expect to persuade bush to help africa .
if europe can deliver on an improved aid deal , the prime minister will command the political and moral authority to pressure less-than-convinced g8 countries - namely the us , canada and japan - that the initiative can work .
blair has a powerful ally in french president jacques chirac and has been boosted by the support of the russian federation . but the major stumbling block to the united european effort appears to be of berlin origin .
observers believe that italy might be climbing down from threats to also block a deal and growing pressure may sway the decision before the summit in july . domestic woes may spell disaster for africa bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , germany claims it is currently more preoccupied with domestic economic problems to expend much energy and cash in blair 's project for africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.05.2005 early elections in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stormy times ahead leaders of all german mainstream parties are meeting today to discuss the ramifications of early national elections this fall after the ruling social democrats suffered a blow in crucial state elections sunday . the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- won about 45 percent of the votes in germany 's most popular state of north rhine-westphalia , with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- trailing behind with just 37.2 percent . the defeat was the latest in a series of state election bungles for schröder 's spd . but this historic win for the cdu was one blow too many for chancellor gerhard schröder who sees himself deprived of enough political support for his reform drive . he is now calling for early elections , originally scheduled for 2006 to be brought forward to this autumn . " i deem it necessary to seek majority support for continued social and economic reforms , " the german chancellor said on sunday evening .
" i see it as my responsibility and duty to persuade the federal president to call early elections at the national level as quickly as possible , realistically by autumn 2005 . " strategic maneuver bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder as he made the announcement on sunday the chancellor 's announcement came as a surprise to both his friends and foes . and with voters still reeling from schröder 's much-loathed incisions into the generous state welfare system , this call for an early ballot is nothing short of a gamble for both the chancellor and his party . record high unemployment rates have gradually been eating away at voter confidence in the spd-green coalition .
dieter wiefelspütz , the party 's interior affairs spokesman , said that the chancellor has to find out as quickly as possible whether his reform course still has the backing of the population at national level .
he added that calling for early elections is the logical consequence . " i think this is an interesting move to avoid political stagnation in the country , " he said .
" i must say the announcement came as a big surprise to me .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.05.2005 early elections in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stormy times ahead leaders of all german mainstream parties are meeting today to discuss the ramifications of early national elections this fall after the ruling social democrats suffered a blow in crucial state elections sunday . the conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- won about 45 percent of the votes in germany 's most popular state of north rhine-westphalia , with the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- trailing behind with just 37.2 percent . the defeat was the latest in a series of state election bungles for schröder 's spd . but this historic win for the cdu was one blow too many for chancellor gerhard schröder who sees himself deprived of enough political support for his reform drive . he is now calling for early elections , originally scheduled for 2006 to be brought forward to this autumn . " i deem it necessary to seek majority support for continued social and economic reforms , " the german chancellor said on sunday evening .
" i see it as my responsibility and duty to persuade the federal president to call early elections at the national level as quickly as possible , realistically by autumn 2005 . " strategic maneuver bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder as he made the announcement on sunday the chancellor 's announcement came as a surprise to both his friends and foes . and with voters still reeling from schröder 's much-loathed incisions into the generous state welfare system , this call for an early ballot is nothing short of a gamble for both the chancellor and his party . record high unemployment rates have gradually been eating away at voter confidence in the spd-green coalition .
dieter wiefelspütz , the party 's interior affairs spokesman , said that the chancellor has to find out as quickly as possible whether his reform course still has the backing of the population at national level .
he added that calling for early elections is the logical consequence . " i think this is an interesting move to avoid political stagnation in the country , " he said .
" i must say the announcement came as a big surprise to me .
we 'll have thrilling weeks and months ahead of us . " strategic move but under the german constitution , the chancellor can not simply call fresh elections .
schröder will have to hold a vote of confidence in the national parliament and have his followers turn him down deliberately in order to pave the way for early elections . the president , horst köhler then has 21 days to decide whether or not to dissolve parliament , but constitutional experts doubt the legality of this step . should his call for early elections , however , be heeded , schröder would use the coming months to sharpen the profile of his party and convince the german people that the opposition christian democrats have even more painful reforms up their sleeves , and have no regard for workers ' rights . there is widespread agreement among germans that early elections in may would help to get the country out of the doldrums . industry leaders emphasize that germany can not afford to continue doing nothing until the scheduled date for a national poll at the end of 2006 . schröder versus merkel ? if fresh elections are set for the autumn , schröder will run as the spd 's candidate just weeks after having been given a vote of no confidence in the bundestag . bildunterschrift : angela merkel is schröder 's most likely challenger at the moment , success at national level seems unlikely for the chancellor and his crew , which is lacking cohesion . for the opposition christian democrats , the task ahead is somewhat easier . cdu leader angela merkel , who is likely to challenge schröder in the general election in a bid to become germany 's first woman leader , described sunday 's north rhine-westphalia as a " sensational result . " " the voters ... have shown hope in us and in the future state leader jürgen rüttgers because the problems are so great and they want us to shape a policy that will bring down unemployment , " merkel said . she welcomed the possibility of an early election . " every day without the red-green coalition will be a good day for germany , " she said . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de social democrats ousted in state election exit polls in the north rhine-westphalia state election show that gerhard schröder 's social democrats -lrb- sdp -rrb- have lost control of their stronghold state after 39 years .

"
new elections , the paper said , represent " a gamble on power .
the social democrats saw the disaster coming , they were ready for it and they tried to weather it .
but it was far greater than expected , and the psychological and political repercussions for the red-green coalition government only began to emerge as the results were revealed on the television screens .
but as long as there can be an election , there can be hope - even if it is hope for a miracle . " the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote that " after this tectonic shift , schröder has little choice but to make a virtue of necessity , if he wants to avoid a crushing defeat in the next bundestag elections .
the box of tricks he 's been using until now is more or less empty .
the fact that schröder missed his chance to secure his position against the worst consequences of losing his majority in the bundesrat with a reform of the federal system has come back to haunt him .
if the government now tried renegotiating in order to win back some room to maneuver , it would inevitably be in a worse position than it was in december .
schröder would have to swallow a bitter pill : a change of coalition , resignation , new elections . "
schröder 's move after sunday 's devastating loss in germany 's most populous state was " an admission of defeat " , said the financial times .
" the scale of the spd 's defeat reflected popular resentment at mr schröder 's economic policy - viewed as far too business-friendly - and his cuts to the country 's traditionally generous welfare state .
with many in the spd demanding a shift to the left in a bid to win back core voters , mr schröder could face a bruising battle with his grassroots as he draws up the party 's election platform .
-lrb- a general election in four months -rrb- could mean the resumption of economic reforms as soon as the autumn - either by a freshly legitimized mr schröder or by a conservative-led government .
it would also dispel fears that the nation could be doomed to spend the next 16 months in a paralysing pre-election limbo . "
the center-left guardian noted that calling early elections was not accepted practice in germany and quoted a social democrat , furious at the chancellor 's decision , calling it " political suicide . "
schröder 's chances of winning a third term as chancellor appear bleak , commented the daily .
" while it is too early to write him off entirely , germany appears to be heading for another period of center-right government , and its first ever woman chancellor - the christian democrats ' leader , angela merkel .
before last night 's disaster , mr schröder was facing growing pressure to dump some of his controversial reforms to the country 's social welfare system .
instead of changing course , he appears to be trying to regain the initiative by going to the polls . "
the center-right times said a " humbled " schröder had taken a " panicked decision , " which clearly shows how deeply the defeat has hurt the government .
analysts quoted by the paper said the election might pave the way " for a grand coalition between the christian democrats and the social democrats in some form of broad cross-party reforming alliance .
it will paralyze germany , the world 's third-largest economy , unless schröder can win a new mandate for his unpopular program to overhaul its stagnant economy and lumbering welfare state .
on yesterday ’ s showing , his chances are slight .
his popular mandate is melting by the day and left-wingers within his party are demanding that he perform a u-turn .

"
new elections , the paper said , represent " a gamble on power .
the social democrats saw the disaster coming , they were ready for it and they tried to weather it .
but it was far greater than expected , and the psychological and political repercussions for the red-green coalition government only began to emerge as the results were revealed on the television screens .
but as long as there can be an election , there can be hope - even if it is hope for a miracle . " the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung wrote that " after this tectonic shift , schröder has little choice but to make a virtue of necessity , if he wants to avoid a crushing defeat in the next bundestag elections .
the box of tricks he 's been using until now is more or less empty .
the fact that schröder missed his chance to secure his position against the worst consequences of losing his majority in the bundesrat with a reform of the federal system has come back to haunt him .
if the government now tried renegotiating in order to win back some room to maneuver , it would inevitably be in a worse position than it was in december .
schröder would have to swallow a bitter pill : a change of coalition , resignation , new elections . "
schröder 's move after sunday 's devastating loss in germany 's most populous state was " an admission of defeat " , said the financial times .
" the scale of the spd 's defeat reflected popular resentment at mr schröder 's economic policy - viewed as far too business-friendly - and his cuts to the country 's traditionally generous welfare state .
with many in the spd demanding a shift to the left in a bid to win back core voters , mr schröder could face a bruising battle with his grassroots as he draws up the party 's election platform .
-lrb- a general election in four months -rrb- could mean the resumption of economic reforms as soon as the autumn - either by a freshly legitimized mr schröder or by a conservative-led government .
it would also dispel fears that the nation could be doomed to spend the next 16 months in a paralysing pre-election limbo . "
the center-left guardian noted that calling early elections was not accepted practice in germany and quoted a social democrat , furious at the chancellor 's decision , calling it " political suicide . "
schröder 's chances of winning a third term as chancellor appear bleak , commented the daily .
" while it is too early to write him off entirely , germany appears to be heading for another period of center-right government , and its first ever woman chancellor - the christian democrats ' leader , angela merkel .
before last night 's disaster , mr schröder was facing growing pressure to dump some of his controversial reforms to the country 's social welfare system .
instead of changing course , he appears to be trying to regain the initiative by going to the polls . "
the center-right times said a " humbled " schröder had taken a " panicked decision , " which clearly shows how deeply the defeat has hurt the government .
analysts quoted by the paper said the election might pave the way " for a grand coalition between the christian democrats and the social democrats in some form of broad cross-party reforming alliance .
it will paralyze germany , the world 's third-largest economy , unless schröder can win a new mandate for his unpopular program to overhaul its stagnant economy and lumbering welfare state .
on yesterday ’ s showing , his chances are slight .

eu foreign ministers sparred sunday over budget questions , as the prospect of early general elections in germany injected fresh uncertainty into the talks , already dogged by britain 's vow to hold onto its budget rebate . the ministers met over dinner in brussels to sound each other out over their positions on the eu 's long-term budget , before getting down to bargaining at an official gathering on monday . luxembourg , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , was aiming to broker a deal between the union 's 25 members that can be signed at a summit here on june 16 and 17 , but the negotiations were being held up by britain 's refusal to reconsider the rebate on budget contributions that former prime minister margaret thatcher won in 1984 . repercussions of german elections the announcement sunday of early elections in germany raised new questions about the negotiating position of the biggest contributor to the budget . " it 's an important point that should not automatically make things easy , but that 's up to germany to decide , " nicolas schmidt , luxembourg 's deputy foreign minister , said . luxembourg was trying to bring minds together with a proposal that includes a suggestion to freeze and then reduce the british rebate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , that proposition raised the ire of britain who , through the voice of foreign secretary jack straw , insisted that his government aimed to keep the rebate , which is supposed to compensate for the fact britain receives less from eu agricultural funds than other nations . it was justified in 1984 when it was agreed , it is justified today and we will not hesitate to use our veto if it is necessary , " straw said in the face of growing opposition to the rebate by other countries . limiting the budget luxembourg wants an agreement before britain takes over the presidency for six months in july , during which the budget issue is likely to languish if there is no deal beforehand .

the bundestag vote then has to take place 48 hours after schröder puts forward what 's known as the vote of confidence , set to take place on july 1 .
if the chancellor loses this vote , new elections can take place earlier than planned , in accordance with article 68 of the constitution , which states that " if a motion of a federal chancellor for a vote of confidence is not assented to by the majority of the members of the bundestag , the federal president may , upon the proposal of the federal chancellor , dissolve the bundestag within twenty-one days .
the right to dissolve shall lapse as soon as the bundestag with the majority of its members elects another federal chancellor . "

the federal president must comply with the request and appoint the person elected . "
this , however , presupposes a candidate for office is already waiting in the wings , who can depend on the support of a bundestag majority .
the constructive no-confidence vote makes it harder to remove a chancellor because opponents of the chancellor not only must disagree with his or her governing but also must agree on a replacement historical precedents early elections in germany are highly unusual .
the first time they took place was in 1972 , initiated by chancellor willy brandt .

the bundestag vote then has to take place 48 hours after schröder puts forward what 's known as the vote of confidence , set to take place on july 1 .
if the chancellor loses this vote , new elections can take place earlier than planned , in accordance with article 68 of the constitution , which states that " if a motion of a federal chancellor for a vote of confidence is not assented to by the majority of the members of the bundestag , the federal president may , upon the proposal of the federal chancellor , dissolve the bundestag within twenty-one days .
the right to dissolve shall lapse as soon as the bundestag with the majority of its members elects another federal chancellor . "
presidential discretion the operative word here is " may . "
the president can act upon the chancellor 's proposal to dissolve the bundestag , but he does n't have to .
it 's up to him to decide whether the chancellor 's decision is in keeping with constitutional principles .

according to his spokesperson , he was carefully considering the matter before meeting with schröder on monday .
a further option available to berlin is the constructive vote of no confidence laid out in article 67 , which states that " the bundestag can express its lack of confidence in the federal chancellor only by electing a successor with the majority of its members and by requesting the federal president to dismiss the federal chancellor .
the federal president must comply with the request and appoint the person elected . "

public opinion is behind early elections , but does gerhard schröder really stand any chance of being re-elected ? opinion polls ahead of sunday 's ballot gave the social democrats , who had ruled in germany 's largest federal state of north rhine-westphalia for 39 years , little hope of holding onto the reins of power . but even in the face of that bitter expectation , politicians and public alike were nothing if not unprepared for gerhard schröder 's announcement . bildunterschrift : schröder on monday his political ambush is viewed as a scrambling attempt to cling to what power he has left by catching his opponents off-guard .
but analysts are predicting a foregone conclusion in favor of the conservative cdu .
the loss of the spd stronghold was a clear statement to the government in berlin that the country is prepared to invest more faith in the opposition than in the current leadership . cabinet stays as is although the clarity of the message moved the chancellor to plead the case of a premature poll , it did not prompt him to consider passing the gauntlet to anyone else .
just hours after the election defeat , schröder said he would not reshuffle his cabinet before leading the party , which voted unanimously in favor of early elections , to the fall campaign . and when he bangs the drum for his red-green coalition later this year , his most likely challenger will be germany 's first female chancellor candidate , christian democrat angela merkel . roland koch , state premier of hesse , said it " goes without saying " that angela merkel will be the elected cdu candidate . " i do n't know anyone in the party who is of a different opinion , " he added . bildunterschrift : angela merkel although merkel has not been officially elected , the decision is expected when the cdu and csu sister party executive boards meet next monday . other cdu members said they shared koch 's optimism .
christian wulff , the state premier of lower saxony , said he " would be surprised if merkel were not elected as the party 's chancellor candidate . " and speaking on germany 's zdf public broadcaster , cdu general secretary volker kauder said the " message of the north rhine-westphalia election results was that the union would win with angela merkel . " a one-woman show or a coalition ? but what would await germany under its first ever woman leader ?
the conservatives have some way to go to flesh out their policies , and after schröder 's surprise announcement yesterday , they have less time to get their agenda in order . another question on the country 's lips is whether the conservative cdu / csu would rule alone or whether they would form a coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guido westerwelle the neoliberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , led by guido westerwelle , on monday said they would join forces with the conservatives in a coalition should they win the election . welcomed all round schröder 's announcement has been very widely accepted with open arms .
green party coalition partners see it as a chance to start a new offensive .
reinhard bütikofer , the party 's co-chairman , spoke to german public television zdf about the advantages of early elections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bütikofer -lrb- right -rrb- and greens co-chairwoman claudia roth " the cdu will no longer be able to use its strategy of blocking everything and simultaneously complaining that there is no progress , " he said . in an interview with the sächsische zeitung , environment minister jürgen trittin said he was certain that the green party would fight the election campaign with joschka fischer at the helm .
he said he thought the coalition stood a good chance of being re-elected in a federal ballot . in a flash poll conducted on the back of sunday 's election debacle , 70 percent of those asked said they thought that a fresh ballot this year would be more beneficial to the opposition than the ruling coalition .
and 54 percent said getting rid of the devil they know could be the answer to heaving germany out of its current misery . election on sept .
18 ? the latest date for a general election would be sept .
18 as schröder will present a motion of confidence in his government to parliament on july 1 , officials said on monday . the leader of schröder 's social democratic party , franz münterfering , said that july 1 was the last sitting of the bundestag , or lower house of parliament , before the summer recess . if the motion of confidence is rejected , german president horst köhler then has 21 days in which to dissolve parliament .
the general election must take place within 60 days of the dissolution of parliament . an election in september would be 12 months ahead of the scheduled date of september 2006 . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early elections in germany leaders of all german mainstream parties are meeting today to discuss the ramifications of early national elections this fall after the ruling social democrats suffered a blow in crucial state elections sunday .

public opinion is behind early elections , but does gerhard schröder really stand any chance of being re-elected ? opinion polls ahead of sunday 's ballot gave the social democrats , who had ruled in germany 's largest federal state of north rhine-westphalia for 39 years , little hope of holding onto the reins of power . but even in the face of that bitter expectation , politicians and public alike were nothing if not unprepared for gerhard schröder 's announcement . bildunterschrift : schröder on monday his political ambush is viewed as a scrambling attempt to cling to what power he has left by catching his opponents off-guard .

" why does nobody like us anymore ? " it asked in its monday edition .
" we have no friends . " there may be little genuine substance to the claim , but perhaps germany and its gracia have some grounds to feel the throb of a disjointed nose .
in fact if , as the paper suggests , the depth of euro friendship is indeed measured by the number of points awarded on contest night , then germany has but two - monaco and moldavia - and not very good ones at that . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " even the granny from moldavia did better than us , " said the paper two points from each and a pathetic 24th-place defeat triggered a tirade of " is this all the thanks we get " comments from germany 's boulevard press . " we pay for everyone , will soon even be paying for rumania too , but even they give us ' zero points . '
welcome to europe , " the paper said . and as the rant continued , it asked " what about spain which gets our holiday money ?
or poland , whose workers earn their wages from us ?
or turkey , whose kebabs we consume ?
or england , which we allow to win the battle for the sun-loungers around the holiday pool ? " it must be hard to be so generous , and even more so to maintain such levels of graciousness .

but analysts say tackling unemployment and slow economic growth will be a tough ride for the opposition . a day after the crushing defeat of chancellor gerhard schroeder 's social democrat spd party in key regional elections in the state of north rhine-westphalia , the german stock market was in a cautiously optimistic mood , with the blue-chip dax 30 index showing a gain of 37.46 points or 0.86 percent at 4,398.14 points . investors were relieved that , following the spd 's landslide defeat in its former stronghold , schröder wanted to hold the next general election this fall , a year ahead of schedule . analysts say the move will avoid long months of economic and political paralysis as the conservative cdu / csu and liberal fdp parties block reform spd-green coalition reform initiatives in the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat . " without this move , the time between now and fall 2006 would simply have been filled with empty political posturing , " said hypovereinsbank economist andreas rees .
he added that the reform process was more likely to be restarted if the opposition were to win the general election , because the christian union and liberal parties already hold the majority in the bundesrat . the prospect of additional reforms - including the further liberalization of the labor markets and a drastic simplification of the tax system - would buoy sentiment on the stock markets . industry applause the automobile industry has also welcomed the prospect of an early election .
" germany needs a strong government , " said the head of the vda auto industry federation , bernd gottschalk .
the decision to bring forward the elections " must be seen as a chance , " he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment has been plaguing germany for years the zdh handworkers ' association agreed .
" any decision that puts an end to the political lethargy and economic stagnation is good , " said zdh chief otto kentzler .
" an early election could be the right step . " during its two terms in power , schröder 's red-green administration has failed to make any inroads into unemployment , currently at a post-war high of around five million , or steer the euro zone 's biggest economy out of the doldrums . merkel 's alternatives the question is whether the conservative opposition under cdu leader angela merkel will be able to handle the economy any better .
hvb economist rees noted that the cdu in north rhine-westphalia had won more by default than on the argument for its own reform programs . ubs economist holger fahrinkrug agreed .
" the conservative parties do n't have an election platform as yet and , like the spd , they also have internal struggles on key policy issues , especially in the fields of social and labor market reforms , " he said . bildunterschrift : angela merkel gernot nerb , chief economist of the influential ifo think tank , also believed that the mere prospect of a change in government would not necessarily lead to a lasting improvement in economic sentiment in germany . concrete progress would have to be made in reforms first , nerb argued .
but banking and stock market professor wolfgang gerke disagreed .
" after the elections , there 's more chance that policies will become more reliable , more calculable , " he said .
" it 's not so important for many companies whether the spd or the cdu is in power .
they just want an end to the endless political manoeuvering and the political blockades . " window of opportunity ? morgan stanley economist elga bartsch said the cdu would have to show it meant business in pressing ahead with reforms if it were to win the election . " it is a regular feature of the german political landscape for the bundesrat to be dominated by the opposition parties after a few years of the new government being in office , " she said .

" without this move , the time between now and fall 2006 would simply have been filled with empty political posturing , " said hypovereinsbank economist andreas rees .
he added that the reform process was more likely to be restarted if the opposition were to win the general election , because the christian union and liberal parties already hold the majority in the bundesrat . the prospect of additional reforms - including the further liberalization of the labor markets and a drastic simplification of the tax system - would buoy sentiment on the stock markets . industry applause the automobile industry has also welcomed the prospect of an early election .

" after the elections , there 's more chance that policies will become more reliable , more calculable , " he said .

but it also happens on their doorstep .
according to the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- study " human trafficking and exploitation in germany , " 360,000 of the 12.3 million people worldwide categorized as modern slaves live in industrialized countries , and an estimated 15,000 of them in germany - a country that has no fixed minimum wage . the ilo is now stepping up pressure for a global alliance to improve laws and raise awareness of what it calls a " hidden " issue . defining modern slavery " the term ' forced labor ' refers to a situation in which a person is being exploited against their will - forced to work under conditions they do not voluntarily accept , " explained norbert cyrus , author of the report .
it depicts the plight of poor or powerless victims , cowed by intimidation and sometimes even violence .
in germany 's worst cases , migrants are housed in basic , unhygienic accommodation with twenty people per room , working 80-hour weeks for negligible wages they have to wait months for - if they 're paid at all . globally , profits amassed on the back on forced labor amount to $ 32 billion -lrb- 25 billion euros -rrb- a year , 50 percent of which is pocketed in the western industrialized nations . in germany , two-thirds of this workforce are women .
approximately 60 percent of forced labor occurs within the country 's sex industry , with women from countries such as columbia , ghana , thailand and ukraine forced into prostitution after being lured to germany with false promises , then robbed of their papers . identifying the problem , helping the victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the coordination center against female trafficking -lrb- kok -rrb- in potsdam , one way of tackling the problem is to improve police awareness so that more instances of modern slavery are identified .
" during a police raid on a brothel , officers might realize that some of the women are not there voluntarily , but it 's very difficult to recognize such cases , " said kok 's manager .
" police need to be sensitized to these situations with further training options .
then these women can be referred to advice centers , which can provide them with support throughout a court case , if they 're required to give evidence - which is a key aspect of clamping down on the problem , because taking legal action hinges almost entirely on personal testimonies . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fear of reprisals , and , crucially , deportation , is one factor preventing people trapped in a condition of enforced dependency from seeking help .
" a lot of these women are traumatized , and help centers can provide them with protection and social support .
alone , they 're not usually in a position to seek help - they do n't speak the language , they 're not able to make contact with the outside world , " explained tanis from the kok .
as usual , however , " funding for these expert advice centers is facing ongoing cuts and they ca n't keep up with the number of cases they have to deal with . " labor as a commodity but muddying the waters is the fact that - like many foreign prostitutes - not all the people working in conditions that amount to modern slavery necessarily feel the need to escape .
" they do n't always see themselves as victims , " said tanis .
" they think they 're making money they can save or send home . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other industries where the problem exists include meatpacking , construction , agriculture , gastronomy , and the textile industry - although germany has been spared the latter 's notorious sweatshops , unlike the uk and france .
spurious agencies across eastern europe , for example , recruit workers eager to earn more in germany than they can at home .
but the picture painted of what awaits them bears little to resemblance to the harsh reality they actually encounter . norbert cyrus explained that many submit to their situation in the belief that any job is better than no job .
" hope of improvement and change keeps them going , " he said .
" another reason these people accept inhumane working conditions is because they feel they lack any alternative .
they end up feeling very fatalistic about their situation , so one thing that needs to change is their willingness to become more confrontational towards employers who are failing to implement prescribed standards . " fair globalization in germany , the meatpacking business in particular is riddled with what is essentially slave labor , on account of cut-throat price wars among germany 's discount supermarkets and a highly competitive , saturated market .
in the last year , some 26,000 jobs have been lost in the industry , with workers from hungary , poland , romania and slovakia picking up the slack for as little as two euros an hour . " a billion euro business -lrb- within the meatpacking industry -rrb- with mafia-like structures , salary dumping and modern slavery has developed , " said matthias brümmer from the ngg trade union in an interview with a local newspaper . but cyrus was quick to stress that eu enlargement is not the root of the problem .
referring to the need for " fair globalization , " he underlined the challenge of lifting restrictions while upholding workers ' rights .
" the problem is not the eu 's free circulation of services , but maintaining standards of fairness within that framework . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the statistics tell us that we need better protection for victims , " said cyrus .

but it also happens on their doorstep .
according to the international labor organization -lrb- ilo -rrb- study " human trafficking and exploitation in germany , " 360,000 of the 12.3 million people worldwide categorized as modern slaves live in industrialized countries , and an estimated 15,000 of them in germany - a country that has no fixed minimum wage . the ilo is now stepping up pressure for a global alliance to improve laws and raise awareness of what it calls a " hidden " issue . defining modern slavery " the term ' forced labor ' refers to a situation in which a person is being exploited against their will - forced to work under conditions they do not voluntarily accept , " explained norbert cyrus , author of the report .
it depicts the plight of poor or powerless victims , cowed by intimidation and sometimes even violence .
in germany 's worst cases , migrants are housed in basic , unhygienic accommodation with twenty people per room , working 80-hour weeks for negligible wages they have to wait months for - if they 're paid at all . globally , profits amassed on the back on forced labor amount to $ 32 billion -lrb- 25 billion euros -rrb- a year , 50 percent of which is pocketed in the western industrialized nations . in germany , two-thirds of this workforce are women .
approximately 60 percent of forced labor occurs within the country 's sex industry , with women from countries such as columbia , ghana , thailand and ukraine forced into prostitution after being lured to germany with false promises , then robbed of their papers . identifying the problem , helping the victims bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the coordination center against female trafficking -lrb- kok -rrb- in potsdam , one way of tackling the problem is to improve police awareness so that more instances of modern slavery are identified .
" during a police raid on a brothel , officers might realize that some of the women are not there voluntarily , but it 's very difficult to recognize such cases , " said kok 's manager .
" police need to be sensitized to these situations with further training options .
then these women can be referred to advice centers , which can provide them with support throughout a court case , if they 're required to give evidence - which is a key aspect of clamping down on the problem , because taking legal action hinges almost entirely on personal testimonies . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fear of reprisals , and , crucially , deportation , is one factor preventing people trapped in a condition of enforced dependency from seeking help .
" a lot of these women are traumatized , and help centers can provide them with protection and social support .
alone , they 're not usually in a position to seek help - they do n't speak the language , they 're not able to make contact with the outside world , " explained tanis from the kok .
as usual , however , " funding for these expert advice centers is facing ongoing cuts and they ca n't keep up with the number of cases they have to deal with . " labor as a commodity but muddying the waters is the fact that - like many foreign prostitutes - not all the people working in conditions that amount to modern slavery necessarily feel the need to escape .
" they do n't always see themselves as victims , " said tanis .
" they think they 're making money they can save or send home . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other industries where the problem exists include meatpacking , construction , agriculture , gastronomy , and the textile industry - although germany has been spared the latter 's notorious sweatshops , unlike the uk and france .
spurious agencies across eastern europe , for example , recruit workers eager to earn more in germany than they can at home .
but the picture painted of what awaits them bears little to resemblance to the harsh reality they actually encounter . norbert cyrus explained that many submit to their situation in the belief that any job is better than no job .
" hope of improvement and change keeps them going , " he said .
" another reason these people accept inhumane working conditions is because they feel they lack any alternative .
they end up feeling very fatalistic about their situation , so one thing that needs to change is their willingness to become more confrontational towards employers who are failing to implement prescribed standards . " fair globalization in germany , the meatpacking business in particular is riddled with what is essentially slave labor , on account of cut-throat price wars among germany 's discount supermarkets and a highly competitive , saturated market .
in the last year , some 26,000 jobs have been lost in the industry , with workers from hungary , poland , romania and slovakia picking up the slack for as little as two euros an hour . " a billion euro business -lrb- within the meatpacking industry -rrb- with mafia-like structures , salary dumping and modern slavery has developed , " said matthias brümmer from the ngg trade union in an interview with a local newspaper . but cyrus was quick to stress that eu enlargement is not the root of the problem .
referring to the need for " fair globalization , " he underlined the challenge of lifting restrictions while upholding workers ' rights .
" the problem is not the eu 's free circulation of services , but maintaining standards of fairness within that framework . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the statistics tell us that we need better protection for victims , " said cyrus .
" we need to improve their legal position , we need to inform them about their rights . "
police identify some 1000 victims of human trafficking a year .
" but often , these cases are simply treated as law-breakers , " he observed .
the ilo wants to see breaches of residency permits categorized as a misdemeanor rather than a criminal offense . " people do n't have to be victims of forced labor , " said cyrus .

advertising blitz escaping the adverts is made even harder by corporate sponsors insisting on having festivals named after them .
at the forefront of this trend is the v , backed by virgin mobile whose logo is plastered across big screens , urging 130,000 festival goers to " text the fest " , eating into their pockets in the process .

" young people are notoriously hard to get hold of , " says graham hales executive director of consultants interbrand .
" so if you sponsor an event with a huge population they 're going to be subsumed within the proximity of that event . "
virgin itself admits to launching its now annual festivals " very much as an opportunistic thing " to promote virgin cola .
" if you start from scratch , its worth a lot more than putting a brand onto it at a later date , " says virgin mobile 's brand director , james kidd .
virgin mobile is selling a lifestyle and an image .
" its very much experiential marketing , " says mr kidd .
" it 's more of a benefit if young people go along and enjoy the event than they come away knowing we 're selling phones at £ 14.99 .
" it 's about brand image , this is the sort of thing we want our values associated with . "
for carling , the reading and leeds weekend festivals are " very , very simply a brand strategy to recruit young males " .
carling already has its name on big sporting events the company wants to attract 25 to 34-year-old men whose main interests are football , music , beer and women .
" there 's evidence from the market place that if you recruit people to brands at an early age they 'll grow with you , so we 're single-mindedly recruiting people to the brand , " says carling brand director at coors , des johnson .
balancing act but there 's a fine line between sponsorship and keeping the festival audience happy .
times have changed since the " tune in , turn on and drop out " heyday of festivals in the 60s and 70s .
woodstock - one of the original " free " fests in 1969 - was marred by riots when it returned 30 years later as security broke down .
some blamed the music for inciting violence while many other said corporate greed had pushed people over the edge .
but festivals can be a way to avoid the " commercial parasite " tag , interbrand 's mr hales says .
" you get a close association with people over two to three day experience having a very good time and saying so - it 's not seen as an overly corporate thing as its not grown up and it 's a good , easy time .
" the audience had a good time when they 're there and they 'll have that brand in mind from the experience , " he says .
were the woodstock rioters raging against corporations ?
" we make sure what we do is not pure branding , instead we 're adding value to the experience and do n't want people to think we 've been forcing our brand down the audiences throat - that 's when people get unhappy , " virgin 's mr kidd says .
companies also have to be careful not to become just part of the scenery , interbrand 's mr hales warns .
" big brands have to work hard for exposure and not to be lost in the snowstorm . "
he cites nike as a good example of how it can be done well - with its sponsorship of golf star tiger woods providing top-end , high cost advertising ; while its amateur 10k fun run in the uk retains its credibility as a brand for anyone .
sponsorship means sales carling 's mr johnson adds that being part of a live festival means the brand is part of a key event in someone 's life , which allows you to share your war stories of muddy fields and undiscovered bands afterwards .
we 've developed a spontaneous association with live music ... we 're now at position number one in terms of awareness don johnson , carling brand director " next time you look and see carling in a pub its positive association as part of pivotal moments in people 's lives , " he adds .
that exposure does equate to sales , the experts argue .
" there 's no doubt that the links and associated pr means we get a spike in awareness that 's the equivalent of a tv campaign , " mr kidd says .
" people are more predisposed to virgin mobile if they 've been to the festival - we have 80 % recognition from people who 've been there . "
carling 's mr johnson agrees .
while he can not give specific figures on how much that feeds through to sales , he does say that sales have risen year-on-year with the pace accelerating over the last few years .

she may have no qualms about germany 's catastrophic capitulation at the end of world war ii , but neither she nor her husband was appalled by efforts to humanize evil . " the germans deserved what happened to them , " male said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bruno ganz as hitler swiss actor bruno ganz 's brilliant warts-and-all portrayal shows hitler in previously unimaginable scenes : charming his secretaries , sharing a passionate kiss with eva braun , frothing at the mouth over the latest reports of the encroaching red army , spilling sauce at dinner down his steel-gray uniform . " the film does n't show hitler in such a human light , " male said .
" the environment around him is humanized by children , the dog and women , but not hitler himself .
he was completely indifferent to his people suffering the allied bombings . " the wider tragedy accepted by some viewers raviv , a 30-year-old social worker , had the same reaction . " what happened to them was deserved , but what a tragedy , " he said .
although he was born in israel , his family comes from austria - annexed to hitler 's third reich in 1938 - and the personal resonance also hit home . " one of my grannies was the only one in the family to survive , " he added .
" although i certainly always felt a victim , this film also made me see the germans as victims .
i felt that too , when i went to berlin . " press divided on human portrayal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the press , as anywhere else , there are those who laud its merits and those deeply critical of director oliver hirschbiegel 's -lrb- photo -rrb- portrayal of the nazi führer . " i 'm not recommending this film to holocaust survivors , but it should be compulsory for everyone else , " wrote avner hopstein in yediot aharonot tabloid .
" it teaches us that even sensitive human beings can become execrable killers . " in the same newspaper , yehuda steve complained about the film 's technical flaws that left hitler less of a human being and " more of a museum wax work . " public response led to realse of film in israel a tel aviv cinema , lev , was initially reluctant to show the film , aware that the intense debate it sparked in europe may prove just too sensitive in israel . to decide , it screened a private viewing to a test audience , 91 percent of which agreed the film should be aired nationwide . " this was a very specific , short and transient time in history , but the film does not glorify hitler as some people said , " said brazilian jewish emigre noah milstein , 66 .
" he was a man , psychotic , but not an animal .

bbc news -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- ex-communists win mongolia race bbc news / asia-pacific graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- monday , 23 may , 2005 , 05:00 gmt 06:00 uk ex-communists win mongolia race the candidate of mongolia 's former communist party has won sunday 's presidential election , according to official results .
nambaryn enkhbayar polled 53.4 % of the more than 900,000 votes cast , thus avoiding the need for a second round of voting .
his main rival , mendsaikhan enkhsaikhan of the democratic party , polled 20 % .
a spokesman for mr enkhbayer 's mongolian people 's revolutionary party -lrb- mprp -rrb- called the result " convincing " .
under mongolia 's system of government , the prime minister and parliament hold most real power , while the president 's role was designed to be largely ceremonial .
but following disputed parliamentary elections last year , the mprp and democratic party have been forced into a coalition government , which , analysts say , increases the president 's influence .
before the poll , there were rallies in the capital , ulan bator , for a more transparent electoral system . "
mongolia is such a small country , we need people to work together " nambaryn enkhbayar protesters also demonstrated against alleged corruption .
international observers who visited polling stations on sunday did not report any irregularities .
" we are relieved that nobody cried foul , " tjalling halbertsma , a campaign advisor to mr enkhbayar , told the afp news agency .
struggle to rebuild turnout in the presidential election was 75 % , slightly lower than in the last election .
mr enkhbayar , undisputed favourite to win , will take over from outgoing president natsagiin bagabandi , also of the mprp .
mr enkhbayar , who was mongolia 's prime minister between 2000 and 2004 , said on monday that his main rival , mr enkhsaikhan , had called to congratulate him on his victory .
" he suggested that we work together .
i replied that i am really looking forward to working together with all the contenders , " mr enkhbayar was quoted as saying by reuters news agency .
" mongolia is such a small country , we need people to work together , " he said .
despite robust economic growth , mongolia still faces deep poverty and social problems .

controversial changes at stobhill hospital will be examined at a public meeting , which andy kerr is attending .

protesters will get a chance to tackle the minister directly at st mary 's church hall in kirkintilloch .
the minister will hear the board 's proposals before taking questions from the audience at monday 's meeting .
greater glasgow health board plans to modernise stobhill to provide a full range of out-patient day care and day surgery .
this would ensure that local access was retained for the vast majority of patient who use the hospital at the moment , a spokeswoman said .
alternative plans critics have suggested their own plans for the future of stobhill , including transforming it into a centre of excellence for the rehabilitation of stroke , heart attack and car crash victims .
a 43,000-signature petition against the changes has already gone to the scottish parliament .
