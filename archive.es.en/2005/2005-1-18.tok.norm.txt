but only about 5 million have actually stayed here since then . in 2003 - the year for which the latest immigration statistics are available - the number of migrants to germany for the first time dropped below 800,000 .
a figure , beck says , which could continue to raise xenophobic fears among native germans , but which should be seen in the light of about 620,000 people who left germany for good in that year . " statistics are dry and complicated but unfortunately they are our only chance to tell people : be rational , take your time and look at who is coming and who is going .
we might have problems but they are not so overwhelming , " beck told dw-radio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overall figures have remained stable at just under nine percent of foreigners among the population in this country .
from the 768,000 migrants to germany in 2003 about two thirds came from europe , mostly from italy , poland , russia and turkey .
migrants from africa make up only a fraction of that with about 5 percent mainly asylum-seekers . beck says that immigration in 2003 was still largely unregulated causing problems of integration .
but she also adds that the influx of foreigners is necessary for german society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have groups of foreigners where the necessity to qualify them is very big and which creats costs , " said beck . " on the other hand , you have people which we badly need .
we are already feeling the effects of a society which is growing older and older and we already have a lack of personal to take care of those people .
historically seen one can always say migration always brought about cultural pushes in a positive way . " estimates for 2004 , according to beck , suggest that the decline in immigration to germany will continue and that there may be yet another 70,000 migrants fewer than in 2003 .
this month a new immigration law has come into effect in germany placing greater emphasis on qualified immigration . beck says it is too early to say how this will affect immigration statistics , but experts are already saying that the hurdles for skilled foreigners to come to germany are still be too high compared with the united states , britain or other industrialized countries . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks common immigration policy eu proposals to attract high-skilled immigrants , unveiled tuesday , were met with criticism at a time when anti-immigrant sentiment is rising in much of europe .

" as long as there are still holocaust survivors among us , the german language should not be spoken in parliament , " israel 's minister of health dani naveh told the right-wing israeli daily newspaper maariv .
naveh said he plans to boycott the speech , which köhler will make toward the end of january , to mark the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between israel and germany .
his comment echoes the feelings of a number of members of the israeli parliament or knesset . other jewish public figures have spoken out in favor of köhler using his native german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous german president johannes rau visited israel in 2003 the current dispute harkens back to 2000 , when germany 's then-president johannes rau made the first address of a german president to the knesset .
his speech , also in german , caused a similar uproar .
reminders of the nazi era ?
responding to the current round of criticism , the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors to cancel the event or to ask köhler to hold his speech in english .
" my feet have never touched german soil , and i buy no german products , " said doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust .
" i can not allow that language to be spoken in the house of parliament of the jewish people , " he said .

" there is an open wound , " she said , in an interview with the jerusalem post on monday .
finkelstein called on köhler to " act with sensitivity " and not speak german .
knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who has rejected as the mks ' requests , was instrumental in the decision to allow köhler to deliver his speech in german in the first place .
" it is clear that a visiting president speaks in his language , " rivlin told the jerusalem post .
it would be " better not to extend an invitation than to demand that the guest speak in a different language , " he argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some members of the knesset at work at the same time , rivlin said he understands mks who argue that israel can not ignore what happened under the nazis . but he also said the protest should not be directed toward one person or his spoken language , but a historic occurrence that " we must remember and not forget . "
insulting request ?
opposition leader yosef lapid - himself a holocaust survivor - said the situation is different now than it was when germany and israel first resumed diplomatic relations .
forty years ago , lapid would have have opposed a german address in the knesset .
since then , israel 's relations with germany have changed .
now , lapid said , it would be insulting to prevent the german president from speaking in his own language .
in an interview in germany 's frankfurt allgemeine zeitung newspaper , marcel reich-ranicki , one of the last survivors of the warsaw ghetto and a prominent literary critic in germany , criticized the discussion in israel .
köhler should address the knesset in german , he arged , calling the boycott threats " not only deplorable but shameful and , in the end , incomprehensible . "
associating the german language only with the nazi regime and saying its use in the knesset would defile holocaust survivors is " pure nonsense , " said reich-ranicki .
it neglects , for instance , the fact that german-speaking jews have played an enormous role in the development of modern thought , he told the paper .
german thinkers " we can no longer imagine physics without albert einstein , psychology without sigmund freud , sociology without karl marx , literature without franz kafka , and modern music without gustav mahler and arnold schönberg - all german speaking jews , " reich-ranicki said .
he also noted that the father of zionism , theodor herzle , published a decisive book on the creation of a jewish state , der judenstaat in german in 1896 , and that herzl had long debated whether german should be that country 's lingua franca .
it was only after the founding of the state of israel that hebrew became the official language because it was the common denominator among jews of different nationalities .
changing concerns the german culture will soon cease to be a touchy topic in israel , according to reich-ranicki .
the current generation has too much else on its mind , said the man known in germany as a " literature czar . "
" in israel , they wo n't discuss much longer whether wagner should be played in concert halls or german should be spoken in parliament , " he predicted .

the project to achieve that , named “ agency shutdown , ” called on reform opponents to turn out in the numbers they did last summer to “ occupy ” job centers and , in effect , shut them down . the call largely went unheeded . government officials estimated that only about 700 protesters gathered at branches of the federal labor office across the country , although protest leaders said around 15,000 took part in protests nationwide . still , it was a far cry from the tens of thousands - at one point 150,000 - who turned out in august and september at the “ monday demonstrations ” to show their opposition to chancellor schröder ’ s controversial plan to breathe new life into germany ’ s labor market . “ agency shutdown was not a big success , ” said peter wahl , a co-founder of attac , the anti-globalization group which played a large role in organizing last summer ’ s protests . according to him , its failure is a result of a feeling of resignation that has set in among many protesters .

“ there are several groups who are trying to keep going with the monday demonstrations , but they aren ’ t very effective . ” shaky determination mag wompel , an editor at labournet germany , an internet site which links labor activists and helped organize the “ agency shutdown ” project , agrees that the protest movement has lost some of the steam it had last summer .
but while it did not have the hoped-for effect , she insists it was not in vain .
according to her , it resulted in new alliances by people in several cities who are still active in their opposition to schröder ’ s reform plans . “ as long as there are hartz laws , we will continue to stage actions and protests , ” she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests that are now taking place have none of the visibility of last year ’ s .
indeed , many of them are hardly public protests at all , but have taken the form of supporting those unemployed who are directly affected by the new welfare rules and helping them navigate the system . still , resignation is not an emotion wompel will admit to . “ not at all , otherwise i ’ d just stay in bed and give up on my work , ” she said .
“ although sometimes that ’ s tempting . ” mondays , toned down there are some who are still hitting the streets on mondays , determined not to the let the excitement of last summer die .
they hold out hope that the protest fever will shoot up again . “ the protests , i believe , happen like waves and they aren ’ t over yet , “ martin keßler , a documentary film maker who filmed last summer ’ s protests , said in an interview with berlin ’ s taz newspaper .
“ something really started moving then . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but it appears to have hit a patch of inertia and eager protesters are harder to find on the streets these days .
at the beginning of the year , in large cities like frankfurt or leipzig , fewer than 100 people turned out to protest in each .
while protests in berlin were a little larger - police estimated 400 on jan .
3 - those numbers are also dwindling . according to egbert balzer , a spokesperson for the berlin monday demonstration alliance , the protest movement is not dying , but merely considering its options . “ it ’ s winter and cold and the government won this first round , ” he said .
“ now we have to form new strategies and have to think seriously about what we 're going to do now . ” while he said the future was difficult to predict , he added that when the population realizes how the new reforms are increasing poverty in germany , they would go back out on the streets and demand change . his organization still puts out the call for people to meet up every monday at a central berlin location and keep the protest torch burning . people have n't given up , he insisted .
although this monday , he himself wo n't be there ; he does n't have the time . kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 2004 : the road to reform the year 2004 saw germany furthering structural reforms in both its health care system and labor market .

but european experts say it would be wrong to think that a tsunami could n't happen here , and say an eu-wide early warning system is needed . the legendary city of atlantis is said to have fallen victim to a massive wave in the mediterranean sea that swallowed an entire culture .
while atlantis is a myth , the earthquake zones beneath the mediterranean are reality , even if thousands of people live seemingly worry-free on the coasts of greece , italy and spain . scientists such as dieter kelletat , professor of geography at the university of essen-duisburg , have long warned of the danger on europe 's doorstep .
kelletat calls up the image of two ice fields that grind against each other until eventually , one sheet of ice slides over the other .
the top ice field pushes the other so far down that water begins to bubble up between the two . large danger zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's southern coastal regions are in the mediterranean danger zone it 's a similar situation along the line where the european and african plates meet .

there are frequent earthquakes originating at the intersection of the two plates , with the danger zone stretching from morocco in the west , across italy and greece to turkey in the east . " in the mediterranean region , tsunamis are a threat to all the coasts , and tsunamis have already happened across the region , " kelletat said .
" but there is no tsunami warning system , and there are still false impressions about the risk tsunamis pose to the region . " as the risks are not limited to a single country , the european parliament in strasbourg is now focusing its attention on the creation of a europe-wide early warning system . warning from outer space the parliamentarians are placing their hopes on the galileo satellite navigation system , which is able to register even the smallest of changes .
but a " traditional " early warning system would also help .
according to kelletat 's estimations , the eu would only need to invest € 20 million -lrb- $ 26 million -rrb- for an effective system .
spain , italy and greece are among the countries demanding decisive action . " the important thing is that we have a unified european policy that can coordinate everything , " said spanish eu parliamentarian -lrb- mep -rrb- javier pomes .
" the risk of such a catastrophe can not be borne by one country alone .
in this area , we have to cooperate .

" i am asking that the commission now take the necessary steps to find solutions to improve the immediate situation , and i 'm happy to say that we have a large consensus on this question . " panicked reactions ? the consensus is not as wide as it could be , however .
some meps are warning of scare tactics .
others argue that an early warning system would be ineffective in the mediterranean , saying that in such a small sea , the warning times would also be too small - an argument rejected by meps from the most endangered countries . " look at the coasts of sicily , calabria , sardinia , " said italian mep vittorio prodi .
" for me , this early warning system is a must .
i think that even half an hour is enough time to save thousands of people . " prodi knows what he 's talking about .

no , it 's friedrich von schiller it 's a unique attempt to get german youth interested in a poet who has been dead for two centuries - and it just might work .
meet friedrich von schiller , comic-book hero . 200 years after the death of friedrich schiller , the keepers of the german poet 's flame have come up with a unique way to memorialize him : a comic book .
a brainchild of the german schiller society in marbach , germany , and the cologne-based publisher ehapa-verlag , the comic about schiller 's life will be published in may , on the 200th anniversary of his death .
exciting life the drawings are currently on view in an exhibit at the poet 's place of birth in marbach .
" we hope the -lrb- book 's -rrb- publication will be tied to new interest in schiller 's work and his life , " schiller society spokeswoman chritiane daetsch told dpa news service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller 's birthplace , in marbach the publishers are especially hoping the comic will awaken an interest in schiller among younger readers .
the story will " tell the exciting story of schiller 's life , " focusing on the period when he fled stuttgart to become a writer , daetsch said .
schiller was a 22 years old medic in 1782 when he left stuttgart , fleeing the duke carl eugen von württemberg , who had forbid him from writing .
his flight represents " the expression of his decision to live for writing alone , " said the artist horus -lrb- horus w. odenthal -rrb- , who was selected to tell the story .
' pale and beaky ' the prizewinning comic artist read through schiller biographies before he began to work on the story , but found particular inspiration in the poet 's personal letters .
they increasingly told the story of a contradictory figure : on the one hand a writer with a sure feel for words and stories , on the other , an excessive , tumultuous outsider , repeatedly irritating those around him .

over the centuries , however , his image was revised and re-revised , until he became a dashingly handsome young blond .
the schiller society 's daetsch points out that what seems very unusual at first glance - combining a historic literary figure with a comic book - actually has a basis in the poet 's own history .
" schiller himself used illustration and humor , " she told dpa , pointing out that he drew illustrated stories with " comic figures " for his friend gottfried körner . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schiller 's skulls as the 200th anniversary of friedrich schiller 's death dawns , controversy over his remains stirs again .

the fiscal framework for the european single currency is in great need of reform . the european union 's finance ministers agreed tuesday to pursue a formal warning process against greece after revelations that the country 's budget deficit far exceeded an eu limit since 1997 .
greece has the highest deficit in percentage terms of all euro-zone countries .
it is well over the three percent limit set down in the stability and growth pact , the fiscal rules underpinning the euro .
greece is closer than any other country to having the european commission impose financial penalties as a result .
in brussels , finance ministers from all 25 european union member states continued talks launched late monday on how best to shake up the stability pact .
the difficulties certain countries have in sticking to it has prompted calls for its reform .
germany and france favor a loosening of the euro-zone rules for national budgets , whereas austria and the netherlands are opposed to greater flexibility .

no , it 's friedrich von schiller it 's a unique attempt to get german youth interested in a poet who has been dead for two centuries - and it just might work .
meet friedrich von schiller , comic-book hero . 200 years after the death of friedrich schiller , the keepers of the german poet 's flame have come up with a unique way to memorialize him : a comic book .
a brainchild of the german schiller society in marbach , germany , and the cologne-based publisher ehapa-verlag , the comic about schiller 's life will be published in may , on the 200th anniversary of his death .
exciting life the drawings are currently on view in an exhibit at the poet 's place of birth in marbach .
" we hope the -lrb- book 's -rrb- publication will be tied to new interest in schiller 's work and his life , " schiller society spokeswoman chritiane daetsch told dpa news service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller 's birthplace , in marbach the publishers are especially hoping the comic will awaken an interest in schiller among younger readers .
the story will " tell the exciting story of schiller 's life , " focusing on the period when he fled stuttgart to become a writer , daetsch said .
schiller was a 22 years old medic in 1782 when he left stuttgart , fleeing the duke carl eugen von württemberg , who had forbid him from writing .
his flight represents " the expression of his decision to live for writing alone , " said the artist horus -lrb- horus w. odenthal -rrb- , who was selected to tell the story .
' pale and beaky ' the prizewinning comic artist read through schiller biographies before he began to work on the story , but found particular inspiration in the poet 's personal letters .
they increasingly told the story of a contradictory figure : on the one hand a writer with a sure feel for words and stories , on the other , an excessive , tumultuous outsider , repeatedly irritating those around him .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.01.2005 " schnappi " snaps up the number one spot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iris guttmann , her niece joy and , of course , the eponymous schnappi germans have gone crocodile-crazy after a children 's song about the reptile took the charts by storm .
the song , like the reptile , struck before the likes of kylie minogue or robbie williams even knew what was happening . a children 's song by a little girl has raced to the top of the german singles charts in just a few weeks .
the song schnappi , das kleine krokodil or " snappy , the little crocodile " has relegated hits by linkin park , snoop dogg and kylie minogue to the lower echelons of the top 10 .
the song is basically about the teething efforts of a little crocodile with lots of sharp teeth .
seven-year-old joy gruttmann 's aunt iris recorded her singing the tune three years ago , when she was four .
iris gruttmann , who co-wrote the song , then posted it on the internet as a kind of family joke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone wants the schnappi cd but when a couple of major radio stations discovered the song , other pop stars did n't stand a chance .
the tinny-voiced " schnappi " is on rotation on radio stations nationwide and mtv .
even nightclubs are playing a disco remix version , with people crowding the dance floor , singing the refrain " schni schna schnappi . "
media hype " schnappi is a charming , sincere children 's song , " said gruttmann .
" maybe that explains its huge success . "
gruttmann has been writing children 's songs for the past 10 years .
she has composed numerous tunes for the german public television show sendung mit der maus .
she said her niece does n't mind the media hype surrounding the song 's success .
joy is the youngest recording artist in german history to make it into the german top 10 .
she has been doing the talk show circuit since the song took off .
" of course , it 's all very exciting for her , but joy is dealing with it very calmly , " gruttmann said .
joy had only told her three best friends that she would be frequently appearing on television .

the song , like the reptile , struck before the likes of kylie minogue or robbie williams even knew what was happening . a children 's song by a little girl has raced to the top of the german singles charts in just a few weeks .
the song schnappi , das kleine krokodil or " snappy , the little crocodile " has relegated hits by linkin park , snoop dogg and kylie minogue to the lower echelons of the top 10 .
the song is basically about the teething efforts of a little crocodile with lots of sharp teeth .
seven-year-old joy gruttmann 's aunt iris recorded her singing the tune three years ago , when she was four .
iris gruttmann , who co-wrote the song , then posted it on the internet as a kind of family joke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone wants the schnappi cd but when a couple of major radio stations discovered the song , other pop stars did n't stand a chance .
the tinny-voiced " schnappi " is on rotation on radio stations nationwide and mtv .
even nightclubs are playing a disco remix version , with people crowding the dance floor , singing the refrain " schni schna schnappi . "
media hype " schnappi is a charming , sincere children 's song , " said gruttmann .
" maybe that explains its huge success . "
gruttmann has been writing children 's songs for the past 10 years .
she has composed numerous tunes for the german public television show sendung mit der maus .
she said her niece does n't mind the media hype surrounding the song 's success .
joy is the youngest recording artist in german history to make it into the german top 10 .
she has been doing the talk show circuit since the song took off .
" of course , it 's all very exciting for her , but joy is dealing with it very calmly , " gruttmann said .

but now the eyes of the world are on kobe , japan , where 3000 experts and politicians from around the globe will meet through jan .
22 to discuss the reduction of natural disasters .
saving lives since the late-december tsunami in the indian ocean , experts have acknowledged that while we ca n't prevent natural catastrophes altogether , we can do much more to mitigate their damages .
the subject of disaster reduction , long ignored by many countries , has now been pushed to the fore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irmgard schwaetzer " i really hope that the public pressure will have an effect on the conference .
documents have been very vague up to now , since many governments generally dont want to make any committment , " said irmgard schwaetzer , chairwoman of the german committee on disaster reduction .
following the south asia tsunamis , the experts all agreed : an early warning system in the region would have saved countless lives .
concrete suggestions a demand for early warning systems for natural catastrophes is nothing new , it was already voiced ten years ago , at the first large united nations conference on disaster prevention .
in addition , the united nations had deemed the 1990s the decade of national catastrophe prevention .
some of the countries represented in kobe arrived with concrete prevention plans already in hand .
germany will actively campaign for a tsunami early warning system designed by german scientists .
the € 25 million -lrb- $ 32.5 million -rrb- project is based on sensors and satellites which would detect earthquakes and calculate flood waves .
japan wants to situate a center for post-catastrophe reconstruction in the city of kobe , itself flattened by an earthquake ten years ago , the governor of hyogo prefecture said .
among its responsibilities would be to coordinate international aid , send experts to disaster-affected regions and oversee reconstruction .
it would also serve as a center for global information campaigns .
not always expensive " for early warning systems , we dont necessarily need to reinvent the wheel , but connect already existing elements , " said schwaetzer .
for years , the pacific has had a functioning system , which could be expanded , she said .
" for example , there are gauging stations in germany that could be expanded , with very little additional work , and connected to an early warning system for the indian ocean .
the measures do n't have to be very expensive ; the coordination is the main factor , " she said .
not only developing nations need improvement .
the elbe river flooding in 2002 showed how industrial nations , like germany , could also benefit from better disaster-relief communications .
" it is clear that communication between the states , the individual aid organizations , and even by us -lrb- the disaster relief committee -rrb- , in a highly developed country , can fail .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sri lanka tsunami survivor the reason for this is the complexity of catastrophe-reduction planning .
" it is more than just making ambulances available .
its about making disaster plans , getting early warning systems running , and training people how to evaluate a warning or a risk .
teaching people to be aware of danger , " schwaezer said .
great expectations but conference goers are also wary of having overly high expectations .
experience shows that the more time has gone by following a catastrophe , the risk-awareness wanes .
there are numerous examples of how preparation can save lives .

following the south asia tsunamis , the experts all agreed : an early warning system in the region would have saved countless lives .
concrete suggestions a demand for early warning systems for natural catastrophes is nothing new , it was already voiced ten years ago , at the first large united nations conference on disaster prevention .
in addition , the united nations had deemed the 1990s the decade of national catastrophe prevention .
some of the countries represented in kobe arrived with concrete prevention plans already in hand .
germany will actively campaign for a tsunami early warning system designed by german scientists .
the € 25 million -lrb- $ 32.5 million -rrb- project is based on sensors and satellites which would detect earthquakes and calculate flood waves .
japan wants to situate a center for post-catastrophe reconstruction in the city of kobe , itself flattened by an earthquake ten years ago , the governor of hyogo prefecture said .
among its responsibilities would be to coordinate international aid , send experts to disaster-affected regions and oversee reconstruction .
it would also serve as a center for global information campaigns .
not always expensive " for early warning systems , we dont necessarily need to reinvent the wheel , but connect already existing elements , " said schwaetzer .
for years , the pacific has had a functioning system , which could be expanded , she said .
" for example , there are gauging stations in germany that could be expanded , with very little additional work , and connected to an early warning system for the indian ocean .
the measures do n't have to be very expensive ; the coordination is the main factor , " she said .
not only developing nations need improvement .
the elbe river flooding in 2002 showed how industrial nations , like germany , could also benefit from better disaster-relief communications .
" it is clear that communication between the states , the individual aid organizations , and even by us -lrb- the disaster relief committee -rrb- , in a highly developed country , can fail .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sri lanka tsunami survivor the reason for this is the complexity of catastrophe-reduction planning .
" it is more than just making ambulances available .
its about making disaster plans , getting early warning systems running , and training people how to evaluate a warning or a risk .
teaching people to be aware of danger , " schwaezer said .

violent militant attacks in iraq continue unabated with at least 16 people , including eight iraqi soldiers , killed in separate attacks around the country on monday . despite the violence , iraqi and us officials still insist that the january 30 poll will go ahead as planned . registration booths have opened all over the world , including in four german cities - cologne , berlin , mannheim and munich .
even iraqis living in poland , the czech republic , austria and switzerland can go to the german election stations .

from the 768,000 migrants to germany in 2003 about two thirds came from europe , mostly from italy , poland , russia and turkey .
migrants from africa make up only a fraction of that with about 5 percent mainly asylum-seekers . beck says that immigration in 2003 was still largely unregulated causing problems of integration .

this month a new immigration law has come into effect in germany placing greater emphasis on qualified immigration . beck says it is too early to say how this will affect immigration statistics , but experts are already saying that the hurdles for skilled foreigners to come to germany are still be too high compared with the united states , britain or other industrialized countries . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks common immigration policy eu proposals to attract high-skilled immigrants , unveiled tuesday , were met with criticism at a time when anti-immigrant sentiment is rising in much of europe .

but only about 5 million have actually stayed here since then . in 2003 - the year for which the latest immigration statistics are available - the number of migrants to germany for the first time dropped below 800,000 .
a figure , beck says , which could continue to raise xenophobic fears among native germans , but which should be seen in the light of about 620,000 people who left germany for good in that year .

migrants from africa make up only a fraction of that with about 5 percent mainly asylum-seekers . beck says that immigration in 2003 was still largely unregulated causing problems of integration .
but she also adds that the influx of foreigners is necessary for german society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have groups of foreigners where the necessity to qualify them is very big and which creats costs , " said beck .

this month a new immigration law has come into effect in germany placing greater emphasis on qualified immigration . beck says it is too early to say how this will affect immigration statistics , but experts are already saying that the hurdles for skilled foreigners to come to germany are still be too high compared with the united states , britain or other industrialized countries . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks common immigration policy eu proposals to attract high-skilled immigrants , unveiled tuesday , were met with criticism at a time when anti-immigrant sentiment is rising in much of europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's rocky road to reformation nothing ventured , nothing gained germany 2004 : the road to reform in coma and looking for work schröder accepts opposition offer of help germany -pipe- 18.01.2005 reform opponents ponder " what now ? " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reform opponents can only dream of getting crowds like these today last year , an opposition movement gained momentum protesting the german government ’ s welfare and labor market reforms .
but now that reforms are a reality , protest groups are looking at ways to keep the opposition alive . the idea was to paralyze labor offices in at least 80 german cities on january 3 , the first day that the controversial hartz iv reforms went into effect .
the project to achieve that , named “ agency shutdown , ” called on reform opponents to turn out in the numbers they did last summer to “ occupy ” job centers and , in effect , shut them down . the call largely went unheeded . government officials estimated that only about 700 protesters gathered at branches of the federal labor office across the country , although protest leaders said around 15,000 took part in protests nationwide . still , it was a far cry from the tens of thousands - at one point 150,000 - who turned out in august and september at the “ monday demonstrations ” to show their opposition to chancellor schröder ’ s controversial plan to breathe new life into germany ’ s labor market . “ agency shutdown was not a big success , ” said peter wahl , a co-founder of attac , the anti-globalization group which played a large role in organizing last summer ’ s protests . according to him , its failure is a result of a feeling of resignation that has set in among many protesters .
they felt themselves to be part of a popular , democratic movement last year , but watched in frustration as the government stood its ground and in the end , only made a few cosmetic changes to a reform plan reviled by many .
in january , hartz iv officially went into effect . “ people are indeed very dissatisfied with these so-called reforms , ” he said .
“ but they have the feeling they can ’ t change anything . ” bildunterschrift : now , attac is considering what to do next regarding the unwelcome reforms .
the group is an international organization which addresses several issues , and for now , the reform issue in germany has taken a back seat .
at present attac does not have any plans to continue with a new series of monday demonstrations . wahl said the group was on “ stand-by , ” ready to get on board if a new protest wave is ignited by popular indignation over the effects of the labor and welfare changes .
but he 's not holding his breath . " at the moment , there is nothing worth mentioning going on , ” he said .
“ there are several groups who are trying to keep going with the monday demonstrations , but they aren ’ t very effective . ” shaky determination mag wompel , an editor at labournet germany , an internet site which links labor activists and helped organize the “ agency shutdown ” project , agrees that the protest movement has lost some of the steam it had last summer .
but while it did not have the hoped-for effect , she insists it was not in vain .
according to her , it resulted in new alliances by people in several cities who are still active in their opposition to schröder ’ s reform plans . “ as long as there are hartz laws , we will continue to stage actions and protests , ” she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests that are now taking place have none of the visibility of last year ’ s .
indeed , many of them are hardly public protests at all , but have taken the form of supporting those unemployed who are directly affected by the new welfare rules and helping them navigate the system . still , resignation is not an emotion wompel will admit to . “ not at all , otherwise i ’ d just stay in bed and give up on my work , ” she said .
“ although sometimes that ’ s tempting . ” mondays , toned down there are some who are still hitting the streets on mondays , determined not to the let the excitement of last summer die .
they hold out hope that the protest fever will shoot up again . “ the protests , i believe , happen like waves and they aren ’ t over yet , “ martin keßler , a documentary film maker who filmed last summer ’ s protests , said in an interview with berlin ’ s taz newspaper .
“ something really started moving then . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but it appears to have hit a patch of inertia and eager protesters are harder to find on the streets these days .
at the beginning of the year , in large cities like frankfurt or leipzig , fewer than 100 people turned out to protest in each .
while protests in berlin were a little larger - police estimated 400 on jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's rocky road to reformation nothing ventured , nothing gained germany 2004 : the road to reform in coma and looking for work schröder accepts opposition offer of help germany -pipe- 18.01.2005 reform opponents ponder " what now ? " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reform opponents can only dream of getting crowds like these today last year , an opposition movement gained momentum protesting the german government ’ s welfare and labor market reforms .
but now that reforms are a reality , protest groups are looking at ways to keep the opposition alive . the idea was to paralyze labor offices in at least 80 german cities on january 3 , the first day that the controversial hartz iv reforms went into effect .
the project to achieve that , named “ agency shutdown , ” called on reform opponents to turn out in the numbers they did last summer to “ occupy ” job centers and , in effect , shut them down . the call largely went unheeded . government officials estimated that only about 700 protesters gathered at branches of the federal labor office across the country , although protest leaders said around 15,000 took part in protests nationwide . still , it was a far cry from the tens of thousands - at one point 150,000 - who turned out in august and september at the “ monday demonstrations ” to show their opposition to chancellor schröder ’ s controversial plan to breathe new life into germany ’ s labor market . “ agency shutdown was not a big success , ” said peter wahl , a co-founder of attac , the anti-globalization group which played a large role in organizing last summer ’ s protests . according to him , its failure is a result of a feeling of resignation that has set in among many protesters .
they felt themselves to be part of a popular , democratic movement last year , but watched in frustration as the government stood its ground and in the end , only made a few cosmetic changes to a reform plan reviled by many .
in january , hartz iv officially went into effect . “ people are indeed very dissatisfied with these so-called reforms , ” he said .
“ but they have the feeling they can ’ t change anything . ” bildunterschrift : now , attac is considering what to do next regarding the unwelcome reforms .
the group is an international organization which addresses several issues , and for now , the reform issue in germany has taken a back seat .
at present attac does not have any plans to continue with a new series of monday demonstrations . wahl said the group was on “ stand-by , ” ready to get on board if a new protest wave is ignited by popular indignation over the effects of the labor and welfare changes .
but he 's not holding his breath . " at the moment , there is nothing worth mentioning going on , ” he said .
“ there are several groups who are trying to keep going with the monday demonstrations , but they aren ’ t very effective . ” shaky determination mag wompel , an editor at labournet germany , an internet site which links labor activists and helped organize the “ agency shutdown ” project , agrees that the protest movement has lost some of the steam it had last summer .
but while it did not have the hoped-for effect , she insists it was not in vain .
according to her , it resulted in new alliances by people in several cities who are still active in their opposition to schröder ’ s reform plans . “ as long as there are hartz laws , we will continue to stage actions and protests , ” she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests that are now taking place have none of the visibility of last year ’ s .
indeed , many of them are hardly public protests at all , but have taken the form of supporting those unemployed who are directly affected by the new welfare rules and helping them navigate the system . still , resignation is not an emotion wompel will admit to . “ not at all , otherwise i ’ d just stay in bed and give up on my work , ” she said .
“ although sometimes that ’ s tempting . ” mondays , toned down there are some who are still hitting the streets on mondays , determined not to the let the excitement of last summer die .
they hold out hope that the protest fever will shoot up again . “ the protests , i believe , happen like waves and they aren ’ t over yet , “ martin keßler , a documentary film maker who filmed last summer ’ s protests , said in an interview with berlin ’ s taz newspaper .
“ something really started moving then . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but it appears to have hit a patch of inertia and eager protesters are harder to find on the streets these days .
at the beginning of the year , in large cities like frankfurt or leipzig , fewer than 100 people turned out to protest in each .
while protests in berlin were a little larger - police estimated 400 on jan .
3 - those numbers are also dwindling . according to egbert balzer , a spokesperson for the berlin monday demonstration alliance , the protest movement is not dying , but merely considering its options . “ it ’ s winter and cold and the government won this first round , ” he said .
“ now we have to form new strategies and have to think seriously about what we 're going to do now . ” while he said the future was difficult to predict , he added that when the population realizes how the new reforms are increasing poverty in germany , they would go back out on the streets and demand change . his organization still puts out the call for people to meet up every monday at a central berlin location and keep the protest torch burning . people have n't given up , he insisted .
although this monday , he himself wo n't be there ; he does n't have the time . kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 2004 : the road to reform the year 2004 saw germany furthering structural reforms in both its health care system and labor market .

" großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reform opponents can only dream of getting crowds like these today last year , an opposition movement gained momentum protesting the german government ’ s welfare and labor market reforms .
but now that reforms are a reality , protest groups are looking at ways to keep the opposition alive . the idea was to paralyze labor offices in at least 80 german cities on january 3 , the first day that the controversial hartz iv reforms went into effect .
the project to achieve that , named “ agency shutdown , ” called on reform opponents to turn out in the numbers they did last summer to “ occupy ” job centers and , in effect , shut them down . the call largely went unheeded . government officials estimated that only about 700 protesters gathered at branches of the federal labor office across the country , although protest leaders said around 15,000 took part in protests nationwide . still , it was a far cry from the tens of thousands - at one point 150,000 - who turned out in august and september at the “ monday demonstrations ” to show their opposition to chancellor schröder ’ s controversial plan to breathe new life into germany ’ s labor market . “ agency shutdown was not a big success , ” said peter wahl , a co-founder of attac , the anti-globalization group which played a large role in organizing last summer ’ s protests . according to him , its failure is a result of a feeling of resignation that has set in among many protesters .
they felt themselves to be part of a popular , democratic movement last year , but watched in frustration as the government stood its ground and in the end , only made a few cosmetic changes to a reform plan reviled by many .
in january , hartz iv officially went into effect . “ people are indeed very dissatisfied with these so-called reforms , ” he said .
“ but they have the feeling they can ’ t change anything . ” bildunterschrift : now , attac is considering what to do next regarding the unwelcome reforms .
the group is an international organization which addresses several issues , and for now , the reform issue in germany has taken a back seat .
at present attac does not have any plans to continue with a new series of monday demonstrations . wahl said the group was on “ stand-by , ” ready to get on board if a new protest wave is ignited by popular indignation over the effects of the labor and welfare changes .
but he 's not holding his breath . " at the moment , there is nothing worth mentioning going on , ” he said .
“ there are several groups who are trying to keep going with the monday demonstrations , but they aren ’ t very effective . ” shaky determination mag wompel , an editor at labournet germany , an internet site which links labor activists and helped organize the “ agency shutdown ” project , agrees that the protest movement has lost some of the steam it had last summer .
but while it did not have the hoped-for effect , she insists it was not in vain .
according to her , it resulted in new alliances by people in several cities who are still active in their opposition to schröder ’ s reform plans . “ as long as there are hartz laws , we will continue to stage actions and protests , ” she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests that are now taking place have none of the visibility of last year ’ s .
indeed , many of them are hardly public protests at all , but have taken the form of supporting those unemployed who are directly affected by the new welfare rules and helping them navigate the system . still , resignation is not an emotion wompel will admit to . “ not at all , otherwise i ’ d just stay in bed and give up on my work , ” she said .
“ although sometimes that ’ s tempting . ” mondays , toned down there are some who are still hitting the streets on mondays , determined not to the let the excitement of last summer die .
they hold out hope that the protest fever will shoot up again . “ the protests , i believe , happen like waves and they aren ’ t over yet , “ martin keßler , a documentary film maker who filmed last summer ’ s protests , said in an interview with berlin ’ s taz newspaper .
“ something really started moving then . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but it appears to have hit a patch of inertia and eager protesters are harder to find on the streets these days .
at the beginning of the year , in large cities like frankfurt or leipzig , fewer than 100 people turned out to protest in each .
while protests in berlin were a little larger - police estimated 400 on jan .
3 - those numbers are also dwindling . according to egbert balzer , a spokesperson for the berlin monday demonstration alliance , the protest movement is not dying , but merely considering its options . “ it ’ s winter and cold and the government won this first round , ” he said .
“ now we have to form new strategies and have to think seriously about what we 're going to do now . ” while he said the future was difficult to predict , he added that when the population realizes how the new reforms are increasing poverty in germany , they would go back out on the streets and demand change . his organization still puts out the call for people to meet up every monday at a central berlin location and keep the protest torch burning . people have n't given up , he insisted .
although this monday , he himself wo n't be there ; he does n't have the time . kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 2004 : the road to reform the year 2004 saw germany furthering structural reforms in both its health care system and labor market .

the project to achieve that , named “ agency shutdown , ” called on reform opponents to turn out in the numbers they did last summer to “ occupy ” job centers and , in effect , shut them down . the call largely went unheeded . government officials estimated that only about 700 protesters gathered at branches of the federal labor office across the country , although protest leaders said around 15,000 took part in protests nationwide . still , it was a far cry from the tens of thousands - at one point 150,000 - who turned out in august and september at the “ monday demonstrations ” to show their opposition to chancellor schröder ’ s controversial plan to breathe new life into germany ’ s labor market . “ agency shutdown was not a big success , ” said peter wahl , a co-founder of attac , the anti-globalization group which played a large role in organizing last summer ’ s protests . according to him , its failure is a result of a feeling of resignation that has set in among many protesters .
they felt themselves to be part of a popular , democratic movement last year , but watched in frustration as the government stood its ground and in the end , only made a few cosmetic changes to a reform plan reviled by many .
in january , hartz iv officially went into effect . “ people are indeed very dissatisfied with these so-called reforms , ” he said .
“ but they have the feeling they can ’ t change anything . ” bildunterschrift : now , attac is considering what to do next regarding the unwelcome reforms .
the group is an international organization which addresses several issues , and for now , the reform issue in germany has taken a back seat .
at present attac does not have any plans to continue with a new series of monday demonstrations . wahl said the group was on “ stand-by , ” ready to get on board if a new protest wave is ignited by popular indignation over the effects of the labor and welfare changes .
but he 's not holding his breath . " at the moment , there is nothing worth mentioning going on , ” he said .
“ there are several groups who are trying to keep going with the monday demonstrations , but they aren ’ t very effective . ” shaky determination mag wompel , an editor at labournet germany , an internet site which links labor activists and helped organize the “ agency shutdown ” project , agrees that the protest movement has lost some of the steam it had last summer .
but while it did not have the hoped-for effect , she insists it was not in vain .
according to her , it resulted in new alliances by people in several cities who are still active in their opposition to schröder ’ s reform plans . “ as long as there are hartz laws , we will continue to stage actions and protests , ” she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests that are now taking place have none of the visibility of last year ’ s .
indeed , many of them are hardly public protests at all , but have taken the form of supporting those unemployed who are directly affected by the new welfare rules and helping them navigate the system . still , resignation is not an emotion wompel will admit to . “ not at all , otherwise i ’ d just stay in bed and give up on my work , ” she said .
“ although sometimes that ’ s tempting . ” mondays , toned down there are some who are still hitting the streets on mondays , determined not to the let the excitement of last summer die .
they hold out hope that the protest fever will shoot up again . “ the protests , i believe , happen like waves and they aren ’ t over yet , “ martin keßler , a documentary film maker who filmed last summer ’ s protests , said in an interview with berlin ’ s taz newspaper .
“ something really started moving then . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but it appears to have hit a patch of inertia and eager protesters are harder to find on the streets these days .
at the beginning of the year , in large cities like frankfurt or leipzig , fewer than 100 people turned out to protest in each .
while protests in berlin were a little larger - police estimated 400 on jan .

" as long as there are still holocaust survivors among us , the german language should not be spoken in parliament , " israel 's minister of health dani naveh told the right-wing israeli daily newspaper maariv .
naveh said he plans to boycott the speech , which köhler will make toward the end of january , to mark the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between israel and germany .
his comment echoes the feelings of a number of members of the israeli parliament or knesset . other jewish public figures have spoken out in favor of köhler using his native german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous german president johannes rau visited israel in 2003 the current dispute harkens back to 2000 , when germany 's then-president johannes rau made the first address of a german president to the knesset .
his speech , also in german , caused a similar uproar .
reminders of the nazi era ?
responding to the current round of criticism , the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors to cancel the event or to ask köhler to hold his speech in english .
" my feet have never touched german soil , and i buy no german products , " said doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust .
" i can not allow that language to be spoken in the house of parliament of the jewish people , " he said .
member of the knesset -lrb- mk -rrb- gila finkelstein also said köhler should speak in english , not german .
' open wound ' " my whole body will tremor if i hear german in the knesset , " said finkelstein , whose extended family was murdered in the holocaust .
" there is an open wound , " she said , in an interview with the jerusalem post on monday .
finkelstein called on köhler to " act with sensitivity " and not speak german .
knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who has rejected as the mks ' requests , was instrumental in the decision to allow köhler to deliver his speech in german in the first place .
" it is clear that a visiting president speaks in his language , " rivlin told the jerusalem post .
it would be " better not to extend an invitation than to demand that the guest speak in a different language , " he argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some members of the knesset at work at the same time , rivlin said he understands mks who argue that israel can not ignore what happened under the nazis . but he also said the protest should not be directed toward one person or his spoken language , but a historic occurrence that " we must remember and not forget . "
insulting request ?
opposition leader yosef lapid - himself a holocaust survivor - said the situation is different now than it was when germany and israel first resumed diplomatic relations .
forty years ago , lapid would have have opposed a german address in the knesset .
since then , israel 's relations with germany have changed .
now , lapid said , it would be insulting to prevent the german president from speaking in his own language .
in an interview in germany 's frankfurt allgemeine zeitung newspaper , marcel reich-ranicki , one of the last survivors of the warsaw ghetto and a prominent literary critic in germany , criticized the discussion in israel .
köhler should address the knesset in german , he arged , calling the boycott threats " not only deplorable but shameful and , in the end , incomprehensible . "
associating the german language only with the nazi regime and saying its use in the knesset would defile holocaust survivors is " pure nonsense , " said reich-ranicki .
it neglects , for instance , the fact that german-speaking jews have played an enormous role in the development of modern thought , he told the paper .
german thinkers " we can no longer imagine physics without albert einstein , psychology without sigmund freud , sociology without karl marx , literature without franz kafka , and modern music without gustav mahler and arnold schönberg - all german speaking jews , " reich-ranicki said .
he also noted that the father of zionism , theodor herzle , published a decisive book on the creation of a jewish state , der judenstaat in german in 1896 , and that herzl had long debated whether german should be that country 's lingua franca .
it was only after the founding of the state of israel that hebrew became the official language because it was the common denominator among jews of different nationalities .
changing concerns the german culture will soon cease to be a touchy topic in israel , according to reich-ranicki .
the current generation has too much else on its mind , said the man known in germany as a " literature czar . "
" in israel , they wo n't discuss much longer whether wagner should be played in concert halls or german should be spoken in parliament , " he predicted .

in an interview in germany 's frankfurt allgemeine zeitung newspaper , marcel reich-ranicki , one of the last survivors of the warsaw ghetto and a prominent literary critic in germany , criticized the discussion in israel .
köhler should address the knesset in german , he arged , calling the boycott threats " not only deplorable but shameful and , in the end , incomprehensible . "
associating the german language only with the nazi regime and saying its use in the knesset would defile holocaust survivors is " pure nonsense , " said reich-ranicki .
it neglects , for instance , the fact that german-speaking jews have played an enormous role in the development of modern thought , he told the paper .
german thinkers " we can no longer imagine physics without albert einstein , psychology without sigmund freud , sociology without karl marx , literature without franz kafka , and modern music without gustav mahler and arnold schönberg - all german speaking jews , " reich-ranicki said .
he also noted that the father of zionism , theodor herzle , published a decisive book on the creation of a jewish state , der judenstaat in german in 1896 , and that herzl had long debated whether german should be that country 's lingua franca .
it was only after the founding of the state of israel that hebrew became the official language because it was the common denominator among jews of different nationalities .
changing concerns the german culture will soon cease to be a touchy topic in israel , according to reich-ranicki .
the current generation has too much else on its mind , said the man known in germany as a " literature czar . "
" in israel , they wo n't discuss much longer whether wagner should be played in concert halls or german should be spoken in parliament , " he predicted .

" as long as there are still holocaust survivors among us , the german language should not be spoken in parliament , " israel 's minister of health dani naveh told the right-wing israeli daily newspaper maariv .
naveh said he plans to boycott the speech , which köhler will make toward the end of january , to mark the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between israel and germany .
his comment echoes the feelings of a number of members of the israeli parliament or knesset . other jewish public figures have spoken out in favor of köhler using his native german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous german president johannes rau visited israel in 2003 the current dispute harkens back to 2000 , when germany 's then-president johannes rau made the first address of a german president to the knesset .
his speech , also in german , caused a similar uproar .
reminders of the nazi era ?
responding to the current round of criticism , the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors to cancel the event or to ask köhler to hold his speech in english .
" my feet have never touched german soil , and i buy no german products , " said doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust .
" i can not allow that language to be spoken in the house of parliament of the jewish people , " he said .
member of the knesset -lrb- mk -rrb- gila finkelstein also said köhler should speak in english , not german .
' open wound ' " my whole body will tremor if i hear german in the knesset , " said finkelstein , whose extended family was murdered in the holocaust .
" there is an open wound , " she said , in an interview with the jerusalem post on monday .
finkelstein called on köhler to " act with sensitivity " and not speak german .
knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who has rejected as the mks ' requests , was instrumental in the decision to allow köhler to deliver his speech in german in the first place .
" it is clear that a visiting president speaks in his language , " rivlin told the jerusalem post .
it would be " better not to extend an invitation than to demand that the guest speak in a different language , " he argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some members of the knesset at work at the same time , rivlin said he understands mks who argue that israel can not ignore what happened under the nazis . but he also said the protest should not be directed toward one person or his spoken language , but a historic occurrence that " we must remember and not forget . "
insulting request ?
opposition leader yosef lapid - himself a holocaust survivor - said the situation is different now than it was when germany and israel first resumed diplomatic relations .
forty years ago , lapid would have have opposed a german address in the knesset .
since then , israel 's relations with germany have changed .
now , lapid said , it would be insulting to prevent the german president from speaking in his own language .

the fiscal framework for the european single currency is in great need of reform . the european union 's finance ministers agreed tuesday to pursue a formal warning process against greece after revelations that the country 's budget deficit far exceeded an eu limit since 1997 .
greece has the highest deficit in percentage terms of all euro-zone countries .
it is well over the three percent limit set down in the stability and growth pact , the fiscal rules underpinning the euro .
greece is closer than any other country to having the european commission impose financial penalties as a result .
in brussels , finance ministers from all 25 european union member states continued talks launched late monday on how best to shake up the stability pact .
the difficulties certain countries have in sticking to it has prompted calls for its reform .
germany and france favor a loosening of the euro-zone rules for national budgets , whereas austria and the netherlands are opposed to greater flexibility .
german call for more leeway negotiations among euro-zone finance ministers have now entered a critical phase .
luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker wants to strike a deal on reforming the pact before an eu summit at the end of march .
it is meant to tackle long-term reforms for the eu 's weak economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel wants the pact reconsidered before the late night meeting started monday , germany 's finance minister hans eichel -lrb- photo -rrb- defended his country 's proposals for more leeway for national governments in times of economic stagnation or social reform .
his austrian counterpart karl heinz grasser responded that there was nothing wrong with the stability pact .
the problem was more that certain countries had difficulty in abiding by it .
making europe more growth-oriented german chancellor gerhard schröder earlier this week called for greater flexibility in the budget rules that set a strict limit on a country 's public deficit .
" the crux of the matter is to ensure that europe become more growth-orientated , " said schröder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a euro sculpture in front of the european central bank in frankfurt , germany the german chancellor wants certain items to be excluded from the deficit calculations - a proposal which has drawn criticism from germany 's central bank , bundesbank .
it argued that this step would be tantamount to lifting the three percent ceiling and excessive deficits would become the rule , not the exception .
leaders should n't interfere dutch finance minister gerrit zalm criticized schröder for his remarks , saying they could make tuesday 's talks more difficult .
" it 's always hard to reach a compromise when government leaders interfere with the business of finance ministers , " zalm told reporters .
but schröder insisted that the deficit limit is inadequate to deal with the complex realities of fiscal policy .
he said germany would not agree to a reform that did not limit the powers of the european commission to intervene .
smaller eu countries are adamant that budgetary rigor is essential to the euro 's credibility .

but now the eyes of the world are on kobe , japan , where 3000 experts and politicians from around the globe will meet through jan .
22 to discuss the reduction of natural disasters .
saving lives since the late-december tsunami in the indian ocean , experts have acknowledged that while we ca n't prevent natural catastrophes altogether , we can do much more to mitigate their damages .
the subject of disaster reduction , long ignored by many countries , has now been pushed to the fore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irmgard schwaetzer " i really hope that the public pressure will have an effect on the conference .
documents have been very vague up to now , since many governments generally dont want to make any committment , " said irmgard schwaetzer , chairwoman of the german committee on disaster reduction .
following the south asia tsunamis , the experts all agreed : an early warning system in the region would have saved countless lives .
concrete suggestions a demand for early warning systems for natural catastrophes is nothing new , it was already voiced ten years ago , at the first large united nations conference on disaster prevention .
in addition , the united nations had deemed the 1990s the decade of national catastrophe prevention .
some of the countries represented in kobe arrived with concrete prevention plans already in hand .

japan wants to situate a center for post-catastrophe reconstruction in the city of kobe , itself flattened by an earthquake ten years ago , the governor of hyogo prefecture said .
among its responsibilities would be to coordinate international aid , send experts to disaster-affected regions and oversee reconstruction .
it would also serve as a center for global information campaigns .
not always expensive " for early warning systems , we dont necessarily need to reinvent the wheel , but connect already existing elements , " said schwaetzer .
for years , the pacific has had a functioning system , which could be expanded , she said .
" for example , there are gauging stations in germany that could be expanded , with very little additional work , and connected to an early warning system for the indian ocean .
the measures do n't have to be very expensive ; the coordination is the main factor , " she said .
not only developing nations need improvement .
the elbe river flooding in 2002 showed how industrial nations , like germany , could also benefit from better disaster-relief communications .
" it is clear that communication between the states , the individual aid organizations , and even by us -lrb- the disaster relief committee -rrb- , in a highly developed country , can fail .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sri lanka tsunami survivor the reason for this is the complexity of catastrophe-reduction planning .

its about making disaster plans , getting early warning systems running , and training people how to evaluate a warning or a risk .
teaching people to be aware of danger , " schwaezer said .
great expectations but conference goers are also wary of having overly high expectations .
experience shows that the more time has gone by following a catastrophe , the risk-awareness wanes .

but now the eyes of the world are on kobe , japan , where 3000 experts and politicians from around the globe will meet through jan .
22 to discuss the reduction of natural disasters .
saving lives since the late-december tsunami in the indian ocean , experts have acknowledged that while we ca n't prevent natural catastrophes altogether , we can do much more to mitigate their damages .
the subject of disaster reduction , long ignored by many countries , has now been pushed to the fore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irmgard schwaetzer " i really hope that the public pressure will have an effect on the conference .
documents have been very vague up to now , since many governments generally dont want to make any committment , " said irmgard schwaetzer , chairwoman of the german committee on disaster reduction .
following the south asia tsunamis , the experts all agreed : an early warning system in the region would have saved countless lives .
concrete suggestions a demand for early warning systems for natural catastrophes is nothing new , it was already voiced ten years ago , at the first large united nations conference on disaster prevention .
in addition , the united nations had deemed the 1990s the decade of national catastrophe prevention .
some of the countries represented in kobe arrived with concrete prevention plans already in hand .
germany will actively campaign for a tsunami early warning system designed by german scientists .
the € 25 million -lrb- $ 32.5 million -rrb- project is based on sensors and satellites which would detect earthquakes and calculate flood waves .
japan wants to situate a center for post-catastrophe reconstruction in the city of kobe , itself flattened by an earthquake ten years ago , the governor of hyogo prefecture said .
among its responsibilities would be to coordinate international aid , send experts to disaster-affected regions and oversee reconstruction .
it would also serve as a center for global information campaigns .
not always expensive " for early warning systems , we dont necessarily need to reinvent the wheel , but connect already existing elements , " said schwaetzer .

the fiscal framework for the european single currency is in great need of reform . the european union 's finance ministers agreed tuesday to pursue a formal warning process against greece after revelations that the country 's budget deficit far exceeded an eu limit since 1997 .
greece has the highest deficit in percentage terms of all euro-zone countries .
it is well over the three percent limit set down in the stability and growth pact , the fiscal rules underpinning the euro .
greece is closer than any other country to having the european commission impose financial penalties as a result .
in brussels , finance ministers from all 25 european union member states continued talks launched late monday on how best to shake up the stability pact .
the difficulties certain countries have in sticking to it has prompted calls for its reform .
germany and france favor a loosening of the euro-zone rules for national budgets , whereas austria and the netherlands are opposed to greater flexibility .
german call for more leeway negotiations among euro-zone finance ministers have now entered a critical phase .
luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker wants to strike a deal on reforming the pact before an eu summit at the end of march .
it is meant to tackle long-term reforms for the eu 's weak economy .

his austrian counterpart karl heinz grasser responded that there was nothing wrong with the stability pact .
the problem was more that certain countries had difficulty in abiding by it .
making europe more growth-oriented german chancellor gerhard schröder earlier this week called for greater flexibility in the budget rules that set a strict limit on a country 's public deficit .
" the crux of the matter is to ensure that europe become more growth-orientated , " said schröder .

leaders should n't interfere dutch finance minister gerrit zalm criticized schröder for his remarks , saying they could make tuesday 's talks more difficult .
" it 's always hard to reach a compromise when government leaders interfere with the business of finance ministers , " zalm told reporters .
but schröder insisted that the deficit limit is inadequate to deal with the complex realities of fiscal policy .
he said germany would not agree to a reform that did not limit the powers of the european commission to intervene .

" you need to count another three years , " airbus chief noel forgeard told france 's la tribune newspaper when asked when the break-even point would come for the a380 project .
forgeard predicted that would happen when the 750th a480 is sold . so far , 14 airlines have placed orders for 149 of the new planes , which have a catalog price of between € 200 and € 218 million .

the planes will be able to land at airports equipped for 747s , though the wing-span is too large for the planes to dock in most places .
many of the world 's most heavily traveled airports , including frankfurt airport london 's heathrow and new york 's john f. kennedy international , have been preparing for the huge planes . airbus has around 50,000 employees , mainly in france , germany , spain and britain .

the fiscal framework for the european single currency is in great need of reform . the european union 's finance ministers agreed tuesday to pursue a formal warning process against greece after revelations that the country 's budget deficit far exceeded an eu limit since 1997 .
greece has the highest deficit in percentage terms of all euro-zone countries .
it is well over the three percent limit set down in the stability and growth pact , the fiscal rules underpinning the euro .
greece is closer than any other country to having the european commission impose financial penalties as a result .
in brussels , finance ministers from all 25 european union member states continued talks launched late monday on how best to shake up the stability pact .
the difficulties certain countries have in sticking to it has prompted calls for its reform .
germany and france favor a loosening of the euro-zone rules for national budgets , whereas austria and the netherlands are opposed to greater flexibility .
german call for more leeway negotiations among euro-zone finance ministers have now entered a critical phase .
luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker wants to strike a deal on reforming the pact before an eu summit at the end of march .
it is meant to tackle long-term reforms for the eu 's weak economy .

his austrian counterpart karl heinz grasser responded that there was nothing wrong with the stability pact .
the problem was more that certain countries had difficulty in abiding by it .
making europe more growth-oriented german chancellor gerhard schröder earlier this week called for greater flexibility in the budget rules that set a strict limit on a country 's public deficit .
" the crux of the matter is to ensure that europe become more growth-orientated , " said schröder .

leaders should n't interfere dutch finance minister gerrit zalm criticized schröder for his remarks , saying they could make tuesday 's talks more difficult .
" it 's always hard to reach a compromise when government leaders interfere with the business of finance ministers , " zalm told reporters .
but schröder insisted that the deficit limit is inadequate to deal with the complex realities of fiscal policy .
he said germany would not agree to a reform that did not limit the powers of the european commission to intervene .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.01.2005 german not wanted in israel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's speech in israel will remind some of the nazi era some israeli politicians are protesting a planned speech in parliament by german president horst köhler , arguing that the address , which köhler will make in german , is an insult to holocaust survivors . " as long as there are still holocaust survivors among us , the german language should not be spoken in parliament , " israel 's minister of health dani naveh told the right-wing israeli daily newspaper maariv .
naveh said he plans to boycott the speech , which köhler will make toward the end of january , to mark the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between israel and germany .
his comment echoes the feelings of a number of members of the israeli parliament or knesset . other jewish public figures have spoken out in favor of köhler using his native german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous german president johannes rau visited israel in 2003 the current dispute harkens back to 2000 , when germany 's then-president johannes rau made the first address of a german president to the knesset .
his speech , also in german , caused a similar uproar .
reminders of the nazi era ?
responding to the current round of criticism , the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors to cancel the event or to ask köhler to hold his speech in english .
" my feet have never touched german soil , and i buy no german products , " said doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust .
" i can not allow that language to be spoken in the house of parliament of the jewish people , " he said .
member of the knesset -lrb- mk -rrb- gila finkelstein also said köhler should speak in english , not german .
' open wound ' " my whole body will tremor if i hear german in the knesset , " said finkelstein , whose extended family was murdered in the holocaust .
" there is an open wound , " she said , in an interview with the jerusalem post on monday .
finkelstein called on köhler to " act with sensitivity " and not speak german .
knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who has rejected as the mks ' requests , was instrumental in the decision to allow köhler to deliver his speech in german in the first place .
" it is clear that a visiting president speaks in his language , " rivlin told the jerusalem post .
it would be " better not to extend an invitation than to demand that the guest speak in a different language , " he argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some members of the knesset at work at the same time , rivlin said he understands mks who argue that israel can not ignore what happened under the nazis . but he also said the protest should not be directed toward one person or his spoken language , but a historic occurrence that " we must remember and not forget . "
insulting request ?
opposition leader yosef lapid - himself a holocaust survivor - said the situation is different now than it was when germany and israel first resumed diplomatic relations .
forty years ago , lapid would have have opposed a german address in the knesset .
since then , israel 's relations with germany have changed .
now , lapid said , it would be insulting to prevent the german president from speaking in his own language .
in an interview in germany 's frankfurt allgemeine zeitung newspaper , marcel reich-ranicki , one of the last survivors of the warsaw ghetto and a prominent literary critic in germany , criticized the discussion in israel .
köhler should address the knesset in german , he arged , calling the boycott threats " not only deplorable but shameful and , in the end , incomprehensible . "
associating the german language only with the nazi regime and saying its use in the knesset would defile holocaust survivors is " pure nonsense , " said reich-ranicki .
it neglects , for instance , the fact that german-speaking jews have played an enormous role in the development of modern thought , he told the paper .
german thinkers " we can no longer imagine physics without albert einstein , psychology without sigmund freud , sociology without karl marx , literature without franz kafka , and modern music without gustav mahler and arnold schönberg - all german speaking jews , " reich-ranicki said .
he also noted that the father of zionism , theodor herzle , published a decisive book on the creation of a jewish state , der judenstaat in german in 1896 , and that herzl had long debated whether german should be that country 's lingua franca .
it was only after the founding of the state of israel that hebrew became the official language because it was the common denominator among jews of different nationalities .
changing concerns the german culture will soon cease to be a touchy topic in israel , according to reich-ranicki .
the current generation has too much else on its mind , said the man known in germany as a " literature czar . "
" in israel , they wo n't discuss much longer whether wagner should be played in concert halls or german should be spoken in parliament , " he predicted .
" the new generation of israeli jews is n't worried at all about such subjects .
and that 's a good thing .

but european experts say it would be wrong to think that a tsunami could n't happen here , and say an eu-wide early warning system is needed . the legendary city of atlantis is said to have fallen victim to a massive wave in the mediterranean sea that swallowed an entire culture .
while atlantis is a myth , the earthquake zones beneath the mediterranean are reality , even if thousands of people live seemingly worry-free on the coasts of greece , italy and spain . scientists such as dieter kelletat , professor of geography at the university of essen-duisburg , have long warned of the danger on europe 's doorstep .
kelletat calls up the image of two ice fields that grind against each other until eventually , one sheet of ice slides over the other .
the top ice field pushes the other so far down that water begins to bubble up between the two . large danger zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's southern coastal regions are in the mediterranean danger zone it 's a similar situation along the line where the european and african plates meet .
each year , the african plate shifts around two centimeters to the north .
there are frequent earthquakes originating at the intersection of the two plates , with the danger zone stretching from morocco in the west , across italy and greece to turkey in the east .

there are frequent earthquakes originating at the intersection of the two plates , with the danger zone stretching from morocco in the west , across italy and greece to turkey in the east . " in the mediterranean region , tsunamis are a threat to all the coasts , and tsunamis have already happened across the region , " kelletat said .
" but there is no tsunami warning system , and there are still false impressions about the risk tsunamis pose to the region . " as the risks are not limited to a single country , the european parliament in strasbourg is now focusing its attention on the creation of a europe-wide early warning system . warning from outer space the parliamentarians are placing their hopes on the galileo satellite navigation system , which is able to register even the smallest of changes .
but a " traditional " early warning system would also help .
according to kelletat 's estimations , the eu would only need to invest € 20 million -lrb- $ 26 million -rrb- for an effective system .
spain , italy and greece are among the countries demanding decisive action . " the important thing is that we have a unified european policy that can coordinate everything , " said spanish eu parliamentarian -lrb- mep -rrb- javier pomes .
" the risk of such a catastrophe can not be borne by one country alone .
in this area , we have to cooperate . " the shock from seeing pictures of the tsunami catastrophe in indonesia , sri lanka and thailand galvanized the parliament in strasbourg such that the largest factions have already worked together to draw up a resolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mep hans-gert pöttering " we now have to pursue this resolution very seriously , " said german mep hans gert pöttering -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" i am asking that the commission now take the necessary steps to find solutions to improve the immediate situation , and i 'm happy to say that we have a large consensus on this question . " panicked reactions ? the consensus is not as wide as it could be , however .
some meps are warning of scare tactics .
others argue that an early warning system would be ineffective in the mediterranean , saying that in such a small sea , the warning times would also be too small - an argument rejected by meps from the most endangered countries . " look at the coasts of sicily , calabria , sardinia , " said italian mep vittorio prodi .
" for me , this early warning system is a must .
i think that even half an hour is enough time to save thousands of people . " prodi knows what he 's talking about .
in 1908 , a large tsunami destroyed large parts of the coastal region his family comes from .

hope for a better future is spurring voter registration across germany . with just two weeks to go before the historical poll , the first democratic election in half a century , security in iraq still remains a troubled issue .
violent militant attacks in iraq continue unabated with at least 16 people , including eight iraqi soldiers , killed in separate attacks around the country on monday . despite the violence , iraqi and us officials still insist that the january 30 poll will go ahead as planned . registration booths have opened all over the world , including in four german cities - cologne , berlin , mannheim and munich .
even iraqis living in poland , the czech republic , austria and switzerland can go to the german election stations .
the cologne stations are expecting registration from up to 18,000 iraqi voters , also from neighboring countries belgium and the netherlands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis register in berlin up to one million iraqis living outside the country are estimated to be eligible to vote ; around 56,000 in germany alone .
all iraqis above the age of 18 who can provide sufficient identification , are eligible to vote .
all voters must appear in person and can not vote by mail . the voter registration drive will end on jan .
23 and actual voting will take place between jan 28-30 .
the counting of votes too will be done in germany due to logistical reasons . hope for better future for many iraqis exiled from their homeland due to oppression under the former leadership , it ’ s a first chance to get their voices heard . " we 're going to be voting for the first time in our lives .
it 's a really important event , " said one iraqi couple from essen , in germany , who turned up at the makeshift voting booth in cologne on a former airfield .
" we 've been waiting for it forever .
hopefully this new government will bring iraq a good future . " they brushed aside speculation that the elections were a foregone conclusion and that allawi -lrb- iraqi prime minister -rrb- would emerge winner .
" naturally , a lot of strings are being pulled behind the scenes .
but i do n't think the americans will dare to meddle with the election outcome , " the man said .
" not when there are so many rival parties in the fray . " " credible and transparent " the international organization for migration , or iom , has been commissioned by the independent iraqi election council to set up around 150 registration offices in 14 countries . nicole baldwin , iom ’ s chief of external affairs who is presently in dubai overseeing overseas registration said that the organization was confident that expatriate iraqis would come out in droves to participate in the poll . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organization expects registration to pick up in the coming days with entire busloads making their way to the stations . baldwin added that her organization 's staff are experienced in managing overseas voting for post-conflict countries .
" we have lots of experience in dealing with polls and ensuring that things run smoothly , " she said .
" from an operational point of view , there is no risk of fraud because groups , including the media , are invited to watch every part of the process .
so voting will be credible and transparent . " security a priority but while all eyes will be trained on whether elections will be free and fair , there remains little doubt that ensuring they remain peaceful will be a greater challenge . with bloodshed occurring on a daily basis within the country , many fear that the threat of continued violence will keep people away from the polls in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi policeman in baghdad directs traffic in front of a wall covered with posters advertising the landmark elections .
both the iraqi interim government and the independent central election commission have announced strong security measures in the country . " security will be a priority .
iraqi police and the national guards will make sure the areas are safe , " said farid ayar of the central election commission . "
we hope that everything will be good on the 30th of this month . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security outside the polling station in cologne unprecedented security measures have also marked the voter registration drive in germany .
wary of bomb attacks and other attempts to disrupt the voting process , police and armed commandos have barricaded the areas where the polling stations are located .
iraqi nationals wanting to register have to go through metal detectors and exhaustive personal checks before they can enter the stations . an honor to vote ammar saeed , an election coordinator at the cologne polling station and an iraqi national himself said that most iraqis however , were undeterred by the cumbersome procedures . " many iraqis who i have seen and got to know are very proud to be finally able to vote after 35 years and to make their voice heard , " saeed said .

but now the eyes of the world are on kobe , japan , where 3000 experts and politicians from around the globe will meet through jan .
22 to discuss the reduction of natural disasters .
saving lives since the late-december tsunami in the indian ocean , experts have acknowledged that while we ca n't prevent natural catastrophes altogether , we can do much more to mitigate their damages .
the subject of disaster reduction , long ignored by many countries , has now been pushed to the fore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irmgard schwaetzer " i really hope that the public pressure will have an effect on the conference .
documents have been very vague up to now , since many governments generally dont want to make any committment , " said irmgard schwaetzer , chairwoman of the german committee on disaster reduction .
following the south asia tsunamis , the experts all agreed : an early warning system in the region would have saved countless lives .
concrete suggestions a demand for early warning systems for natural catastrophes is nothing new , it was already voiced ten years ago , at the first large united nations conference on disaster prevention .
in addition , the united nations had deemed the 1990s the decade of national catastrophe prevention .
some of the countries represented in kobe arrived with concrete prevention plans already in hand .
germany will actively campaign for a tsunami early warning system designed by german scientists .
the € 25 million -lrb- $ 32.5 million -rrb- project is based on sensors and satellites which would detect earthquakes and calculate flood waves .
japan wants to situate a center for post-catastrophe reconstruction in the city of kobe , itself flattened by an earthquake ten years ago , the governor of hyogo prefecture said .
among its responsibilities would be to coordinate international aid , send experts to disaster-affected regions and oversee reconstruction .
it would also serve as a center for global information campaigns .
not always expensive " for early warning systems , we dont necessarily need to reinvent the wheel , but connect already existing elements , " said schwaetzer .
for years , the pacific has had a functioning system , which could be expanded , she said .
" for example , there are gauging stations in germany that could be expanded , with very little additional work , and connected to an early warning system for the indian ocean .
the measures do n't have to be very expensive ; the coordination is the main factor , " she said .
not only developing nations need improvement .
the elbe river flooding in 2002 showed how industrial nations , like germany , could also benefit from better disaster-relief communications .
" it is clear that communication between the states , the individual aid organizations , and even by us -lrb- the disaster relief committee -rrb- , in a highly developed country , can fail .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sri lanka tsunami survivor the reason for this is the complexity of catastrophe-reduction planning .
" it is more than just making ambulances available .
its about making disaster plans , getting early warning systems running , and training people how to evaluate a warning or a risk .
teaching people to be aware of danger , " schwaezer said .
great expectations but conference goers are also wary of having overly high expectations .
experience shows that the more time has gone by following a catastrophe , the risk-awareness wanes .
there are numerous examples of how preparation can save lives .
for example , bangladesh has had a program against tornadoes since the early 1970s .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.01.2005 german not wanted in israel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's speech in israel will remind some of the nazi era some israeli politicians are protesting a planned speech in parliament by german president horst köhler , arguing that the address , which köhler will make in german , is an insult to holocaust survivors . " as long as there are still holocaust survivors among us , the german language should not be spoken in parliament , " israel 's minister of health dani naveh told the right-wing israeli daily newspaper maariv .
naveh said he plans to boycott the speech , which köhler will make toward the end of january , to mark the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between israel and germany .
his comment echoes the feelings of a number of members of the israeli parliament or knesset . other jewish public figures have spoken out in favor of köhler using his native german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous german president johannes rau visited israel in 2003 the current dispute harkens back to 2000 , when germany 's then-president johannes rau made the first address of a german president to the knesset .
his speech , also in german , caused a similar uproar .
reminders of the nazi era ?
responding to the current round of criticism , the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors to cancel the event or to ask köhler to hold his speech in english .
" my feet have never touched german soil , and i buy no german products , " said doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust .
" i can not allow that language to be spoken in the house of parliament of the jewish people , " he said .
member of the knesset -lrb- mk -rrb- gila finkelstein also said köhler should speak in english , not german .
' open wound ' " my whole body will tremor if i hear german in the knesset , " said finkelstein , whose extended family was murdered in the holocaust .

hope for a better future is spurring voter registration across germany . with just two weeks to go before the historical poll , the first democratic election in half a century , security in iraq still remains a troubled issue .
violent militant attacks in iraq continue unabated with at least 16 people , including eight iraqi soldiers , killed in separate attacks around the country on monday . despite the violence , iraqi and us officials still insist that the january 30 poll will go ahead as planned . registration booths have opened all over the world , including in four german cities - cologne , berlin , mannheim and munich .
even iraqis living in poland , the czech republic , austria and switzerland can go to the german election stations .
the cologne stations are expecting registration from up to 18,000 iraqi voters , also from neighboring countries belgium and the netherlands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis register in berlin up to one million iraqis living outside the country are estimated to be eligible to vote ; around 56,000 in germany alone .

all voters must appear in person and can not vote by mail . the voter registration drive will end on jan .
23 and actual voting will take place between jan 28-30 .
the counting of votes too will be done in germany due to logistical reasons . hope for better future for many iraqis exiled from their homeland due to oppression under the former leadership , it ’ s a first chance to get their voices heard . " we 're going to be voting for the first time in our lives .
it 's a really important event , " said one iraqi couple from essen , in germany , who turned up at the makeshift voting booth in cologne on a former airfield .
" we 've been waiting for it forever .
hopefully this new government will bring iraq a good future . " they brushed aside speculation that the elections were a foregone conclusion and that allawi -lrb- iraqi prime minister -rrb- would emerge winner .
" naturally , a lot of strings are being pulled behind the scenes .

" not when there are so many rival parties in the fray . " " credible and transparent " the international organization for migration , or iom , has been commissioned by the independent iraqi election council to set up around 150 registration offices in 14 countries . nicole baldwin , iom ’ s chief of external affairs who is presently in dubai overseeing overseas registration said that the organization was confident that expatriate iraqis would come out in droves to participate in the poll . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organization expects registration to pick up in the coming days with entire busloads making their way to the stations . baldwin added that her organization 's staff are experienced in managing overseas voting for post-conflict countries .
" we have lots of experience in dealing with polls and ensuring that things run smoothly , " she said .
" from an operational point of view , there is no risk of fraud because groups , including the media , are invited to watch every part of the process .
so voting will be credible and transparent . " security a priority but while all eyes will be trained on whether elections will be free and fair , there remains little doubt that ensuring they remain peaceful will be a greater challenge . with bloodshed occurring on a daily basis within the country , many fear that the threat of continued violence will keep people away from the polls in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi policeman in baghdad directs traffic in front of a wall covered with posters advertising the landmark elections .
both the iraqi interim government and the independent central election commission have announced strong security measures in the country . " security will be a priority .
iraqi police and the national guards will make sure the areas are safe , " said farid ayar of the central election commission . "
we hope that everything will be good on the 30th of this month . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security outside the polling station in cologne unprecedented security measures have also marked the voter registration drive in germany .
wary of bomb attacks and other attempts to disrupt the voting process , police and armed commandos have barricaded the areas where the polling stations are located .
iraqi nationals wanting to register have to go through metal detectors and exhaustive personal checks before they can enter the stations . an honor to vote ammar saeed , an election coordinator at the cologne polling station and an iraqi national himself said that most iraqis however , were undeterred by the cumbersome procedures . " many iraqis who i have seen and got to know are very proud to be finally able to vote after 35 years and to make their voice heard , " saeed said .

hope for a better future is spurring voter registration across germany . with just two weeks to go before the historical poll , the first democratic election in half a century , security in iraq still remains a troubled issue .
violent militant attacks in iraq continue unabated with at least 16 people , including eight iraqi soldiers , killed in separate attacks around the country on monday . despite the violence , iraqi and us officials still insist that the january 30 poll will go ahead as planned . registration booths have opened all over the world , including in four german cities - cologne , berlin , mannheim and munich .
even iraqis living in poland , the czech republic , austria and switzerland can go to the german election stations .
the cologne stations are expecting registration from up to 18,000 iraqi voters , also from neighboring countries belgium and the netherlands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis register in berlin up to one million iraqis living outside the country are estimated to be eligible to vote ; around 56,000 in germany alone .

all voters must appear in person and can not vote by mail . the voter registration drive will end on jan .
23 and actual voting will take place between jan 28-30 .
the counting of votes too will be done in germany due to logistical reasons . hope for better future for many iraqis exiled from their homeland due to oppression under the former leadership , it ’ s a first chance to get their voices heard . " we 're going to be voting for the first time in our lives .
it 's a really important event , " said one iraqi couple from essen , in germany , who turned up at the makeshift voting booth in cologne on a former airfield .
" we 've been waiting for it forever .
hopefully this new government will bring iraq a good future . " they brushed aside speculation that the elections were a foregone conclusion and that allawi -lrb- iraqi prime minister -rrb- would emerge winner .
" naturally , a lot of strings are being pulled behind the scenes .
but i do n't think the americans will dare to meddle with the election outcome , " the man said .
" not when there are so many rival parties in the fray . " " credible and transparent " the international organization for migration , or iom , has been commissioned by the independent iraqi election council to set up around 150 registration offices in 14 countries . nicole baldwin , iom ’ s chief of external affairs who is presently in dubai overseeing overseas registration said that the organization was confident that expatriate iraqis would come out in droves to participate in the poll . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organization expects registration to pick up in the coming days with entire busloads making their way to the stations . baldwin added that her organization 's staff are experienced in managing overseas voting for post-conflict countries .
" we have lots of experience in dealing with polls and ensuring that things run smoothly , " she said .
" from an operational point of view , there is no risk of fraud because groups , including the media , are invited to watch every part of the process .
so voting will be credible and transparent . " security a priority but while all eyes will be trained on whether elections will be free and fair , there remains little doubt that ensuring they remain peaceful will be a greater challenge . with bloodshed occurring on a daily basis within the country , many fear that the threat of continued violence will keep people away from the polls in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iraqi policeman in baghdad directs traffic in front of a wall covered with posters advertising the landmark elections .
both the iraqi interim government and the independent central election commission have announced strong security measures in the country . " security will be a priority .
iraqi police and the national guards will make sure the areas are safe , " said farid ayar of the central election commission . "
we hope that everything will be good on the 30th of this month . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security outside the polling station in cologne unprecedented security measures have also marked the voter registration drive in germany .
wary of bomb attacks and other attempts to disrupt the voting process , police and armed commandos have barricaded the areas where the polling stations are located .
iraqi nationals wanting to register have to go through metal detectors and exhaustive personal checks before they can enter the stations . an honor to vote ammar saeed , an election coordinator at the cologne polling station and an iraqi national himself said that most iraqis however , were undeterred by the cumbersome procedures . " many iraqis who i have seen and got to know are very proud to be finally able to vote after 35 years and to make their voice heard , " saeed said .
" people have even come here from holland .
i think for them , it 's an honor .

" großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reform opponents can only dream of getting crowds like these today last year , an opposition movement gained momentum protesting the german government ’ s welfare and labor market reforms .
but now that reforms are a reality , protest groups are looking at ways to keep the opposition alive . the idea was to paralyze labor offices in at least 80 german cities on january 3 , the first day that the controversial hartz iv reforms went into effect .
the project to achieve that , named “ agency shutdown , ” called on reform opponents to turn out in the numbers they did last summer to “ occupy ” job centers and , in effect , shut them down . the call largely went unheeded . government officials estimated that only about 700 protesters gathered at branches of the federal labor office across the country , although protest leaders said around 15,000 took part in protests nationwide . still , it was a far cry from the tens of thousands - at one point 150,000 - who turned out in august and september at the “ monday demonstrations ” to show their opposition to chancellor schröder ’ s controversial plan to breathe new life into germany ’ s labor market . “ agency shutdown was not a big success , ” said peter wahl , a co-founder of attac , the anti-globalization group which played a large role in organizing last summer ’ s protests . according to him , its failure is a result of a feeling of resignation that has set in among many protesters .
they felt themselves to be part of a popular , democratic movement last year , but watched in frustration as the government stood its ground and in the end , only made a few cosmetic changes to a reform plan reviled by many .
in january , hartz iv officially went into effect . “ people are indeed very dissatisfied with these so-called reforms , ” he said .
“ but they have the feeling they can ’ t change anything . ” bildunterschrift : now , attac is considering what to do next regarding the unwelcome reforms .
the group is an international organization which addresses several issues , and for now , the reform issue in germany has taken a back seat .
at present attac does not have any plans to continue with a new series of monday demonstrations . wahl said the group was on “ stand-by , ” ready to get on board if a new protest wave is ignited by popular indignation over the effects of the labor and welfare changes .
but he 's not holding his breath . " at the moment , there is nothing worth mentioning going on , ” he said .
“ there are several groups who are trying to keep going with the monday demonstrations , but they aren ’ t very effective . ” shaky determination mag wompel , an editor at labournet germany , an internet site which links labor activists and helped organize the “ agency shutdown ” project , agrees that the protest movement has lost some of the steam it had last summer .
but while it did not have the hoped-for effect , she insists it was not in vain .
according to her , it resulted in new alliances by people in several cities who are still active in their opposition to schröder ’ s reform plans . “ as long as there are hartz laws , we will continue to stage actions and protests , ” she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests that are now taking place have none of the visibility of last year ’ s .

“ although sometimes that ’ s tempting . ” mondays , toned down there are some who are still hitting the streets on mondays , determined not to the let the excitement of last summer die .
they hold out hope that the protest fever will shoot up again . “ the protests , i believe , happen like waves and they aren ’ t over yet , “ martin keßler , a documentary film maker who filmed last summer ’ s protests , said in an interview with berlin ’ s taz newspaper .
“ something really started moving then . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but it appears to have hit a patch of inertia and eager protesters are harder to find on the streets these days .
at the beginning of the year , in large cities like frankfurt or leipzig , fewer than 100 people turned out to protest in each .

while atlantis is a myth , the earthquake zones beneath the mediterranean are reality , even if thousands of people live seemingly worry-free on the coasts of greece , italy and spain . scientists such as dieter kelletat , professor of geography at the university of essen-duisburg , have long warned of the danger on europe 's doorstep .

spain , italy and greece are among the countries demanding decisive action . " the important thing is that we have a unified european policy that can coordinate everything , " said spanish eu parliamentarian -lrb- mep -rrb- javier pomes .
" the risk of such a catastrophe can not be borne by one country alone .

but european experts say it would be wrong to think that a tsunami could n't happen here , and say an eu-wide early warning system is needed . the legendary city of atlantis is said to have fallen victim to a massive wave in the mediterranean sea that swallowed an entire culture .
while atlantis is a myth , the earthquake zones beneath the mediterranean are reality , even if thousands of people live seemingly worry-free on the coasts of greece , italy and spain . scientists such as dieter kelletat , professor of geography at the university of essen-duisburg , have long warned of the danger on europe 's doorstep .
kelletat calls up the image of two ice fields that grind against each other until eventually , one sheet of ice slides over the other .
the top ice field pushes the other so far down that water begins to bubble up between the two . large danger zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's southern coastal regions are in the mediterranean danger zone it 's a similar situation along the line where the european and african plates meet .
each year , the african plate shifts around two centimeters to the north .
there are frequent earthquakes originating at the intersection of the two plates , with the danger zone stretching from morocco in the west , across italy and greece to turkey in the east . " in the mediterranean region , tsunamis are a threat to all the coasts , and tsunamis have already happened across the region , " kelletat said .
" but there is no tsunami warning system , and there are still false impressions about the risk tsunamis pose to the region . " as the risks are not limited to a single country , the european parliament in strasbourg is now focusing its attention on the creation of a europe-wide early warning system . warning from outer space the parliamentarians are placing their hopes on the galileo satellite navigation system , which is able to register even the smallest of changes .
but a " traditional " early warning system would also help .
according to kelletat 's estimations , the eu would only need to invest € 20 million -lrb- $ 26 million -rrb- for an effective system .
spain , italy and greece are among the countries demanding decisive action . " the important thing is that we have a unified european policy that can coordinate everything , " said spanish eu parliamentarian -lrb- mep -rrb- javier pomes .
" the risk of such a catastrophe can not be borne by one country alone .
in this area , we have to cooperate . " the shock from seeing pictures of the tsunami catastrophe in indonesia , sri lanka and thailand galvanized the parliament in strasbourg such that the largest factions have already worked together to draw up a resolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mep hans-gert pöttering " we now have to pursue this resolution very seriously , " said german mep hans gert pöttering -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" i am asking that the commission now take the necessary steps to find solutions to improve the immediate situation , and i 'm happy to say that we have a large consensus on this question . " panicked reactions ? the consensus is not as wide as it could be , however .
some meps are warning of scare tactics .
others argue that an early warning system would be ineffective in the mediterranean , saying that in such a small sea , the warning times would also be too small - an argument rejected by meps from the most endangered countries . " look at the coasts of sicily , calabria , sardinia , " said italian mep vittorio prodi .
" for me , this early warning system is a must .
i think that even half an hour is enough time to save thousands of people . " prodi knows what he 's talking about .

but now the eyes of the world are on kobe , japan , where 3000 experts and politicians from around the globe will meet through jan .
22 to discuss the reduction of natural disasters .
saving lives since the late-december tsunami in the indian ocean , experts have acknowledged that while we ca n't prevent natural catastrophes altogether , we can do much more to mitigate their damages .
the subject of disaster reduction , long ignored by many countries , has now been pushed to the fore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irmgard schwaetzer " i really hope that the public pressure will have an effect on the conference .
documents have been very vague up to now , since many governments generally dont want to make any committment , " said irmgard schwaetzer , chairwoman of the german committee on disaster reduction .
following the south asia tsunamis , the experts all agreed : an early warning system in the region would have saved countless lives .
concrete suggestions a demand for early warning systems for natural catastrophes is nothing new , it was already voiced ten years ago , at the first large united nations conference on disaster prevention .
in addition , the united nations had deemed the 1990s the decade of national catastrophe prevention .
some of the countries represented in kobe arrived with concrete prevention plans already in hand .
germany will actively campaign for a tsunami early warning system designed by german scientists .
the € 25 million -lrb- $ 32.5 million -rrb- project is based on sensors and satellites which would detect earthquakes and calculate flood waves .
japan wants to situate a center for post-catastrophe reconstruction in the city of kobe , itself flattened by an earthquake ten years ago , the governor of hyogo prefecture said .
among its responsibilities would be to coordinate international aid , send experts to disaster-affected regions and oversee reconstruction .
it would also serve as a center for global information campaigns .
not always expensive " for early warning systems , we dont necessarily need to reinvent the wheel , but connect already existing elements , " said schwaetzer .
for years , the pacific has had a functioning system , which could be expanded , she said .
" for example , there are gauging stations in germany that could be expanded , with very little additional work , and connected to an early warning system for the indian ocean .
the measures do n't have to be very expensive ; the coordination is the main factor , " she said .
not only developing nations need improvement .
the elbe river flooding in 2002 showed how industrial nations , like germany , could also benefit from better disaster-relief communications .
" it is clear that communication between the states , the individual aid organizations , and even by us -lrb- the disaster relief committee -rrb- , in a highly developed country , can fail .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sri lanka tsunami survivor the reason for this is the complexity of catastrophe-reduction planning .
" it is more than just making ambulances available .
its about making disaster plans , getting early warning systems running , and training people how to evaluate a warning or a risk .
teaching people to be aware of danger , " schwaezer said .
great expectations but conference goers are also wary of having overly high expectations .
experience shows that the more time has gone by following a catastrophe , the risk-awareness wanes .
there are numerous examples of how preparation can save lives .
for example , bangladesh has had a program against tornadoes since the early 1970s .
vietnam has been planting robust mangrove trees along its coastline to stabilize the shoreline .

but now the eyes of the world are on kobe , japan , where 3000 experts and politicians from around the globe will meet through jan .
22 to discuss the reduction of natural disasters .
saving lives since the late-december tsunami in the indian ocean , experts have acknowledged that while we ca n't prevent natural catastrophes altogether , we can do much more to mitigate their damages .
the subject of disaster reduction , long ignored by many countries , has now been pushed to the fore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irmgard schwaetzer " i really hope that the public pressure will have an effect on the conference .
documents have been very vague up to now , since many governments generally dont want to make any committment , " said irmgard schwaetzer , chairwoman of the german committee on disaster reduction .
following the south asia tsunamis , the experts all agreed : an early warning system in the region would have saved countless lives .
concrete suggestions a demand for early warning systems for natural catastrophes is nothing new , it was already voiced ten years ago , at the first large united nations conference on disaster prevention .
in addition , the united nations had deemed the 1990s the decade of national catastrophe prevention .
some of the countries represented in kobe arrived with concrete prevention plans already in hand .
germany will actively campaign for a tsunami early warning system designed by german scientists .
the € 25 million -lrb- $ 32.5 million -rrb- project is based on sensors and satellites which would detect earthquakes and calculate flood waves .
japan wants to situate a center for post-catastrophe reconstruction in the city of kobe , itself flattened by an earthquake ten years ago , the governor of hyogo prefecture said .
among its responsibilities would be to coordinate international aid , send experts to disaster-affected regions and oversee reconstruction .
it would also serve as a center for global information campaigns .
not always expensive " for early warning systems , we dont necessarily need to reinvent the wheel , but connect already existing elements , " said schwaetzer .
for years , the pacific has had a functioning system , which could be expanded , she said .
" for example , there are gauging stations in germany that could be expanded , with very little additional work , and connected to an early warning system for the indian ocean .
the measures do n't have to be very expensive ; the coordination is the main factor , " she said .
not only developing nations need improvement .
the elbe river flooding in 2002 showed how industrial nations , like germany , could also benefit from better disaster-relief communications .
" it is clear that communication between the states , the individual aid organizations , and even by us -lrb- the disaster relief committee -rrb- , in a highly developed country , can fail .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sri lanka tsunami survivor the reason for this is the complexity of catastrophe-reduction planning .
" it is more than just making ambulances available .
its about making disaster plans , getting early warning systems running , and training people how to evaluate a warning or a risk .
teaching people to be aware of danger , " schwaezer said .
great expectations but conference goers are also wary of having overly high expectations .
experience shows that the more time has gone by following a catastrophe , the risk-awareness wanes .
there are numerous examples of how preparation can save lives .

following the south asia tsunamis , the experts all agreed : an early warning system in the region would have saved countless lives .
concrete suggestions a demand for early warning systems for natural catastrophes is nothing new , it was already voiced ten years ago , at the first large united nations conference on disaster prevention .
in addition , the united nations had deemed the 1990s the decade of national catastrophe prevention .
some of the countries represented in kobe arrived with concrete prevention plans already in hand .
germany will actively campaign for a tsunami early warning system designed by german scientists .
the € 25 million -lrb- $ 32.5 million -rrb- project is based on sensors and satellites which would detect earthquakes and calculate flood waves .
japan wants to situate a center for post-catastrophe reconstruction in the city of kobe , itself flattened by an earthquake ten years ago , the governor of hyogo prefecture said .
among its responsibilities would be to coordinate international aid , send experts to disaster-affected regions and oversee reconstruction .
it would also serve as a center for global information campaigns .
not always expensive " for early warning systems , we dont necessarily need to reinvent the wheel , but connect already existing elements , " said schwaetzer .
for years , the pacific has had a functioning system , which could be expanded , she said .
" for example , there are gauging stations in germany that could be expanded , with very little additional work , and connected to an early warning system for the indian ocean .
the measures do n't have to be very expensive ; the coordination is the main factor , " she said .
not only developing nations need improvement .
the elbe river flooding in 2002 showed how industrial nations , like germany , could also benefit from better disaster-relief communications .
" it is clear that communication between the states , the individual aid organizations , and even by us -lrb- the disaster relief committee -rrb- , in a highly developed country , can fail .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sri lanka tsunami survivor the reason for this is the complexity of catastrophe-reduction planning .
" it is more than just making ambulances available .
its about making disaster plans , getting early warning systems running , and training people how to evaluate a warning or a risk .
teaching people to be aware of danger , " schwaezer said .
great expectations but conference goers are also wary of having overly high expectations .
experience shows that the more time has gone by following a catastrophe , the risk-awareness wanes .
there are numerous examples of how preparation can save lives .

the fiscal framework for the european single currency is in great need of reform . the european union 's finance ministers agreed tuesday to pursue a formal warning process against greece after revelations that the country 's budget deficit far exceeded an eu limit since 1997 .
greece has the highest deficit in percentage terms of all euro-zone countries .
it is well over the three percent limit set down in the stability and growth pact , the fiscal rules underpinning the euro .
greece is closer than any other country to having the european commission impose financial penalties as a result .
in brussels , finance ministers from all 25 european union member states continued talks launched late monday on how best to shake up the stability pact .
the difficulties certain countries have in sticking to it has prompted calls for its reform .
germany and france favor a loosening of the euro-zone rules for national budgets , whereas austria and the netherlands are opposed to greater flexibility .
german call for more leeway negotiations among euro-zone finance ministers have now entered a critical phase .
luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker wants to strike a deal on reforming the pact before an eu summit at the end of march .
it is meant to tackle long-term reforms for the eu 's weak economy .

his austrian counterpart karl heinz grasser responded that there was nothing wrong with the stability pact .
the problem was more that certain countries had difficulty in abiding by it .
making europe more growth-oriented german chancellor gerhard schröder earlier this week called for greater flexibility in the budget rules that set a strict limit on a country 's public deficit .
" the crux of the matter is to ensure that europe become more growth-orientated , " said schröder .

" it 's always hard to reach a compromise when government leaders interfere with the business of finance ministers , " zalm told reporters .
but schröder insisted that the deficit limit is inadequate to deal with the complex realities of fiscal policy .

the fiscal framework for the european single currency is in great need of reform . the european union 's finance ministers agreed tuesday to pursue a formal warning process against greece after revelations that the country 's budget deficit far exceeded an eu limit since 1997 .
greece has the highest deficit in percentage terms of all euro-zone countries .
it is well over the three percent limit set down in the stability and growth pact , the fiscal rules underpinning the euro .
greece is closer than any other country to having the european commission impose financial penalties as a result .
in brussels , finance ministers from all 25 european union member states continued talks launched late monday on how best to shake up the stability pact .
the difficulties certain countries have in sticking to it has prompted calls for its reform .
germany and france favor a loosening of the euro-zone rules for national budgets , whereas austria and the netherlands are opposed to greater flexibility .
german call for more leeway negotiations among euro-zone finance ministers have now entered a critical phase .
luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker wants to strike a deal on reforming the pact before an eu summit at the end of march .

" it 's always hard to reach a compromise when government leaders interfere with the business of finance ministers , " zalm told reporters .
but schröder insisted that the deficit limit is inadequate to deal with the complex realities of fiscal policy .
he said germany would not agree to a reform that did not limit the powers of the european commission to intervene .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.01.2005 german not wanted in israel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's speech in israel will remind some of the nazi era some israeli politicians are protesting a planned speech in parliament by german president horst köhler , arguing that the address , which köhler will make in german , is an insult to holocaust survivors . " as long as there are still holocaust survivors among us , the german language should not be spoken in parliament , " israel 's minister of health dani naveh told the right-wing israeli daily newspaper maariv .
naveh said he plans to boycott the speech , which köhler will make toward the end of january , to mark the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between israel and germany .
his comment echoes the feelings of a number of members of the israeli parliament or knesset . other jewish public figures have spoken out in favor of köhler using his native german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous german president johannes rau visited israel in 2003 the current dispute harkens back to 2000 , when germany 's then-president johannes rau made the first address of a german president to the knesset .
his speech , also in german , caused a similar uproar .
reminders of the nazi era ?
responding to the current round of criticism , the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors to cancel the event or to ask köhler to hold his speech in english .
" my feet have never touched german soil , and i buy no german products , " said doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust .
" i can not allow that language to be spoken in the house of parliament of the jewish people , " he said .
member of the knesset -lrb- mk -rrb- gila finkelstein also said köhler should speak in english , not german .
' open wound ' " my whole body will tremor if i hear german in the knesset , " said finkelstein , whose extended family was murdered in the holocaust .
" there is an open wound , " she said , in an interview with the jerusalem post on monday .
finkelstein called on köhler to " act with sensitivity " and not speak german .
knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who has rejected as the mks ' requests , was instrumental in the decision to allow köhler to deliver his speech in german in the first place .
" it is clear that a visiting president speaks in his language , " rivlin told the jerusalem post .
it would be " better not to extend an invitation than to demand that the guest speak in a different language , " he argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some members of the knesset at work at the same time , rivlin said he understands mks who argue that israel can not ignore what happened under the nazis . but he also said the protest should not be directed toward one person or his spoken language , but a historic occurrence that " we must remember and not forget . "
insulting request ?
opposition leader yosef lapid - himself a holocaust survivor - said the situation is different now than it was when germany and israel first resumed diplomatic relations .
forty years ago , lapid would have have opposed a german address in the knesset .
since then , israel 's relations with germany have changed .
now , lapid said , it would be insulting to prevent the german president from speaking in his own language .
in an interview in germany 's frankfurt allgemeine zeitung newspaper , marcel reich-ranicki , one of the last survivors of the warsaw ghetto and a prominent literary critic in germany , criticized the discussion in israel .
köhler should address the knesset in german , he arged , calling the boycott threats " not only deplorable but shameful and , in the end , incomprehensible . "
associating the german language only with the nazi regime and saying its use in the knesset would defile holocaust survivors is " pure nonsense , " said reich-ranicki .
it neglects , for instance , the fact that german-speaking jews have played an enormous role in the development of modern thought , he told the paper .
german thinkers " we can no longer imagine physics without albert einstein , psychology without sigmund freud , sociology without karl marx , literature without franz kafka , and modern music without gustav mahler and arnold schönberg - all german speaking jews , " reich-ranicki said .
he also noted that the father of zionism , theodor herzle , published a decisive book on the creation of a jewish state , der judenstaat in german in 1896 , and that herzl had long debated whether german should be that country 's lingua franca .
it was only after the founding of the state of israel that hebrew became the official language because it was the common denominator among jews of different nationalities .
changing concerns the german culture will soon cease to be a touchy topic in israel , according to reich-ranicki .
the current generation has too much else on its mind , said the man known in germany as a " literature czar . "
" in israel , they wo n't discuss much longer whether wagner should be played in concert halls or german should be spoken in parliament , " he predicted .
" the new generation of israeli jews is n't worried at all about such subjects .
and that 's a good thing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.01.2005 german not wanted in israel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler 's speech in israel will remind some of the nazi era some israeli politicians are protesting a planned speech in parliament by german president horst köhler , arguing that the address , which köhler will make in german , is an insult to holocaust survivors . " as long as there are still holocaust survivors among us , the german language should not be spoken in parliament , " israel 's minister of health dani naveh told the right-wing israeli daily newspaper maariv .
naveh said he plans to boycott the speech , which köhler will make toward the end of january , to mark the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between israel and germany .
his comment echoes the feelings of a number of members of the israeli parliament or knesset . other jewish public figures have spoken out in favor of köhler using his native german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous german president johannes rau visited israel in 2003 the current dispute harkens back to 2000 , when germany 's then-president johannes rau made the first address of a german president to the knesset .
his speech , also in german , caused a similar uproar .
reminders of the nazi era ?
responding to the current round of criticism , the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors to cancel the event or to ask köhler to hold his speech in english .
" my feet have never touched german soil , and i buy no german products , " said doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust .
" i can not allow that language to be spoken in the house of parliament of the jewish people , " he said .
member of the knesset -lrb- mk -rrb- gila finkelstein also said köhler should speak in english , not german .
' open wound ' " my whole body will tremor if i hear german in the knesset , " said finkelstein , whose extended family was murdered in the holocaust .
" there is an open wound , " she said , in an interview with the jerusalem post on monday .
finkelstein called on köhler to " act with sensitivity " and not speak german .
knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who has rejected as the mks ' requests , was instrumental in the decision to allow köhler to deliver his speech in german in the first place .
" it is clear that a visiting president speaks in his language , " rivlin told the jerusalem post .
it would be " better not to extend an invitation than to demand that the guest speak in a different language , " he argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some members of the knesset at work at the same time , rivlin said he understands mks who argue that israel can not ignore what happened under the nazis . but he also said the protest should not be directed toward one person or his spoken language , but a historic occurrence that " we must remember and not forget . "
insulting request ?
opposition leader yosef lapid - himself a holocaust survivor - said the situation is different now than it was when germany and israel first resumed diplomatic relations .
forty years ago , lapid would have have opposed a german address in the knesset .
since then , israel 's relations with germany have changed .
now , lapid said , it would be insulting to prevent the german president from speaking in his own language .
in an interview in germany 's frankfurt allgemeine zeitung newspaper , marcel reich-ranicki , one of the last survivors of the warsaw ghetto and a prominent literary critic in germany , criticized the discussion in israel .
köhler should address the knesset in german , he arged , calling the boycott threats " not only deplorable but shameful and , in the end , incomprehensible . "
associating the german language only with the nazi regime and saying its use in the knesset would defile holocaust survivors is " pure nonsense , " said reich-ranicki .
it neglects , for instance , the fact that german-speaking jews have played an enormous role in the development of modern thought , he told the paper .
german thinkers " we can no longer imagine physics without albert einstein , psychology without sigmund freud , sociology without karl marx , literature without franz kafka , and modern music without gustav mahler and arnold schönberg - all german speaking jews , " reich-ranicki said .
he also noted that the father of zionism , theodor herzle , published a decisive book on the creation of a jewish state , der judenstaat in german in 1896 , and that herzl had long debated whether german should be that country 's lingua franca .
it was only after the founding of the state of israel that hebrew became the official language because it was the common denominator among jews of different nationalities .
changing concerns the german culture will soon cease to be a touchy topic in israel , according to reich-ranicki .
the current generation has too much else on its mind , said the man known in germany as a " literature czar . "
" in israel , they wo n't discuss much longer whether wagner should be played in concert halls or german should be spoken in parliament , " he predicted .
" the new generation of israeli jews is n't worried at all about such subjects .

but now that reforms are a reality , protest groups are looking at ways to keep the opposition alive . the idea was to paralyze labor offices in at least 80 german cities on january 3 , the first day that the controversial hartz iv reforms went into effect .
the project to achieve that , named “ agency shutdown , ” called on reform opponents to turn out in the numbers they did last summer to “ occupy ” job centers and , in effect , shut them down . the call largely went unheeded . government officials estimated that only about 700 protesters gathered at branches of the federal labor office across the country , although protest leaders said around 15,000 took part in protests nationwide . still , it was a far cry from the tens of thousands - at one point 150,000 - who turned out in august and september at the “ monday demonstrations ” to show their opposition to chancellor schröder ’ s controversial plan to breathe new life into germany ’ s labor market . “ agency shutdown was not a big success , ” said peter wahl , a co-founder of attac , the anti-globalization group which played a large role in organizing last summer ’ s protests . according to him , its failure is a result of a feeling of resignation that has set in among many protesters .

the group is an international organization which addresses several issues , and for now , the reform issue in germany has taken a back seat .
at present attac does not have any plans to continue with a new series of monday demonstrations . wahl said the group was on “ stand-by , ” ready to get on board if a new protest wave is ignited by popular indignation over the effects of the labor and welfare changes .

but european experts say it would be wrong to think that a tsunami could n't happen here , and say an eu-wide early warning system is needed . the legendary city of atlantis is said to have fallen victim to a massive wave in the mediterranean sea that swallowed an entire culture .
while atlantis is a myth , the earthquake zones beneath the mediterranean are reality , even if thousands of people live seemingly worry-free on the coasts of greece , italy and spain . scientists such as dieter kelletat , professor of geography at the university of essen-duisburg , have long warned of the danger on europe 's doorstep .
kelletat calls up the image of two ice fields that grind against each other until eventually , one sheet of ice slides over the other .
the top ice field pushes the other so far down that water begins to bubble up between the two . large danger zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's southern coastal regions are in the mediterranean danger zone it 's a similar situation along the line where the european and african plates meet .
each year , the african plate shifts around two centimeters to the north .
there are frequent earthquakes originating at the intersection of the two plates , with the danger zone stretching from morocco in the west , across italy and greece to turkey in the east . " in the mediterranean region , tsunamis are a threat to all the coasts , and tsunamis have already happened across the region , " kelletat said .
" but there is no tsunami warning system , and there are still false impressions about the risk tsunamis pose to the region . " as the risks are not limited to a single country , the european parliament in strasbourg is now focusing its attention on the creation of a europe-wide early warning system . warning from outer space the parliamentarians are placing their hopes on the galileo satellite navigation system , which is able to register even the smallest of changes .
but a " traditional " early warning system would also help .
according to kelletat 's estimations , the eu would only need to invest € 20 million -lrb- $ 26 million -rrb- for an effective system .
spain , italy and greece are among the countries demanding decisive action . " the important thing is that we have a unified european policy that can coordinate everything , " said spanish eu parliamentarian -lrb- mep -rrb- javier pomes .
" the risk of such a catastrophe can not be borne by one country alone .
in this area , we have to cooperate . " the shock from seeing pictures of the tsunami catastrophe in indonesia , sri lanka and thailand galvanized the parliament in strasbourg such that the largest factions have already worked together to draw up a resolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mep hans-gert pöttering " we now have to pursue this resolution very seriously , " said german mep hans gert pöttering -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" i am asking that the commission now take the necessary steps to find solutions to improve the immediate situation , and i 'm happy to say that we have a large consensus on this question . " panicked reactions ? the consensus is not as wide as it could be , however .
some meps are warning of scare tactics .
others argue that an early warning system would be ineffective in the mediterranean , saying that in such a small sea , the warning times would also be too small - an argument rejected by meps from the most endangered countries . " look at the coasts of sicily , calabria , sardinia , " said italian mep vittorio prodi .
" for me , this early warning system is a must .
i think that even half an hour is enough time to save thousands of people . " prodi knows what he 's talking about .
in 1908 , a large tsunami destroyed large parts of the coastal region his family comes from .
he is fighting to give the people who live along italy 's southern coasts now a chance of survival . sebastian schubert -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leaders agree to tsunami warning system world leaders at an aid summit in the indonesian capital jakarta on thursday agreed to set up a tsunami early warning system .

" as long as there are still holocaust survivors among us , the german language should not be spoken in parliament , " israel 's minister of health dani naveh told the right-wing israeli daily newspaper maariv .
naveh said he plans to boycott the speech , which köhler will make toward the end of january , to mark the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between israel and germany .
his comment echoes the feelings of a number of members of the israeli parliament or knesset . other jewish public figures have spoken out in favor of köhler using his native german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous german president johannes rau visited israel in 2003 the current dispute harkens back to 2000 , when germany 's then-president johannes rau made the first address of a german president to the knesset .
his speech , also in german , caused a similar uproar .

responding to the current round of criticism , the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors to cancel the event or to ask köhler to hold his speech in english .
" my feet have never touched german soil , and i buy no german products , " said doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust .
" i can not allow that language to be spoken in the house of parliament of the jewish people , " he said .

finkelstein called on köhler to " act with sensitivity " and not speak german .
knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who has rejected as the mks ' requests , was instrumental in the decision to allow köhler to deliver his speech in german in the first place .
" it is clear that a visiting president speaks in his language , " rivlin told the jerusalem post .

"
insulting request ?
opposition leader yosef lapid - himself a holocaust survivor - said the situation is different now than it was when germany and israel first resumed diplomatic relations .
forty years ago , lapid would have have opposed a german address in the knesset .
since then , israel 's relations with germany have changed .
now , lapid said , it would be insulting to prevent the german president from speaking in his own language .
in an interview in germany 's frankfurt allgemeine zeitung newspaper , marcel reich-ranicki , one of the last survivors of the warsaw ghetto and a prominent literary critic in germany , criticized the discussion in israel .
köhler should address the knesset in german , he arged , calling the boycott threats " not only deplorable but shameful and , in the end , incomprehensible . "
associating the german language only with the nazi regime and saying its use in the knesset would defile holocaust survivors is " pure nonsense , " said reich-ranicki .
it neglects , for instance , the fact that german-speaking jews have played an enormous role in the development of modern thought , he told the paper .

no , it 's friedrich von schiller it 's a unique attempt to get german youth interested in a poet who has been dead for two centuries - and it just might work .
meet friedrich von schiller , comic-book hero . 200 years after the death of friedrich schiller , the keepers of the german poet 's flame have come up with a unique way to memorialize him : a comic book .
a brainchild of the german schiller society in marbach , germany , and the cologne-based publisher ehapa-verlag , the comic about schiller 's life will be published in may , on the 200th anniversary of his death .
exciting life the drawings are currently on view in an exhibit at the poet 's place of birth in marbach .
" we hope the -lrb- book 's -rrb- publication will be tied to new interest in schiller 's work and his life , " schiller society spokeswoman chritiane daetsch told dpa news service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller 's birthplace , in marbach the publishers are especially hoping the comic will awaken an interest in schiller among younger readers .
the story will " tell the exciting story of schiller 's life , " focusing on the period when he fled stuttgart to become a writer , daetsch said .
schiller was a 22 years old medic in 1782 when he left stuttgart , fleeing the duke carl eugen von württemberg , who had forbid him from writing .

" we hope the -lrb- book 's -rrb- publication will be tied to new interest in schiller 's work and his life , " schiller society spokeswoman chritiane daetsch told dpa news service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller 's birthplace , in marbach the publishers are especially hoping the comic will awaken an interest in schiller among younger readers .
the story will " tell the exciting story of schiller 's life , " focusing on the period when he fled stuttgart to become a writer , daetsch said .
schiller was a 22 years old medic in 1782 when he left stuttgart , fleeing the duke carl eugen von württemberg , who had forbid him from writing .
his flight represents " the expression of his decision to live for writing alone , " said the artist horus -lrb- horus w. odenthal -rrb- , who was selected to tell the story .
' pale and beaky ' the prizewinning comic artist read through schiller biographies before he began to work on the story , but found particular inspiration in the poet 's personal letters .
they increasingly told the story of a contradictory figure : on the one hand a writer with a sure feel for words and stories , on the other , an excessive , tumultuous outsider , repeatedly irritating those around him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * * archiv * * undatiertes bild des deutschen dichters friedrich von schiller .
er wurde 1759 in marbach am neckar geboren und starb 1805 in weimar .

zu ehren des grossen deutschen dichters wird es in seinem geburtsort marbach am neckar wie an seinen wirkungsstaetten in stuttgart , mannheim , jena und weimar eine fuelle von veranstaltungen geben .
-lrb- ap photo -rrb- horus said his biggest challenge was figuring out how to draw the protagonist .
the problem ?
finding out what schiller - who over the years had been depicted in widely varying ways - really looked like .
in order to find the real schiller , horus went straight to the source : the poet 's death mask .
-lrb- making a cast of the face of a famous person upon his death was once common practice . -rrb-
in the end , horus decided schiller " was like the ugly kid in the class : redhead , freckled , pale , with a long neck and a beaky nose , " he told dpa .
over the centuries , however , his image was revised and re-revised , until he became a dashingly handsome young blond .
the schiller society 's daetsch points out that what seems very unusual at first glance - combining a historic literary figure with a comic book - actually has a basis in the poet 's own history .
" schiller himself used illustration and humor , " she told dpa , pointing out that he drew illustrated stories with " comic figures " for his friend gottfried körner . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schiller 's skulls as the 200th anniversary of friedrich schiller 's death dawns , controversy over his remains stirs again .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.01.2005 government says immigrant wave receding in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the immigration boom of the 1990 's has begun to tail off in germany immigration into germany in the year 2003 , for the first time in many decades , dropped below 800,000 as the influx of foreigners throughout the 1990s has receded , according to government statistics released on monday . according to the latest statistics from the german government ’ s special commisssioner for foreigner 's affairs , it is specifically the number of asylum-seekers and the influx of russians with german ancestry which were markedly lower in 2003 . the commissioner also said that the numbers are expected to decline even further this year , as a new german immigration law will be laying greater emphasis on qualitative aspects of immigration into germany . marieluise beck , the government ’ s ombudswomen for foreigners ' affairs , says the years of the immigration boom of the 1990s are over . the ethnic war in the former yugoslavia and an influx of russians of german origin brought about 14 million foreigners to germany between 1991 and 2003 .

but now the eyes of the world are on kobe , japan , where 3000 experts and politicians from around the globe will meet through jan .
22 to discuss the reduction of natural disasters .
saving lives since the late-december tsunami in the indian ocean , experts have acknowledged that while we ca n't prevent natural catastrophes altogether , we can do much more to mitigate their damages .
the subject of disaster reduction , long ignored by many countries , has now been pushed to the fore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irmgard schwaetzer " i really hope that the public pressure will have an effect on the conference .
documents have been very vague up to now , since many governments generally dont want to make any committment , " said irmgard schwaetzer , chairwoman of the german committee on disaster reduction .
following the south asia tsunamis , the experts all agreed : an early warning system in the region would have saved countless lives .
concrete suggestions a demand for early warning systems for natural catastrophes is nothing new , it was already voiced ten years ago , at the first large united nations conference on disaster prevention .
in addition , the united nations had deemed the 1990s the decade of national catastrophe prevention .
some of the countries represented in kobe arrived with concrete prevention plans already in hand .
germany will actively campaign for a tsunami early warning system designed by german scientists .
the € 25 million -lrb- $ 32.5 million -rrb- project is based on sensors and satellites which would detect earthquakes and calculate flood waves .
japan wants to situate a center for post-catastrophe reconstruction in the city of kobe , itself flattened by an earthquake ten years ago , the governor of hyogo prefecture said .
among its responsibilities would be to coordinate international aid , send experts to disaster-affected regions and oversee reconstruction .
it would also serve as a center for global information campaigns .
not always expensive " for early warning systems , we dont necessarily need to reinvent the wheel , but connect already existing elements , " said schwaetzer .
for years , the pacific has had a functioning system , which could be expanded , she said .
" for example , there are gauging stations in germany that could be expanded , with very little additional work , and connected to an early warning system for the indian ocean .
the measures do n't have to be very expensive ; the coordination is the main factor , " she said .
not only developing nations need improvement .
the elbe river flooding in 2002 showed how industrial nations , like germany , could also benefit from better disaster-relief communications .
" it is clear that communication between the states , the individual aid organizations , and even by us -lrb- the disaster relief committee -rrb- , in a highly developed country , can fail .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sri lanka tsunami survivor the reason for this is the complexity of catastrophe-reduction planning .
" it is more than just making ambulances available .
its about making disaster plans , getting early warning systems running , and training people how to evaluate a warning or a risk .
teaching people to be aware of danger , " schwaezer said .
great expectations but conference goers are also wary of having overly high expectations .
experience shows that the more time has gone by following a catastrophe , the risk-awareness wanes .
there are numerous examples of how preparation can save lives .
for example , bangladesh has had a program against tornadoes since the early 1970s .
vietnam has been planting robust mangrove trees along its coastline to stabilize the shoreline .

but now the eyes of the world are on kobe , japan , where 3000 experts and politicians from around the globe will meet through jan .
22 to discuss the reduction of natural disasters .
saving lives since the late-december tsunami in the indian ocean , experts have acknowledged that while we ca n't prevent natural catastrophes altogether , we can do much more to mitigate their damages .
the subject of disaster reduction , long ignored by many countries , has now been pushed to the fore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irmgard schwaetzer " i really hope that the public pressure will have an effect on the conference .
documents have been very vague up to now , since many governments generally dont want to make any committment , " said irmgard schwaetzer , chairwoman of the german committee on disaster reduction .
following the south asia tsunamis , the experts all agreed : an early warning system in the region would have saved countless lives .
concrete suggestions a demand for early warning systems for natural catastrophes is nothing new , it was already voiced ten years ago , at the first large united nations conference on disaster prevention .
in addition , the united nations had deemed the 1990s the decade of national catastrophe prevention .
some of the countries represented in kobe arrived with concrete prevention plans already in hand .
germany will actively campaign for a tsunami early warning system designed by german scientists .
the € 25 million -lrb- $ 32.5 million -rrb- project is based on sensors and satellites which would detect earthquakes and calculate flood waves .
japan wants to situate a center for post-catastrophe reconstruction in the city of kobe , itself flattened by an earthquake ten years ago , the governor of hyogo prefecture said .
among its responsibilities would be to coordinate international aid , send experts to disaster-affected regions and oversee reconstruction .
it would also serve as a center for global information campaigns .
not always expensive " for early warning systems , we dont necessarily need to reinvent the wheel , but connect already existing elements , " said schwaetzer .
for years , the pacific has had a functioning system , which could be expanded , she said .
" for example , there are gauging stations in germany that could be expanded , with very little additional work , and connected to an early warning system for the indian ocean .
the measures do n't have to be very expensive ; the coordination is the main factor , " she said .
not only developing nations need improvement .
the elbe river flooding in 2002 showed how industrial nations , like germany , could also benefit from better disaster-relief communications .
" it is clear that communication between the states , the individual aid organizations , and even by us -lrb- the disaster relief committee -rrb- , in a highly developed country , can fail .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sri lanka tsunami survivor the reason for this is the complexity of catastrophe-reduction planning .
" it is more than just making ambulances available .
its about making disaster plans , getting early warning systems running , and training people how to evaluate a warning or a risk .
teaching people to be aware of danger , " schwaezer said .
great expectations but conference goers are also wary of having overly high expectations .
experience shows that the more time has gone by following a catastrophe , the risk-awareness wanes .

the fiscal framework for the european single currency is in great need of reform . the european union 's finance ministers agreed tuesday to pursue a formal warning process against greece after revelations that the country 's budget deficit far exceeded an eu limit since 1997 .
greece has the highest deficit in percentage terms of all euro-zone countries .
it is well over the three percent limit set down in the stability and growth pact , the fiscal rules underpinning the euro .
greece is closer than any other country to having the european commission impose financial penalties as a result .
in brussels , finance ministers from all 25 european union member states continued talks launched late monday on how best to shake up the stability pact .
the difficulties certain countries have in sticking to it has prompted calls for its reform .
germany and france favor a loosening of the euro-zone rules for national budgets , whereas austria and the netherlands are opposed to greater flexibility .
german call for more leeway negotiations among euro-zone finance ministers have now entered a critical phase .
luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker wants to strike a deal on reforming the pact before an eu summit at the end of march .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a euro sculpture in front of the european central bank in frankfurt , germany the german chancellor wants certain items to be excluded from the deficit calculations - a proposal which has drawn criticism from germany 's central bank , bundesbank .
it argued that this step would be tantamount to lifting the three percent ceiling and excessive deficits would become the rule , not the exception .
leaders should n't interfere dutch finance minister gerrit zalm criticized schröder for his remarks , saying they could make tuesday 's talks more difficult .
" it 's always hard to reach a compromise when government leaders interfere with the business of finance ministers , " zalm told reporters .
but schröder insisted that the deficit limit is inadequate to deal with the complex realities of fiscal policy .
he said germany would not agree to a reform that did not limit the powers of the european commission to intervene .

but now that reforms are a reality , protest groups are looking at ways to keep the opposition alive . the idea was to paralyze labor offices in at least 80 german cities on january 3 , the first day that the controversial hartz iv reforms went into effect .
the project to achieve that , named “ agency shutdown , ” called on reform opponents to turn out in the numbers they did last summer to “ occupy ” job centers and , in effect , shut them down . the call largely went unheeded . government officials estimated that only about 700 protesters gathered at branches of the federal labor office across the country , although protest leaders said around 15,000 took part in protests nationwide . still , it was a far cry from the tens of thousands - at one point 150,000 - who turned out in august and september at the “ monday demonstrations ” to show their opposition to chancellor schröder ’ s controversial plan to breathe new life into germany ’ s labor market . “ agency shutdown was not a big success , ” said peter wahl , a co-founder of attac , the anti-globalization group which played a large role in organizing last summer ’ s protests . according to him , its failure is a result of a feeling of resignation that has set in among many protesters .

the group is an international organization which addresses several issues , and for now , the reform issue in germany has taken a back seat .
at present attac does not have any plans to continue with a new series of monday demonstrations . wahl said the group was on “ stand-by , ” ready to get on board if a new protest wave is ignited by popular indignation over the effects of the labor and welfare changes .
but he 's not holding his breath . " at the moment , there is nothing worth mentioning going on , ” he said .
“ there are several groups who are trying to keep going with the monday demonstrations , but they aren ’ t very effective . ” shaky determination mag wompel , an editor at labournet germany , an internet site which links labor activists and helped organize the “ agency shutdown ” project , agrees that the protest movement has lost some of the steam it had last summer .
but while it did not have the hoped-for effect , she insists it was not in vain .
according to her , it resulted in new alliances by people in several cities who are still active in their opposition to schröder ’ s reform plans . “ as long as there are hartz laws , we will continue to stage actions and protests , ” she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests that are now taking place have none of the visibility of last year ’ s .

but european experts say it would be wrong to think that a tsunami could n't happen here , and say an eu-wide early warning system is needed . the legendary city of atlantis is said to have fallen victim to a massive wave in the mediterranean sea that swallowed an entire culture .
while atlantis is a myth , the earthquake zones beneath the mediterranean are reality , even if thousands of people live seemingly worry-free on the coasts of greece , italy and spain . scientists such as dieter kelletat , professor of geography at the university of essen-duisburg , have long warned of the danger on europe 's doorstep .
kelletat calls up the image of two ice fields that grind against each other until eventually , one sheet of ice slides over the other .
the top ice field pushes the other so far down that water begins to bubble up between the two . large danger zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's southern coastal regions are in the mediterranean danger zone it 's a similar situation along the line where the european and african plates meet .
each year , the african plate shifts around two centimeters to the north .
there are frequent earthquakes originating at the intersection of the two plates , with the danger zone stretching from morocco in the west , across italy and greece to turkey in the east . " in the mediterranean region , tsunamis are a threat to all the coasts , and tsunamis have already happened across the region , " kelletat said .
" but there is no tsunami warning system , and there are still false impressions about the risk tsunamis pose to the region . " as the risks are not limited to a single country , the european parliament in strasbourg is now focusing its attention on the creation of a europe-wide early warning system . warning from outer space the parliamentarians are placing their hopes on the galileo satellite navigation system , which is able to register even the smallest of changes .
but a " traditional " early warning system would also help .
according to kelletat 's estimations , the eu would only need to invest € 20 million -lrb- $ 26 million -rrb- for an effective system .
spain , italy and greece are among the countries demanding decisive action . " the important thing is that we have a unified european policy that can coordinate everything , " said spanish eu parliamentarian -lrb- mep -rrb- javier pomes .
" the risk of such a catastrophe can not be borne by one country alone .
in this area , we have to cooperate . " the shock from seeing pictures of the tsunami catastrophe in indonesia , sri lanka and thailand galvanized the parliament in strasbourg such that the largest factions have already worked together to draw up a resolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mep hans-gert pöttering " we now have to pursue this resolution very seriously , " said german mep hans gert pöttering -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" i am asking that the commission now take the necessary steps to find solutions to improve the immediate situation , and i 'm happy to say that we have a large consensus on this question . " panicked reactions ? the consensus is not as wide as it could be , however .
some meps are warning of scare tactics .
others argue that an early warning system would be ineffective in the mediterranean , saying that in such a small sea , the warning times would also be too small - an argument rejected by meps from the most endangered countries . " look at the coasts of sicily , calabria , sardinia , " said italian mep vittorio prodi .
" for me , this early warning system is a must .
i think that even half an hour is enough time to save thousands of people . " prodi knows what he 's talking about .

the song , like the reptile , struck before the likes of kylie minogue or robbie williams even knew what was happening . a children 's song by a little girl has raced to the top of the german singles charts in just a few weeks .
the song schnappi , das kleine krokodil or " snappy , the little crocodile " has relegated hits by linkin park , snoop dogg and kylie minogue to the lower echelons of the top 10 .
the song is basically about the teething efforts of a little crocodile with lots of sharp teeth .
seven-year-old joy gruttmann 's aunt iris recorded her singing the tune three years ago , when she was four .
iris gruttmann , who co-wrote the song , then posted it on the internet as a kind of family joke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone wants the schnappi cd but when a couple of major radio stations discovered the song , other pop stars did n't stand a chance .
the tinny-voiced " schnappi " is on rotation on radio stations nationwide and mtv .
even nightclubs are playing a disco remix version , with people crowding the dance floor , singing the refrain " schni schna schnappi . "
media hype " schnappi is a charming , sincere children 's song , " said gruttmann .
" maybe that explains its huge success . "
gruttmann has been writing children 's songs for the past 10 years .
she has composed numerous tunes for the german public television show sendung mit der maus .
she said her niece does n't mind the media hype surrounding the song 's success .
joy is the youngest recording artist in german history to make it into the german top 10 .
she has been doing the talk show circuit since the song took off .
" of course , it 's all very exciting for her , but joy is dealing with it very calmly , " gruttmann said .
joy had only told her three best friends that she would be frequently appearing on television .
schnappi on the phone but the gruttmann family is certainly snapping up all they can from the song 's popularity .
the little crocodile already has his own web site , where fans can buy schnappi baseball caps and t-shirts , as well as the official schnappi cd , video , dvd and video game .

" großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reform opponents can only dream of getting crowds like these today last year , an opposition movement gained momentum protesting the german government ’ s welfare and labor market reforms .
but now that reforms are a reality , protest groups are looking at ways to keep the opposition alive . the idea was to paralyze labor offices in at least 80 german cities on january 3 , the first day that the controversial hartz iv reforms went into effect .
the project to achieve that , named “ agency shutdown , ” called on reform opponents to turn out in the numbers they did last summer to “ occupy ” job centers and , in effect , shut them down . the call largely went unheeded . government officials estimated that only about 700 protesters gathered at branches of the federal labor office across the country , although protest leaders said around 15,000 took part in protests nationwide . still , it was a far cry from the tens of thousands - at one point 150,000 - who turned out in august and september at the “ monday demonstrations ” to show their opposition to chancellor schröder ’ s controversial plan to breathe new life into germany ’ s labor market . “ agency shutdown was not a big success , ” said peter wahl , a co-founder of attac , the anti-globalization group which played a large role in organizing last summer ’ s protests . according to him , its failure is a result of a feeling of resignation that has set in among many protesters .
they felt themselves to be part of a popular , democratic movement last year , but watched in frustration as the government stood its ground and in the end , only made a few cosmetic changes to a reform plan reviled by many .
in january , hartz iv officially went into effect . “ people are indeed very dissatisfied with these so-called reforms , ” he said .
“ but they have the feeling they can ’ t change anything . ” bildunterschrift : now , attac is considering what to do next regarding the unwelcome reforms .
the group is an international organization which addresses several issues , and for now , the reform issue in germany has taken a back seat .
at present attac does not have any plans to continue with a new series of monday demonstrations . wahl said the group was on “ stand-by , ” ready to get on board if a new protest wave is ignited by popular indignation over the effects of the labor and welfare changes .
but he 's not holding his breath . " at the moment , there is nothing worth mentioning going on , ” he said .
“ there are several groups who are trying to keep going with the monday demonstrations , but they aren ’ t very effective . ” shaky determination mag wompel , an editor at labournet germany , an internet site which links labor activists and helped organize the “ agency shutdown ” project , agrees that the protest movement has lost some of the steam it had last summer .
but while it did not have the hoped-for effect , she insists it was not in vain .
according to her , it resulted in new alliances by people in several cities who are still active in their opposition to schröder ’ s reform plans . “ as long as there are hartz laws , we will continue to stage actions and protests , ” she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests that are now taking place have none of the visibility of last year ’ s .
indeed , many of them are hardly public protests at all , but have taken the form of supporting those unemployed who are directly affected by the new welfare rules and helping them navigate the system . still , resignation is not an emotion wompel will admit to . “ not at all , otherwise i ’ d just stay in bed and give up on my work , ” she said .
“ although sometimes that ’ s tempting . ” mondays , toned down there are some who are still hitting the streets on mondays , determined not to the let the excitement of last summer die .
they hold out hope that the protest fever will shoot up again . “ the protests , i believe , happen like waves and they aren ’ t over yet , “ martin keßler , a documentary film maker who filmed last summer ’ s protests , said in an interview with berlin ’ s taz newspaper .
“ something really started moving then . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but it appears to have hit a patch of inertia and eager protesters are harder to find on the streets these days .
at the beginning of the year , in large cities like frankfurt or leipzig , fewer than 100 people turned out to protest in each .
while protests in berlin were a little larger - police estimated 400 on jan .
3 - those numbers are also dwindling . according to egbert balzer , a spokesperson for the berlin monday demonstration alliance , the protest movement is not dying , but merely considering its options . “ it ’ s winter and cold and the government won this first round , ” he said .
“ now we have to form new strategies and have to think seriously about what we 're going to do now . ” while he said the future was difficult to predict , he added that when the population realizes how the new reforms are increasing poverty in germany , they would go back out on the streets and demand change . his organization still puts out the call for people to meet up every monday at a central berlin location and keep the protest torch burning . people have n't given up , he insisted .
although this monday , he himself wo n't be there ; he does n't have the time . kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 2004 : the road to reform the year 2004 saw germany furthering structural reforms in both its health care system and labor market .

the project to achieve that , named “ agency shutdown , ” called on reform opponents to turn out in the numbers they did last summer to “ occupy ” job centers and , in effect , shut them down . the call largely went unheeded . government officials estimated that only about 700 protesters gathered at branches of the federal labor office across the country , although protest leaders said around 15,000 took part in protests nationwide . still , it was a far cry from the tens of thousands - at one point 150,000 - who turned out in august and september at the “ monday demonstrations ” to show their opposition to chancellor schröder ’ s controversial plan to breathe new life into germany ’ s labor market . “ agency shutdown was not a big success , ” said peter wahl , a co-founder of attac , the anti-globalization group which played a large role in organizing last summer ’ s protests . according to him , its failure is a result of a feeling of resignation that has set in among many protesters .

at present attac does not have any plans to continue with a new series of monday demonstrations . wahl said the group was on “ stand-by , ” ready to get on board if a new protest wave is ignited by popular indignation over the effects of the labor and welfare changes .

but now that reforms are a reality , protest groups are looking at ways to keep the opposition alive . the idea was to paralyze labor offices in at least 80 german cities on january 3 , the first day that the controversial hartz iv reforms went into effect .
the project to achieve that , named “ agency shutdown , ” called on reform opponents to turn out in the numbers they did last summer to “ occupy ” job centers and , in effect , shut them down . the call largely went unheeded . government officials estimated that only about 700 protesters gathered at branches of the federal labor office across the country , although protest leaders said around 15,000 took part in protests nationwide . still , it was a far cry from the tens of thousands - at one point 150,000 - who turned out in august and september at the “ monday demonstrations ” to show their opposition to chancellor schröder ’ s controversial plan to breathe new life into germany ’ s labor market . “ agency shutdown was not a big success , ” said peter wahl , a co-founder of attac , the anti-globalization group which played a large role in organizing last summer ’ s protests . according to him , its failure is a result of a feeling of resignation that has set in among many protesters .

while atlantis is a myth , the earthquake zones beneath the mediterranean are reality , even if thousands of people live seemingly worry-free on the coasts of greece , italy and spain . scientists such as dieter kelletat , professor of geography at the university of essen-duisburg , have long warned of the danger on europe 's doorstep .

spain , italy and greece are among the countries demanding decisive action . " the important thing is that we have a unified european policy that can coordinate everything , " said spanish eu parliamentarian -lrb- mep -rrb- javier pomes .
" the risk of such a catastrophe can not be borne by one country alone .

others argue that an early warning system would be ineffective in the mediterranean , saying that in such a small sea , the warning times would also be too small - an argument rejected by meps from the most endangered countries .

" you need to count another three years , " airbus chief noel forgeard told france 's la tribune newspaper when asked when the break-even point would come for the a380 project .
forgeard predicted that would happen when the 750th a480 is sold . so far , 14 airlines have placed orders for 149 of the new planes , which have a catalog price of between € 200 and € 218 million .
dubai-based airlines emirates will have the largest a380 fleet with 45 . a new giant in the sky ? since it was first introduced in the early 1970s , boeing 's 747 has monopolized the market for large jets .
but the a380 can seat more passengers - between 555 and 853 as opposed to the most recently updated boeing , the 747-400 , which seats between 416 and 568 . bildunterschrift : first class lounge with pull-out beds airbus has tried to attract orders by arguing that the a380 will cost 17 percent less to fly than boeing 's 747-400 , despite the fact that it weighs more .
the a380 is 15 meters -lrb- 16.4 yards -rrb- wider , 4 meters taller , 2 meters longer and 118 tons heavier than the boeing 747 jumbo .
seventy cars could be parked on its enormous wing-span .
airbus offers the plane equipped with cocktail bars , billiard rooms , showers and libraries . bildunterschrift : a library and sales space for duty-free items the double-decker will take its maiden voyage in march and be exhibited for the public to see at the paris air show in june .
singapore airlines is expected to put the first a380 to use in 2006 . airbus figures that , over the next two decades , more than 1,200 aircraft of the size of the a380 will be required for point-to-point routes in the world .
the planes will be able to land at airports equipped for 747s , though the wing-span is too large for the planes to dock in most places .
many of the world 's most heavily traveled airports , including frankfurt airport london 's heathrow and new york 's john f. kennedy international , have been preparing for the huge planes . airbus has around 50,000 employees , mainly in france , germany , spain and britain .

" you need to count another three years , " airbus chief noel forgeard told france 's la tribune newspaper when asked when the break-even point would come for the a380 project .
forgeard predicted that would happen when the 750th a480 is sold . so far , 14 airlines have placed orders for 149 of the new planes , which have a catalog price of between € 200 and € 218 million .
dubai-based airlines emirates will have the largest a380 fleet with 45 . a new giant in the sky ? since it was first introduced in the early 1970s , boeing 's 747 has monopolized the market for large jets .
but the a380 can seat more passengers - between 555 and 853 as opposed to the most recently updated boeing , the 747-400 , which seats between 416 and 568 . bildunterschrift : first class lounge with pull-out beds airbus has tried to attract orders by arguing that the a380 will cost 17 percent less to fly than boeing 's 747-400 , despite the fact that it weighs more .
the a380 is 15 meters -lrb- 16.4 yards -rrb- wider , 4 meters taller , 2 meters longer and 118 tons heavier than the boeing 747 jumbo .
seventy cars could be parked on its enormous wing-span .
airbus offers the plane equipped with cocktail bars , billiard rooms , showers and libraries . bildunterschrift : a library and sales space for duty-free items the double-decker will take its maiden voyage in march and be exhibited for the public to see at the paris air show in june .
singapore airlines is expected to put the first a380 to use in 2006 . airbus figures that , over the next two decades , more than 1,200 aircraft of the size of the a380 will be required for point-to-point routes in the world .
the planes will be able to land at airports equipped for 747s , though the wing-span is too large for the planes to dock in most places .
many of the world 's most heavily traveled airports , including frankfurt airport london 's heathrow and new york 's john f. kennedy international , have been preparing for the huge planes . airbus has around 50,000 employees , mainly in france , germany , spain and britain .

" as long as there are still holocaust survivors among us , the german language should not be spoken in parliament , " israel 's minister of health dani naveh told the right-wing israeli daily newspaper maariv .
naveh said he plans to boycott the speech , which köhler will make toward the end of january , to mark the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between israel and germany .
his comment echoes the feelings of a number of members of the israeli parliament or knesset . other jewish public figures have spoken out in favor of köhler using his native german .

responding to the current round of criticism , the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors to cancel the event or to ask köhler to hold his speech in english .
" my feet have never touched german soil , and i buy no german products , " said doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust .

knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who has rejected as the mks ' requests , was instrumental in the decision to allow köhler to deliver his speech in german in the first place .
" it is clear that a visiting president speaks in his language , " rivlin told the jerusalem post .

"

opposition leader yosef lapid - himself a holocaust survivor - said the situation is different now than it was when germany and israel first resumed diplomatic relations .
forty years ago , lapid would have have opposed a german address in the knesset .
since then , israel 's relations with germany have changed .
now , lapid said , it would be insulting to prevent the german president from speaking in his own language .
in an interview in germany 's frankfurt allgemeine zeitung newspaper , marcel reich-ranicki , one of the last survivors of the warsaw ghetto and a prominent literary critic in germany , criticized the discussion in israel .
köhler should address the knesset in german , he arged , calling the boycott threats " not only deplorable but shameful and , in the end , incomprehensible . "
associating the german language only with the nazi regime and saying its use in the knesset would defile holocaust survivors is " pure nonsense , " said reich-ranicki .
it neglects , for instance , the fact that german-speaking jews have played an enormous role in the development of modern thought , he told the paper .
german thinkers " we can no longer imagine physics without albert einstein , psychology without sigmund freud , sociology without karl marx , literature without franz kafka , and modern music without gustav mahler and arnold schönberg - all german speaking jews , " reich-ranicki said .
he also noted that the father of zionism , theodor herzle , published a decisive book on the creation of a jewish state , der judenstaat in german in 1896 , and that herzl had long debated whether german should be that country 's lingua franca .
it was only after the founding of the state of israel that hebrew became the official language because it was the common denominator among jews of different nationalities .
changing concerns the german culture will soon cease to be a touchy topic in israel , according to reich-ranicki .

his comment echoes the feelings of a number of members of the israeli parliament or knesset . other jewish public figures have spoken out in favor of köhler using his native german .

"
insulting request ?
opposition leader yosef lapid - himself a holocaust survivor - said the situation is different now than it was when germany and israel first resumed diplomatic relations .
forty years ago , lapid would have have opposed a german address in the knesset .
since then , israel 's relations with germany have changed .
now , lapid said , it would be insulting to prevent the german president from speaking in his own language .
in an interview in germany 's frankfurt allgemeine zeitung newspaper , marcel reich-ranicki , one of the last survivors of the warsaw ghetto and a prominent literary critic in germany , criticized the discussion in israel .
köhler should address the knesset in german , he arged , calling the boycott threats " not only deplorable but shameful and , in the end , incomprehensible . "
associating the german language only with the nazi regime and saying its use in the knesset would defile holocaust survivors is " pure nonsense , " said reich-ranicki .
it neglects , for instance , the fact that german-speaking jews have played an enormous role in the development of modern thought , he told the paper .
german thinkers " we can no longer imagine physics without albert einstein , psychology without sigmund freud , sociology without karl marx , literature without franz kafka , and modern music without gustav mahler and arnold schönberg - all german speaking jews , " reich-ranicki said .
he also noted that the father of zionism , theodor herzle , published a decisive book on the creation of a jewish state , der judenstaat in german in 1896 , and that herzl had long debated whether german should be that country 's lingua franca .
it was only after the founding of the state of israel that hebrew became the official language because it was the common denominator among jews of different nationalities .
changing concerns the german culture will soon cease to be a touchy topic in israel , according to reich-ranicki .
the current generation has too much else on its mind , said the man known in germany as a " literature czar . "
" in israel , they wo n't discuss much longer whether wagner should be played in concert halls or german should be spoken in parliament , " he predicted .

now , lapid said , it would be insulting to prevent the german president from speaking in his own language .
in an interview in germany 's frankfurt allgemeine zeitung newspaper , marcel reich-ranicki , one of the last survivors of the warsaw ghetto and a prominent literary critic in germany , criticized the discussion in israel .
köhler should address the knesset in german , he arged , calling the boycott threats " not only deplorable but shameful and , in the end , incomprehensible . "
associating the german language only with the nazi regime and saying its use in the knesset would defile holocaust survivors is " pure nonsense , " said reich-ranicki .
it neglects , for instance , the fact that german-speaking jews have played an enormous role in the development of modern thought , he told the paper .
german thinkers " we can no longer imagine physics without albert einstein , psychology without sigmund freud , sociology without karl marx , literature without franz kafka , and modern music without gustav mahler and arnold schönberg - all german speaking jews , " reich-ranicki said .
he also noted that the father of zionism , theodor herzle , published a decisive book on the creation of a jewish state , der judenstaat in german in 1896 , and that herzl had long debated whether german should be that country 's lingua franca .
it was only after the founding of the state of israel that hebrew became the official language because it was the common denominator among jews of different nationalities .
changing concerns the german culture will soon cease to be a touchy topic in israel , according to reich-ranicki .
the current generation has too much else on its mind , said the man known in germany as a " literature czar . "
" in israel , they wo n't discuss much longer whether wagner should be played in concert halls or german should be spoken in parliament , " he predicted .
" the new generation of israeli jews is n't worried at all about such subjects .
and that 's a good thing .

the fiscal framework for the european single currency is in great need of reform . the european union 's finance ministers agreed tuesday to pursue a formal warning process against greece after revelations that the country 's budget deficit far exceeded an eu limit since 1997 .
greece has the highest deficit in percentage terms of all euro-zone countries .
it is well over the three percent limit set down in the stability and growth pact , the fiscal rules underpinning the euro .
greece is closer than any other country to having the european commission impose financial penalties as a result .
in brussels , finance ministers from all 25 european union member states continued talks launched late monday on how best to shake up the stability pact .
the difficulties certain countries have in sticking to it has prompted calls for its reform .
germany and france favor a loosening of the euro-zone rules for national budgets , whereas austria and the netherlands are opposed to greater flexibility .
german call for more leeway negotiations among euro-zone finance ministers have now entered a critical phase .

his austrian counterpart karl heinz grasser responded that there was nothing wrong with the stability pact .
the problem was more that certain countries had difficulty in abiding by it .
making europe more growth-oriented german chancellor gerhard schröder earlier this week called for greater flexibility in the budget rules that set a strict limit on a country 's public deficit .

" it 's always hard to reach a compromise when government leaders interfere with the business of finance ministers , " zalm told reporters .

the fiscal framework for the european single currency is in great need of reform . the european union 's finance ministers agreed tuesday to pursue a formal warning process against greece after revelations that the country 's budget deficit far exceeded an eu limit since 1997 .
greece has the highest deficit in percentage terms of all euro-zone countries .
it is well over the three percent limit set down in the stability and growth pact , the fiscal rules underpinning the euro .
greece is closer than any other country to having the european commission impose financial penalties as a result .
in brussels , finance ministers from all 25 european union member states continued talks launched late monday on how best to shake up the stability pact .
the difficulties certain countries have in sticking to it has prompted calls for its reform .
germany and france favor a loosening of the euro-zone rules for national budgets , whereas austria and the netherlands are opposed to greater flexibility .
german call for more leeway negotiations among euro-zone finance ministers have now entered a critical phase .
luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker wants to strike a deal on reforming the pact before an eu summit at the end of march .
it is meant to tackle long-term reforms for the eu 's weak economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel wants the pact reconsidered before the late night meeting started monday , germany 's finance minister hans eichel -lrb- photo -rrb- defended his country 's proposals for more leeway for national governments in times of economic stagnation or social reform .
his austrian counterpart karl heinz grasser responded that there was nothing wrong with the stability pact .
the problem was more that certain countries had difficulty in abiding by it .
making europe more growth-oriented german chancellor gerhard schröder earlier this week called for greater flexibility in the budget rules that set a strict limit on a country 's public deficit .
" the crux of the matter is to ensure that europe become more growth-orientated , " said schröder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a euro sculpture in front of the european central bank in frankfurt , germany the german chancellor wants certain items to be excluded from the deficit calculations - a proposal which has drawn criticism from germany 's central bank , bundesbank .
it argued that this step would be tantamount to lifting the three percent ceiling and excessive deficits would become the rule , not the exception .
leaders should n't interfere dutch finance minister gerrit zalm criticized schröder for his remarks , saying they could make tuesday 's talks more difficult .
" it 's always hard to reach a compromise when government leaders interfere with the business of finance ministers , " zalm told reporters .
but schröder insisted that the deficit limit is inadequate to deal with the complex realities of fiscal policy .
he said germany would not agree to a reform that did not limit the powers of the european commission to intervene .

but now the eyes of the world are on kobe , japan , where 3000 experts and politicians from around the globe will meet through jan .
22 to discuss the reduction of natural disasters .
saving lives since the late-december tsunami in the indian ocean , experts have acknowledged that while we ca n't prevent natural catastrophes altogether , we can do much more to mitigate their damages .
the subject of disaster reduction , long ignored by many countries , has now been pushed to the fore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irmgard schwaetzer " i really hope that the public pressure will have an effect on the conference .
documents have been very vague up to now , since many governments generally dont want to make any committment , " said irmgard schwaetzer , chairwoman of the german committee on disaster reduction .
following the south asia tsunamis , the experts all agreed : an early warning system in the region would have saved countless lives .
concrete suggestions a demand for early warning systems for natural catastrophes is nothing new , it was already voiced ten years ago , at the first large united nations conference on disaster prevention .
in addition , the united nations had deemed the 1990s the decade of national catastrophe prevention .
some of the countries represented in kobe arrived with concrete prevention plans already in hand .
germany will actively campaign for a tsunami early warning system designed by german scientists .
the € 25 million -lrb- $ 32.5 million -rrb- project is based on sensors and satellites which would detect earthquakes and calculate flood waves .
japan wants to situate a center for post-catastrophe reconstruction in the city of kobe , itself flattened by an earthquake ten years ago , the governor of hyogo prefecture said .
among its responsibilities would be to coordinate international aid , send experts to disaster-affected regions and oversee reconstruction .
it would also serve as a center for global information campaigns .
not always expensive " for early warning systems , we dont necessarily need to reinvent the wheel , but connect already existing elements , " said schwaetzer .
for years , the pacific has had a functioning system , which could be expanded , she said .
" for example , there are gauging stations in germany that could be expanded , with very little additional work , and connected to an early warning system for the indian ocean .
the measures do n't have to be very expensive ; the coordination is the main factor , " she said .
not only developing nations need improvement .
the elbe river flooding in 2002 showed how industrial nations , like germany , could also benefit from better disaster-relief communications .
" it is clear that communication between the states , the individual aid organizations , and even by us -lrb- the disaster relief committee -rrb- , in a highly developed country , can fail .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sri lanka tsunami survivor the reason for this is the complexity of catastrophe-reduction planning .
" it is more than just making ambulances available .
its about making disaster plans , getting early warning systems running , and training people how to evaluate a warning or a risk .
teaching people to be aware of danger , " schwaezer said .
great expectations but conference goers are also wary of having overly high expectations .
experience shows that the more time has gone by following a catastrophe , the risk-awareness wanes .
there are numerous examples of how preparation can save lives .
for example , bangladesh has had a program against tornadoes since the early 1970s .

concrete suggestions a demand for early warning systems for natural catastrophes is nothing new , it was already voiced ten years ago , at the first large united nations conference on disaster prevention .
in addition , the united nations had deemed the 1990s the decade of national catastrophe prevention .
some of the countries represented in kobe arrived with concrete prevention plans already in hand .
germany will actively campaign for a tsunami early warning system designed by german scientists .
the € 25 million -lrb- $ 32.5 million -rrb- project is based on sensors and satellites which would detect earthquakes and calculate flood waves .
japan wants to situate a center for post-catastrophe reconstruction in the city of kobe , itself flattened by an earthquake ten years ago , the governor of hyogo prefecture said .
among its responsibilities would be to coordinate international aid , send experts to disaster-affected regions and oversee reconstruction .
it would also serve as a center for global information campaigns .
not always expensive " for early warning systems , we dont necessarily need to reinvent the wheel , but connect already existing elements , " said schwaetzer .
for years , the pacific has had a functioning system , which could be expanded , she said .
" for example , there are gauging stations in germany that could be expanded , with very little additional work , and connected to an early warning system for the indian ocean .
the measures do n't have to be very expensive ; the coordination is the main factor , " she said .
not only developing nations need improvement .
the elbe river flooding in 2002 showed how industrial nations , like germany , could also benefit from better disaster-relief communications .
" it is clear that communication between the states , the individual aid organizations , and even by us -lrb- the disaster relief committee -rrb- , in a highly developed country , can fail .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sri lanka tsunami survivor the reason for this is the complexity of catastrophe-reduction planning .
" it is more than just making ambulances available .
its about making disaster plans , getting early warning systems running , and training people how to evaluate a warning or a risk .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.01.2005 a democratic dream for germany 's iraqis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : signing up for democracy despite continuing violence in their home country , expatriate iraqis have begun signing up for their first democratic poll amid tight security .
hope for a better future is spurring voter registration across germany . with just two weeks to go before the historical poll , the first democratic election in half a century , security in iraq still remains a troubled issue .
violent militant attacks in iraq continue unabated with at least 16 people , including eight iraqi soldiers , killed in separate attacks around the country on monday . despite the violence , iraqi and us officials still insist that the january 30 poll will go ahead as planned . registration booths have opened all over the world , including in four german cities - cologne , berlin , mannheim and munich .
even iraqis living in poland , the czech republic , austria and switzerland can go to the german election stations .
the cologne stations are expecting registration from up to 18,000 iraqi voters , also from neighboring countries belgium and the netherlands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iraqis register in berlin up to one million iraqis living outside the country are estimated to be eligible to vote ; around 56,000 in germany alone .
all iraqis above the age of 18 who can provide sufficient identification , are eligible to vote .
all voters must appear in person and can not vote by mail . the voter registration drive will end on jan .
23 and actual voting will take place between jan 28-30 .
the counting of votes too will be done in germany due to logistical reasons . hope for better future for many iraqis exiled from their homeland due to oppression under the former leadership , it ’ s a first chance to get their voices heard . " we 're going to be voting for the first time in our lives .
it 's a really important event , " said one iraqi couple from essen , in germany , who turned up at the makeshift voting booth in cologne on a former airfield .
" we 've been waiting for it forever .
hopefully this new government will bring iraq a good future . " they brushed aside speculation that the elections were a foregone conclusion and that allawi -lrb- iraqi prime minister -rrb- would emerge winner .
" naturally , a lot of strings are being pulled behind the scenes .
but i do n't think the americans will dare to meddle with the election outcome , " the man said .
" not when there are so many rival parties in the fray . " " credible and transparent " the international organization for migration , or iom , has been commissioned by the independent iraqi election council to set up around 150 registration offices in 14 countries . nicole baldwin , iom ’ s chief of external affairs who is presently in dubai overseeing overseas registration said that the organization was confident that expatriate iraqis would come out in droves to participate in the poll . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the organization expects registration to pick up in the coming days with entire busloads making their way to the stations . baldwin added that her organization 's staff are experienced in managing overseas voting for post-conflict countries .
" we have lots of experience in dealing with polls and ensuring that things run smoothly , " she said .

hope for a better future is spurring voter registration across germany . with just two weeks to go before the historical poll , the first democratic election in half a century , security in iraq still remains a troubled issue .
violent militant attacks in iraq continue unabated with at least 16 people , including eight iraqi soldiers , killed in separate attacks around the country on monday . despite the violence , iraqi and us officials still insist that the january 30 poll will go ahead as planned . registration booths have opened all over the world , including in four german cities - cologne , berlin , mannheim and munich .

but only about 5 million have actually stayed here since then . in 2003 - the year for which the latest immigration statistics are available - the number of migrants to germany for the first time dropped below 800,000 .
a figure , beck says , which could continue to raise xenophobic fears among native germans , but which should be seen in the light of about 620,000 people who left germany for good in that year . " statistics are dry and complicated but unfortunately they are our only chance to tell people : be rational , take your time and look at who is coming and who is going .
we might have problems but they are not so overwhelming , " beck told dw-radio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overall figures have remained stable at just under nine percent of foreigners among the population in this country .
from the 768,000 migrants to germany in 2003 about two thirds came from europe , mostly from italy , poland , russia and turkey .
migrants from africa make up only a fraction of that with about 5 percent mainly asylum-seekers . beck says that immigration in 2003 was still largely unregulated causing problems of integration .
but she also adds that the influx of foreigners is necessary for german society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have groups of foreigners where the necessity to qualify them is very big and which creats costs , " said beck . " on the other hand , you have people which we badly need .
we are already feeling the effects of a society which is growing older and older and we already have a lack of personal to take care of those people .
historically seen one can always say migration always brought about cultural pushes in a positive way . " estimates for 2004 , according to beck , suggest that the decline in immigration to germany will continue and that there may be yet another 70,000 migrants fewer than in 2003 .
this month a new immigration law has come into effect in germany placing greater emphasis on qualified immigration . beck says it is too early to say how this will affect immigration statistics , but experts are already saying that the hurdles for skilled foreigners to come to germany are still be too high compared with the united states , britain or other industrialized countries . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks common immigration policy eu proposals to attract high-skilled immigrants , unveiled tuesday , were met with criticism at a time when anti-immigrant sentiment is rising in much of europe .

but only about 5 million have actually stayed here since then . in 2003 - the year for which the latest immigration statistics are available - the number of migrants to germany for the first time dropped below 800,000 .
a figure , beck says , which could continue to raise xenophobic fears among native germans , but which should be seen in the light of about 620,000 people who left germany for good in that year . " statistics are dry and complicated but unfortunately they are our only chance to tell people : be rational , take your time and look at who is coming and who is going .
we might have problems but they are not so overwhelming , " beck told dw-radio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overall figures have remained stable at just under nine percent of foreigners among the population in this country .
from the 768,000 migrants to germany in 2003 about two thirds came from europe , mostly from italy , poland , russia and turkey .
migrants from africa make up only a fraction of that with about 5 percent mainly asylum-seekers . beck says that immigration in 2003 was still largely unregulated causing problems of integration .
but she also adds that the influx of foreigners is necessary for german society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have groups of foreigners where the necessity to qualify them is very big and which creats costs , " said beck . " on the other hand , you have people which we badly need .
we are already feeling the effects of a society which is growing older and older and we already have a lack of personal to take care of those people .
historically seen one can always say migration always brought about cultural pushes in a positive way . " estimates for 2004 , according to beck , suggest that the decline in immigration to germany will continue and that there may be yet another 70,000 migrants fewer than in 2003 .
this month a new immigration law has come into effect in germany placing greater emphasis on qualified immigration . beck says it is too early to say how this will affect immigration statistics , but experts are already saying that the hurdles for skilled foreigners to come to germany are still be too high compared with the united states , britain or other industrialized countries . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks common immigration policy eu proposals to attract high-skilled immigrants , unveiled tuesday , were met with criticism at a time when anti-immigrant sentiment is rising in much of europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.01.2005 " schnappi " snaps up the number one spot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iris guttmann , her niece joy and , of course , the eponymous schnappi germans have gone crocodile-crazy after a children 's song about the reptile took the charts by storm .
the song , like the reptile , struck before the likes of kylie minogue or robbie williams even knew what was happening . a children 's song by a little girl has raced to the top of the german singles charts in just a few weeks .
the song schnappi , das kleine krokodil or " snappy , the little crocodile " has relegated hits by linkin park , snoop dogg and kylie minogue to the lower echelons of the top 10 .
the song is basically about the teething efforts of a little crocodile with lots of sharp teeth .
seven-year-old joy gruttmann 's aunt iris recorded her singing the tune three years ago , when she was four .
iris gruttmann , who co-wrote the song , then posted it on the internet as a kind of family joke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone wants the schnappi cd but when a couple of major radio stations discovered the song , other pop stars did n't stand a chance .
the tinny-voiced " schnappi " is on rotation on radio stations nationwide and mtv .
even nightclubs are playing a disco remix version , with people crowding the dance floor , singing the refrain " schni schna schnappi . "
media hype " schnappi is a charming , sincere children 's song , " said gruttmann .
" maybe that explains its huge success . "
gruttmann has been writing children 's songs for the past 10 years .
she has composed numerous tunes for the german public television show sendung mit der maus .
she said her niece does n't mind the media hype surrounding the song 's success .
joy is the youngest recording artist in german history to make it into the german top 10 .
she has been doing the talk show circuit since the song took off .
" of course , it 's all very exciting for her , but joy is dealing with it very calmly , " gruttmann said .
joy had only told her three best friends that she would be frequently appearing on television .
schnappi on the phone but the gruttmann family is certainly snapping up all they can from the song 's popularity .
the little crocodile already has his own web site , where fans can buy schnappi baseball caps and t-shirts , as well as the official schnappi cd , video , dvd and video game .
the hit single is even available as a mobile phone ring tone . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " click here for a selection of quirky stories on dw-world .

no , it 's friedrich von schiller it 's a unique attempt to get german youth interested in a poet who has been dead for two centuries - and it just might work .
meet friedrich von schiller , comic-book hero . 200 years after the death of friedrich schiller , the keepers of the german poet 's flame have come up with a unique way to memorialize him : a comic book .
a brainchild of the german schiller society in marbach , germany , and the cologne-based publisher ehapa-verlag , the comic about schiller 's life will be published in may , on the 200th anniversary of his death .
exciting life the drawings are currently on view in an exhibit at the poet 's place of birth in marbach .
" we hope the -lrb- book 's -rrb- publication will be tied to new interest in schiller 's work and his life , " schiller society spokeswoman chritiane daetsch told dpa news service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller 's birthplace , in marbach the publishers are especially hoping the comic will awaken an interest in schiller among younger readers .
the story will " tell the exciting story of schiller 's life , " focusing on the period when he fled stuttgart to become a writer , daetsch said .
schiller was a 22 years old medic in 1782 when he left stuttgart , fleeing the duke carl eugen von württemberg , who had forbid him from writing .
his flight represents " the expression of his decision to live for writing alone , " said the artist horus -lrb- horus w. odenthal -rrb- , who was selected to tell the story .
' pale and beaky ' the prizewinning comic artist read through schiller biographies before he began to work on the story , but found particular inspiration in the poet 's personal letters .
they increasingly told the story of a contradictory figure : on the one hand a writer with a sure feel for words and stories , on the other , an excessive , tumultuous outsider , repeatedly irritating those around him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * * archiv * * undatiertes bild des deutschen dichters friedrich von schiller .

-lrb- ap photo -rrb- horus said his biggest challenge was figuring out how to draw the protagonist .
the problem ?
finding out what schiller - who over the years had been depicted in widely varying ways - really looked like .
in order to find the real schiller , horus went straight to the source : the poet 's death mask .
-lrb- making a cast of the face of a famous person upon his death was once common practice . -rrb-
in the end , horus decided schiller " was like the ugly kid in the class : redhead , freckled , pale , with a long neck and a beaky nose , " he told dpa .
over the centuries , however , his image was revised and re-revised , until he became a dashingly handsome young blond .
the schiller society 's daetsch points out that what seems very unusual at first glance - combining a historic literary figure with a comic book - actually has a basis in the poet 's own history .
" schiller himself used illustration and humor , " she told dpa , pointing out that he drew illustrated stories with " comic figures " for his friend gottfried körner . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schiller 's skulls as the 200th anniversary of friedrich schiller 's death dawns , controversy over his remains stirs again .

no , it 's friedrich von schiller it 's a unique attempt to get german youth interested in a poet who has been dead for two centuries - and it just might work .
meet friedrich von schiller , comic-book hero . 200 years after the death of friedrich schiller , the keepers of the german poet 's flame have come up with a unique way to memorialize him : a comic book .
a brainchild of the german schiller society in marbach , germany , and the cologne-based publisher ehapa-verlag , the comic about schiller 's life will be published in may , on the 200th anniversary of his death .
exciting life the drawings are currently on view in an exhibit at the poet 's place of birth in marbach .
" we hope the -lrb- book 's -rrb- publication will be tied to new interest in schiller 's work and his life , " schiller society spokeswoman chritiane daetsch told dpa news service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller 's birthplace , in marbach the publishers are especially hoping the comic will awaken an interest in schiller among younger readers .
the story will " tell the exciting story of schiller 's life , " focusing on the period when he fled stuttgart to become a writer , daetsch said .
schiller was a 22 years old medic in 1782 when he left stuttgart , fleeing the duke carl eugen von württemberg , who had forbid him from writing .
his flight represents " the expression of his decision to live for writing alone , " said the artist horus -lrb- horus w. odenthal -rrb- , who was selected to tell the story .
' pale and beaky ' the prizewinning comic artist read through schiller biographies before he began to work on the story , but found particular inspiration in the poet 's personal letters .
they increasingly told the story of a contradictory figure : on the one hand a writer with a sure feel for words and stories , on the other , an excessive , tumultuous outsider , repeatedly irritating those around him .

no , it 's friedrich von schiller it 's a unique attempt to get german youth interested in a poet who has been dead for two centuries - and it just might work .
meet friedrich von schiller , comic-book hero . 200 years after the death of friedrich schiller , the keepers of the german poet 's flame have come up with a unique way to memorialize him : a comic book .
a brainchild of the german schiller society in marbach , germany , and the cologne-based publisher ehapa-verlag , the comic about schiller 's life will be published in may , on the 200th anniversary of his death .
exciting life the drawings are currently on view in an exhibit at the poet 's place of birth in marbach .
" we hope the -lrb- book 's -rrb- publication will be tied to new interest in schiller 's work and his life , " schiller society spokeswoman chritiane daetsch told dpa news service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller 's birthplace , in marbach the publishers are especially hoping the comic will awaken an interest in schiller among younger readers .
the story will " tell the exciting story of schiller 's life , " focusing on the period when he fled stuttgart to become a writer , daetsch said .
schiller was a 22 years old medic in 1782 when he left stuttgart , fleeing the duke carl eugen von württemberg , who had forbid him from writing .
his flight represents " the expression of his decision to live for writing alone , " said the artist horus -lrb- horus w. odenthal -rrb- , who was selected to tell the story .
' pale and beaky ' the prizewinning comic artist read through schiller biographies before he began to work on the story , but found particular inspiration in the poet 's personal letters .
they increasingly told the story of a contradictory figure : on the one hand a writer with a sure feel for words and stories , on the other , an excessive , tumultuous outsider , repeatedly irritating those around him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * * archiv * * undatiertes bild des deutschen dichters friedrich von schiller .
er wurde 1759 in marbach am neckar geboren und starb 1805 in weimar .

-lrb- ap photo -rrb- horus said his biggest challenge was figuring out how to draw the protagonist .
the problem ?
finding out what schiller - who over the years had been depicted in widely varying ways - really looked like .
in order to find the real schiller , horus went straight to the source : the poet 's death mask .
-lrb- making a cast of the face of a famous person upon his death was once common practice . -rrb-
in the end , horus decided schiller " was like the ugly kid in the class : redhead , freckled , pale , with a long neck and a beaky nose , " he told dpa .
over the centuries , however , his image was revised and re-revised , until he became a dashingly handsome young blond .
the schiller society 's daetsch points out that what seems very unusual at first glance - combining a historic literary figure with a comic book - actually has a basis in the poet 's own history .
" schiller himself used illustration and humor , " she told dpa , pointing out that he drew illustrated stories with " comic figures " for his friend gottfried körner . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schiller 's skulls as the 200th anniversary of friedrich schiller 's death dawns , controversy over his remains stirs again .

the song , like the reptile , struck before the likes of kylie minogue or robbie williams even knew what was happening . a children 's song by a little girl has raced to the top of the german singles charts in just a few weeks .
the song schnappi , das kleine krokodil or " snappy , the little crocodile " has relegated hits by linkin park , snoop dogg and kylie minogue to the lower echelons of the top 10 .
the song is basically about the teething efforts of a little crocodile with lots of sharp teeth .
seven-year-old joy gruttmann 's aunt iris recorded her singing the tune three years ago , when she was four .
iris gruttmann , who co-wrote the song , then posted it on the internet as a kind of family joke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone wants the schnappi cd but when a couple of major radio stations discovered the song , other pop stars did n't stand a chance .
the tinny-voiced " schnappi " is on rotation on radio stations nationwide and mtv .
even nightclubs are playing a disco remix version , with people crowding the dance floor , singing the refrain " schni schna schnappi . "
media hype " schnappi is a charming , sincere children 's song , " said gruttmann .
" maybe that explains its huge success . "
gruttmann has been writing children 's songs for the past 10 years .
she has composed numerous tunes for the german public television show sendung mit der maus .
she said her niece does n't mind the media hype surrounding the song 's success .
joy is the youngest recording artist in german history to make it into the german top 10 .
she has been doing the talk show circuit since the song took off .
" of course , it 's all very exciting for her , but joy is dealing with it very calmly , " gruttmann said .
joy had only told her three best friends that she would be frequently appearing on television .
schnappi on the phone but the gruttmann family is certainly snapping up all they can from the song 's popularity .
the little crocodile already has his own web site , where fans can buy schnappi baseball caps and t-shirts , as well as the official schnappi cd , video , dvd and video game .
the hit single is even available as a mobile phone ring tone . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " click here for a selection of quirky stories on dw-world .

but only about 5 million have actually stayed here since then . in 2003 - the year for which the latest immigration statistics are available - the number of migrants to germany for the first time dropped below 800,000 .
a figure , beck says , which could continue to raise xenophobic fears among native germans , but which should be seen in the light of about 620,000 people who left germany for good in that year .

from the 768,000 migrants to germany in 2003 about two thirds came from europe , mostly from italy , poland , russia and turkey .
migrants from africa make up only a fraction of that with about 5 percent mainly asylum-seekers . beck says that immigration in 2003 was still largely unregulated causing problems of integration .
but she also adds that the influx of foreigners is necessary for german society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have groups of foreigners where the necessity to qualify them is very big and which creats costs , " said beck . " on the other hand , you have people which we badly need .
we are already feeling the effects of a society which is growing older and older and we already have a lack of personal to take care of those people .
historically seen one can always say migration always brought about cultural pushes in a positive way . " estimates for 2004 , according to beck , suggest that the decline in immigration to germany will continue and that there may be yet another 70,000 migrants fewer than in 2003 .
this month a new immigration law has come into effect in germany placing greater emphasis on qualified immigration . beck says it is too early to say how this will affect immigration statistics , but experts are already saying that the hurdles for skilled foreigners to come to germany are still be too high compared with the united states , britain or other industrialized countries . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks common immigration policy eu proposals to attract high-skilled immigrants , unveiled tuesday , were met with criticism at a time when anti-immigrant sentiment is rising in much of europe .

but she also adds that the influx of foreigners is necessary for german society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have groups of foreigners where the necessity to qualify them is very big and which creats costs , " said beck . " on the other hand , you have people which we badly need .
we are already feeling the effects of a society which is growing older and older and we already have a lack of personal to take care of those people .
historically seen one can always say migration always brought about cultural pushes in a positive way . " estimates for 2004 , according to beck , suggest that the decline in immigration to germany will continue and that there may be yet another 70,000 migrants fewer than in 2003 .
this month a new immigration law has come into effect in germany placing greater emphasis on qualified immigration . beck says it is too early to say how this will affect immigration statistics , but experts are already saying that the hurdles for skilled foreigners to come to germany are still be too high compared with the united states , britain or other industrialized countries . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks common immigration policy eu proposals to attract high-skilled immigrants , unveiled tuesday , were met with criticism at a time when anti-immigrant sentiment is rising in much of europe .

no , it 's friedrich von schiller it 's a unique attempt to get german youth interested in a poet who has been dead for two centuries - and it just might work .
meet friedrich von schiller , comic-book hero . 200 years after the death of friedrich schiller , the keepers of the german poet 's flame have come up with a unique way to memorialize him : a comic book .
a brainchild of the german schiller society in marbach , germany , and the cologne-based publisher ehapa-verlag , the comic about schiller 's life will be published in may , on the 200th anniversary of his death .
exciting life the drawings are currently on view in an exhibit at the poet 's place of birth in marbach .
" we hope the -lrb- book 's -rrb- publication will be tied to new interest in schiller 's work and his life , " schiller society spokeswoman chritiane daetsch told dpa news service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller 's birthplace , in marbach the publishers are especially hoping the comic will awaken an interest in schiller among younger readers .
the story will " tell the exciting story of schiller 's life , " focusing on the period when he fled stuttgart to become a writer , daetsch said .
schiller was a 22 years old medic in 1782 when he left stuttgart , fleeing the duke carl eugen von württemberg , who had forbid him from writing .
his flight represents " the expression of his decision to live for writing alone , " said the artist horus -lrb- horus w. odenthal -rrb- , who was selected to tell the story .
' pale and beaky ' the prizewinning comic artist read through schiller biographies before he began to work on the story , but found particular inspiration in the poet 's personal letters .
they increasingly told the story of a contradictory figure : on the one hand a writer with a sure feel for words and stories , on the other , an excessive , tumultuous outsider , repeatedly irritating those around him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * * archiv * * undatiertes bild des deutschen dichters friedrich von schiller .
er wurde 1759 in marbach am neckar geboren und starb 1805 in weimar .

mal der todestag friedrich schillers .
zu ehren des grossen deutschen dichters wird es in seinem geburtsort marbach am neckar wie an seinen wirkungsstaetten in stuttgart , mannheim , jena und weimar eine fuelle von veranstaltungen geben .
-lrb- ap photo -rrb- horus said his biggest challenge was figuring out how to draw the protagonist .
the problem ?
finding out what schiller - who over the years had been depicted in widely varying ways - really looked like .
in order to find the real schiller , horus went straight to the source : the poet 's death mask .
-lrb- making a cast of the face of a famous person upon his death was once common practice . -rrb-
in the end , horus decided schiller " was like the ugly kid in the class : redhead , freckled , pale , with a long neck and a beaky nose , " he told dpa .
over the centuries , however , his image was revised and re-revised , until he became a dashingly handsome young blond .

no , it 's friedrich von schiller it 's a unique attempt to get german youth interested in a poet who has been dead for two centuries - and it just might work .
meet friedrich von schiller , comic-book hero . 200 years after the death of friedrich schiller , the keepers of the german poet 's flame have come up with a unique way to memorialize him : a comic book .
a brainchild of the german schiller society in marbach , germany , and the cologne-based publisher ehapa-verlag , the comic about schiller 's life will be published in may , on the 200th anniversary of his death .
exciting life the drawings are currently on view in an exhibit at the poet 's place of birth in marbach .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller 's birthplace , in marbach the publishers are especially hoping the comic will awaken an interest in schiller among younger readers .
the story will " tell the exciting story of schiller 's life , " focusing on the period when he fled stuttgart to become a writer , daetsch said .
schiller was a 22 years old medic in 1782 when he left stuttgart , fleeing the duke carl eugen von württemberg , who had forbid him from writing .
his flight represents " the expression of his decision to live for writing alone , " said the artist horus -lrb- horus w. odenthal -rrb- , who was selected to tell the story .
' pale and beaky ' the prizewinning comic artist read through schiller biographies before he began to work on the story , but found particular inspiration in the poet 's personal letters .
they increasingly told the story of a contradictory figure : on the one hand a writer with a sure feel for words and stories , on the other , an excessive , tumultuous outsider , repeatedly irritating those around him .

-lrb- ap photo -rrb- horus said his biggest challenge was figuring out how to draw the protagonist .
the problem ?
finding out what schiller - who over the years had been depicted in widely varying ways - really looked like .
in order to find the real schiller , horus went straight to the source : the poet 's death mask .
-lrb- making a cast of the face of a famous person upon his death was once common practice . -rrb-
in the end , horus decided schiller " was like the ugly kid in the class : redhead , freckled , pale , with a long neck and a beaky nose , " he told dpa .
over the centuries , however , his image was revised and re-revised , until he became a dashingly handsome young blond .
the schiller society 's daetsch points out that what seems very unusual at first glance - combining a historic literary figure with a comic book - actually has a basis in the poet 's own history .
" schiller himself used illustration and humor , " she told dpa , pointing out that he drew illustrated stories with " comic figures " for his friend gottfried körner . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schiller 's skulls as the 200th anniversary of friedrich schiller 's death dawns , controversy over his remains stirs again .

but european experts say it would be wrong to think that a tsunami could n't happen here , and say an eu-wide early warning system is needed . the legendary city of atlantis is said to have fallen victim to a massive wave in the mediterranean sea that swallowed an entire culture .
while atlantis is a myth , the earthquake zones beneath the mediterranean are reality , even if thousands of people live seemingly worry-free on the coasts of greece , italy and spain . scientists such as dieter kelletat , professor of geography at the university of essen-duisburg , have long warned of the danger on europe 's doorstep .
kelletat calls up the image of two ice fields that grind against each other until eventually , one sheet of ice slides over the other .
the top ice field pushes the other so far down that water begins to bubble up between the two . large danger zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy 's southern coastal regions are in the mediterranean danger zone it 's a similar situation along the line where the european and african plates meet .
each year , the african plate shifts around two centimeters to the north .
there are frequent earthquakes originating at the intersection of the two plates , with the danger zone stretching from morocco in the west , across italy and greece to turkey in the east . " in the mediterranean region , tsunamis are a threat to all the coasts , and tsunamis have already happened across the region , " kelletat said .
" but there is no tsunami warning system , and there are still false impressions about the risk tsunamis pose to the region . " as the risks are not limited to a single country , the european parliament in strasbourg is now focusing its attention on the creation of a europe-wide early warning system . warning from outer space the parliamentarians are placing their hopes on the galileo satellite navigation system , which is able to register even the smallest of changes .
but a " traditional " early warning system would also help .
according to kelletat 's estimations , the eu would only need to invest € 20 million -lrb- $ 26 million -rrb- for an effective system .
spain , italy and greece are among the countries demanding decisive action . " the important thing is that we have a unified european policy that can coordinate everything , " said spanish eu parliamentarian -lrb- mep -rrb- javier pomes .
" the risk of such a catastrophe can not be borne by one country alone .
in this area , we have to cooperate . " the shock from seeing pictures of the tsunami catastrophe in indonesia , sri lanka and thailand galvanized the parliament in strasbourg such that the largest factions have already worked together to draw up a resolution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german mep hans-gert pöttering " we now have to pursue this resolution very seriously , " said german mep hans gert pöttering -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" i am asking that the commission now take the necessary steps to find solutions to improve the immediate situation , and i 'm happy to say that we have a large consensus on this question . " panicked reactions ? the consensus is not as wide as it could be , however .
some meps are warning of scare tactics .
others argue that an early warning system would be ineffective in the mediterranean , saying that in such a small sea , the warning times would also be too small - an argument rejected by meps from the most endangered countries . " look at the coasts of sicily , calabria , sardinia , " said italian mep vittorio prodi .
" for me , this early warning system is a must .
i think that even half an hour is enough time to save thousands of people . " prodi knows what he 's talking about .

but now the eyes of the world are on kobe , japan , where 3000 experts and politicians from around the globe will meet through jan .
22 to discuss the reduction of natural disasters .
saving lives since the late-december tsunami in the indian ocean , experts have acknowledged that while we ca n't prevent natural catastrophes altogether , we can do much more to mitigate their damages .
the subject of disaster reduction , long ignored by many countries , has now been pushed to the fore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irmgard schwaetzer " i really hope that the public pressure will have an effect on the conference .
documents have been very vague up to now , since many governments generally dont want to make any committment , " said irmgard schwaetzer , chairwoman of the german committee on disaster reduction .
following the south asia tsunamis , the experts all agreed : an early warning system in the region would have saved countless lives .
concrete suggestions a demand for early warning systems for natural catastrophes is nothing new , it was already voiced ten years ago , at the first large united nations conference on disaster prevention .
in addition , the united nations had deemed the 1990s the decade of national catastrophe prevention .
some of the countries represented in kobe arrived with concrete prevention plans already in hand .
germany will actively campaign for a tsunami early warning system designed by german scientists .
the € 25 million -lrb- $ 32.5 million -rrb- project is based on sensors and satellites which would detect earthquakes and calculate flood waves .
japan wants to situate a center for post-catastrophe reconstruction in the city of kobe , itself flattened by an earthquake ten years ago , the governor of hyogo prefecture said .
among its responsibilities would be to coordinate international aid , send experts to disaster-affected regions and oversee reconstruction .
it would also serve as a center for global information campaigns .
not always expensive " for early warning systems , we dont necessarily need to reinvent the wheel , but connect already existing elements , " said schwaetzer .
for years , the pacific has had a functioning system , which could be expanded , she said .
" for example , there are gauging stations in germany that could be expanded , with very little additional work , and connected to an early warning system for the indian ocean .
the measures do n't have to be very expensive ; the coordination is the main factor , " she said .
not only developing nations need improvement .
the elbe river flooding in 2002 showed how industrial nations , like germany , could also benefit from better disaster-relief communications .
" it is clear that communication between the states , the individual aid organizations , and even by us -lrb- the disaster relief committee -rrb- , in a highly developed country , can fail .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sri lanka tsunami survivor the reason for this is the complexity of catastrophe-reduction planning .
" it is more than just making ambulances available .
its about making disaster plans , getting early warning systems running , and training people how to evaluate a warning or a risk .
teaching people to be aware of danger , " schwaezer said .
great expectations but conference goers are also wary of having overly high expectations .
experience shows that the more time has gone by following a catastrophe , the risk-awareness wanes .
there are numerous examples of how preparation can save lives .
for example , bangladesh has had a program against tornadoes since the early 1970s .
vietnam has been planting robust mangrove trees along its coastline to stabilize the shoreline .

this month a new immigration law has come into effect in germany placing greater emphasis on qualified immigration . beck says it is too early to say how this will affect immigration statistics , but experts are already saying that the hurdles for skilled foreigners to come to germany are still be too high compared with the united states , britain or other industrialized countries . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks common immigration policy eu proposals to attract high-skilled immigrants , unveiled tuesday , were met with criticism at a time when anti-immigrant sentiment is rising in much of europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's rocky road to reformation nothing ventured , nothing gained germany 2004 : the road to reform in coma and looking for work schröder accepts opposition offer of help germany -pipe- 18.01.2005 reform opponents ponder " what now ? " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reform opponents can only dream of getting crowds like these today last year , an opposition movement gained momentum protesting the german government ’ s welfare and labor market reforms .
but now that reforms are a reality , protest groups are looking at ways to keep the opposition alive . the idea was to paralyze labor offices in at least 80 german cities on january 3 , the first day that the controversial hartz iv reforms went into effect .
the project to achieve that , named “ agency shutdown , ” called on reform opponents to turn out in the numbers they did last summer to “ occupy ” job centers and , in effect , shut them down . the call largely went unheeded . government officials estimated that only about 700 protesters gathered at branches of the federal labor office across the country , although protest leaders said around 15,000 took part in protests nationwide . still , it was a far cry from the tens of thousands - at one point 150,000 - who turned out in august and september at the “ monday demonstrations ” to show their opposition to chancellor schröder ’ s controversial plan to breathe new life into germany ’ s labor market . “ agency shutdown was not a big success , ” said peter wahl , a co-founder of attac , the anti-globalization group which played a large role in organizing last summer ’ s protests . according to him , its failure is a result of a feeling of resignation that has set in among many protesters .
they felt themselves to be part of a popular , democratic movement last year , but watched in frustration as the government stood its ground and in the end , only made a few cosmetic changes to a reform plan reviled by many .
in january , hartz iv officially went into effect . “ people are indeed very dissatisfied with these so-called reforms , ” he said .
“ but they have the feeling they can ’ t change anything . ” bildunterschrift : now , attac is considering what to do next regarding the unwelcome reforms .
the group is an international organization which addresses several issues , and for now , the reform issue in germany has taken a back seat .
at present attac does not have any plans to continue with a new series of monday demonstrations . wahl said the group was on “ stand-by , ” ready to get on board if a new protest wave is ignited by popular indignation over the effects of the labor and welfare changes .
but he 's not holding his breath . " at the moment , there is nothing worth mentioning going on , ” he said .
“ there are several groups who are trying to keep going with the monday demonstrations , but they aren ’ t very effective . ” shaky determination mag wompel , an editor at labournet germany , an internet site which links labor activists and helped organize the “ agency shutdown ” project , agrees that the protest movement has lost some of the steam it had last summer .
but while it did not have the hoped-for effect , she insists it was not in vain .
according to her , it resulted in new alliances by people in several cities who are still active in their opposition to schröder ’ s reform plans . “ as long as there are hartz laws , we will continue to stage actions and protests , ” she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the protests that are now taking place have none of the visibility of last year ’ s .
indeed , many of them are hardly public protests at all , but have taken the form of supporting those unemployed who are directly affected by the new welfare rules and helping them navigate the system . still , resignation is not an emotion wompel will admit to . “ not at all , otherwise i ’ d just stay in bed and give up on my work , ” she said .
“ although sometimes that ’ s tempting . ” mondays , toned down there are some who are still hitting the streets on mondays , determined not to the let the excitement of last summer die .
they hold out hope that the protest fever will shoot up again . “ the protests , i believe , happen like waves and they aren ’ t over yet , “ martin keßler , a documentary film maker who filmed last summer ’ s protests , said in an interview with berlin ’ s taz newspaper .
“ something really started moving then . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but it appears to have hit a patch of inertia and eager protesters are harder to find on the streets these days .
at the beginning of the year , in large cities like frankfurt or leipzig , fewer than 100 people turned out to protest in each .
while protests in berlin were a little larger - police estimated 400 on jan .
3 - those numbers are also dwindling . according to egbert balzer , a spokesperson for the berlin monday demonstration alliance , the protest movement is not dying , but merely considering its options . “ it ’ s winter and cold and the government won this first round , ” he said .
“ now we have to form new strategies and have to think seriously about what we 're going to do now . ” while he said the future was difficult to predict , he added that when the population realizes how the new reforms are increasing poverty in germany , they would go back out on the streets and demand change . his organization still puts out the call for people to meet up every monday at a central berlin location and keep the protest torch burning . people have n't given up , he insisted .
although this monday , he himself wo n't be there ; he does n't have the time . kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 2004 : the road to reform the year 2004 saw germany furthering structural reforms in both its health care system and labor market .

but only about 5 million have actually stayed here since then . in 2003 - the year for which the latest immigration statistics are available - the number of migrants to germany for the first time dropped below 800,000 .
a figure , beck says , which could continue to raise xenophobic fears among native germans , but which should be seen in the light of about 620,000 people who left germany for good in that year . " statistics are dry and complicated but unfortunately they are our only chance to tell people : be rational , take your time and look at who is coming and who is going .
we might have problems but they are not so overwhelming , " beck told dw-radio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overall figures have remained stable at just under nine percent of foreigners among the population in this country .
from the 768,000 migrants to germany in 2003 about two thirds came from europe , mostly from italy , poland , russia and turkey .
migrants from africa make up only a fraction of that with about 5 percent mainly asylum-seekers . beck says that immigration in 2003 was still largely unregulated causing problems of integration .

but now the eyes of the world are on kobe , japan , where 3000 experts and politicians from around the globe will meet through jan .
22 to discuss the reduction of natural disasters .
saving lives since the late-december tsunami in the indian ocean , experts have acknowledged that while we ca n't prevent natural catastrophes altogether , we can do much more to mitigate their damages .
the subject of disaster reduction , long ignored by many countries , has now been pushed to the fore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irmgard schwaetzer " i really hope that the public pressure will have an effect on the conference .
documents have been very vague up to now , since many governments generally dont want to make any committment , " said irmgard schwaetzer , chairwoman of the german committee on disaster reduction .
following the south asia tsunamis , the experts all agreed : an early warning system in the region would have saved countless lives .
concrete suggestions a demand for early warning systems for natural catastrophes is nothing new , it was already voiced ten years ago , at the first large united nations conference on disaster prevention .
in addition , the united nations had deemed the 1990s the decade of national catastrophe prevention .
some of the countries represented in kobe arrived with concrete prevention plans already in hand .
germany will actively campaign for a tsunami early warning system designed by german scientists .
the € 25 million -lrb- $ 32.5 million -rrb- project is based on sensors and satellites which would detect earthquakes and calculate flood waves .
japan wants to situate a center for post-catastrophe reconstruction in the city of kobe , itself flattened by an earthquake ten years ago , the governor of hyogo prefecture said .
among its responsibilities would be to coordinate international aid , send experts to disaster-affected regions and oversee reconstruction .
it would also serve as a center for global information campaigns .
not always expensive " for early warning systems , we dont necessarily need to reinvent the wheel , but connect already existing elements , " said schwaetzer .
for years , the pacific has had a functioning system , which could be expanded , she said .
" for example , there are gauging stations in germany that could be expanded , with very little additional work , and connected to an early warning system for the indian ocean .
the measures do n't have to be very expensive ; the coordination is the main factor , " she said .
not only developing nations need improvement .
the elbe river flooding in 2002 showed how industrial nations , like germany , could also benefit from better disaster-relief communications .
" it is clear that communication between the states , the individual aid organizations , and even by us -lrb- the disaster relief committee -rrb- , in a highly developed country , can fail .

the song schnappi , das kleine krokodil or " snappy , the little crocodile " has relegated hits by linkin park , snoop dogg and kylie minogue to the lower echelons of the top 10 .

the fiscal framework for the european single currency is in great need of reform . the european union 's finance ministers agreed tuesday to pursue a formal warning process against greece after revelations that the country 's budget deficit far exceeded an eu limit since 1997 .
greece has the highest deficit in percentage terms of all euro-zone countries .
it is well over the three percent limit set down in the stability and growth pact , the fiscal rules underpinning the euro .
greece is closer than any other country to having the european commission impose financial penalties as a result .
in brussels , finance ministers from all 25 european union member states continued talks launched late monday on how best to shake up the stability pact .
the difficulties certain countries have in sticking to it has prompted calls for its reform .
germany and france favor a loosening of the euro-zone rules for national budgets , whereas austria and the netherlands are opposed to greater flexibility .
german call for more leeway negotiations among euro-zone finance ministers have now entered a critical phase .
luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker wants to strike a deal on reforming the pact before an eu summit at the end of march .
it is meant to tackle long-term reforms for the eu 's weak economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel wants the pact reconsidered before the late night meeting started monday , germany 's finance minister hans eichel -lrb- photo -rrb- defended his country 's proposals for more leeway for national governments in times of economic stagnation or social reform .
his austrian counterpart karl heinz grasser responded that there was nothing wrong with the stability pact .
the problem was more that certain countries had difficulty in abiding by it .
making europe more growth-oriented german chancellor gerhard schröder earlier this week called for greater flexibility in the budget rules that set a strict limit on a country 's public deficit .
" the crux of the matter is to ensure that europe become more growth-orientated , " said schröder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a euro sculpture in front of the european central bank in frankfurt , germany the german chancellor wants certain items to be excluded from the deficit calculations - a proposal which has drawn criticism from germany 's central bank , bundesbank .
it argued that this step would be tantamount to lifting the three percent ceiling and excessive deficits would become the rule , not the exception .
leaders should n't interfere dutch finance minister gerrit zalm criticized schröder for his remarks , saying they could make tuesday 's talks more difficult .
" it 's always hard to reach a compromise when government leaders interfere with the business of finance ministers , " zalm told reporters .
but schröder insisted that the deficit limit is inadequate to deal with the complex realities of fiscal policy .
he said germany would not agree to a reform that did not limit the powers of the european commission to intervene .

but now the eyes of the world are on kobe , japan , where 3000 experts and politicians from around the globe will meet through jan .
22 to discuss the reduction of natural disasters .
saving lives since the late-december tsunami in the indian ocean , experts have acknowledged that while we ca n't prevent natural catastrophes altogether , we can do much more to mitigate their damages .
the subject of disaster reduction , long ignored by many countries , has now been pushed to the fore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irmgard schwaetzer " i really hope that the public pressure will have an effect on the conference .
documents have been very vague up to now , since many governments generally dont want to make any committment , " said irmgard schwaetzer , chairwoman of the german committee on disaster reduction .
following the south asia tsunamis , the experts all agreed : an early warning system in the region would have saved countless lives .
concrete suggestions a demand for early warning systems for natural catastrophes is nothing new , it was already voiced ten years ago , at the first large united nations conference on disaster prevention .
in addition , the united nations had deemed the 1990s the decade of national catastrophe prevention .
some of the countries represented in kobe arrived with concrete prevention plans already in hand .
germany will actively campaign for a tsunami early warning system designed by german scientists .
the € 25 million -lrb- $ 32.5 million -rrb- project is based on sensors and satellites which would detect earthquakes and calculate flood waves .
japan wants to situate a center for post-catastrophe reconstruction in the city of kobe , itself flattened by an earthquake ten years ago , the governor of hyogo prefecture said .
among its responsibilities would be to coordinate international aid , send experts to disaster-affected regions and oversee reconstruction .
it would also serve as a center for global information campaigns .
not always expensive " for early warning systems , we dont necessarily need to reinvent the wheel , but connect already existing elements , " said schwaetzer .
for years , the pacific has had a functioning system , which could be expanded , she said .
" for example , there are gauging stations in germany that could be expanded , with very little additional work , and connected to an early warning system for the indian ocean .
the measures do n't have to be very expensive ; the coordination is the main factor , " she said .
not only developing nations need improvement .
the elbe river flooding in 2002 showed how industrial nations , like germany , could also benefit from better disaster-relief communications .
" it is clear that communication between the states , the individual aid organizations , and even by us -lrb- the disaster relief committee -rrb- , in a highly developed country , can fail .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sri lanka tsunami survivor the reason for this is the complexity of catastrophe-reduction planning .
" it is more than just making ambulances available .
its about making disaster plans , getting early warning systems running , and training people how to evaluate a warning or a risk .
teaching people to be aware of danger , " schwaezer said .
great expectations but conference goers are also wary of having overly high expectations .
experience shows that the more time has gone by following a catastrophe , the risk-awareness wanes .
there are numerous examples of how preparation can save lives .
for example , bangladesh has had a program against tornadoes since the early 1970s .
vietnam has been planting robust mangrove trees along its coastline to stabilize the shoreline .

the fiscal framework for the european single currency is in great need of reform . the european union 's finance ministers agreed tuesday to pursue a formal warning process against greece after revelations that the country 's budget deficit far exceeded an eu limit since 1997 .
greece has the highest deficit in percentage terms of all euro-zone countries .
it is well over the three percent limit set down in the stability and growth pact , the fiscal rules underpinning the euro .
greece is closer than any other country to having the european commission impose financial penalties as a result .

the song , like the reptile , struck before the likes of kylie minogue or robbie williams even knew what was happening . a children 's song by a little girl has raced to the top of the german singles charts in just a few weeks .
the song schnappi , das kleine krokodil or " snappy , the little crocodile " has relegated hits by linkin park , snoop dogg and kylie minogue to the lower echelons of the top 10 .
the song is basically about the teething efforts of a little crocodile with lots of sharp teeth .
seven-year-old joy gruttmann 's aunt iris recorded her singing the tune three years ago , when she was four .
iris gruttmann , who co-wrote the song , then posted it on the internet as a kind of family joke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone wants the schnappi cd but when a couple of major radio stations discovered the song , other pop stars did n't stand a chance .
the tinny-voiced " schnappi " is on rotation on radio stations nationwide and mtv .
even nightclubs are playing a disco remix version , with people crowding the dance floor , singing the refrain " schni schna schnappi . "
media hype " schnappi is a charming , sincere children 's song , " said gruttmann .
" maybe that explains its huge success . "
gruttmann has been writing children 's songs for the past 10 years .
she has composed numerous tunes for the german public television show sendung mit der maus .
she said her niece does n't mind the media hype surrounding the song 's success .
joy is the youngest recording artist in german history to make it into the german top 10 .
she has been doing the talk show circuit since the song took off .
" of course , it 's all very exciting for her , but joy is dealing with it very calmly , " gruttmann said .
joy had only told her three best friends that she would be frequently appearing on television .
schnappi on the phone but the gruttmann family is certainly snapping up all they can from the song 's popularity .
the little crocodile already has his own web site , where fans can buy schnappi baseball caps and t-shirts , as well as the official schnappi cd , video , dvd and video game .

" as long as there are still holocaust survivors among us , the german language should not be spoken in parliament , " israel 's minister of health dani naveh told the right-wing israeli daily newspaper maariv .
naveh said he plans to boycott the speech , which köhler will make toward the end of january , to mark the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between israel and germany .
his comment echoes the feelings of a number of members of the israeli parliament or knesset . other jewish public figures have spoken out in favor of köhler using his native german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous german president johannes rau visited israel in 2003 the current dispute harkens back to 2000 , when germany 's then-president johannes rau made the first address of a german president to the knesset .
his speech , also in german , caused a similar uproar .
reminders of the nazi era ?
responding to the current round of criticism , the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors to cancel the event or to ask köhler to hold his speech in english .
" my feet have never touched german soil , and i buy no german products , " said doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust .
" i can not allow that language to be spoken in the house of parliament of the jewish people , " he said .
member of the knesset -lrb- mk -rrb- gila finkelstein also said köhler should speak in english , not german .
' open wound ' " my whole body will tremor if i hear german in the knesset , " said finkelstein , whose extended family was murdered in the holocaust .
" there is an open wound , " she said , in an interview with the jerusalem post on monday .
finkelstein called on köhler to " act with sensitivity " and not speak german .
knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who has rejected as the mks ' requests , was instrumental in the decision to allow köhler to deliver his speech in german in the first place .
" it is clear that a visiting president speaks in his language , " rivlin told the jerusalem post .
it would be " better not to extend an invitation than to demand that the guest speak in a different language , " he argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some members of the knesset at work at the same time , rivlin said he understands mks who argue that israel can not ignore what happened under the nazis . but he also said the protest should not be directed toward one person or his spoken language , but a historic occurrence that " we must remember and not forget . "
insulting request ?
opposition leader yosef lapid - himself a holocaust survivor - said the situation is different now than it was when germany and israel first resumed diplomatic relations .
forty years ago , lapid would have have opposed a german address in the knesset .
since then , israel 's relations with germany have changed .
now , lapid said , it would be insulting to prevent the german president from speaking in his own language .
in an interview in germany 's frankfurt allgemeine zeitung newspaper , marcel reich-ranicki , one of the last survivors of the warsaw ghetto and a prominent literary critic in germany , criticized the discussion in israel .
köhler should address the knesset in german , he arged , calling the boycott threats " not only deplorable but shameful and , in the end , incomprehensible . "
associating the german language only with the nazi regime and saying its use in the knesset would defile holocaust survivors is " pure nonsense , " said reich-ranicki .
it neglects , for instance , the fact that german-speaking jews have played an enormous role in the development of modern thought , he told the paper .
german thinkers " we can no longer imagine physics without albert einstein , psychology without sigmund freud , sociology without karl marx , literature without franz kafka , and modern music without gustav mahler and arnold schönberg - all german speaking jews , " reich-ranicki said .
he also noted that the father of zionism , theodor herzle , published a decisive book on the creation of a jewish state , der judenstaat in german in 1896 , and that herzl had long debated whether german should be that country 's lingua franca .
it was only after the founding of the state of israel that hebrew became the official language because it was the common denominator among jews of different nationalities .
changing concerns the german culture will soon cease to be a touchy topic in israel , according to reich-ranicki .
the current generation has too much else on its mind , said the man known in germany as a " literature czar . "
" in israel , they wo n't discuss much longer whether wagner should be played in concert halls or german should be spoken in parliament , " he predicted .
" the new generation of israeli jews is n't worried at all about such subjects .
and that 's a good thing .

responding to the current round of criticism , the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors to cancel the event or to ask köhler to hold his speech in english .
" my feet have never touched german soil , and i buy no german products , " said doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust .
" i can not allow that language to be spoken in the house of parliament of the jewish people , " he said .
member of the knesset -lrb- mk -rrb- gila finkelstein also said köhler should speak in english , not german .
' open wound ' " my whole body will tremor if i hear german in the knesset , " said finkelstein , whose extended family was murdered in the holocaust .
" there is an open wound , " she said , in an interview with the jerusalem post on monday .
finkelstein called on köhler to " act with sensitivity " and not speak german .
knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who has rejected as the mks ' requests , was instrumental in the decision to allow köhler to deliver his speech in german in the first place .
" it is clear that a visiting president speaks in his language , " rivlin told the jerusalem post .
it would be " better not to extend an invitation than to demand that the guest speak in a different language , " he argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some members of the knesset at work at the same time , rivlin said he understands mks who argue that israel can not ignore what happened under the nazis . but he also said the protest should not be directed toward one person or his spoken language , but a historic occurrence that " we must remember and not forget . "
insulting request ?
opposition leader yosef lapid - himself a holocaust survivor - said the situation is different now than it was when germany and israel first resumed diplomatic relations .
forty years ago , lapid would have have opposed a german address in the knesset .
since then , israel 's relations with germany have changed .
now , lapid said , it would be insulting to prevent the german president from speaking in his own language .
in an interview in germany 's frankfurt allgemeine zeitung newspaper , marcel reich-ranicki , one of the last survivors of the warsaw ghetto and a prominent literary critic in germany , criticized the discussion in israel .
köhler should address the knesset in german , he arged , calling the boycott threats " not only deplorable but shameful and , in the end , incomprehensible . "
associating the german language only with the nazi regime and saying its use in the knesset would defile holocaust survivors is " pure nonsense , " said reich-ranicki .
it neglects , for instance , the fact that german-speaking jews have played an enormous role in the development of modern thought , he told the paper .
german thinkers " we can no longer imagine physics without albert einstein , psychology without sigmund freud , sociology without karl marx , literature without franz kafka , and modern music without gustav mahler and arnold schönberg - all german speaking jews , " reich-ranicki said .
he also noted that the father of zionism , theodor herzle , published a decisive book on the creation of a jewish state , der judenstaat in german in 1896 , and that herzl had long debated whether german should be that country 's lingua franca .
it was only after the founding of the state of israel that hebrew became the official language because it was the common denominator among jews of different nationalities .
changing concerns the german culture will soon cease to be a touchy topic in israel , according to reich-ranicki .
the current generation has too much else on its mind , said the man known in germany as a " literature czar . "
" in israel , they wo n't discuss much longer whether wagner should be played in concert halls or german should be spoken in parliament , " he predicted .
" the new generation of israeli jews is n't worried at all about such subjects .
and that 's a good thing .

no , it 's friedrich von schiller it 's a unique attempt to get german youth interested in a poet who has been dead for two centuries - and it just might work .
meet friedrich von schiller , comic-book hero . 200 years after the death of friedrich schiller , the keepers of the german poet 's flame have come up with a unique way to memorialize him : a comic book .
a brainchild of the german schiller society in marbach , germany , and the cologne-based publisher ehapa-verlag , the comic about schiller 's life will be published in may , on the 200th anniversary of his death .
exciting life the drawings are currently on view in an exhibit at the poet 's place of birth in marbach .
" we hope the -lrb- book 's -rrb- publication will be tied to new interest in schiller 's work and his life , " schiller society spokeswoman chritiane daetsch told dpa news service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller 's birthplace , in marbach the publishers are especially hoping the comic will awaken an interest in schiller among younger readers .
the story will " tell the exciting story of schiller 's life , " focusing on the period when he fled stuttgart to become a writer , daetsch said .
schiller was a 22 years old medic in 1782 when he left stuttgart , fleeing the duke carl eugen von württemberg , who had forbid him from writing .
his flight represents " the expression of his decision to live for writing alone , " said the artist horus -lrb- horus w. odenthal -rrb- , who was selected to tell the story .
' pale and beaky ' the prizewinning comic artist read through schiller biographies before he began to work on the story , but found particular inspiration in the poet 's personal letters .
they increasingly told the story of a contradictory figure : on the one hand a writer with a sure feel for words and stories , on the other , an excessive , tumultuous outsider , repeatedly irritating those around him .

no , it 's friedrich von schiller it 's a unique attempt to get german youth interested in a poet who has been dead for two centuries - and it just might work .
meet friedrich von schiller , comic-book hero . 200 years after the death of friedrich schiller , the keepers of the german poet 's flame have come up with a unique way to memorialize him : a comic book .
a brainchild of the german schiller society in marbach , germany , and the cologne-based publisher ehapa-verlag , the comic about schiller 's life will be published in may , on the 200th anniversary of his death .
exciting life the drawings are currently on view in an exhibit at the poet 's place of birth in marbach .
" we hope the -lrb- book 's -rrb- publication will be tied to new interest in schiller 's work and his life , " schiller society spokeswoman chritiane daetsch told dpa news service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller 's birthplace , in marbach the publishers are especially hoping the comic will awaken an interest in schiller among younger readers .
the story will " tell the exciting story of schiller 's life , " focusing on the period when he fled stuttgart to become a writer , daetsch said .
schiller was a 22 years old medic in 1782 when he left stuttgart , fleeing the duke carl eugen von württemberg , who had forbid him from writing .
his flight represents " the expression of his decision to live for writing alone , " said the artist horus -lrb- horus w. odenthal -rrb- , who was selected to tell the story .
' pale and beaky ' the prizewinning comic artist read through schiller biographies before he began to work on the story , but found particular inspiration in the poet 's personal letters .
they increasingly told the story of a contradictory figure : on the one hand a writer with a sure feel for words and stories , on the other , an excessive , tumultuous outsider , repeatedly irritating those around him .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.01.2005 government says immigrant wave receding in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the immigration boom of the 1990 's has begun to tail off in germany immigration into germany in the year 2003 , for the first time in many decades , dropped below 800,000 as the influx of foreigners throughout the 1990s has receded , according to government statistics released on monday . according to the latest statistics from the german government ’ s special commisssioner for foreigner 's affairs , it is specifically the number of asylum-seekers and the influx of russians with german ancestry which were markedly lower in 2003 . the commissioner also said that the numbers are expected to decline even further this year , as a new german immigration law will be laying greater emphasis on qualitative aspects of immigration into germany . marieluise beck , the government ’ s ombudswomen for foreigners ' affairs , says the years of the immigration boom of the 1990s are over . the ethnic war in the former yugoslavia and an influx of russians of german origin brought about 14 million foreigners to germany between 1991 and 2003 .
but only about 5 million have actually stayed here since then . in 2003 - the year for which the latest immigration statistics are available - the number of migrants to germany for the first time dropped below 800,000 .
a figure , beck says , which could continue to raise xenophobic fears among native germans , but which should be seen in the light of about 620,000 people who left germany for good in that year . " statistics are dry and complicated but unfortunately they are our only chance to tell people : be rational , take your time and look at who is coming and who is going .
we might have problems but they are not so overwhelming , " beck told dw-radio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overall figures have remained stable at just under nine percent of foreigners among the population in this country .
from the 768,000 migrants to germany in 2003 about two thirds came from europe , mostly from italy , poland , russia and turkey .
migrants from africa make up only a fraction of that with about 5 percent mainly asylum-seekers . beck says that immigration in 2003 was still largely unregulated causing problems of integration .
but she also adds that the influx of foreigners is necessary for german society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have groups of foreigners where the necessity to qualify them is very big and which creats costs , " said beck . " on the other hand , you have people which we badly need .
we are already feeling the effects of a society which is growing older and older and we already have a lack of personal to take care of those people .
historically seen one can always say migration always brought about cultural pushes in a positive way . " estimates for 2004 , according to beck , suggest that the decline in immigration to germany will continue and that there may be yet another 70,000 migrants fewer than in 2003 .
this month a new immigration law has come into effect in germany placing greater emphasis on qualified immigration . beck says it is too early to say how this will affect immigration statistics , but experts are already saying that the hurdles for skilled foreigners to come to germany are still be too high compared with the united states , britain or other industrialized countries . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks common immigration policy eu proposals to attract high-skilled immigrants , unveiled tuesday , were met with criticism at a time when anti-immigrant sentiment is rising in much of europe .

the song , like the reptile , struck before the likes of kylie minogue or robbie williams even knew what was happening . a children 's song by a little girl has raced to the top of the german singles charts in just a few weeks .
the song schnappi , das kleine krokodil or " snappy , the little crocodile " has relegated hits by linkin park , snoop dogg and kylie minogue to the lower echelons of the top 10 .
the song is basically about the teething efforts of a little crocodile with lots of sharp teeth .
seven-year-old joy gruttmann 's aunt iris recorded her singing the tune three years ago , when she was four .
iris gruttmann , who co-wrote the song , then posted it on the internet as a kind of family joke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone wants the schnappi cd but when a couple of major radio stations discovered the song , other pop stars did n't stand a chance .
the tinny-voiced " schnappi " is on rotation on radio stations nationwide and mtv .
even nightclubs are playing a disco remix version , with people crowding the dance floor , singing the refrain " schni schna schnappi . "
media hype " schnappi is a charming , sincere children 's song , " said gruttmann .
" maybe that explains its huge success . "
gruttmann has been writing children 's songs for the past 10 years .
she has composed numerous tunes for the german public television show sendung mit der maus .
she said her niece does n't mind the media hype surrounding the song 's success .
joy is the youngest recording artist in german history to make it into the german top 10 .
she has been doing the talk show circuit since the song took off .
" of course , it 's all very exciting for her , but joy is dealing with it very calmly , " gruttmann said .
joy had only told her three best friends that she would be frequently appearing on television .
schnappi on the phone but the gruttmann family is certainly snapping up all they can from the song 's popularity .
the little crocodile already has his own web site , where fans can buy schnappi baseball caps and t-shirts , as well as the official schnappi cd , video , dvd and video game .
the hit single is even available as a mobile phone ring tone . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " click here for a selection of quirky stories on dw-world .

no , it 's friedrich von schiller it 's a unique attempt to get german youth interested in a poet who has been dead for two centuries - and it just might work .
meet friedrich von schiller , comic-book hero . 200 years after the death of friedrich schiller , the keepers of the german poet 's flame have come up with a unique way to memorialize him : a comic book .
a brainchild of the german schiller society in marbach , germany , and the cologne-based publisher ehapa-verlag , the comic about schiller 's life will be published in may , on the 200th anniversary of his death .
exciting life the drawings are currently on view in an exhibit at the poet 's place of birth in marbach .
" we hope the -lrb- book 's -rrb- publication will be tied to new interest in schiller 's work and his life , " schiller society spokeswoman chritiane daetsch told dpa news service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller 's birthplace , in marbach the publishers are especially hoping the comic will awaken an interest in schiller among younger readers .
the story will " tell the exciting story of schiller 's life , " focusing on the period when he fled stuttgart to become a writer , daetsch said .
schiller was a 22 years old medic in 1782 when he left stuttgart , fleeing the duke carl eugen von württemberg , who had forbid him from writing .
his flight represents " the expression of his decision to live for writing alone , " said the artist horus -lrb- horus w. odenthal -rrb- , who was selected to tell the story .
' pale and beaky ' the prizewinning comic artist read through schiller biographies before he began to work on the story , but found particular inspiration in the poet 's personal letters .
they increasingly told the story of a contradictory figure : on the one hand a writer with a sure feel for words and stories , on the other , an excessive , tumultuous outsider , repeatedly irritating those around him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * * archiv * * undatiertes bild des deutschen dichters friedrich von schiller .
er wurde 1759 in marbach am neckar geboren und starb 1805 in weimar .

mal der todestag friedrich schillers .
zu ehren des grossen deutschen dichters wird es in seinem geburtsort marbach am neckar wie an seinen wirkungsstaetten in stuttgart , mannheim , jena und weimar eine fuelle von veranstaltungen geben .
-lrb- ap photo -rrb- horus said his biggest challenge was figuring out how to draw the protagonist .
the problem ?
finding out what schiller - who over the years had been depicted in widely varying ways - really looked like .
in order to find the real schiller , horus went straight to the source : the poet 's death mask .
-lrb- making a cast of the face of a famous person upon his death was once common practice . -rrb-
in the end , horus decided schiller " was like the ugly kid in the class : redhead , freckled , pale , with a long neck and a beaky nose , " he told dpa .
over the centuries , however , his image was revised and re-revised , until he became a dashingly handsome young blond .
the schiller society 's daetsch points out that what seems very unusual at first glance - combining a historic literary figure with a comic book - actually has a basis in the poet 's own history .
" schiller himself used illustration and humor , " she told dpa , pointing out that he drew illustrated stories with " comic figures " for his friend gottfried körner . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schiller 's skulls as the 200th anniversary of friedrich schiller 's death dawns , controversy over his remains stirs again .

but only about 5 million have actually stayed here since then . in 2003 - the year for which the latest immigration statistics are available - the number of migrants to germany for the first time dropped below 800,000 .

from the 768,000 migrants to germany in 2003 about two thirds came from europe , mostly from italy , poland , russia and turkey .
migrants from africa make up only a fraction of that with about 5 percent mainly asylum-seekers . beck says that immigration in 2003 was still largely unregulated causing problems of integration .

this month a new immigration law has come into effect in germany placing greater emphasis on qualified immigration . beck says it is too early to say how this will affect immigration statistics , but experts are already saying that the hurdles for skilled foreigners to come to germany are still be too high compared with the united states , britain or other industrialized countries . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks common immigration policy eu proposals to attract high-skilled immigrants , unveiled tuesday , were met with criticism at a time when anti-immigrant sentiment is rising in much of europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.01.2005 government says immigrant wave receding in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the immigration boom of the 1990 's has begun to tail off in germany immigration into germany in the year 2003 , for the first time in many decades , dropped below 800,000 as the influx of foreigners throughout the 1990s has receded , according to government statistics released on monday . according to the latest statistics from the german government ’ s special commisssioner for foreigner 's affairs , it is specifically the number of asylum-seekers and the influx of russians with german ancestry which were markedly lower in 2003 . the commissioner also said that the numbers are expected to decline even further this year , as a new german immigration law will be laying greater emphasis on qualitative aspects of immigration into germany . marieluise beck , the government ’ s ombudswomen for foreigners ' affairs , says the years of the immigration boom of the 1990s are over . the ethnic war in the former yugoslavia and an influx of russians of german origin brought about 14 million foreigners to germany between 1991 and 2003 .
but only about 5 million have actually stayed here since then . in 2003 - the year for which the latest immigration statistics are available - the number of migrants to germany for the first time dropped below 800,000 .
a figure , beck says , which could continue to raise xenophobic fears among native germans , but which should be seen in the light of about 620,000 people who left germany for good in that year . " statistics are dry and complicated but unfortunately they are our only chance to tell people : be rational , take your time and look at who is coming and who is going .
we might have problems but they are not so overwhelming , " beck told dw-radio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overall figures have remained stable at just under nine percent of foreigners among the population in this country .
from the 768,000 migrants to germany in 2003 about two thirds came from europe , mostly from italy , poland , russia and turkey .
migrants from africa make up only a fraction of that with about 5 percent mainly asylum-seekers . beck says that immigration in 2003 was still largely unregulated causing problems of integration .

no , it 's friedrich von schiller it 's a unique attempt to get german youth interested in a poet who has been dead for two centuries - and it just might work .
meet friedrich von schiller , comic-book hero . 200 years after the death of friedrich schiller , the keepers of the german poet 's flame have come up with a unique way to memorialize him : a comic book .
a brainchild of the german schiller society in marbach , germany , and the cologne-based publisher ehapa-verlag , the comic about schiller 's life will be published in may , on the 200th anniversary of his death .
exciting life the drawings are currently on view in an exhibit at the poet 's place of birth in marbach .
" we hope the -lrb- book 's -rrb- publication will be tied to new interest in schiller 's work and his life , " schiller society spokeswoman chritiane daetsch told dpa news service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller 's birthplace , in marbach the publishers are especially hoping the comic will awaken an interest in schiller among younger readers .
the story will " tell the exciting story of schiller 's life , " focusing on the period when he fled stuttgart to become a writer , daetsch said .
schiller was a 22 years old medic in 1782 when he left stuttgart , fleeing the duke carl eugen von württemberg , who had forbid him from writing .
his flight represents " the expression of his decision to live for writing alone , " said the artist horus -lrb- horus w. odenthal -rrb- , who was selected to tell the story .
' pale and beaky ' the prizewinning comic artist read through schiller biographies before he began to work on the story , but found particular inspiration in the poet 's personal letters .
they increasingly told the story of a contradictory figure : on the one hand a writer with a sure feel for words and stories , on the other , an excessive , tumultuous outsider , repeatedly irritating those around him .

the song , like the reptile , struck before the likes of kylie minogue or robbie williams even knew what was happening . a children 's song by a little girl has raced to the top of the german singles charts in just a few weeks .
the song schnappi , das kleine krokodil or " snappy , the little crocodile " has relegated hits by linkin park , snoop dogg and kylie minogue to the lower echelons of the top 10 .
the song is basically about the teething efforts of a little crocodile with lots of sharp teeth .
seven-year-old joy gruttmann 's aunt iris recorded her singing the tune three years ago , when she was four .
iris gruttmann , who co-wrote the song , then posted it on the internet as a kind of family joke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone wants the schnappi cd but when a couple of major radio stations discovered the song , other pop stars did n't stand a chance .
the tinny-voiced " schnappi " is on rotation on radio stations nationwide and mtv .
even nightclubs are playing a disco remix version , with people crowding the dance floor , singing the refrain " schni schna schnappi . "
media hype " schnappi is a charming , sincere children 's song , " said gruttmann .
" maybe that explains its huge success . "
gruttmann has been writing children 's songs for the past 10 years .
she has composed numerous tunes for the german public television show sendung mit der maus .
she said her niece does n't mind the media hype surrounding the song 's success .
joy is the youngest recording artist in german history to make it into the german top 10 .
she has been doing the talk show circuit since the song took off .
" of course , it 's all very exciting for her , but joy is dealing with it very calmly , " gruttmann said .
joy had only told her three best friends that she would be frequently appearing on television .
schnappi on the phone but the gruttmann family is certainly snapping up all they can from the song 's popularity .
the little crocodile already has his own web site , where fans can buy schnappi baseball caps and t-shirts , as well as the official schnappi cd , video , dvd and video game .
the hit single is even available as a mobile phone ring tone . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " click here for a selection of quirky stories on dw-world .

no , it 's friedrich von schiller it 's a unique attempt to get german youth interested in a poet who has been dead for two centuries - and it just might work .
meet friedrich von schiller , comic-book hero . 200 years after the death of friedrich schiller , the keepers of the german poet 's flame have come up with a unique way to memorialize him : a comic book .
a brainchild of the german schiller society in marbach , germany , and the cologne-based publisher ehapa-verlag , the comic about schiller 's life will be published in may , on the 200th anniversary of his death .
exciting life the drawings are currently on view in an exhibit at the poet 's place of birth in marbach .
" we hope the -lrb- book 's -rrb- publication will be tied to new interest in schiller 's work and his life , " schiller society spokeswoman chritiane daetsch told dpa news service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller 's birthplace , in marbach the publishers are especially hoping the comic will awaken an interest in schiller among younger readers .
the story will " tell the exciting story of schiller 's life , " focusing on the period when he fled stuttgart to become a writer , daetsch said .
schiller was a 22 years old medic in 1782 when he left stuttgart , fleeing the duke carl eugen von württemberg , who had forbid him from writing .
his flight represents " the expression of his decision to live for writing alone , " said the artist horus -lrb- horus w. odenthal -rrb- , who was selected to tell the story .
' pale and beaky ' the prizewinning comic artist read through schiller biographies before he began to work on the story , but found particular inspiration in the poet 's personal letters .
they increasingly told the story of a contradictory figure : on the one hand a writer with a sure feel for words and stories , on the other , an excessive , tumultuous outsider , repeatedly irritating those around him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * * archiv * * undatiertes bild des deutschen dichters friedrich von schiller .
er wurde 1759 in marbach am neckar geboren und starb 1805 in weimar .

zu ehren des grossen deutschen dichters wird es in seinem geburtsort marbach am neckar wie an seinen wirkungsstaetten in stuttgart , mannheim , jena und weimar eine fuelle von veranstaltungen geben .
-lrb- ap photo -rrb- horus said his biggest challenge was figuring out how to draw the protagonist .
the problem ?
finding out what schiller - who over the years had been depicted in widely varying ways - really looked like .
in order to find the real schiller , horus went straight to the source : the poet 's death mask .
-lrb- making a cast of the face of a famous person upon his death was once common practice . -rrb-
in the end , horus decided schiller " was like the ugly kid in the class : redhead , freckled , pale , with a long neck and a beaky nose , " he told dpa .
over the centuries , however , his image was revised and re-revised , until he became a dashingly handsome young blond .
the schiller society 's daetsch points out that what seems very unusual at first glance - combining a historic literary figure with a comic book - actually has a basis in the poet 's own history .
" schiller himself used illustration and humor , " she told dpa , pointing out that he drew illustrated stories with " comic figures " for his friend gottfried körner . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schiller 's skulls as the 200th anniversary of friedrich schiller 's death dawns , controversy over his remains stirs again .

the song , like the reptile , struck before the likes of kylie minogue or robbie williams even knew what was happening . a children 's song by a little girl has raced to the top of the german singles charts in just a few weeks .
the song schnappi , das kleine krokodil or " snappy , the little crocodile " has relegated hits by linkin park , snoop dogg and kylie minogue to the lower echelons of the top 10 .
the song is basically about the teething efforts of a little crocodile with lots of sharp teeth .
seven-year-old joy gruttmann 's aunt iris recorded her singing the tune three years ago , when she was four .
iris gruttmann , who co-wrote the song , then posted it on the internet as a kind of family joke .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone wants the schnappi cd but when a couple of major radio stations discovered the song , other pop stars did n't stand a chance .
the tinny-voiced " schnappi " is on rotation on radio stations nationwide and mtv .
even nightclubs are playing a disco remix version , with people crowding the dance floor , singing the refrain " schni schna schnappi . "
media hype " schnappi is a charming , sincere children 's song , " said gruttmann .
" maybe that explains its huge success . "
gruttmann has been writing children 's songs for the past 10 years .
she has composed numerous tunes for the german public television show sendung mit der maus .
she said her niece does n't mind the media hype surrounding the song 's success .
joy is the youngest recording artist in german history to make it into the german top 10 .
she has been doing the talk show circuit since the song took off .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.01.2005 government says immigrant wave receding in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the immigration boom of the 1990 's has begun to tail off in germany immigration into germany in the year 2003 , for the first time in many decades , dropped below 800,000 as the influx of foreigners throughout the 1990s has receded , according to government statistics released on monday . according to the latest statistics from the german government ’ s special commisssioner for foreigner 's affairs , it is specifically the number of asylum-seekers and the influx of russians with german ancestry which were markedly lower in 2003 . the commissioner also said that the numbers are expected to decline even further this year , as a new german immigration law will be laying greater emphasis on qualitative aspects of immigration into germany . marieluise beck , the government ’ s ombudswomen for foreigners ' affairs , says the years of the immigration boom of the 1990s are over . the ethnic war in the former yugoslavia and an influx of russians of german origin brought about 14 million foreigners to germany between 1991 and 2003 .
but only about 5 million have actually stayed here since then . in 2003 - the year for which the latest immigration statistics are available - the number of migrants to germany for the first time dropped below 800,000 .
a figure , beck says , which could continue to raise xenophobic fears among native germans , but which should be seen in the light of about 620,000 people who left germany for good in that year . " statistics are dry and complicated but unfortunately they are our only chance to tell people : be rational , take your time and look at who is coming and who is going .
we might have problems but they are not so overwhelming , " beck told dw-radio . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overall figures have remained stable at just under nine percent of foreigners among the population in this country .
from the 768,000 migrants to germany in 2003 about two thirds came from europe , mostly from italy , poland , russia and turkey .
migrants from africa make up only a fraction of that with about 5 percent mainly asylum-seekers . beck says that immigration in 2003 was still largely unregulated causing problems of integration .
but she also adds that the influx of foreigners is necessary for german society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have groups of foreigners where the necessity to qualify them is very big and which creats costs , " said beck . " on the other hand , you have people which we badly need .
we are already feeling the effects of a society which is growing older and older and we already have a lack of personal to take care of those people .
historically seen one can always say migration always brought about cultural pushes in a positive way . " estimates for 2004 , according to beck , suggest that the decline in immigration to germany will continue and that there may be yet another 70,000 migrants fewer than in 2003 .
this month a new immigration law has come into effect in germany placing greater emphasis on qualified immigration . beck says it is too early to say how this will affect immigration statistics , but experts are already saying that the hurdles for skilled foreigners to come to germany are still be too high compared with the united states , britain or other industrialized countries . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks common immigration policy eu proposals to attract high-skilled immigrants , unveiled tuesday , were met with criticism at a time when anti-immigrant sentiment is rising in much of europe .

no , it 's friedrich von schiller it 's a unique attempt to get german youth interested in a poet who has been dead for two centuries - and it just might work .
meet friedrich von schiller , comic-book hero . 200 years after the death of friedrich schiller , the keepers of the german poet 's flame have come up with a unique way to memorialize him : a comic book .
a brainchild of the german schiller society in marbach , germany , and the cologne-based publisher ehapa-verlag , the comic about schiller 's life will be published in may , on the 200th anniversary of his death .
exciting life the drawings are currently on view in an exhibit at the poet 's place of birth in marbach .
" we hope the -lrb- book 's -rrb- publication will be tied to new interest in schiller 's work and his life , " schiller society spokeswoman chritiane daetsch told dpa news service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller 's birthplace , in marbach the publishers are especially hoping the comic will awaken an interest in schiller among younger readers .
the story will " tell the exciting story of schiller 's life , " focusing on the period when he fled stuttgart to become a writer , daetsch said .
schiller was a 22 years old medic in 1782 when he left stuttgart , fleeing the duke carl eugen von württemberg , who had forbid him from writing .
his flight represents " the expression of his decision to live for writing alone , " said the artist horus -lrb- horus w. odenthal -rrb- , who was selected to tell the story .
' pale and beaky ' the prizewinning comic artist read through schiller biographies before he began to work on the story , but found particular inspiration in the poet 's personal letters .
they increasingly told the story of a contradictory figure : on the one hand a writer with a sure feel for words and stories , on the other , an excessive , tumultuous outsider , repeatedly irritating those around him .

no , it 's friedrich von schiller it 's a unique attempt to get german youth interested in a poet who has been dead for two centuries - and it just might work .
meet friedrich von schiller , comic-book hero . 200 years after the death of friedrich schiller , the keepers of the german poet 's flame have come up with a unique way to memorialize him : a comic book .
a brainchild of the german schiller society in marbach , germany , and the cologne-based publisher ehapa-verlag , the comic about schiller 's life will be published in may , on the 200th anniversary of his death .
exciting life the drawings are currently on view in an exhibit at the poet 's place of birth in marbach .
" we hope the -lrb- book 's -rrb- publication will be tied to new interest in schiller 's work and his life , " schiller society spokeswoman chritiane daetsch told dpa news service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller 's birthplace , in marbach the publishers are especially hoping the comic will awaken an interest in schiller among younger readers .
the story will " tell the exciting story of schiller 's life , " focusing on the period when he fled stuttgart to become a writer , daetsch said .
schiller was a 22 years old medic in 1782 when he left stuttgart , fleeing the duke carl eugen von württemberg , who had forbid him from writing .
his flight represents " the expression of his decision to live for writing alone , " said the artist horus -lrb- horus w. odenthal -rrb- , who was selected to tell the story .
' pale and beaky ' the prizewinning comic artist read through schiller biographies before he began to work on the story , but found particular inspiration in the poet 's personal letters .
they increasingly told the story of a contradictory figure : on the one hand a writer with a sure feel for words and stories , on the other , an excessive , tumultuous outsider , repeatedly irritating those around him .

but only about 5 million have actually stayed here since then . in 2003 - the year for which the latest immigration statistics are available - the number of migrants to germany for the first time dropped below 800,000 .

from the 768,000 migrants to germany in 2003 about two thirds came from europe , mostly from italy , poland , russia and turkey .
migrants from africa make up only a fraction of that with about 5 percent mainly asylum-seekers . beck says that immigration in 2003 was still largely unregulated causing problems of integration .
but she also adds that the influx of foreigners is necessary for german society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " you have groups of foreigners where the necessity to qualify them is very big and which creats costs , " said beck .

this month a new immigration law has come into effect in germany placing greater emphasis on qualified immigration . beck says it is too early to say how this will affect immigration statistics , but experts are already saying that the hurdles for skilled foreigners to come to germany are still be too high compared with the united states , britain or other industrialized countries . uwe hessler send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu seeks common immigration policy eu proposals to attract high-skilled immigrants , unveiled tuesday , were met with criticism at a time when anti-immigrant sentiment is rising in much of europe .

no , it 's friedrich von schiller it 's a unique attempt to get german youth interested in a poet who has been dead for two centuries - and it just might work .
meet friedrich von schiller , comic-book hero . 200 years after the death of friedrich schiller , the keepers of the german poet 's flame have come up with a unique way to memorialize him : a comic book .
a brainchild of the german schiller society in marbach , germany , and the cologne-based publisher ehapa-verlag , the comic about schiller 's life will be published in may , on the 200th anniversary of his death .
exciting life the drawings are currently on view in an exhibit at the poet 's place of birth in marbach .
" we hope the -lrb- book 's -rrb- publication will be tied to new interest in schiller 's work and his life , " schiller society spokeswoman chritiane daetsch told dpa news service .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller 's birthplace , in marbach the publishers are especially hoping the comic will awaken an interest in schiller among younger readers .
the story will " tell the exciting story of schiller 's life , " focusing on the period when he fled stuttgart to become a writer , daetsch said .
schiller was a 22 years old medic in 1782 when he left stuttgart , fleeing the duke carl eugen von württemberg , who had forbid him from writing .
his flight represents " the expression of his decision to live for writing alone , " said the artist horus -lrb- horus w. odenthal -rrb- , who was selected to tell the story .
' pale and beaky ' the prizewinning comic artist read through schiller biographies before he began to work on the story , but found particular inspiration in the poet 's personal letters .
they increasingly told the story of a contradictory figure : on the one hand a writer with a sure feel for words and stories , on the other , an excessive , tumultuous outsider , repeatedly irritating those around him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : * * archiv * * undatiertes bild des deutschen dichters friedrich von schiller .
er wurde 1759 in marbach am neckar geboren und starb 1805 in weimar .
am 9 .
mai 2005 jaehrt sich zum 200 .
mal der todestag friedrich schillers .
zu ehren des grossen deutschen dichters wird es in seinem geburtsort marbach am neckar wie an seinen wirkungsstaetten in stuttgart , mannheim , jena und weimar eine fuelle von veranstaltungen geben .
-lrb- ap photo -rrb- horus said his biggest challenge was figuring out how to draw the protagonist .
the problem ?
finding out what schiller - who over the years had been depicted in widely varying ways - really looked like .
in order to find the real schiller , horus went straight to the source : the poet 's death mask .
-lrb- making a cast of the face of a famous person upon his death was once common practice . -rrb-
in the end , horus decided schiller " was like the ugly kid in the class : redhead , freckled , pale , with a long neck and a beaky nose , " he told dpa .
over the centuries , however , his image was revised and re-revised , until he became a dashingly handsome young blond .
the schiller society 's daetsch points out that what seems very unusual at first glance - combining a historic literary figure with a comic book - actually has a basis in the poet 's own history .
" schiller himself used illustration and humor , " she told dpa , pointing out that he drew illustrated stories with " comic figures " for his friend gottfried körner . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : schiller 's skulls as the 200th anniversary of friedrich schiller 's death dawns , controversy over his remains stirs again .

" as long as there are still holocaust survivors among us , the german language should not be spoken in parliament , " israel 's minister of health dani naveh told the right-wing israeli daily newspaper maariv .
naveh said he plans to boycott the speech , which köhler will make toward the end of january , to mark the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations between israel and germany .
his comment echoes the feelings of a number of members of the israeli parliament or knesset . other jewish public figures have spoken out in favor of köhler using his native german .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous german president johannes rau visited israel in 2003 the current dispute harkens back to 2000 , when germany 's then-president johannes rau made the first address of a german president to the knesset .
his speech , also in german , caused a similar uproar .
reminders of the nazi era ?
responding to the current round of criticism , the acting president of the knesset , hemi doron , said he would ask his superiors to cancel the event or to ask köhler to hold his speech in english .
" my feet have never touched german soil , and i buy no german products , " said doron , whose grandfather was killed in the holocaust .
" i can not allow that language to be spoken in the house of parliament of the jewish people , " he said .
member of the knesset -lrb- mk -rrb- gila finkelstein also said köhler should speak in english , not german .
' open wound ' " my whole body will tremor if i hear german in the knesset , " said finkelstein , whose extended family was murdered in the holocaust .
" there is an open wound , " she said , in an interview with the jerusalem post on monday .
finkelstein called on köhler to " act with sensitivity " and not speak german .
knesset speaker reuven rivlin , who has rejected as the mks ' requests , was instrumental in the decision to allow köhler to deliver his speech in german in the first place .
" it is clear that a visiting president speaks in his language , " rivlin told the jerusalem post .
it would be " better not to extend an invitation than to demand that the guest speak in a different language , " he argued .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some members of the knesset at work at the same time , rivlin said he understands mks who argue that israel can not ignore what happened under the nazis . but he also said the protest should not be directed toward one person or his spoken language , but a historic occurrence that " we must remember and not forget . "
insulting request ?
opposition leader yosef lapid - himself a holocaust survivor - said the situation is different now than it was when germany and israel first resumed diplomatic relations .
forty years ago , lapid would have have opposed a german address in the knesset .
since then , israel 's relations with germany have changed .
now , lapid said , it would be insulting to prevent the german president from speaking in his own language .
in an interview in germany 's frankfurt allgemeine zeitung newspaper , marcel reich-ranicki , one of the last survivors of the warsaw ghetto and a prominent literary critic in germany , criticized the discussion in israel .
köhler should address the knesset in german , he arged , calling the boycott threats " not only deplorable but shameful and , in the end , incomprehensible . "
associating the german language only with the nazi regime and saying its use in the knesset would defile holocaust survivors is " pure nonsense , " said reich-ranicki .
it neglects , for instance , the fact that german-speaking jews have played an enormous role in the development of modern thought , he told the paper .
german thinkers " we can no longer imagine physics without albert einstein , psychology without sigmund freud , sociology without karl marx , literature without franz kafka , and modern music without gustav mahler and arnold schönberg - all german speaking jews , " reich-ranicki said .
he also noted that the father of zionism , theodor herzle , published a decisive book on the creation of a jewish state , der judenstaat in german in 1896 , and that herzl had long debated whether german should be that country 's lingua franca .
it was only after the founding of the state of israel that hebrew became the official language because it was the common denominator among jews of different nationalities .
changing concerns the german culture will soon cease to be a touchy topic in israel , according to reich-ranicki .
the current generation has too much else on its mind , said the man known in germany as a " literature czar . "
" in israel , they wo n't discuss much longer whether wagner should be played in concert halls or german should be spoken in parliament , " he predicted .
" the new generation of israeli jews is n't worried at all about such subjects .
and that 's a good thing .

but only about 5 million have actually stayed here since then . in 2003 - the year for which the latest immigration statistics are available - the number of migrants to germany for the first time dropped below 800,000 .

the bbc and woodland trust are running the springwatch project to see how nature is responding to global warming .
a nationwide network of volunteers is being asked to record their first sightings of six species - including bees and butterflies - this spring .

springwatch is one of the biggest public nature projects undertaken in the uk .
climate change participants , who do not need to be wildlife experts , are being asked to record when and where they first see bumblebees , frog spawn , swifts , peacock butterflies , seven-spot ladybirds and flowering hawthorn .
scientists know that certain species , especially types of insect , make their first appearance of the year earlier than they did 30 years ago .
but each species reacts differently to the warmer weather and researchers want to understand how their habits differ to discover the overall impact of climate change .
the new data will be sent to researchers via the springwatch website .

springwatch is one of the biggest public nature projects undertaken in the uk .
climate change participants , who do not need to be wildlife experts , are being asked to record when and where they first see bumblebees , frog spawn , swifts , peacock butterflies , seven-spot ladybirds and flowering hawthorn .
scientists know that certain species , especially types of insect , make their first appearance of the year earlier than they did 30 years ago .
but each species reacts differently to the warmer weather and researchers want to understand how their habits differ to discover the overall impact of climate change .
the new data will be sent to researchers via the springwatch website .

three separate studies by us , uk and dutch research teams are published in the lancet medical journal .
parkinson 's , for which there is no cure , is a degenerative disease in the part of the brain controlling movement and affects 3 % of people over 75 .
' dardarin ' protein each of the three studies looked at genetic faults in the lrrk2 gene .
it controls the action of a protein named dardarin by researchers , after the basque word dardara , which means tremor .
scientists do not yet fully understand what the protein 's intended function is . "
this could lead to new improved treatments and potentially a cure for some people with the condition " linda kelly , parkinson 's disease society the mutation of the gene , found on a region of chromosome 12 , is called park8 .
it was identified in a study of five families with a history of parkinson 's disease who lived in the basque region of northern spain , and in england the us study , by scientists from indiana university and cincinnati children 's hospital , involved 767 parkinson 's disease patients from 358 families across america .
it was found that 34 , or just under 5 % , of patients carried the same gene mutation .
in an institute of neurology study , 482 people from families without a known history of parkinson 's were studied and eight were found to have the same mutation .
in the third study , by researchers from erasmus mc in the netherlands , the mutation was present in four out of 61 families with a history of parkinson 's disease .
from the results of all three studies the researchers concluded that the mutation appears to be responsible for up to 5 % of parkinson 's in people with a family history of the disorder and up to 2 % of cases in people who do not have a family history of the disease .
' new treatments ' andrew singleton , of the national institute of aging 's said : " knowing that this mutation is not only important in familial forms of disease , but in typical sporadic disease , where there is no strong family history , could lead to earlier detection of parkinson 's disease .
" further study of how this gene works also might help scientists identify new treatments . "
dr william nichols , of the cincinnati children 's hospital suggested screening for the mutation would soon become a key part of genetic testing for parkinson 's .

" young people are hearing that , as a result of the reclassification that took place a year ago , cannabis is no longer regarded as a serious drug and that the police wo n't make arrests except in the most serious circumstances .
" young people are getting the message that cannabis is risk-free which is reflected in the astonishingly high rates of use amongst young people as the street drug of choice . "

north and western areas are to be hit by winds gusting up to 70mph , with snow falling over much of scotland .
fife and the central belt are worst affected , with a number of roads passable only with care .
gritters have been out .
the m77 , m8 and m74 have already been hit by snow and ice , as have surrounding roads .
northern constabulary said it was offering precautionary advice to people on the western isles based on information received from stornoway coastguard .
the severe weather warning applies until tuesday .
schools shut the a82 at glencoe is also affected by snow and police have advised motorists to take extra caution .
police are appealing for people to secure any garden materials which may be unstable following last week 's gales .
" the public should be aware that any storm debris which may not have been cleared away may pose a risk to safety if the winds are as strong as predicted , " the force said .
all schools in the western isles are to close on tuesday .
meanwhile , experts studying the seas off the west coast are warning of more devastating weather of the type which caused havoc in scotland last week . "
there may be an economic cost for scotland in that the lifeline subsidy is already quite high " john coll scientist they predict that damaging storms will become more frequent .
researchers from the university of the highlands and islands and southampton have been looking at wave heights in the atlantic over the last nine years .
the project was conducted jointly by the environmental research institute in thurso , which is part of the university of the highlands and islands -lrb- uhi -rrb- millennium institute network , and the southampton oceanography centre .
scientists carried out a series of studies , including the use of satellites to assess wave heights in the seas around the west coast and the hebrides .
atlantic cyclones they found that high seas were causing more frequent disruption to communities and transport networks .
they have produced their findings alongside a clear pattern in recent decades of more frequent and more intense atlantic cyclones their findings highlighted the possibility of the scottish executive having to offer larger subsidies to provide bigger ferries on lifeline routes to avoid increasing disruption .
expert john coll explained : " we 've worked in partnership with -lrb- ferry company -rrb- caledonian macbrayne .
we 've been looking at two sailings in relation to wave heights along these routes .
" should there be a deterioration in wave height associated with wider warming , we can expect more disruption for these sailings .
" there may be an economic cost for scotland in that the lifeline subsidy is already quite high .
' social cost ' " if the intensity of this recent storm is repeated with greater frequency in the future , the level of subsidy may have to rise to provide bigger boats to protect timetables and maintain communities .
" the other possibility is that there may be a social cost for communities if they are subject to more isolation caused by being cut off for longer periods of time by these weather events . "
the researchers ' work is continuing and is being co-ordinated by the tyndall centre for climate change , a network of more than 200 researchers working on ways to minimise the risks posed by climate change .

the project was conducted jointly by the environmental research institute in thurso , which is part of the university of the highlands and islands -lrb- uhi -rrb- millennium institute network , and the southampton oceanography centre .
scientists carried out a series of studies , including the use of satellites to assess wave heights in the seas around the west coast and the hebrides .
atlantic cyclones they found that high seas were causing more frequent disruption to communities and transport networks .
they have produced their findings alongside a clear pattern in recent decades of more frequent and more intense atlantic cyclones their findings highlighted the possibility of the scottish executive having to offer larger subsidies to provide bigger ferries on lifeline routes to avoid increasing disruption .
snow is making driving conditions treacherous expert john coll explained : " we 've worked in partnership with -lrb- ferry company -rrb- caledonian macbrayne .
we 've been looking at two sailings in relation to wave heights along these routes .
" should there be a deterioration in wave height associated with wider warming , we can expect more disruption for these sailings .
" there may be an economic cost for scotland in that the lifeline subsidy is already quite high .
' social cost ' " if the intensity of this recent storm is repeated with greater frequency in the future , the level of subsidy may have to rise to provide bigger boats to protect timetables and maintain communities .
" the other possibility is that there may be a social cost for communities if they are subject to more isolation caused by being cut off for longer periods of time by these weather events . "
the researchers ' work is continuing and is being co-ordinated by the tyndall centre for climate change , a network of more than 200 researchers working on ways to minimise the risks posed by climate change .
