" the moon is the next worthy goal , " said astronaut manfred messerschmid during the symposium , adding that the celestial body is only 1,000 hours away from the earth , unlike mars which takes a 1,000 days to reach .
the companies also urged the creation of an unmanned european research station on the moon .
they said in a statement that a gigantic long wave radio telescope would be installed on the back of the moon by 2015 to research a completely unknown side of the universe .
the aerospace firms added that they hoped the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- would shoulder the costs of the project which is estimated at around 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- .
esa , which is headquartered in paris , is expected to debate the issue during its next conference , in december .

esa wants to head to mars and the moon , but not before 2033 and 2024 respectively .
that 's too late for the scientists , researchers and industry representatives assembled in bremen on thursday , who stressed that europe had to do more , and quickly , in space research if it wanted to keep up with other nations .
manfred fuchs , head of the bremen-based aerospace company ohb said that other countries had long been involved in missions to the moon .
he criticized the fact that the issue unfortunately " is n't the first priority " in europe and warned that germany , as the biggest country in europe , could n't afford to sit back while countries such as the us , russia , japan , china and india planned and realized their own space programs .
money the biggest problem most scientists and industry representatives admitted that the biggest stumbling block to european aerospace research is the paucity of funds .
evert dudok , president of eads space transportation , said that a central problem in germany was the slim budget for space research .
that amount plus the funds germany receives from esa add up to just about 700 million euros , dudok pointed out and added that the budget for this year had already been completely allocated .
" we demand a raise of 15 percent or 100 million euros to finally get some leeway , " he said .

messerschmidt said that the german research ministry 's budget allocation for space research had already fallen to 11 percent from 20 percent .
" we have to stop this process , " messerschmit said .
manfred fuchs pointed out that nations like japan had already massively increased their space research budgets .
however , a spokesman for the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- was skeptical of the ambitious plans of aerospace industry representatives .
he told spiegel online that the " big goal " of the dlr remained the international space station iss and the docking of the european space research module colombus .
a " quantum leap " aerospace industry experts for now have pinned their hopes on a more realistic goal : building a giant radio telescope on the moon by 2015 , which in dudok 's words would bring a " quantum leap for radio astronomy . "
eads space transportation is already working with dutch researchers on the telescope .
the apparatus , which will be transported with the help of a ariane 5 rocket , will consist of 100 small antennae and will cover an initial radius of 300 meters , if all goes according to plan .

" the meeting of the ambassadors is over .
there has not been any major shift in the countries ' positions , " one diplomat told reuters .
the eu 's british presidency , which has been trying to resolve the issue for weeks , has conceded that it may have to call a special meeting of eu foreign ministers , possibly on sept .
26 , an agreement can not be reached soon .
still hope for a deal but a presidency spokesman tried to sound upbeat after the ambassadors met .
" it was a good discussion .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has been unwilling to recognize the nikosia government turkey drew criticism in july when , while signing a protocol extending a customs accord with the eu to the bloc 's 10 newest states - including cyprus - it simultaneously declared this did not amount to a recognition of the nicosia government .
the eu ministers are seeking agreement on a " counter-declaration , " but differences over how strongly it should press ankara to recognize the island member state have so far prevented an accord .
cyprus , which gained independence from britain in 1960 , has struggled to emerge from its three-decade-long division into predominantly greek-cypriot and turkish-cypriot sectors .
the island has been split since 1974 when the turkish military occupied the northern third in response to a greek-inspired coup .
turkey supports the turkish cypriot breakaway state in the north of the mediterranean island , while cyprus 's greek cypriot government represents the whole island in the eu .
british-french agreement fails earlier this week , britain and france sought support for a compromise stating that turkey should recognize cyprus before joining , but that failed to win enough backing when the ambassadors first met on wednesday .
the latest draft for the friday meeting , seen by afp , contained a paragraph proposing that the eu tell ankara that " prior recognition of all member states is a necessary component of accession . "
without providing additional details , an eu diplomat said that cyprus , its closest ally greece as well as the czech republic had refused to accept the wording .
cyprus previously stated it wanted the eu to create deadlines for turkey to fulfill in its process of recognizing the mediterranean island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus wants access to turkish ports and airports cyprus wants access to turkish ports the draft also warned that failure by turkey to fully implement the ankara accord - notably by allowing cypriot ships and planes to use its ports and airports - will slow down the pace of membership talks .
" failure to implement its obligations in full will affect the overall progress in the negotiations , " the draft said .
the eu diplomat said that this warning " was acceptable to all member states . "
while the eu debates what position to take , ankara has grown increasingly impatient , with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan accusing the bloc of " rude " diplomatic conduct for placing new conditions on its bid to become a member .
turkey said it would recognize cyprus only after a broad international agreement , possibly sponsored by the united nations , to end the division of the island .
ankara argues that although it occupied the northern part of the island in 1974 to protect the turkish population following a pro-greek coup , it is not responsible for the continuing division of cyprus . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de uk and france mull deal on turkey standoff britain and france have agreed that turkey must recognize cyprus before joining the european union , as a possible compromise to clear the way for accession talks next month , according to diplomatic sources .

bildunterschrift : speaking at the un general assembly , fischer stressed that unsuccessful negotiations so far about expanding the security council should be reopened .
he added that he was hopeful that a watered-down plan adopted by the general assembly to restructure the world body still " leaves the door open " for further progress . " we will continue to work patiently on reform , " the minister told german reporters .
fischer quashed rumors that reform of the un 's highest-ranking body had been put on hold , saying that " the pressure of relationships makes this reform necessary . "
he underlined that the german government was not primarily concerned about getting permanent membership , but rather wanted to bestow more legitimacy on the world body by ensuring that it no longer reflected the world of 1945 but rather that of the 21st century .
opposition from us and china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council has five permanent members - the us , russia , china , france and great britain .
the remaining ten members are elected for a period of two years .
germany has launched a joint bid along with japan , india and brazil for permanent membership .
the group known as " g4 " agreed thursday on the sidelines of the un summit to continue to pursue efforts towards that end .
the g4 had submitted a plan to boost the council 's membership from its current 15 to 25 , with six new permanent seats and four new non-permanent seats .
their first bid ran into opposition from the united states and china and failed to get crucial support from africa for the necessary two-thirds of member countries ' votes in the un general assembly to change the world body 's charter .
fischer 's appeal to reform and expand the security council was lent support by the remaining g4 members on thursday , many of whom appeared optimistic about their chances .
g4 not dead " the g4 exists .
the g4 will continue to work for united nations reform , " indian foreign minister natwar singh said .
singh added that their proposal could be reintroduced at the 60th session of the un general assembly with some changes .
" we are confident that it -lrb- reform -rrb- will happen , " said brazilian foreign minister celso amorim .
japan in particular , made a strong case for the security council to be more inclusive and meet the challenges of a changing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi in a speech to the un world summit , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , fresh off a thumping election victory at home , pleaded the case for change on the security council .
" the world has changed dramatically over the last 60 years .
asia and africa , once under the shackles of colonialism , are now significant players in our global community , " koizumi told other leaders .
" for the last 60 years , japan has determinedly pursued a course of development as a peace-loving nation , making a unique and significant contribution to the peace and prosperity of the world , " he said .
" the composition of the security council must reflect these fundamental changes .
japan is convinced that security council reform is a just cause for the international community - as is the deletion of the long-obsolete ' enemy state ' clauses from the un charter , " koizumi added .
japan was one of the vanquished nations in 1945 , but now has the world 's second-largest economy and is the second-biggest contributor to the un budget .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.09.2005 germany 's unions face decisive moment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionally a force in germany , unions ' power is on the wane many are calling the upcoming vote key to determining germany 's economic future .
it 's just as crucial for the country 's trade unions , which could see their power greatly reduced by a conservative-liberal government . the chairman of germany 's dgb trade union federation , michael sommer , was all smiles as he stood side by side with chancellor gerhard schröder last week at the dgb headquarters .
just months ago , the two would n't even shake each the other 's hand after the bitter recriminations that were thrown from both sides over welfare and labor market reforms put in place by schröder .
at the kiss-and-make-up session , however , sommer was , while not commanding , strongly suggesting that germany 's trade union members vote for schröder and keep the current social democratic-green coalition in power for four more years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer , dgb chairman , right , and chancellor gerhard schröder , left , brief the media following their their talks at the dgb headquarters in berlin .
" it 's about nothing less than determining the future of this society , " sommer said .
in the back of his mind , however , he might have been thinking about the future of germany 's trade union movement , which is looking more uncertain these days , especially if a coalition of angela merkel 's conservative union bloc and the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- form the next government .
while sommer had his problems with his traditional allies - schröder 's social democrats , whose reforms were seen as " socially unjust " - the alternative looks even worse .
in these somewhat desperate times , better to go with the lesser of two evils .
" if the majority of voters vote for the union and the fdp , these parties could attempt to break the back of the unions , like margaret thatcher did in great britain , " sommer told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
and while once unions in the uk were mighty forces , today they are but a shadow of their former selves .
" unions lost that fight -lrb- over reforms -rrb- , " said hagen lesch , an expert on wage policy at the cologne institute for economic research .
" the thinking is to hang on to what they have now . "
traditional force trade unions in germany have traditionally been a powerful force in the labor market .
unions , in often tough negotiations with employers , set wage agreements that apply to entire sectors of the labor market .
in the postwar era , that has translated into regular pay increases for workers , generous holiday and sick-time allowances , and labor conditions that are the envy of much of the world .
bildunterschrift : steelworkers protesting but things have changed on the labor landscape and the once shining reputation of german trade unions is looking tarnished .
the country 's unemployment rate , which has been rising since the 1970s and is now at almost 12 percent , seems impossible to get down .
the pressures of globalization and the outsourcing of many manufacturing jobs means the traditional models - a job for life , an ever-increasing standard of living , cradle-to-grave security - are proving unsustainable .
the economy is stuck with anemic growth rates and often hovers just above recession .
economists , business leaders and some politicians have been calling for reform , for more self-responsibility , more flexibility and less government intervention and state support .
unions have resisted those appeals , claiming they hurt workers , and have begun to be seen - depending on which side of the labor and political spectrum one stands - as roadblocks to growth or protectors of the common man .
however , among the political classes , the former category of opinion appears to be in the ascendant .
change , it is a-comin ' ?
the conservative cdu party , led by angela merkel , who is likely to become germany 's next , and first female , chancellor , has said the unions will likely be looking at change if she forms the next government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel she wants to take away some of their most cherished power - that of setting sector-wide wage agreements - and allow staff and management at individual companies to decide if they want to determine their own pay scales .
merkel has said she wants germany to continue to have strong unions , but that they should be more flexible .
" one ca n't say you 're for a strong union and at the same time , erode wage autonomy .
that 's a contradiction , " said hans-joachim schabedoth , head of the policy department of the dgb .
according to him , conservatives are playing a dangerous game in attempting to eviscerate union power .
history has shown , if a government wants to maintain a majority , or its popularity , it has to pay attention to union interests , he said . the current anti-union strategy was going against the best interests of the larger society , he added .

other considerations by merkel & co . , such as loosening job protection laws , liberalizing store opening hours , and rethinking policies on worker participation in company management , if they go through , would also be defeats for unions and could further push them to the periphery of a germany that appears to be embarking on a more free-market course . kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder seeks unions ' support ten days ahead of germany 's general elections , chancellor gerhard schröder made a show of unity with a major trade union boss , brushing aside the repeated clashes that have marked his seven years in power .

it 's just as crucial for the country 's trade unions , which could see their power greatly reduced by a conservative-liberal government . the chairman of germany 's dgb trade union federation , michael sommer , was all smiles as he stood side by side with chancellor gerhard schröder last week at the dgb headquarters .
just months ago , the two would n't even shake each the other 's hand after the bitter recriminations that were thrown from both sides over welfare and labor market reforms put in place by schröder .
at the kiss-and-make-up session , however , sommer was , while not commanding , strongly suggesting that germany 's trade union members vote for schröder and keep the current social democratic-green coalition in power for four more years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer , dgb chairman , right , and chancellor gerhard schröder , left , brief the media following their their talks at the dgb headquarters in berlin .
" it 's about nothing less than determining the future of this society , " sommer said .
in the back of his mind , however , he might have been thinking about the future of germany 's trade union movement , which is looking more uncertain these days , especially if a coalition of angela merkel 's conservative union bloc and the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- form the next government .
while sommer had his problems with his traditional allies - schröder 's social democrats , whose reforms were seen as " socially unjust " - the alternative looks even worse .
in these somewhat desperate times , better to go with the lesser of two evils .
" if the majority of voters vote for the union and the fdp , these parties could attempt to break the back of the unions , like margaret thatcher did in great britain , " sommer told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
and while once unions in the uk were mighty forces , today they are but a shadow of their former selves .
" unions lost that fight -lrb- over reforms -rrb- , " said hagen lesch , an expert on wage policy at the cologne institute for economic research .
" the thinking is to hang on to what they have now . "
traditional force trade unions in germany have traditionally been a powerful force in the labor market .
unions , in often tough negotiations with employers , set wage agreements that apply to entire sectors of the labor market .
in the postwar era , that has translated into regular pay increases for workers , generous holiday and sick-time allowances , and labor conditions that are the envy of much of the world .
bildunterschrift : steelworkers protesting but things have changed on the labor landscape and the once shining reputation of german trade unions is looking tarnished .
the country 's unemployment rate , which has been rising since the 1970s and is now at almost 12 percent , seems impossible to get down .
the pressures of globalization and the outsourcing of many manufacturing jobs means the traditional models - a job for life , an ever-increasing standard of living , cradle-to-grave security - are proving unsustainable .
the economy is stuck with anemic growth rates and often hovers just above recession .
economists , business leaders and some politicians have been calling for reform , for more self-responsibility , more flexibility and less government intervention and state support .
unions have resisted those appeals , claiming they hurt workers , and have begun to be seen - depending on which side of the labor and political spectrum one stands - as roadblocks to growth or protectors of the common man .
however , among the political classes , the former category of opinion appears to be in the ascendant .
change , it is a-comin ' ?
the conservative cdu party , led by angela merkel , who is likely to become germany 's next , and first female , chancellor , has said the unions will likely be looking at change if she forms the next government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel she wants to take away some of their most cherished power - that of setting sector-wide wage agreements - and allow staff and management at individual companies to decide if they want to determine their own pay scales .
merkel has said she wants germany to continue to have strong unions , but that they should be more flexible .
" one ca n't say you 're for a strong union and at the same time , erode wage autonomy .
that 's a contradiction , " said hans-joachim schabedoth , head of the policy department of the dgb .
according to him , conservatives are playing a dangerous game in attempting to eviscerate union power .
history has shown , if a government wants to maintain a majority , or its popularity , it has to pay attention to union interests , he said . the current anti-union strategy was going against the best interests of the larger society , he added .
" our role is to ensure that people benefit from their own work and that social questions are considered in the larger economy so that social problems do n't grow , " he said .

" there 's something mechanical today in the franco-german relationship that needs to be given new legitimacy , " said jean-dominique giuliani , head of the robert schuman foundation in paris .
merkel herself has said the franco-german motor would continue if she became chancellor , through she stated it would not be an " exclusive " relationship nor one directed against other eu members .
merkel signaled that she would maintain several foreign policy positions , including support for environmental protection and the international criminal court - both issues that align with chirac 's views .
she is vehemently opposed to turkey 's bid to join the european union , which could please chirac .
initially an enthusiastic supporter of ankara 's bid , he has become more ambivalent on the subject after the french electorate made clear its resistance to the idea .
merkel was also likely to continue the current government 's soft-spoken approach on human rights in both russia and china but stop short of echoing current german chancellor gerhard schröder 's and chirac 's call to lift the eu arms embargo against beijing .
in the end , though , a long-awaited turnaround in the economic fortunes of the two countries may be the impetus to revive their partnership .
" the basis of the problems in the franco-german relationship are economic in nature , " said giuliani . dw-world.de merkel 's fans in washington washington is watching sunday 's election and , secretly , hoping for a merkel victory .
but the promise of better relations is off-set by areas of potential dispute .

bildunterschrift : speaking at the un general assembly , fischer stressed that unsuccessful negotiations so far about expanding the security council should be reopened .
he added that he was hopeful that a watered-down plan adopted by the general assembly to restructure the world body still " leaves the door open " for further progress . " we will continue to work patiently on reform , " the minister told german reporters .
fischer quashed rumors that reform of the un 's highest-ranking body had been put on hold , saying that " the pressure of relationships makes this reform necessary . "
he underlined that the german government was not primarily concerned about getting permanent membership , but rather wanted to bestow more legitimacy on the world body by ensuring that it no longer reflected the world of 1945 but rather that of the 21st century .
opposition from us and china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council has five permanent members - the us , russia , china , france and great britain .
the remaining ten members are elected for a period of two years .
germany has launched a joint bid along with japan , india and brazil for permanent membership .
the group known as " g4 " agreed thursday on the sidelines of the un summit to continue to pursue efforts towards that end .
the g4 had submitted a plan to boost the council 's membership from its current 15 to 25 , with six new permanent seats and four new non-permanent seats .
their first bid ran into opposition from the united states and china and failed to get crucial support from africa for the necessary two-thirds of member countries ' votes in the un general assembly to change the world body 's charter .
fischer 's appeal to reform and expand the security council was lent support by the remaining g4 members on thursday , many of whom appeared optimistic about their chances .
g4 not dead " the g4 exists .
the g4 will continue to work for united nations reform , " indian foreign minister natwar singh said .
singh added that their proposal could be reintroduced at the 60th session of the un general assembly with some changes .
" we are confident that it -lrb- reform -rrb- will happen , " said brazilian foreign minister celso amorim .
japan in particular , made a strong case for the security council to be more inclusive and meet the challenges of a changing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi in a speech to the un world summit , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , fresh off a thumping election victory at home , pleaded the case for change on the security council .
" the world has changed dramatically over the last 60 years .
asia and africa , once under the shackles of colonialism , are now significant players in our global community , " koizumi told other leaders .
" for the last 60 years , japan has determinedly pursued a course of development as a peace-loving nation , making a unique and significant contribution to the peace and prosperity of the world , " he said .
" the composition of the security council must reflect these fundamental changes .
japan is convinced that security council reform is a just cause for the international community - as is the deletion of the long-obsolete ' enemy state ' clauses from the un charter , " koizumi added .
japan was one of the vanquished nations in 1945 , but now has the world 's second-largest economy and is the second-biggest contributor to the un budget .
germany has made a similar case as europe 's biggest economy .

the relatives of bavarian king ludwig ii are resigned to the fact that they have a colorful legacy to look back on , but a descendant of the king 's stable master does n't want anyone to pass that legacy onto his forebear . king ludwig ii -lrb- 1845-86 -rrb- , who was rumored to have been a good-looking man with an excellent reputation among his subjects , was known to keep a diary that documented his difficulties reconciling his catholic faith and his sexual desires .
indeed , many people suspected him of overly-friendly relationships with his male servants - especially the head of the stables .
the relationship was so well-known that it made its way into a song in alfred wolfsteiner 's book , geschichte in liedern : eine zeitreise durch die oberpfalz -lrb- history in song : a trip in time through the upper palatinate -rrb- , which alludes to a homosexual relationship between the ludwig and the stable master .

" there 's something mechanical today in the franco-german relationship that needs to be given new legitimacy , " said jean-dominique giuliani , head of the robert schuman foundation in paris .
merkel herself has said the franco-german motor would continue if she became chancellor , through she stated it would not be an " exclusive " relationship nor one directed against other eu members .
merkel signaled that she would maintain several foreign policy positions , including support for environmental protection and the international criminal court - both issues that align with chirac 's views .
she is vehemently opposed to turkey 's bid to join the european union , which could please chirac .
initially an enthusiastic supporter of ankara 's bid , he has become more ambivalent on the subject after the french electorate made clear its resistance to the idea .
merkel was also likely to continue the current government 's soft-spoken approach on human rights in both russia and china but stop short of echoing current german chancellor gerhard schröder 's and chirac 's call to lift the eu arms embargo against beijing .
in the end , though , a long-awaited turnaround in the economic fortunes of the two countries may be the impetus to revive their partnership .

but the promise of better relations is off-set by areas of potential dispute . should conservative angela merkel sweep to victory in sunday 's elections , it could mean a fresh start for strained us-german relations , according to analysts . after dipping to new lows under chancellor gerhard schröder and his center-left coalition , with differences over iraq and the partnership linking germany , france and russia undermining ties , the relationship seems to have stabilized of late .
but a victory by merkel , an atlanticist like her mentor helmut kohl , could make ties to washington a lot friendlier . " what is happening in germany is a catalyst for change , " said rockwell schnabel , former us ambassador to the european union and author of a new book on the eu and its contentious relations with the united states . merkel appears to be " a closer friend of the united states and therefore would lead a policy that would be more pro-american and pro-atlanticist , " he added . merkel 's priorities after riding a wave of anti-bush sentiment to victory in 2002 , germany 's miserable economic state has forced schröder to focus on domestic issues in his uphill battle to re-election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- might do things differently than her predecessor -lrb- left -rrb- opinion polls show that merkel , candidate for the christian democrats , has a good chance at becoming the country 's first female chancellor .
but up to 30 percent of the electorate remains undecided . merkel , 51 , has said that one of her priorities if elected would be mending the poisoned relationship with the united states , while still not sending troops to iraq .
washington is also interested in her aggressive pro-free market agenda . although bush officials refuse to publicly comment on the outcome of the sunday vote , privately they say a merkel victory would be a welcome change . a fresh start , without " leftovers " " if the administration representatives are honest they 'll tell you ' well this is a fresh start and merkel 's victory would be a good thing ' , " said jackson janes , director of the american institute for contemporary german studies . " we got a lot of leftovers with the schröder team and we 'll probably never be able to change that , so if we get a new team in berlin it 's an opportunity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jackson janes janes -lrb- photo -rrb- and others warned , however , that if merkel wins on sunday , the bush administration should n't rush to pop the champagne corks .
" i do n't think that we here in washington should escalate our expectations that her parameters would be significantly bigger than schröder 's , " janes said . dieter dettke , executive director of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , which is close to schröder 's spd , in washington , said that while merkel would certainly work hard to establish smoother lines of communication with washington , in substance there could be little change under her administration as far as foreign policy is concerned .
the turkey question one likely contentious issue , janes and dettke noted , was merkel 's opposition to turkey becoming a full member of the european union which put her at odds with washington . nonetheless , analysts say , relations under merkel are unlikely to be any worse than they have been with schröder . " i think that -lrb- if merkel wins -rrb- there 's going to be much more of an effort to say ' let 's see where we agree ... ' , " janes said . " in the case of schröder , there was a great deal of concern that they were thinking more about differences rather than commonalities .

washington is watching sunday 's election and , secretly , hoping for a merkel victory .
but the promise of better relations is off-set by areas of potential dispute . should conservative angela merkel sweep to victory in sunday 's elections , it could mean a fresh start for strained us-german relations , according to analysts . after dipping to new lows under chancellor gerhard schröder and his center-left coalition , with differences over iraq and the partnership linking germany , france and russia undermining ties , the relationship seems to have stabilized of late .
but a victory by merkel , an atlanticist like her mentor helmut kohl , could make ties to washington a lot friendlier . " what is happening in germany is a catalyst for change , " said rockwell schnabel , former us ambassador to the european union and author of a new book on the eu and its contentious relations with the united states . merkel appears to be " a closer friend of the united states and therefore would lead a policy that would be more pro-american and pro-atlanticist , " he added . merkel 's priorities after riding a wave of anti-bush sentiment to victory in 2002 , germany 's miserable economic state has forced schröder to focus on domestic issues in his uphill battle to re-election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- might do things differently than her predecessor -lrb- left -rrb- opinion polls show that merkel , candidate for the christian democrats , has a good chance at becoming the country 's first female chancellor .
but up to 30 percent of the electorate remains undecided . merkel , 51 , has said that one of her priorities if elected would be mending the poisoned relationship with the united states , while still not sending troops to iraq .
washington is also interested in her aggressive pro-free market agenda . although bush officials refuse to publicly comment on the outcome of the sunday vote , privately they say a merkel victory would be a welcome change . a fresh start , without " leftovers " " if the administration representatives are honest they 'll tell you ' well this is a fresh start and merkel 's victory would be a good thing ' , " said jackson janes , director of the american institute for contemporary german studies . " we got a lot of leftovers with the schröder team and we 'll probably never be able to change that , so if we get a new team in berlin it 's an opportunity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jackson janes janes -lrb- photo -rrb- and others warned , however , that if merkel wins on sunday , the bush administration should n't rush to pop the champagne corks .
" i do n't think that we here in washington should escalate our expectations that her parameters would be significantly bigger than schröder 's , " janes said . dieter dettke , executive director of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , which is close to schröder 's spd , in washington , said that while merkel would certainly work hard to establish smoother lines of communication with washington , in substance there could be little change under her administration as far as foreign policy is concerned .
the turkey question one likely contentious issue , janes and dettke noted , was merkel 's opposition to turkey becoming a full member of the european union which put her at odds with washington . nonetheless , analysts say , relations under merkel are unlikely to be any worse than they have been with schröder . " i think that -lrb- if merkel wins -rrb- there 's going to be much more of an effort to say ' let 's see where we agree ... ' , " janes said . " in the case of schröder , there was a great deal of concern that they were thinking more about differences rather than commonalities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.09.2005 germany 's unions face decisive moment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionally a force in germany , unions ' power is on the wane many are calling the upcoming vote key to determining germany 's economic future .
it 's just as crucial for the country 's trade unions , which could see their power greatly reduced by a conservative-liberal government . the chairman of germany 's dgb trade union federation , michael sommer , was all smiles as he stood side by side with chancellor gerhard schröder last week at the dgb headquarters .
just months ago , the two would n't even shake each the other 's hand after the bitter recriminations that were thrown from both sides over welfare and labor market reforms put in place by schröder .
at the kiss-and-make-up session , however , sommer was , while not commanding , strongly suggesting that germany 's trade union members vote for schröder and keep the current social democratic-green coalition in power for four more years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer , dgb chairman , right , and chancellor gerhard schröder , left , brief the media following their their talks at the dgb headquarters in berlin .
" it 's about nothing less than determining the future of this society , " sommer said .
in the back of his mind , however , he might have been thinking about the future of germany 's trade union movement , which is looking more uncertain these days , especially if a coalition of angela merkel 's conservative union bloc and the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- form the next government .
while sommer had his problems with his traditional allies - schröder 's social democrats , whose reforms were seen as " socially unjust " - the alternative looks even worse .
in these somewhat desperate times , better to go with the lesser of two evils .
" if the majority of voters vote for the union and the fdp , these parties could attempt to break the back of the unions , like margaret thatcher did in great britain , " sommer told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
and while once unions in the uk were mighty forces , today they are but a shadow of their former selves .
" unions lost that fight -lrb- over reforms -rrb- , " said hagen lesch , an expert on wage policy at the cologne institute for economic research .
" the thinking is to hang on to what they have now . "
traditional force trade unions in germany have traditionally been a powerful force in the labor market .
unions , in often tough negotiations with employers , set wage agreements that apply to entire sectors of the labor market .
in the postwar era , that has translated into regular pay increases for workers , generous holiday and sick-time allowances , and labor conditions that are the envy of much of the world .
bildunterschrift : steelworkers protesting but things have changed on the labor landscape and the once shining reputation of german trade unions is looking tarnished .
the country 's unemployment rate , which has been rising since the 1970s and is now at almost 12 percent , seems impossible to get down .
the pressures of globalization and the outsourcing of many manufacturing jobs means the traditional models - a job for life , an ever-increasing standard of living , cradle-to-grave security - are proving unsustainable .
the economy is stuck with anemic growth rates and often hovers just above recession .
economists , business leaders and some politicians have been calling for reform , for more self-responsibility , more flexibility and less government intervention and state support .
unions have resisted those appeals , claiming they hurt workers , and have begun to be seen - depending on which side of the labor and political spectrum one stands - as roadblocks to growth or protectors of the common man .
however , among the political classes , the former category of opinion appears to be in the ascendant .
change , it is a-comin ' ?
the conservative cdu party , led by angela merkel , who is likely to become germany 's next , and first female , chancellor , has said the unions will likely be looking at change if she forms the next government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel she wants to take away some of their most cherished power - that of setting sector-wide wage agreements - and allow staff and management at individual companies to decide if they want to determine their own pay scales .
merkel has said she wants germany to continue to have strong unions , but that they should be more flexible .
" one ca n't say you 're for a strong union and at the same time , erode wage autonomy .
that 's a contradiction , " said hans-joachim schabedoth , head of the policy department of the dgb .
according to him , conservatives are playing a dangerous game in attempting to eviscerate union power .
history has shown , if a government wants to maintain a majority , or its popularity , it has to pay attention to union interests , he said . the current anti-union strategy was going against the best interests of the larger society , he added .
" our role is to ensure that people benefit from their own work and that social questions are considered in the larger economy so that social problems do n't grow , " he said .
" therefore we 're worried about the current state of things . "
overall decline but the role of unions , in the minds of the populace at least , seems to have lost of its importance .
de-unionization has been a phenomenon over the past two decades all over the world .
since the 1980s , the share of wage earners who are also union members has declined in all but a few countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , the trend is the same .
membership of the dgb 's affiliated trade unions dropped by nearly 5 percent in 2004 and is now at just over 7 million .
unions also face the problem of an aging membership , which does not portend well for the future .
membership of young people -lrb- 16-25 -rrb- within the dgb dropped considerably from 15 percent in the early 1980s to about 5 percent today .
that slow decline could be revved up considerably after sunday 's vote , should the center-right and the free-market liberals prove triumphant .
if unions lose their main power position - the setting of sector-wide wage agreements - it could well cause many workers to reconsider their union memberships and spend their dues money elsewhere .
other considerations by merkel & co . , such as loosening job protection laws , liberalizing store opening hours , and rethinking policies on worker participation in company management , if they go through , would also be defeats for unions and could further push them to the periphery of a germany that appears to be embarking on a more free-market course . kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder seeks unions ' support ten days ahead of germany 's general elections , chancellor gerhard schröder made a show of unity with a major trade union boss , brushing aside the repeated clashes that have marked his seven years in power .

bildunterschrift : speaking at the un general assembly , fischer stressed that unsuccessful negotiations so far about expanding the security council should be reopened .
he added that he was hopeful that a watered-down plan adopted by the general assembly to restructure the world body still " leaves the door open " for further progress . " we will continue to work patiently on reform , " the minister told german reporters .
fischer quashed rumors that reform of the un 's highest-ranking body had been put on hold , saying that " the pressure of relationships makes this reform necessary . "
he underlined that the german government was not primarily concerned about getting permanent membership , but rather wanted to bestow more legitimacy on the world body by ensuring that it no longer reflected the world of 1945 but rather that of the 21st century .
opposition from us and china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council has five permanent members - the us , russia , china , france and great britain .
the remaining ten members are elected for a period of two years .
germany has launched a joint bid along with japan , india and brazil for permanent membership .
the group known as " g4 " agreed thursday on the sidelines of the un summit to continue to pursue efforts towards that end .
the g4 had submitted a plan to boost the council 's membership from its current 15 to 25 , with six new permanent seats and four new non-permanent seats .
their first bid ran into opposition from the united states and china and failed to get crucial support from africa for the necessary two-thirds of member countries ' votes in the un general assembly to change the world body 's charter .
fischer 's appeal to reform and expand the security council was lent support by the remaining g4 members on thursday , many of whom appeared optimistic about their chances .
g4 not dead " the g4 exists .
the g4 will continue to work for united nations reform , " indian foreign minister natwar singh said .
singh added that their proposal could be reintroduced at the 60th session of the un general assembly with some changes .
" we are confident that it -lrb- reform -rrb- will happen , " said brazilian foreign minister celso amorim .
japan in particular , made a strong case for the security council to be more inclusive and meet the challenges of a changing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi in a speech to the un world summit , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , fresh off a thumping election victory at home , pleaded the case for change on the security council .
" the world has changed dramatically over the last 60 years .
asia and africa , once under the shackles of colonialism , are now significant players in our global community , " koizumi told other leaders .
" for the last 60 years , japan has determinedly pursued a course of development as a peace-loving nation , making a unique and significant contribution to the peace and prosperity of the world , " he said .
" the composition of the security council must reflect these fundamental changes .
japan is convinced that security council reform is a just cause for the international community - as is the deletion of the long-obsolete ' enemy state ' clauses from the un charter , " koizumi added .
japan was one of the vanquished nations in 1945 , but now has the world 's second-largest economy and is the second-biggest contributor to the un budget .

dw-world summarizes the main points of the race set to end sept .
18 . a process that was riddled with pitfalls when it started in july will come to an end on sunday , when germans decide who will sit in the chancellery for the next four years .
already upset about his coalition 's inability to push through necessary economic and welfare reforms due to constant blockades from the opposition and inner-party bickering , and after suffering damning regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , chancellor gerhard schröder called for a vote of confidence he hoped to - and did - lose , as a way of introducing early elections .
german president horst köhler and the country 's highest court approved the move , deciding that schröder 's ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens did indeed fulfill the necessary legal criteria to dissolve parliament - not having enough of a mandate to run the government effectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler took the entire 21 days allotted to him before deciding to dissolve parliament köhler did his duty " it is my duty as president to decide this issue according to the law , " köhler -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a national television broadcast on july 22 .
" i think it is best to have a new election to let the people decide . "
the decision pleased the majority of german voters and all the major political parties .
since receiving the official thumbs up , the parties ' campaigns have been dominated by their different visions of how to deal with germany 's sluggish economy and high unemployment .
schröder urges voters to stay the course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder insists his reforms have germany on the right track in part , schröder 's unpopular market and labor reforms led to the need for new elections in the first place , but as the campaigning wraps up , he continues to insist that germany has taken the right route .
" we are going in the right direction , " schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- said during his party 's caucus .
" and we need to stay the course . "
like schröder , angela merkel , the opposition christian democratic party 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- chancellor candidate , continues zigzagging across the country holding two rallies a day to win over the voters who could tip the scales in their favor .
rather than speculating on possible coalitions - as one-third of voters are reportedly undecided - merkel has been spending more time in public trying to win votes with sharp criticism of governmental policies that she blames for nearly 5 million unemployed and a budget that continuously breaks european union stability pact rules .
" there is no reason that a re-elected spd parliamentary group would be able to implement new reforms , " she said .
" they may be willing to be in the government , but they are not able . "
union slipping in polls since debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until july , merkel 's party was well ahead of the spd in the polls , at times even enjoying an absolute majority .
but merkel has seen her lead slip away since july , when the cdu revealed plans to increase national sales tax by 2 percent .
the real downturn came after a televised debate between merkel and schröder on sept .
4 , in which the chancellor again proved himself to be both media-savvy and telegenic , while his challenger managed to squeeze through the broadcast without too many glaring gaffes .
since then , schröder has increased his party 's take of the vote to 33 percent and put an end to the newly-formed left party 's double-digit poll results .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's comments did n't give merkel much of a hand with voters unfortunate comments from edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , leader of the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , and runner-up to schröder in the 2002 election , did further damage to the conservatives ' campaign .
stoiber called eastern germans " frustrated " and less capable than the voters in his home state of bavaria .
parties split on reforms merkel 's woes have only been multiplied by paul kirchhof , a potential finance minister who the cdu leader introduced as key to the reforms her government would carry out upon election .
but members of the party base have scorned the heidelberg economics professor , saying his radical changes to germany 's tax code go too far beyond the party platform they have supported .
though the spd 's campaign has not been as turbulent as the cdu / csu 's , it remains to be seen whether schröder can earn enough votes to stay in power and carry through his reform plans , or whether the cdu / csu will get a chance at trying to bring germany back up to speed . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german election enters final phase with five days to before germany elects a new government , both chancellor gerhard schröder and opposition frontrunner angela merkel are confident they can gain a majority and avoid a so-called grand coalition .

dw-world summarizes the main points of the race set to end sept .
18 . a process that was riddled with pitfalls when it started in july will come to an end on sunday , when germans decide who will sit in the chancellery for the next four years .
already upset about his coalition 's inability to push through necessary economic and welfare reforms due to constant blockades from the opposition and inner-party bickering , and after suffering damning regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , chancellor gerhard schröder called for a vote of confidence he hoped to - and did - lose , as a way of introducing early elections .
german president horst köhler and the country 's highest court approved the move , deciding that schröder 's ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens did indeed fulfill the necessary legal criteria to dissolve parliament - not having enough of a mandate to run the government effectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler took the entire 21 days allotted to him before deciding to dissolve parliament köhler did his duty " it is my duty as president to decide this issue according to the law , " köhler -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a national television broadcast on july 22 .
" i think it is best to have a new election to let the people decide . "
the decision pleased the majority of german voters and all the major political parties .
since receiving the official thumbs up , the parties ' campaigns have been dominated by their different visions of how to deal with germany 's sluggish economy and high unemployment .
schröder urges voters to stay the course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder insists his reforms have germany on the right track in part , schröder 's unpopular market and labor reforms led to the need for new elections in the first place , but as the campaigning wraps up , he continues to insist that germany has taken the right route .
" we are going in the right direction , " schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- said during his party 's caucus .
" and we need to stay the course . "
like schröder , angela merkel , the opposition christian democratic party 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- chancellor candidate , continues zigzagging across the country holding two rallies a day to win over the voters who could tip the scales in their favor .
rather than speculating on possible coalitions - as one-third of voters are reportedly undecided - merkel has been spending more time in public trying to win votes with sharp criticism of governmental policies that she blames for nearly 5 million unemployed and a budget that continuously breaks european union stability pact rules .
" there is no reason that a re-elected spd parliamentary group would be able to implement new reforms , " she said .
" they may be willing to be in the government , but they are not able . "
union slipping in polls since debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until july , merkel 's party was well ahead of the spd in the polls , at times even enjoying an absolute majority .
but merkel has seen her lead slip away since july , when the cdu revealed plans to increase national sales tax by 2 percent .
the real downturn came after a televised debate between merkel and schröder on sept .
4 , in which the chancellor again proved himself to be both media-savvy and telegenic , while his challenger managed to squeeze through the broadcast without too many glaring gaffes .
since then , schröder has increased his party 's take of the vote to 33 percent and put an end to the newly-formed left party 's double-digit poll results .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's comments did n't give merkel much of a hand with voters unfortunate comments from edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , leader of the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , and runner-up to schröder in the 2002 election , did further damage to the conservatives ' campaign .
stoiber called eastern germans " frustrated " and less capable than the voters in his home state of bavaria .
parties split on reforms merkel 's woes have only been multiplied by paul kirchhof , a potential finance minister who the cdu leader introduced as key to the reforms her government would carry out upon election .
but members of the party base have scorned the heidelberg economics professor , saying his radical changes to germany 's tax code go too far beyond the party platform they have supported .
though the spd 's campaign has not been as turbulent as the cdu / csu 's , it remains to be seen whether schröder can earn enough votes to stay in power and carry through his reform plans , or whether the cdu / csu will get a chance at trying to bring germany back up to speed . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german election enters final phase with five days to before germany elects a new government , both chancellor gerhard schröder and opposition frontrunner angela merkel are confident they can gain a majority and avoid a so-called grand coalition .

" it 's sensational .

around 7 percent of their german business is now focused on sunday 's election outcome .
conservative leader angela merkel is the overwhelming favorite to oust schröder .
german society has traditionally frowned on gambling .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.09.2005 germany 's unions face decisive moment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionally a force in germany , unions ' power is on the wane many are calling the upcoming vote key to determining germany 's economic future .
it 's just as crucial for the country 's trade unions , which could see their power greatly reduced by a conservative-liberal government . the chairman of germany 's dgb trade union federation , michael sommer , was all smiles as he stood side by side with chancellor gerhard schröder last week at the dgb headquarters .
just months ago , the two would n't even shake each the other 's hand after the bitter recriminations that were thrown from both sides over welfare and labor market reforms put in place by schröder .
at the kiss-and-make-up session , however , sommer was , while not commanding , strongly suggesting that germany 's trade union members vote for schröder and keep the current social democratic-green coalition in power for four more years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer , dgb chairman , right , and chancellor gerhard schröder , left , brief the media following their their talks at the dgb headquarters in berlin .
" it 's about nothing less than determining the future of this society , " sommer said .
in the back of his mind , however , he might have been thinking about the future of germany 's trade union movement , which is looking more uncertain these days , especially if a coalition of angela merkel 's conservative union bloc and the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- form the next government .
while sommer had his problems with his traditional allies - schröder 's social democrats , whose reforms were seen as " socially unjust " - the alternative looks even worse .
in these somewhat desperate times , better to go with the lesser of two evils .
" if the majority of voters vote for the union and the fdp , these parties could attempt to break the back of the unions , like margaret thatcher did in great britain , " sommer told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
and while once unions in the uk were mighty forces , today they are but a shadow of their former selves .
" unions lost that fight -lrb- over reforms -rrb- , " said hagen lesch , an expert on wage policy at the cologne institute for economic research .
" the thinking is to hang on to what they have now . "
traditional force trade unions in germany have traditionally been a powerful force in the labor market .
unions , in often tough negotiations with employers , set wage agreements that apply to entire sectors of the labor market .
in the postwar era , that has translated into regular pay increases for workers , generous holiday and sick-time allowances , and labor conditions that are the envy of much of the world .
bildunterschrift : steelworkers protesting but things have changed on the labor landscape and the once shining reputation of german trade unions is looking tarnished .
the country 's unemployment rate , which has been rising since the 1970s and is now at almost 12 percent , seems impossible to get down .
the pressures of globalization and the outsourcing of many manufacturing jobs means the traditional models - a job for life , an ever-increasing standard of living , cradle-to-grave security - are proving unsustainable .
the economy is stuck with anemic growth rates and often hovers just above recession .
economists , business leaders and some politicians have been calling for reform , for more self-responsibility , more flexibility and less government intervention and state support .
unions have resisted those appeals , claiming they hurt workers , and have begun to be seen - depending on which side of the labor and political spectrum one stands - as roadblocks to growth or protectors of the common man .
however , among the political classes , the former category of opinion appears to be in the ascendant .
change , it is a-comin ' ?
the conservative cdu party , led by angela merkel , who is likely to become germany 's next , and first female , chancellor , has said the unions will likely be looking at change if she forms the next government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel she wants to take away some of their most cherished power - that of setting sector-wide wage agreements - and allow staff and management at individual companies to decide if they want to determine their own pay scales .
merkel has said she wants germany to continue to have strong unions , but that they should be more flexible .
" one ca n't say you 're for a strong union and at the same time , erode wage autonomy .
that 's a contradiction , " said hans-joachim schabedoth , head of the policy department of the dgb .
according to him , conservatives are playing a dangerous game in attempting to eviscerate union power .
history has shown , if a government wants to maintain a majority , or its popularity , it has to pay attention to union interests , he said . the current anti-union strategy was going against the best interests of the larger society , he added .
" our role is to ensure that people benefit from their own work and that social questions are considered in the larger economy so that social problems do n't grow , " he said .
" therefore we 're worried about the current state of things . "
overall decline but the role of unions , in the minds of the populace at least , seems to have lost of its importance .
de-unionization has been a phenomenon over the past two decades all over the world .
since the 1980s , the share of wage earners who are also union members has declined in all but a few countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , the trend is the same .
membership of the dgb 's affiliated trade unions dropped by nearly 5 percent in 2004 and is now at just over 7 million .
unions also face the problem of an aging membership , which does not portend well for the future .
membership of young people -lrb- 16-25 -rrb- within the dgb dropped considerably from 15 percent in the early 1980s to about 5 percent today .
that slow decline could be revved up considerably after sunday 's vote , should the center-right and the free-market liberals prove triumphant .
if unions lose their main power position - the setting of sector-wide wage agreements - it could well cause many workers to reconsider their union memberships and spend their dues money elsewhere .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.09.2005 germany 's unions face decisive moment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionally a force in germany , unions ' power is on the wane many are calling the upcoming vote key to determining germany 's economic future .
it 's just as crucial for the country 's trade unions , which could see their power greatly reduced by a conservative-liberal government . the chairman of germany 's dgb trade union federation , michael sommer , was all smiles as he stood side by side with chancellor gerhard schröder last week at the dgb headquarters .
just months ago , the two would n't even shake each the other 's hand after the bitter recriminations that were thrown from both sides over welfare and labor market reforms put in place by schröder .
at the kiss-and-make-up session , however , sommer was , while not commanding , strongly suggesting that germany 's trade union members vote for schröder and keep the current social democratic-green coalition in power for four more years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer , dgb chairman , right , and chancellor gerhard schröder , left , brief the media following their their talks at the dgb headquarters in berlin .
" it 's about nothing less than determining the future of this society , " sommer said .
in the back of his mind , however , he might have been thinking about the future of germany 's trade union movement , which is looking more uncertain these days , especially if a coalition of angela merkel 's conservative union bloc and the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- form the next government .
while sommer had his problems with his traditional allies - schröder 's social democrats , whose reforms were seen as " socially unjust " - the alternative looks even worse .
in these somewhat desperate times , better to go with the lesser of two evils .
" if the majority of voters vote for the union and the fdp , these parties could attempt to break the back of the unions , like margaret thatcher did in great britain , " sommer told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
and while once unions in the uk were mighty forces , today they are but a shadow of their former selves .
" unions lost that fight -lrb- over reforms -rrb- , " said hagen lesch , an expert on wage policy at the cologne institute for economic research .
" the thinking is to hang on to what they have now . "
traditional force trade unions in germany have traditionally been a powerful force in the labor market .
unions , in often tough negotiations with employers , set wage agreements that apply to entire sectors of the labor market .
in the postwar era , that has translated into regular pay increases for workers , generous holiday and sick-time allowances , and labor conditions that are the envy of much of the world .
bildunterschrift : steelworkers protesting but things have changed on the labor landscape and the once shining reputation of german trade unions is looking tarnished .
the country 's unemployment rate , which has been rising since the 1970s and is now at almost 12 percent , seems impossible to get down .
the pressures of globalization and the outsourcing of many manufacturing jobs means the traditional models - a job for life , an ever-increasing standard of living , cradle-to-grave security - are proving unsustainable .
the economy is stuck with anemic growth rates and often hovers just above recession .
economists , business leaders and some politicians have been calling for reform , for more self-responsibility , more flexibility and less government intervention and state support .
unions have resisted those appeals , claiming they hurt workers , and have begun to be seen - depending on which side of the labor and political spectrum one stands - as roadblocks to growth or protectors of the common man .
however , among the political classes , the former category of opinion appears to be in the ascendant .
change , it is a-comin ' ?
the conservative cdu party , led by angela merkel , who is likely to become germany 's next , and first female , chancellor , has said the unions will likely be looking at change if she forms the next government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel she wants to take away some of their most cherished power - that of setting sector-wide wage agreements - and allow staff and management at individual companies to decide if they want to determine their own pay scales .
merkel has said she wants germany to continue to have strong unions , but that they should be more flexible .
" one ca n't say you 're for a strong union and at the same time , erode wage autonomy .
that 's a contradiction , " said hans-joachim schabedoth , head of the policy department of the dgb .
according to him , conservatives are playing a dangerous game in attempting to eviscerate union power .
history has shown , if a government wants to maintain a majority , or its popularity , it has to pay attention to union interests , he said . the current anti-union strategy was going against the best interests of the larger society , he added .
" our role is to ensure that people benefit from their own work and that social questions are considered in the larger economy so that social problems do n't grow , " he said .
" therefore we 're worried about the current state of things . "
overall decline but the role of unions , in the minds of the populace at least , seems to have lost of its importance .
de-unionization has been a phenomenon over the past two decades all over the world .
since the 1980s , the share of wage earners who are also union members has declined in all but a few countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , the trend is the same .
membership of the dgb 's affiliated trade unions dropped by nearly 5 percent in 2004 and is now at just over 7 million .
unions also face the problem of an aging membership , which does not portend well for the future .
membership of young people -lrb- 16-25 -rrb- within the dgb dropped considerably from 15 percent in the early 1980s to about 5 percent today .
that slow decline could be revved up considerably after sunday 's vote , should the center-right and the free-market liberals prove triumphant .
if unions lose their main power position - the setting of sector-wide wage agreements - it could well cause many workers to reconsider their union memberships and spend their dues money elsewhere .
other considerations by merkel & co . , such as loosening job protection laws , liberalizing store opening hours , and rethinking policies on worker participation in company management , if they go through , would also be defeats for unions and could further push them to the periphery of a germany that appears to be embarking on a more free-market course . kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder seeks unions ' support ten days ahead of germany 's general elections , chancellor gerhard schröder made a show of unity with a major trade union boss , brushing aside the repeated clashes that have marked his seven years in power .

bildunterschrift : speaking at the un general assembly , fischer stressed that unsuccessful negotiations so far about expanding the security council should be reopened .
he added that he was hopeful that a watered-down plan adopted by the general assembly to restructure the world body still " leaves the door open " for further progress . " we will continue to work patiently on reform , " the minister told german reporters .
fischer quashed rumors that reform of the un 's highest-ranking body had been put on hold , saying that " the pressure of relationships makes this reform necessary . "
he underlined that the german government was not primarily concerned about getting permanent membership , but rather wanted to bestow more legitimacy on the world body by ensuring that it no longer reflected the world of 1945 but rather that of the 21st century .
opposition from us and china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council has five permanent members - the us , russia , china , france and great britain .
the remaining ten members are elected for a period of two years .
germany has launched a joint bid along with japan , india and brazil for permanent membership .
the group known as " g4 " agreed thursday on the sidelines of the un summit to continue to pursue efforts towards that end .
the g4 had submitted a plan to boost the council 's membership from its current 15 to 25 , with six new permanent seats and four new non-permanent seats .
their first bid ran into opposition from the united states and china and failed to get crucial support from africa for the necessary two-thirds of member countries ' votes in the un general assembly to change the world body 's charter .
fischer 's appeal to reform and expand the security council was lent support by the remaining g4 members on thursday , many of whom appeared optimistic about their chances .
g4 not dead " the g4 exists .
the g4 will continue to work for united nations reform , " indian foreign minister natwar singh said .
singh added that their proposal could be reintroduced at the 60th session of the un general assembly with some changes .
" we are confident that it -lrb- reform -rrb- will happen , " said brazilian foreign minister celso amorim .
japan in particular , made a strong case for the security council to be more inclusive and meet the challenges of a changing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi in a speech to the un world summit , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , fresh off a thumping election victory at home , pleaded the case for change on the security council .
" the world has changed dramatically over the last 60 years .
asia and africa , once under the shackles of colonialism , are now significant players in our global community , " koizumi told other leaders .
" for the last 60 years , japan has determinedly pursued a course of development as a peace-loving nation , making a unique and significant contribution to the peace and prosperity of the world , " he said .
" the composition of the security council must reflect these fundamental changes .
japan is convinced that security council reform is a just cause for the international community - as is the deletion of the long-obsolete ' enemy state ' clauses from the un charter , " koizumi added .
japan was one of the vanquished nations in 1945 , but now has the world 's second-largest economy and is the second-biggest contributor to the un budget .
germany has made a similar case as europe 's biggest economy .

" the moon is the next worthy goal , " said astronaut manfred messerschmid during the symposium , adding that the celestial body is only 1,000 hours away from the earth , unlike mars which takes a 1,000 days to reach .

they said in a statement that a gigantic long wave radio telescope would be installed on the back of the moon by 2015 to research a completely unknown side of the universe .
the aerospace firms added that they hoped the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- would shoulder the costs of the project which is estimated at around 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- .

that 's too late for the scientists , researchers and industry representatives assembled in bremen on thursday , who stressed that europe had to do more , and quickly , in space research if it wanted to keep up with other nations .
manfred fuchs , head of the bremen-based aerospace company ohb said that other countries had long been involved in missions to the moon .
he criticized the fact that the issue unfortunately " is n't the first priority " in europe and warned that germany , as the biggest country in europe , could n't afford to sit back while countries such as the us , russia , japan , china and india planned and realized their own space programs .
money the biggest problem most scientists and industry representatives admitted that the biggest stumbling block to european aerospace research is the paucity of funds .
evert dudok , president of eads space transportation , said that a central problem in germany was the slim budget for space research .
that amount plus the funds germany receives from esa add up to just about 700 million euros , dudok pointed out and added that the budget for this year had already been completely allocated .

messerschmidt said that the german research ministry 's budget allocation for space research had already fallen to 11 percent from 20 percent .
" we have to stop this process , " messerschmit said .

" the moon is the next worthy goal , " said astronaut manfred messerschmid during the symposium , adding that the celestial body is only 1,000 hours away from the earth , unlike mars which takes a 1,000 days to reach .
the companies also urged the creation of an unmanned european research station on the moon .
they said in a statement that a gigantic long wave radio telescope would be installed on the back of the moon by 2015 to research a completely unknown side of the universe .
the aerospace firms added that they hoped the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- would shoulder the costs of the project which is estimated at around 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- .
esa , which is headquartered in paris , is expected to debate the issue during its next conference , in december .
europe could lag in space exploration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa 's aurora mission will explore the solar system esa 's aurora project , which began in 2001 , does include plans for a manned mars mission as well as a manned mission to the moon .
esa wants to head to mars and the moon , but not before 2033 and 2024 respectively .
that 's too late for the scientists , researchers and industry representatives assembled in bremen on thursday , who stressed that europe had to do more , and quickly , in space research if it wanted to keep up with other nations .
manfred fuchs , head of the bremen-based aerospace company ohb said that other countries had long been involved in missions to the moon .
he criticized the fact that the issue unfortunately " is n't the first priority " in europe and warned that germany , as the biggest country in europe , could n't afford to sit back while countries such as the us , russia , japan , china and india planned and realized their own space programs .
money the biggest problem most scientists and industry representatives admitted that the biggest stumbling block to european aerospace research is the paucity of funds .
evert dudok , president of eads space transportation , said that a central problem in germany was the slim budget for space research .
that amount plus the funds germany receives from esa add up to just about 700 million euros , dudok pointed out and added that the budget for this year had already been completely allocated .
" we demand a raise of 15 percent or 100 million euros to finally get some leeway , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of the esa landing unit ' huygens ' -lrb- left -rrb- separating from the ' cassini ' orbiter as the spacecraft advances titan , saturn 's biggest moon both eads space transportation and ohb as well astronaut ernst messerschmidt have appealed to the german government for support and more funds .
messerschmidt said that the german research ministry 's budget allocation for space research had already fallen to 11 percent from 20 percent .
" we have to stop this process , " messerschmit said .
manfred fuchs pointed out that nations like japan had already massively increased their space research budgets .
however , a spokesman for the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- was skeptical of the ambitious plans of aerospace industry representatives .
he told spiegel online that the " big goal " of the dlr remained the international space station iss and the docking of the european space research module colombus .
a " quantum leap " aerospace industry experts for now have pinned their hopes on a more realistic goal : building a giant radio telescope on the moon by 2015 , which in dudok 's words would bring a " quantum leap for radio astronomy . "
eads space transportation is already working with dutch researchers on the telescope .
the apparatus , which will be transported with the help of a ariane 5 rocket , will consist of 100 small antennae and will cover an initial radius of 300 meters , if all goes according to plan .

bildunterschrift : speaking at the un general assembly , fischer stressed that unsuccessful negotiations so far about expanding the security council should be reopened .
he added that he was hopeful that a watered-down plan adopted by the general assembly to restructure the world body still " leaves the door open " for further progress . " we will continue to work patiently on reform , " the minister told german reporters .
fischer quashed rumors that reform of the un 's highest-ranking body had been put on hold , saying that " the pressure of relationships makes this reform necessary . "
he underlined that the german government was not primarily concerned about getting permanent membership , but rather wanted to bestow more legitimacy on the world body by ensuring that it no longer reflected the world of 1945 but rather that of the 21st century .
opposition from us and china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council has five permanent members - the us , russia , china , france and great britain .
the remaining ten members are elected for a period of two years .
germany has launched a joint bid along with japan , india and brazil for permanent membership .
the group known as " g4 " agreed thursday on the sidelines of the un summit to continue to pursue efforts towards that end .
the g4 had submitted a plan to boost the council 's membership from its current 15 to 25 , with six new permanent seats and four new non-permanent seats .
their first bid ran into opposition from the united states and china and failed to get crucial support from africa for the necessary two-thirds of member countries ' votes in the un general assembly to change the world body 's charter .
fischer 's appeal to reform and expand the security council was lent support by the remaining g4 members on thursday , many of whom appeared optimistic about their chances .
g4 not dead " the g4 exists .
the g4 will continue to work for united nations reform , " indian foreign minister natwar singh said .
singh added that their proposal could be reintroduced at the 60th session of the un general assembly with some changes .
" we are confident that it -lrb- reform -rrb- will happen , " said brazilian foreign minister celso amorim .
japan in particular , made a strong case for the security council to be more inclusive and meet the challenges of a changing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi in a speech to the un world summit , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , fresh off a thumping election victory at home , pleaded the case for change on the security council .
" the world has changed dramatically over the last 60 years .
asia and africa , once under the shackles of colonialism , are now significant players in our global community , " koizumi told other leaders .
" for the last 60 years , japan has determinedly pursued a course of development as a peace-loving nation , making a unique and significant contribution to the peace and prosperity of the world , " he said .
" the composition of the security council must reflect these fundamental changes .
japan is convinced that security council reform is a just cause for the international community - as is the deletion of the long-obsolete ' enemy state ' clauses from the un charter , " koizumi added .
japan was one of the vanquished nations in 1945 , but now has the world 's second-largest economy and is the second-biggest contributor to the un budget .
germany has made a similar case as europe 's biggest economy .

" we had a very thorough exchange of the different positions of the eu-3 and the new government of iran , " british foreign secretary jack straw told reporters after the 80-minute session with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said the ministers had a " very frank discussion " in the first talks between iran and the so-called eu-3 since a may 25 session in geneva . meeting with new president the ministers later sat down with iran 's new president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who planned to unveil what tehran called new proposals to resolve the standoff , in a speech in new york saturday .

" the meeting of the ambassadors is over .
there has not been any major shift in the countries ' positions , " one diplomat told reuters .
the eu 's british presidency , which has been trying to resolve the issue for weeks , has conceded that it may have to call a special meeting of eu foreign ministers , possibly on sept .
26 , an agreement can not be reached soon .
still hope for a deal but a presidency spokesman tried to sound upbeat after the ambassadors met .
" it was a good discussion .
considerable progress was made and we hope to reach an agreement soon , " he said .
" we remain hopeful that we wo n't have to drag the ministers to brussels . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has been unwilling to recognize the nikosia government turkey drew criticism in july when , while signing a protocol extending a customs accord with the eu to the bloc 's 10 newest states - including cyprus - it simultaneously declared this did not amount to a recognition of the nicosia government .
the eu ministers are seeking agreement on a " counter-declaration , " but differences over how strongly it should press ankara to recognize the island member state have so far prevented an accord .
cyprus , which gained independence from britain in 1960 , has struggled to emerge from its three-decade-long division into predominantly greek-cypriot and turkish-cypriot sectors .
the island has been split since 1974 when the turkish military occupied the northern third in response to a greek-inspired coup .
turkey supports the turkish cypriot breakaway state in the north of the mediterranean island , while cyprus 's greek cypriot government represents the whole island in the eu .
british-french agreement fails earlier this week , britain and france sought support for a compromise stating that turkey should recognize cyprus before joining , but that failed to win enough backing when the ambassadors first met on wednesday .
the latest draft for the friday meeting , seen by afp , contained a paragraph proposing that the eu tell ankara that " prior recognition of all member states is a necessary component of accession . "
without providing additional details , an eu diplomat said that cyprus , its closest ally greece as well as the czech republic had refused to accept the wording .
cyprus previously stated it wanted the eu to create deadlines for turkey to fulfill in its process of recognizing the mediterranean island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus wants access to turkish ports and airports cyprus wants access to turkish ports the draft also warned that failure by turkey to fully implement the ankara accord - notably by allowing cypriot ships and planes to use its ports and airports - will slow down the pace of membership talks .
" failure to implement its obligations in full will affect the overall progress in the negotiations , " the draft said .
the eu diplomat said that this warning " was acceptable to all member states . "
while the eu debates what position to take , ankara has grown increasingly impatient , with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan accusing the bloc of " rude " diplomatic conduct for placing new conditions on its bid to become a member .
turkey said it would recognize cyprus only after a broad international agreement , possibly sponsored by the united nations , to end the division of the island .
ankara argues that although it occupied the northern part of the island in 1974 to protect the turkish population following a pro-greek coup , it is not responsible for the continuing division of cyprus . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de uk and france mull deal on turkey standoff britain and france have agreed that turkey must recognize cyprus before joining the european union , as a possible compromise to clear the way for accession talks next month , according to diplomatic sources .

" the meeting of the ambassadors is over .
there has not been any major shift in the countries ' positions , " one diplomat told reuters .
the eu 's british presidency , which has been trying to resolve the issue for weeks , has conceded that it may have to call a special meeting of eu foreign ministers , possibly on sept .
26 , an agreement can not be reached soon .
still hope for a deal but a presidency spokesman tried to sound upbeat after the ambassadors met .
" it was a good discussion .
considerable progress was made and we hope to reach an agreement soon , " he said .
" we remain hopeful that we wo n't have to drag the ministers to brussels . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has been unwilling to recognize the nikosia government turkey drew criticism in july when , while signing a protocol extending a customs accord with the eu to the bloc 's 10 newest states - including cyprus - it simultaneously declared this did not amount to a recognition of the nicosia government .
the eu ministers are seeking agreement on a " counter-declaration , " but differences over how strongly it should press ankara to recognize the island member state have so far prevented an accord .
cyprus , which gained independence from britain in 1960 , has struggled to emerge from its three-decade-long division into predominantly greek-cypriot and turkish-cypriot sectors .
the island has been split since 1974 when the turkish military occupied the northern third in response to a greek-inspired coup .
turkey supports the turkish cypriot breakaway state in the north of the mediterranean island , while cyprus 's greek cypriot government represents the whole island in the eu .
british-french agreement fails earlier this week , britain and france sought support for a compromise stating that turkey should recognize cyprus before joining , but that failed to win enough backing when the ambassadors first met on wednesday .
the latest draft for the friday meeting , seen by afp , contained a paragraph proposing that the eu tell ankara that " prior recognition of all member states is a necessary component of accession . "
without providing additional details , an eu diplomat said that cyprus , its closest ally greece as well as the czech republic had refused to accept the wording .
cyprus previously stated it wanted the eu to create deadlines for turkey to fulfill in its process of recognizing the mediterranean island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus wants access to turkish ports and airports cyprus wants access to turkish ports the draft also warned that failure by turkey to fully implement the ankara accord - notably by allowing cypriot ships and planes to use its ports and airports - will slow down the pace of membership talks .
" failure to implement its obligations in full will affect the overall progress in the negotiations , " the draft said .
the eu diplomat said that this warning " was acceptable to all member states . "
while the eu debates what position to take , ankara has grown increasingly impatient , with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan accusing the bloc of " rude " diplomatic conduct for placing new conditions on its bid to become a member .
turkey said it would recognize cyprus only after a broad international agreement , possibly sponsored by the united nations , to end the division of the island .
ankara argues that although it occupied the northern part of the island in 1974 to protect the turkish population following a pro-greek coup , it is not responsible for the continuing division of cyprus . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de uk and france mull deal on turkey standoff britain and france have agreed that turkey must recognize cyprus before joining the european union , as a possible compromise to clear the way for accession talks next month , according to diplomatic sources .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 16.09.2005 highlights of a short election campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder and angela merkel on all channels starting with chancellor schröder 's call for a no-confidence vote in june , the german electorate has faced an intense summer of campaigning .
dw-world summarizes the main points of the race set to end sept .
18 . a process that was riddled with pitfalls when it started in july will come to an end on sunday , when germans decide who will sit in the chancellery for the next four years .
already upset about his coalition 's inability to push through necessary economic and welfare reforms due to constant blockades from the opposition and inner-party bickering , and after suffering damning regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , chancellor gerhard schröder called for a vote of confidence he hoped to - and did - lose , as a way of introducing early elections .
german president horst köhler and the country 's highest court approved the move , deciding that schröder 's ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens did indeed fulfill the necessary legal criteria to dissolve parliament - not having enough of a mandate to run the government effectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler took the entire 21 days allotted to him before deciding to dissolve parliament köhler did his duty " it is my duty as president to decide this issue according to the law , " köhler -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a national television broadcast on july 22 .
" i think it is best to have a new election to let the people decide . "
the decision pleased the majority of german voters and all the major political parties .
since receiving the official thumbs up , the parties ' campaigns have been dominated by their different visions of how to deal with germany 's sluggish economy and high unemployment .
schröder urges voters to stay the course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder insists his reforms have germany on the right track in part , schröder 's unpopular market and labor reforms led to the need for new elections in the first place , but as the campaigning wraps up , he continues to insist that germany has taken the right route .
" we are going in the right direction , " schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- said during his party 's caucus .
" and we need to stay the course . "
like schröder , angela merkel , the opposition christian democratic party 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- chancellor candidate , continues zigzagging across the country holding two rallies a day to win over the voters who could tip the scales in their favor .
rather than speculating on possible coalitions - as one-third of voters are reportedly undecided - merkel has been spending more time in public trying to win votes with sharp criticism of governmental policies that she blames for nearly 5 million unemployed and a budget that continuously breaks european union stability pact rules .
" there is no reason that a re-elected spd parliamentary group would be able to implement new reforms , " she said .
" they may be willing to be in the government , but they are not able . "
union slipping in polls since debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until july , merkel 's party was well ahead of the spd in the polls , at times even enjoying an absolute majority .
but merkel has seen her lead slip away since july , when the cdu revealed plans to increase national sales tax by 2 percent .
the real downturn came after a televised debate between merkel and schröder on sept .
4 , in which the chancellor again proved himself to be both media-savvy and telegenic , while his challenger managed to squeeze through the broadcast without too many glaring gaffes .
since then , schröder has increased his party 's take of the vote to 33 percent and put an end to the newly-formed left party 's double-digit poll results .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's comments did n't give merkel much of a hand with voters unfortunate comments from edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , leader of the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , and runner-up to schröder in the 2002 election , did further damage to the conservatives ' campaign .
stoiber called eastern germans " frustrated " and less capable than the voters in his home state of bavaria .
parties split on reforms merkel 's woes have only been multiplied by paul kirchhof , a potential finance minister who the cdu leader introduced as key to the reforms her government would carry out upon election .
but members of the party base have scorned the heidelberg economics professor , saying his radical changes to germany 's tax code go too far beyond the party platform they have supported .
though the spd 's campaign has not been as turbulent as the cdu / csu 's , it remains to be seen whether schröder can earn enough votes to stay in power and carry through his reform plans , or whether the cdu / csu will get a chance at trying to bring germany back up to speed . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german election enters final phase with five days to before germany elects a new government , both chancellor gerhard schröder and opposition frontrunner angela merkel are confident they can gain a majority and avoid a so-called grand coalition .
-lrb- sept .
13 , 2005 -rrb- the road to the chancellery dw-world looks back on the issues and rhetoric that have fueled germany 's approaching elections .

the relatives of bavarian king ludwig ii are resigned to the fact that they have a colorful legacy to look back on , but a descendant of the king 's stable master does n't want anyone to pass that legacy onto his forebear . king ludwig ii -lrb- 1845-86 -rrb- , who was rumored to have been a good-looking man with an excellent reputation among his subjects , was known to keep a diary that documented his difficulties reconciling his catholic faith and his sexual desires .
indeed , many people suspected him of overly-friendly relationships with his male servants - especially the head of the stables .
the relationship was so well-known that it made its way into a song in alfred wolfsteiner 's book , geschichte in liedern : eine zeitreise durch die oberpfalz -lrb- history in song : a trip in time through the upper palatinate -rrb- , which alludes to a homosexual relationship between the ludwig and the stable master .

" it injures his reputation and is an insult .
i 'm not going to let that happen . " he said , according to berlin 's tabloid bz . " if it remain uncontested , it could be seen as a confirmation . "

" the meeting of the ambassadors is over .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has been unwilling to recognize the nikosia government turkey drew criticism in july when , while signing a protocol extending a customs accord with the eu to the bloc 's 10 newest states - including cyprus - it simultaneously declared this did not amount to a recognition of the nicosia government .
the eu ministers are seeking agreement on a " counter-declaration , " but differences over how strongly it should press ankara to recognize the island member state have so far prevented an accord .
cyprus , which gained independence from britain in 1960 , has struggled to emerge from its three-decade-long division into predominantly greek-cypriot and turkish-cypriot sectors .
the island has been split since 1974 when the turkish military occupied the northern third in response to a greek-inspired coup .
turkey supports the turkish cypriot breakaway state in the north of the mediterranean island , while cyprus 's greek cypriot government represents the whole island in the eu .
british-french agreement fails earlier this week , britain and france sought support for a compromise stating that turkey should recognize cyprus before joining , but that failed to win enough backing when the ambassadors first met on wednesday .
the latest draft for the friday meeting , seen by afp , contained a paragraph proposing that the eu tell ankara that " prior recognition of all member states is a necessary component of accession . "
without providing additional details , an eu diplomat said that cyprus , its closest ally greece as well as the czech republic had refused to accept the wording .
cyprus previously stated it wanted the eu to create deadlines for turkey to fulfill in its process of recognizing the mediterranean island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus wants access to turkish ports and airports cyprus wants access to turkish ports the draft also warned that failure by turkey to fully implement the ankara accord - notably by allowing cypriot ships and planes to use its ports and airports - will slow down the pace of membership talks .
" failure to implement its obligations in full will affect the overall progress in the negotiations , " the draft said .
the eu diplomat said that this warning " was acceptable to all member states . "
while the eu debates what position to take , ankara has grown increasingly impatient , with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan accusing the bloc of " rude " diplomatic conduct for placing new conditions on its bid to become a member .
turkey said it would recognize cyprus only after a broad international agreement , possibly sponsored by the united nations , to end the division of the island .
ankara argues that although it occupied the northern part of the island in 1974 to protect the turkish population following a pro-greek coup , it is not responsible for the continuing division of cyprus . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de uk and france mull deal on turkey standoff britain and france have agreed that turkey must recognize cyprus before joining the european union , as a possible compromise to clear the way for accession talks next month , according to diplomatic sources .

" the moon is the next worthy goal , " said astronaut manfred messerschmid during the symposium , adding that the celestial body is only 1,000 hours away from the earth , unlike mars which takes a 1,000 days to reach .
the companies also urged the creation of an unmanned european research station on the moon .
they said in a statement that a gigantic long wave radio telescope would be installed on the back of the moon by 2015 to research a completely unknown side of the universe .
the aerospace firms added that they hoped the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- would shoulder the costs of the project which is estimated at around 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- .
esa , which is headquartered in paris , is expected to debate the issue during its next conference , in december .
europe could lag in space exploration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa 's aurora mission will explore the solar system esa 's aurora project , which began in 2001 , does include plans for a manned mars mission as well as a manned mission to the moon .
esa wants to head to mars and the moon , but not before 2033 and 2024 respectively .
that 's too late for the scientists , researchers and industry representatives assembled in bremen on thursday , who stressed that europe had to do more , and quickly , in space research if it wanted to keep up with other nations .
manfred fuchs , head of the bremen-based aerospace company ohb said that other countries had long been involved in missions to the moon .
he criticized the fact that the issue unfortunately " is n't the first priority " in europe and warned that germany , as the biggest country in europe , could n't afford to sit back while countries such as the us , russia , japan , china and india planned and realized their own space programs .
money the biggest problem most scientists and industry representatives admitted that the biggest stumbling block to european aerospace research is the paucity of funds .
evert dudok , president of eads space transportation , said that a central problem in germany was the slim budget for space research .
that amount plus the funds germany receives from esa add up to just about 700 million euros , dudok pointed out and added that the budget for this year had already been completely allocated .
" we demand a raise of 15 percent or 100 million euros to finally get some leeway , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of the esa landing unit ' huygens ' -lrb- left -rrb- separating from the ' cassini ' orbiter as the spacecraft advances titan , saturn 's biggest moon both eads space transportation and ohb as well astronaut ernst messerschmidt have appealed to the german government for support and more funds .
messerschmidt said that the german research ministry 's budget allocation for space research had already fallen to 11 percent from 20 percent .
" we have to stop this process , " messerschmit said .
manfred fuchs pointed out that nations like japan had already massively increased their space research budgets .
however , a spokesman for the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- was skeptical of the ambitious plans of aerospace industry representatives .
he told spiegel online that the " big goal " of the dlr remained the international space station iss and the docking of the european space research module colombus .
a " quantum leap " aerospace industry experts for now have pinned their hopes on a more realistic goal : building a giant radio telescope on the moon by 2015 , which in dudok 's words would bring a " quantum leap for radio astronomy . "
eads space transportation is already working with dutch researchers on the telescope .
the apparatus , which will be transported with the help of a ariane 5 rocket , will consist of 100 small antennae and will cover an initial radius of 300 meters , if all goes according to plan .

dw-world summarizes the main points of the race set to end sept .
18 . a process that was riddled with pitfalls when it started in july will come to an end on sunday , when germans decide who will sit in the chancellery for the next four years .
already upset about his coalition 's inability to push through necessary economic and welfare reforms due to constant blockades from the opposition and inner-party bickering , and after suffering damning regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , chancellor gerhard schröder called for a vote of confidence he hoped to - and did - lose , as a way of introducing early elections .
german president horst köhler and the country 's highest court approved the move , deciding that schröder 's ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens did indeed fulfill the necessary legal criteria to dissolve parliament - not having enough of a mandate to run the government effectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler took the entire 21 days allotted to him before deciding to dissolve parliament köhler did his duty " it is my duty as president to decide this issue according to the law , " köhler -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a national television broadcast on july 22 .
" i think it is best to have a new election to let the people decide . "
the decision pleased the majority of german voters and all the major political parties .
since receiving the official thumbs up , the parties ' campaigns have been dominated by their different visions of how to deal with germany 's sluggish economy and high unemployment .
schröder urges voters to stay the course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder insists his reforms have germany on the right track in part , schröder 's unpopular market and labor reforms led to the need for new elections in the first place , but as the campaigning wraps up , he continues to insist that germany has taken the right route .
" we are going in the right direction , " schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- said during his party 's caucus .
" and we need to stay the course . "
like schröder , angela merkel , the opposition christian democratic party 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- chancellor candidate , continues zigzagging across the country holding two rallies a day to win over the voters who could tip the scales in their favor .
rather than speculating on possible coalitions - as one-third of voters are reportedly undecided - merkel has been spending more time in public trying to win votes with sharp criticism of governmental policies that she blames for nearly 5 million unemployed and a budget that continuously breaks european union stability pact rules .
" there is no reason that a re-elected spd parliamentary group would be able to implement new reforms , " she said .
" they may be willing to be in the government , but they are not able . "
union slipping in polls since debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until july , merkel 's party was well ahead of the spd in the polls , at times even enjoying an absolute majority .
but merkel has seen her lead slip away since july , when the cdu revealed plans to increase national sales tax by 2 percent .
the real downturn came after a televised debate between merkel and schröder on sept .
4 , in which the chancellor again proved himself to be both media-savvy and telegenic , while his challenger managed to squeeze through the broadcast without too many glaring gaffes .
since then , schröder has increased his party 's take of the vote to 33 percent and put an end to the newly-formed left party 's double-digit poll results .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's comments did n't give merkel much of a hand with voters unfortunate comments from edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , leader of the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , and runner-up to schröder in the 2002 election , did further damage to the conservatives ' campaign .
stoiber called eastern germans " frustrated " and less capable than the voters in his home state of bavaria .
parties split on reforms merkel 's woes have only been multiplied by paul kirchhof , a potential finance minister who the cdu leader introduced as key to the reforms her government would carry out upon election .
but members of the party base have scorned the heidelberg economics professor , saying his radical changes to germany 's tax code go too far beyond the party platform they have supported .
though the spd 's campaign has not been as turbulent as the cdu / csu 's , it remains to be seen whether schröder can earn enough votes to stay in power and carry through his reform plans , or whether the cdu / csu will get a chance at trying to bring germany back up to speed . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german election enters final phase with five days to before germany elects a new government , both chancellor gerhard schröder and opposition frontrunner angela merkel are confident they can gain a majority and avoid a so-called grand coalition .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has been unwilling to recognize the nikosia government turkey drew criticism in july when , while signing a protocol extending a customs accord with the eu to the bloc 's 10 newest states - including cyprus - it simultaneously declared this did not amount to a recognition of the nicosia government .
the eu ministers are seeking agreement on a " counter-declaration , " but differences over how strongly it should press ankara to recognize the island member state have so far prevented an accord .
cyprus , which gained independence from britain in 1960 , has struggled to emerge from its three-decade-long division into predominantly greek-cypriot and turkish-cypriot sectors .
the island has been split since 1974 when the turkish military occupied the northern third in response to a greek-inspired coup .
turkey supports the turkish cypriot breakaway state in the north of the mediterranean island , while cyprus 's greek cypriot government represents the whole island in the eu .
british-french agreement fails earlier this week , britain and france sought support for a compromise stating that turkey should recognize cyprus before joining , but that failed to win enough backing when the ambassadors first met on wednesday .
the latest draft for the friday meeting , seen by afp , contained a paragraph proposing that the eu tell ankara that " prior recognition of all member states is a necessary component of accession . "
without providing additional details , an eu diplomat said that cyprus , its closest ally greece as well as the czech republic had refused to accept the wording .
cyprus previously stated it wanted the eu to create deadlines for turkey to fulfill in its process of recognizing the mediterranean island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus wants access to turkish ports and airports cyprus wants access to turkish ports the draft also warned that failure by turkey to fully implement the ankara accord - notably by allowing cypriot ships and planes to use its ports and airports - will slow down the pace of membership talks .
" failure to implement its obligations in full will affect the overall progress in the negotiations , " the draft said .
the eu diplomat said that this warning " was acceptable to all member states . "
while the eu debates what position to take , ankara has grown increasingly impatient , with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan accusing the bloc of " rude " diplomatic conduct for placing new conditions on its bid to become a member .
turkey said it would recognize cyprus only after a broad international agreement , possibly sponsored by the united nations , to end the division of the island .
ankara argues that although it occupied the northern part of the island in 1974 to protect the turkish population following a pro-greek coup , it is not responsible for the continuing division of cyprus . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de uk and france mull deal on turkey standoff britain and france have agreed that turkey must recognize cyprus before joining the european union , as a possible compromise to clear the way for accession talks next month , according to diplomatic sources .

the relatives of bavarian king ludwig ii are resigned to the fact that they have a colorful legacy to look back on , but a descendant of the king 's stable master does n't want anyone to pass that legacy onto his forebear . king ludwig ii -lrb- 1845-86 -rrb- , who was rumored to have been a good-looking man with an excellent reputation among his subjects , was known to keep a diary that documented his difficulties reconciling his catholic faith and his sexual desires .
indeed , many people suspected him of overly-friendly relationships with his male servants - especially the head of the stables .
the relationship was so well-known that it made its way into a song in alfred wolfsteiner 's book , geschichte in liedern : eine zeitreise durch die oberpfalz -lrb- history in song : a trip in time through the upper palatinate -rrb- , which alludes to a homosexual relationship between the ludwig and the stable master .

" it injures his reputation and is an insult .
i 'm not going to let that happen . " he said , according to berlin 's tabloid bz . " if it remain uncontested , it could be seen as a confirmation . "

washington is watching sunday 's election and , secretly , hoping for a merkel victory .
but the promise of better relations is off-set by areas of potential dispute . should conservative angela merkel sweep to victory in sunday 's elections , it could mean a fresh start for strained us-german relations , according to analysts . after dipping to new lows under chancellor gerhard schröder and his center-left coalition , with differences over iraq and the partnership linking germany , france and russia undermining ties , the relationship seems to have stabilized of late .
but a victory by merkel , an atlanticist like her mentor helmut kohl , could make ties to washington a lot friendlier . " what is happening in germany is a catalyst for change , " said rockwell schnabel , former us ambassador to the european union and author of a new book on the eu and its contentious relations with the united states . merkel appears to be " a closer friend of the united states and therefore would lead a policy that would be more pro-american and pro-atlanticist , " he added . merkel 's priorities after riding a wave of anti-bush sentiment to victory in 2002 , germany 's miserable economic state has forced schröder to focus on domestic issues in his uphill battle to re-election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- might do things differently than her predecessor -lrb- left -rrb- opinion polls show that merkel , candidate for the christian democrats , has a good chance at becoming the country 's first female chancellor .
but up to 30 percent of the electorate remains undecided . merkel , 51 , has said that one of her priorities if elected would be mending the poisoned relationship with the united states , while still not sending troops to iraq .
washington is also interested in her aggressive pro-free market agenda . although bush officials refuse to publicly comment on the outcome of the sunday vote , privately they say a merkel victory would be a welcome change . a fresh start , without " leftovers " " if the administration representatives are honest they 'll tell you ' well this is a fresh start and merkel 's victory would be a good thing ' , " said jackson janes , director of the american institute for contemporary german studies . " we got a lot of leftovers with the schröder team and we 'll probably never be able to change that , so if we get a new team in berlin it 's an opportunity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jackson janes janes -lrb- photo -rrb- and others warned , however , that if merkel wins on sunday , the bush administration should n't rush to pop the champagne corks .
" i do n't think that we here in washington should escalate our expectations that her parameters would be significantly bigger than schröder 's , " janes said . dieter dettke , executive director of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , which is close to schröder 's spd , in washington , said that while merkel would certainly work hard to establish smoother lines of communication with washington , in substance there could be little change under her administration as far as foreign policy is concerned .
the turkey question one likely contentious issue , janes and dettke noted , was merkel 's opposition to turkey becoming a full member of the european union which put her at odds with washington . nonetheless , analysts say , relations under merkel are unlikely to be any worse than they have been with schröder . " i think that -lrb- if merkel wins -rrb- there 's going to be much more of an effort to say ' let 's see where we agree ... ' , " janes said .

washington is watching sunday 's election and , secretly , hoping for a merkel victory .
but the promise of better relations is off-set by areas of potential dispute . should conservative angela merkel sweep to victory in sunday 's elections , it could mean a fresh start for strained us-german relations , according to analysts . after dipping to new lows under chancellor gerhard schröder and his center-left coalition , with differences over iraq and the partnership linking germany , france and russia undermining ties , the relationship seems to have stabilized of late .
but a victory by merkel , an atlanticist like her mentor helmut kohl , could make ties to washington a lot friendlier . " what is happening in germany is a catalyst for change , " said rockwell schnabel , former us ambassador to the european union and author of a new book on the eu and its contentious relations with the united states . merkel appears to be " a closer friend of the united states and therefore would lead a policy that would be more pro-american and pro-atlanticist , " he added . merkel 's priorities after riding a wave of anti-bush sentiment to victory in 2002 , germany 's miserable economic state has forced schröder to focus on domestic issues in his uphill battle to re-election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- might do things differently than her predecessor -lrb- left -rrb- opinion polls show that merkel , candidate for the christian democrats , has a good chance at becoming the country 's first female chancellor .
but up to 30 percent of the electorate remains undecided . merkel , 51 , has said that one of her priorities if elected would be mending the poisoned relationship with the united states , while still not sending troops to iraq .
washington is also interested in her aggressive pro-free market agenda . although bush officials refuse to publicly comment on the outcome of the sunday vote , privately they say a merkel victory would be a welcome change . a fresh start , without " leftovers " " if the administration representatives are honest they 'll tell you ' well this is a fresh start and merkel 's victory would be a good thing ' , " said jackson janes , director of the american institute for contemporary german studies . " we got a lot of leftovers with the schröder team and we 'll probably never be able to change that , so if we get a new team in berlin it 's an opportunity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jackson janes janes -lrb- photo -rrb- and others warned , however , that if merkel wins on sunday , the bush administration should n't rush to pop the champagne corks .
" i do n't think that we here in washington should escalate our expectations that her parameters would be significantly bigger than schröder 's , " janes said . dieter dettke , executive director of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , which is close to schröder 's spd , in washington , said that while merkel would certainly work hard to establish smoother lines of communication with washington , in substance there could be little change under her administration as far as foreign policy is concerned .
the turkey question one likely contentious issue , janes and dettke noted , was merkel 's opposition to turkey becoming a full member of the european union which put her at odds with washington . nonetheless , analysts say , relations under merkel are unlikely to be any worse than they have been with schröder . " i think that -lrb- if merkel wins -rrb- there 's going to be much more of an effort to say ' let 's see where we agree ... ' , " janes said . " in the case of schröder , there was a great deal of concern that they were thinking more about differences rather than commonalities .

" it 's sensational .
we certainly had n't thought there 'd be as much , " said hans-joachim bischoff , spokesman for bookmaker eurosportwetten , of interest in betting on the elections , according to reuters news agency .
eurosportwetten has taken bets from tens of thousands of germans since chancellor gerhard schröder in may called for elections a year ahead of schedule .
around 7 percent of their german business is now focused on sunday 's election outcome .
conservative leader angela merkel is the overwhelming favorite to oust schröder .
german society has traditionally frowned on gambling .
until a liberalization of the sector in the mid-1990s , germans could only bet on horses .
eurosportwetten odds that merkel will become germany 's first female chancellor have widened since the start of the week from 1-20 to 1-10 , meaning she is less of a favorite but still overwhelmingly backed to win . dw-world.de germany 's most famous non-voter germans eligible to vote can head to the polls sunday - including pope benedict xvi , who is still a registered voter in bavaria .
but the catholic leader wo n't cast his ballot , his brother told dw-world .

she is vehemently opposed to turkey 's bid to join the european union , which could please chirac .
initially an enthusiastic supporter of ankara 's bid , he has become more ambivalent on the subject after the french electorate made clear its resistance to the idea .
merkel was also likely to continue the current government 's soft-spoken approach on human rights in both russia and china but stop short of echoing current german chancellor gerhard schröder 's and chirac 's call to lift the eu arms embargo against beijing .

" the moon is the next worthy goal , " said astronaut manfred messerschmid during the symposium , adding that the celestial body is only 1,000 hours away from the earth , unlike mars which takes a 1,000 days to reach .
the companies also urged the creation of an unmanned european research station on the moon .
they said in a statement that a gigantic long wave radio telescope would be installed on the back of the moon by 2015 to research a completely unknown side of the universe .
the aerospace firms added that they hoped the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- would shoulder the costs of the project which is estimated at around 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- .

that 's too late for the scientists , researchers and industry representatives assembled in bremen on thursday , who stressed that europe had to do more , and quickly , in space research if it wanted to keep up with other nations .
manfred fuchs , head of the bremen-based aerospace company ohb said that other countries had long been involved in missions to the moon .
he criticized the fact that the issue unfortunately " is n't the first priority " in europe and warned that germany , as the biggest country in europe , could n't afford to sit back while countries such as the us , russia , japan , china and india planned and realized their own space programs .
money the biggest problem most scientists and industry representatives admitted that the biggest stumbling block to european aerospace research is the paucity of funds .
evert dudok , president of eads space transportation , said that a central problem in germany was the slim budget for space research .
that amount plus the funds germany receives from esa add up to just about 700 million euros , dudok pointed out and added that the budget for this year had already been completely allocated .

messerschmidt said that the german research ministry 's budget allocation for space research had already fallen to 11 percent from 20 percent .
" we have to stop this process , " messerschmit said .
manfred fuchs pointed out that nations like japan had already massively increased their space research budgets .
however , a spokesman for the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- was skeptical of the ambitious plans of aerospace industry representatives .
he told spiegel online that the " big goal " of the dlr remained the international space station iss and the docking of the european space research module colombus .
a " quantum leap " aerospace industry experts for now have pinned their hopes on a more realistic goal : building a giant radio telescope on the moon by 2015 , which in dudok 's words would bring a " quantum leap for radio astronomy . "

" the moon is the next worthy goal , " said astronaut manfred messerschmid during the symposium , adding that the celestial body is only 1,000 hours away from the earth , unlike mars which takes a 1,000 days to reach .
the companies also urged the creation of an unmanned european research station on the moon .
they said in a statement that a gigantic long wave radio telescope would be installed on the back of the moon by 2015 to research a completely unknown side of the universe .
the aerospace firms added that they hoped the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- would shoulder the costs of the project which is estimated at around 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- .
esa , which is headquartered in paris , is expected to debate the issue during its next conference , in december .
europe could lag in space exploration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa 's aurora mission will explore the solar system esa 's aurora project , which began in 2001 , does include plans for a manned mars mission as well as a manned mission to the moon .
esa wants to head to mars and the moon , but not before 2033 and 2024 respectively .
that 's too late for the scientists , researchers and industry representatives assembled in bremen on thursday , who stressed that europe had to do more , and quickly , in space research if it wanted to keep up with other nations .
manfred fuchs , head of the bremen-based aerospace company ohb said that other countries had long been involved in missions to the moon .
he criticized the fact that the issue unfortunately " is n't the first priority " in europe and warned that germany , as the biggest country in europe , could n't afford to sit back while countries such as the us , russia , japan , china and india planned and realized their own space programs .
money the biggest problem most scientists and industry representatives admitted that the biggest stumbling block to european aerospace research is the paucity of funds .
evert dudok , president of eads space transportation , said that a central problem in germany was the slim budget for space research .
that amount plus the funds germany receives from esa add up to just about 700 million euros , dudok pointed out and added that the budget for this year had already been completely allocated .
" we demand a raise of 15 percent or 100 million euros to finally get some leeway , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of the esa landing unit ' huygens ' -lrb- left -rrb- separating from the ' cassini ' orbiter as the spacecraft advances titan , saturn 's biggest moon both eads space transportation and ohb as well astronaut ernst messerschmidt have appealed to the german government for support and more funds .
messerschmidt said that the german research ministry 's budget allocation for space research had already fallen to 11 percent from 20 percent .
" we have to stop this process , " messerschmit said .
manfred fuchs pointed out that nations like japan had already massively increased their space research budgets .
however , a spokesman for the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- was skeptical of the ambitious plans of aerospace industry representatives .
he told spiegel online that the " big goal " of the dlr remained the international space station iss and the docking of the european space research module colombus .
a " quantum leap " aerospace industry experts for now have pinned their hopes on a more realistic goal : building a giant radio telescope on the moon by 2015 , which in dudok 's words would bring a " quantum leap for radio astronomy . "

at the kiss-and-make-up session , however , sommer was , while not commanding , strongly suggesting that germany 's trade union members vote for schröder and keep the current social democratic-green coalition in power for four more years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer , dgb chairman , right , and chancellor gerhard schröder , left , brief the media following their their talks at the dgb headquarters in berlin .
" it 's about nothing less than determining the future of this society , " sommer said .
in the back of his mind , however , he might have been thinking about the future of germany 's trade union movement , which is looking more uncertain these days , especially if a coalition of angela merkel 's conservative union bloc and the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- form the next government .
while sommer had his problems with his traditional allies - schröder 's social democrats , whose reforms were seen as " socially unjust " - the alternative looks even worse .
in these somewhat desperate times , better to go with the lesser of two evils .
" if the majority of voters vote for the union and the fdp , these parties could attempt to break the back of the unions , like margaret thatcher did in great britain , " sommer told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
and while once unions in the uk were mighty forces , today they are but a shadow of their former selves .
" unions lost that fight -lrb- over reforms -rrb- , " said hagen lesch , an expert on wage policy at the cologne institute for economic research .
" the thinking is to hang on to what they have now . "
traditional force trade unions in germany have traditionally been a powerful force in the labor market .
unions , in often tough negotiations with employers , set wage agreements that apply to entire sectors of the labor market .
in the postwar era , that has translated into regular pay increases for workers , generous holiday and sick-time allowances , and labor conditions that are the envy of much of the world .
bildunterschrift : steelworkers protesting but things have changed on the labor landscape and the once shining reputation of german trade unions is looking tarnished .
the country 's unemployment rate , which has been rising since the 1970s and is now at almost 12 percent , seems impossible to get down .
the pressures of globalization and the outsourcing of many manufacturing jobs means the traditional models - a job for life , an ever-increasing standard of living , cradle-to-grave security - are proving unsustainable .
the economy is stuck with anemic growth rates and often hovers just above recession .
economists , business leaders and some politicians have been calling for reform , for more self-responsibility , more flexibility and less government intervention and state support .
unions have resisted those appeals , claiming they hurt workers , and have begun to be seen - depending on which side of the labor and political spectrum one stands - as roadblocks to growth or protectors of the common man .
however , among the political classes , the former category of opinion appears to be in the ascendant .
change , it is a-comin ' ?
the conservative cdu party , led by angela merkel , who is likely to become germany 's next , and first female , chancellor , has said the unions will likely be looking at change if she forms the next government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel she wants to take away some of their most cherished power - that of setting sector-wide wage agreements - and allow staff and management at individual companies to decide if they want to determine their own pay scales .
merkel has said she wants germany to continue to have strong unions , but that they should be more flexible .
" one ca n't say you 're for a strong union and at the same time , erode wage autonomy .
that 's a contradiction , " said hans-joachim schabedoth , head of the policy department of the dgb .
according to him , conservatives are playing a dangerous game in attempting to eviscerate union power .
history has shown , if a government wants to maintain a majority , or its popularity , it has to pay attention to union interests , he said . the current anti-union strategy was going against the best interests of the larger society , he added .
" our role is to ensure that people benefit from their own work and that social questions are considered in the larger economy so that social problems do n't grow , " he said .
" therefore we 're worried about the current state of things . "
overall decline but the role of unions , in the minds of the populace at least , seems to have lost of its importance .
de-unionization has been a phenomenon over the past two decades all over the world .
since the 1980s , the share of wage earners who are also union members has declined in all but a few countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , the trend is the same .
membership of the dgb 's affiliated trade unions dropped by nearly 5 percent in 2004 and is now at just over 7 million .
unions also face the problem of an aging membership , which does not portend well for the future .
membership of young people -lrb- 16-25 -rrb- within the dgb dropped considerably from 15 percent in the early 1980s to about 5 percent today .
that slow decline could be revved up considerably after sunday 's vote , should the center-right and the free-market liberals prove triumphant .
if unions lose their main power position - the setting of sector-wide wage agreements - it could well cause many workers to reconsider their union memberships and spend their dues money elsewhere .
other considerations by merkel & co . , such as loosening job protection laws , liberalizing store opening hours , and rethinking policies on worker participation in company management , if they go through , would also be defeats for unions and could further push them to the periphery of a germany that appears to be embarking on a more free-market course . kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder seeks unions ' support ten days ahead of germany 's general elections , chancellor gerhard schröder made a show of unity with a major trade union boss , brushing aside the repeated clashes that have marked his seven years in power .

" therefore we 're worried about the current state of things . "
overall decline but the role of unions , in the minds of the populace at least , seems to have lost of its importance .
de-unionization has been a phenomenon over the past two decades all over the world .
since the 1980s , the share of wage earners who are also union members has declined in all but a few countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , the trend is the same .
membership of the dgb 's affiliated trade unions dropped by nearly 5 percent in 2004 and is now at just over 7 million .
unions also face the problem of an aging membership , which does not portend well for the future .
membership of young people -lrb- 16-25 -rrb- within the dgb dropped considerably from 15 percent in the early 1980s to about 5 percent today .
that slow decline could be revved up considerably after sunday 's vote , should the center-right and the free-market liberals prove triumphant .
if unions lose their main power position - the setting of sector-wide wage agreements - it could well cause many workers to reconsider their union memberships and spend their dues money elsewhere .
other considerations by merkel & co . , such as loosening job protection laws , liberalizing store opening hours , and rethinking policies on worker participation in company management , if they go through , would also be defeats for unions and could further push them to the periphery of a germany that appears to be embarking on a more free-market course . kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder seeks unions ' support ten days ahead of germany 's general elections , chancellor gerhard schröder made a show of unity with a major trade union boss , brushing aside the repeated clashes that have marked his seven years in power .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.09.2005 germany 's unions face decisive moment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionally a force in germany , unions ' power is on the wane many are calling the upcoming vote key to determining germany 's economic future .
it 's just as crucial for the country 's trade unions , which could see their power greatly reduced by a conservative-liberal government . the chairman of germany 's dgb trade union federation , michael sommer , was all smiles as he stood side by side with chancellor gerhard schröder last week at the dgb headquarters .
just months ago , the two would n't even shake each the other 's hand after the bitter recriminations that were thrown from both sides over welfare and labor market reforms put in place by schröder .
at the kiss-and-make-up session , however , sommer was , while not commanding , strongly suggesting that germany 's trade union members vote for schröder and keep the current social democratic-green coalition in power for four more years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer , dgb chairman , right , and chancellor gerhard schröder , left , brief the media following their their talks at the dgb headquarters in berlin .
" it 's about nothing less than determining the future of this society , " sommer said .
in the back of his mind , however , he might have been thinking about the future of germany 's trade union movement , which is looking more uncertain these days , especially if a coalition of angela merkel 's conservative union bloc and the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- form the next government .
while sommer had his problems with his traditional allies - schröder 's social democrats , whose reforms were seen as " socially unjust " - the alternative looks even worse .
in these somewhat desperate times , better to go with the lesser of two evils .
" if the majority of voters vote for the union and the fdp , these parties could attempt to break the back of the unions , like margaret thatcher did in great britain , " sommer told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
and while once unions in the uk were mighty forces , today they are but a shadow of their former selves .
" unions lost that fight -lrb- over reforms -rrb- , " said hagen lesch , an expert on wage policy at the cologne institute for economic research .
" the thinking is to hang on to what they have now . "
traditional force trade unions in germany have traditionally been a powerful force in the labor market .
unions , in often tough negotiations with employers , set wage agreements that apply to entire sectors of the labor market .
in the postwar era , that has translated into regular pay increases for workers , generous holiday and sick-time allowances , and labor conditions that are the envy of much of the world .
bildunterschrift : steelworkers protesting but things have changed on the labor landscape and the once shining reputation of german trade unions is looking tarnished .
the country 's unemployment rate , which has been rising since the 1970s and is now at almost 12 percent , seems impossible to get down .
the pressures of globalization and the outsourcing of many manufacturing jobs means the traditional models - a job for life , an ever-increasing standard of living , cradle-to-grave security - are proving unsustainable .
the economy is stuck with anemic growth rates and often hovers just above recession .
economists , business leaders and some politicians have been calling for reform , for more self-responsibility , more flexibility and less government intervention and state support .
unions have resisted those appeals , claiming they hurt workers , and have begun to be seen - depending on which side of the labor and political spectrum one stands - as roadblocks to growth or protectors of the common man .
however , among the political classes , the former category of opinion appears to be in the ascendant .
change , it is a-comin ' ?
the conservative cdu party , led by angela merkel , who is likely to become germany 's next , and first female , chancellor , has said the unions will likely be looking at change if she forms the next government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel she wants to take away some of their most cherished power - that of setting sector-wide wage agreements - and allow staff and management at individual companies to decide if they want to determine their own pay scales .
merkel has said she wants germany to continue to have strong unions , but that they should be more flexible .
" one ca n't say you 're for a strong union and at the same time , erode wage autonomy .
that 's a contradiction , " said hans-joachim schabedoth , head of the policy department of the dgb .
according to him , conservatives are playing a dangerous game in attempting to eviscerate union power .
history has shown , if a government wants to maintain a majority , or its popularity , it has to pay attention to union interests , he said . the current anti-union strategy was going against the best interests of the larger society , he added .
" our role is to ensure that people benefit from their own work and that social questions are considered in the larger economy so that social problems do n't grow , " he said .
" therefore we 're worried about the current state of things . "

bildunterschrift : speaking at the un general assembly , fischer stressed that unsuccessful negotiations so far about expanding the security council should be reopened .
he added that he was hopeful that a watered-down plan adopted by the general assembly to restructure the world body still " leaves the door open " for further progress . " we will continue to work patiently on reform , " the minister told german reporters .
fischer quashed rumors that reform of the un 's highest-ranking body had been put on hold , saying that " the pressure of relationships makes this reform necessary . "
he underlined that the german government was not primarily concerned about getting permanent membership , but rather wanted to bestow more legitimacy on the world body by ensuring that it no longer reflected the world of 1945 but rather that of the 21st century .

germany has launched a joint bid along with japan , india and brazil for permanent membership .
the group known as " g4 " agreed thursday on the sidelines of the un summit to continue to pursue efforts towards that end .
the g4 had submitted a plan to boost the council 's membership from its current 15 to 25 , with six new permanent seats and four new non-permanent seats .
their first bid ran into opposition from the united states and china and failed to get crucial support from africa for the necessary two-thirds of member countries ' votes in the un general assembly to change the world body 's charter .
fischer 's appeal to reform and expand the security council was lent support by the remaining g4 members on thursday , many of whom appeared optimistic about their chances .

dw-world summarizes the main points of the race set to end sept .
18 . a process that was riddled with pitfalls when it started in july will come to an end on sunday , when germans decide who will sit in the chancellery for the next four years .
already upset about his coalition 's inability to push through necessary economic and welfare reforms due to constant blockades from the opposition and inner-party bickering , and after suffering damning regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , chancellor gerhard schröder called for a vote of confidence he hoped to - and did - lose , as a way of introducing early elections .
german president horst köhler and the country 's highest court approved the move , deciding that schröder 's ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens did indeed fulfill the necessary legal criteria to dissolve parliament - not having enough of a mandate to run the government effectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler took the entire 21 days allotted to him before deciding to dissolve parliament köhler did his duty " it is my duty as president to decide this issue according to the law , " köhler -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a national television broadcast on july 22 .
" i think it is best to have a new election to let the people decide . "
the decision pleased the majority of german voters and all the major political parties .
since receiving the official thumbs up , the parties ' campaigns have been dominated by their different visions of how to deal with germany 's sluggish economy and high unemployment .
schröder urges voters to stay the course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder insists his reforms have germany on the right track in part , schröder 's unpopular market and labor reforms led to the need for new elections in the first place , but as the campaigning wraps up , he continues to insist that germany has taken the right route .
" we are going in the right direction , " schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- said during his party 's caucus .
" and we need to stay the course . "
like schröder , angela merkel , the opposition christian democratic party 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- chancellor candidate , continues zigzagging across the country holding two rallies a day to win over the voters who could tip the scales in their favor .
rather than speculating on possible coalitions - as one-third of voters are reportedly undecided - merkel has been spending more time in public trying to win votes with sharp criticism of governmental policies that she blames for nearly 5 million unemployed and a budget that continuously breaks european union stability pact rules .
" there is no reason that a re-elected spd parliamentary group would be able to implement new reforms , " she said .
" they may be willing to be in the government , but they are not able . "
union slipping in polls since debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until july , merkel 's party was well ahead of the spd in the polls , at times even enjoying an absolute majority .
but merkel has seen her lead slip away since july , when the cdu revealed plans to increase national sales tax by 2 percent .
the real downturn came after a televised debate between merkel and schröder on sept .
4 , in which the chancellor again proved himself to be both media-savvy and telegenic , while his challenger managed to squeeze through the broadcast without too many glaring gaffes .
since then , schröder has increased his party 's take of the vote to 33 percent and put an end to the newly-formed left party 's double-digit poll results .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's comments did n't give merkel much of a hand with voters unfortunate comments from edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , leader of the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , and runner-up to schröder in the 2002 election , did further damage to the conservatives ' campaign .
stoiber called eastern germans " frustrated " and less capable than the voters in his home state of bavaria .
parties split on reforms merkel 's woes have only been multiplied by paul kirchhof , a potential finance minister who the cdu leader introduced as key to the reforms her government would carry out upon election .
but members of the party base have scorned the heidelberg economics professor , saying his radical changes to germany 's tax code go too far beyond the party platform they have supported .
though the spd 's campaign has not been as turbulent as the cdu / csu 's , it remains to be seen whether schröder can earn enough votes to stay in power and carry through his reform plans , or whether the cdu / csu will get a chance at trying to bring germany back up to speed . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german election enters final phase with five days to before germany elects a new government , both chancellor gerhard schröder and opposition frontrunner angela merkel are confident they can gain a majority and avoid a so-called grand coalition .

bildunterschrift : speaking at the un general assembly , fischer stressed that unsuccessful negotiations so far about expanding the security council should be reopened .

" we had a very thorough exchange of the different positions of the eu-3 and the new government of iran , " british foreign secretary jack straw told reporters after the 80-minute session with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said the ministers had a " very frank discussion " in the first talks between iran and the so-called eu-3 since a may 25 session in geneva . meeting with new president the ministers later sat down with iran 's new president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who planned to unveil what tehran called new proposals to resolve the standoff , in a speech in new york saturday . " we 're going to listen carefully to what the president has to say and we 'll take it from there , " straw said afterwards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer and others trying to avert showdown european union foreign policy chief javier solana , who also attended the meeting with ahmadinejad along with german foreign minister joschka fischer , stressed there were no actual negotiations . " we have only prepared the ground , " solana told reporters .
" if it is possible to continue ? .
it 's not clear yet .
we have to wait until the speech . " possible referral to security council douste-blazy insisted the eu-3 strategy had always been to avoid involving the security council , but added that the next step would depend on how far ahmadinejad 's speech goes in addressing the europeans ' concerns . " if there 's no movement , no change ... it 's not at all impossible that there will be a referral to the council , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president-elect mahmoud ahmadinejad to outline iran plans saturday ´ annan organized the meeting between iran and the eu-3 , which has been trying for nearly two years to wean tehran off its suspected nuclear arms ambitions with economic and security incentives . russia opposed on the margins of the summit , russian president vladimir also huddled with ahmadinejad but a russian official who was present for the first half of the hour-long meeting said the two leaders did not discuss tehran 's nuclear program . russia is building a nuclear power plant in bushehr , iran , a move which has sparked controversy as the united states and other western countries accuse iran of seeking to secretly build nuclear weapons . moscow has indicated it will not support hauling iran before the un security council over its suspected weapons-related nuclear program , as sought by the united states and its european allies . making his debut appearance on the international stage wednesday , ahmadinejad lashed out at western " interventionism " but did not touch the thorny nuclear issue when he addressed the general assembly . ahmadinejad has defended his country 's nuclear program as purely peaceful . the united states has been lobbying for world support to refer iran to the un security council for possible sanctions but has signaled it may not have enough backing when the iaea board convenes monday . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-3 seek nuclear talks with iran germany , france and britain sought talks with iran on the sidelines of the un summit as washington signaled it needed more time to enlist support for possible un sanctions against tehran over its nuclear program .

" the meeting of the ambassadors is over .
there has not been any major shift in the countries ' positions , " one diplomat told reuters .
the eu 's british presidency , which has been trying to resolve the issue for weeks , has conceded that it may have to call a special meeting of eu foreign ministers , possibly on sept .
26 , an agreement can not be reached soon .
still hope for a deal but a presidency spokesman tried to sound upbeat after the ambassadors met .
" it was a good discussion .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has been unwilling to recognize the nikosia government turkey drew criticism in july when , while signing a protocol extending a customs accord with the eu to the bloc 's 10 newest states - including cyprus - it simultaneously declared this did not amount to a recognition of the nicosia government .
the eu ministers are seeking agreement on a " counter-declaration , " but differences over how strongly it should press ankara to recognize the island member state have so far prevented an accord .
cyprus , which gained independence from britain in 1960 , has struggled to emerge from its three-decade-long division into predominantly greek-cypriot and turkish-cypriot sectors .
the island has been split since 1974 when the turkish military occupied the northern third in response to a greek-inspired coup .
turkey supports the turkish cypriot breakaway state in the north of the mediterranean island , while cyprus 's greek cypriot government represents the whole island in the eu .
british-french agreement fails earlier this week , britain and france sought support for a compromise stating that turkey should recognize cyprus before joining , but that failed to win enough backing when the ambassadors first met on wednesday .
the latest draft for the friday meeting , seen by afp , contained a paragraph proposing that the eu tell ankara that " prior recognition of all member states is a necessary component of accession . "
without providing additional details , an eu diplomat said that cyprus , its closest ally greece as well as the czech republic had refused to accept the wording .
cyprus previously stated it wanted the eu to create deadlines for turkey to fulfill in its process of recognizing the mediterranean island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus wants access to turkish ports and airports cyprus wants access to turkish ports the draft also warned that failure by turkey to fully implement the ankara accord - notably by allowing cypriot ships and planes to use its ports and airports - will slow down the pace of membership talks .
" failure to implement its obligations in full will affect the overall progress in the negotiations , " the draft said .
the eu diplomat said that this warning " was acceptable to all member states . "
while the eu debates what position to take , ankara has grown increasingly impatient , with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan accusing the bloc of " rude " diplomatic conduct for placing new conditions on its bid to become a member .
turkey said it would recognize cyprus only after a broad international agreement , possibly sponsored by the united nations , to end the division of the island .
ankara argues that although it occupied the northern part of the island in 1974 to protect the turkish population following a pro-greek coup , it is not responsible for the continuing division of cyprus . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de uk and france mull deal on turkey standoff britain and france have agreed that turkey must recognize cyprus before joining the european union , as a possible compromise to clear the way for accession talks next month , according to diplomatic sources .

" the meeting of the ambassadors is over .
there has not been any major shift in the countries ' positions , " one diplomat told reuters .
the eu 's british presidency , which has been trying to resolve the issue for weeks , has conceded that it may have to call a special meeting of eu foreign ministers , possibly on sept .
26 , an agreement can not be reached soon .
still hope for a deal but a presidency spokesman tried to sound upbeat after the ambassadors met .
" it was a good discussion .
considerable progress was made and we hope to reach an agreement soon , " he said .
" we remain hopeful that we wo n't have to drag the ministers to brussels . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has been unwilling to recognize the nikosia government turkey drew criticism in july when , while signing a protocol extending a customs accord with the eu to the bloc 's 10 newest states - including cyprus - it simultaneously declared this did not amount to a recognition of the nicosia government .
the eu ministers are seeking agreement on a " counter-declaration , " but differences over how strongly it should press ankara to recognize the island member state have so far prevented an accord .
cyprus , which gained independence from britain in 1960 , has struggled to emerge from its three-decade-long division into predominantly greek-cypriot and turkish-cypriot sectors .
the island has been split since 1974 when the turkish military occupied the northern third in response to a greek-inspired coup .
turkey supports the turkish cypriot breakaway state in the north of the mediterranean island , while cyprus 's greek cypriot government represents the whole island in the eu .
british-french agreement fails earlier this week , britain and france sought support for a compromise stating that turkey should recognize cyprus before joining , but that failed to win enough backing when the ambassadors first met on wednesday .
the latest draft for the friday meeting , seen by afp , contained a paragraph proposing that the eu tell ankara that " prior recognition of all member states is a necessary component of accession . "
without providing additional details , an eu diplomat said that cyprus , its closest ally greece as well as the czech republic had refused to accept the wording .
cyprus previously stated it wanted the eu to create deadlines for turkey to fulfill in its process of recognizing the mediterranean island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus wants access to turkish ports and airports cyprus wants access to turkish ports the draft also warned that failure by turkey to fully implement the ankara accord - notably by allowing cypriot ships and planes to use its ports and airports - will slow down the pace of membership talks .
" failure to implement its obligations in full will affect the overall progress in the negotiations , " the draft said .
the eu diplomat said that this warning " was acceptable to all member states . "

" there 's something mechanical today in the franco-german relationship that needs to be given new legitimacy , " said jean-dominique giuliani , head of the robert schuman foundation in paris .
merkel herself has said the franco-german motor would continue if she became chancellor , through she stated it would not be an " exclusive " relationship nor one directed against other eu members .
merkel signaled that she would maintain several foreign policy positions , including support for environmental protection and the international criminal court - both issues that align with chirac 's views .
she is vehemently opposed to turkey 's bid to join the european union , which could please chirac .
initially an enthusiastic supporter of ankara 's bid , he has become more ambivalent on the subject after the french electorate made clear its resistance to the idea .
merkel was also likely to continue the current government 's soft-spoken approach on human rights in both russia and china but stop short of echoing current german chancellor gerhard schröder 's and chirac 's call to lift the eu arms embargo against beijing .
in the end , though , a long-awaited turnaround in the economic fortunes of the two countries may be the impetus to revive their partnership .
" the basis of the problems in the franco-german relationship are economic in nature , " said giuliani . dw-world.de merkel 's fans in washington washington is watching sunday 's election and , secretly , hoping for a merkel victory .

washington is watching sunday 's election and , secretly , hoping for a merkel victory .
but the promise of better relations is off-set by areas of potential dispute . should conservative angela merkel sweep to victory in sunday 's elections , it could mean a fresh start for strained us-german relations , according to analysts . after dipping to new lows under chancellor gerhard schröder and his center-left coalition , with differences over iraq and the partnership linking germany , france and russia undermining ties , the relationship seems to have stabilized of late .
but a victory by merkel , an atlanticist like her mentor helmut kohl , could make ties to washington a lot friendlier . " what is happening in germany is a catalyst for change , " said rockwell schnabel , former us ambassador to the european union and author of a new book on the eu and its contentious relations with the united states . merkel appears to be " a closer friend of the united states and therefore would lead a policy that would be more pro-american and pro-atlanticist , " he added . merkel 's priorities after riding a wave of anti-bush sentiment to victory in 2002 , germany 's miserable economic state has forced schröder to focus on domestic issues in his uphill battle to re-election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- might do things differently than her predecessor -lrb- left -rrb- opinion polls show that merkel , candidate for the christian democrats , has a good chance at becoming the country 's first female chancellor .
but up to 30 percent of the electorate remains undecided . merkel , 51 , has said that one of her priorities if elected would be mending the poisoned relationship with the united states , while still not sending troops to iraq .
washington is also interested in her aggressive pro-free market agenda . although bush officials refuse to publicly comment on the outcome of the sunday vote , privately they say a merkel victory would be a welcome change . a fresh start , without " leftovers " " if the administration representatives are honest they 'll tell you ' well this is a fresh start and merkel 's victory would be a good thing ' , " said jackson janes , director of the american institute for contemporary german studies . " we got a lot of leftovers with the schröder team and we 'll probably never be able to change that , so if we get a new team in berlin it 's an opportunity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jackson janes janes -lrb- photo -rrb- and others warned , however , that if merkel wins on sunday , the bush administration should n't rush to pop the champagne corks .
" i do n't think that we here in washington should escalate our expectations that her parameters would be significantly bigger than schröder 's , " janes said . dieter dettke , executive director of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , which is close to schröder 's spd , in washington , said that while merkel would certainly work hard to establish smoother lines of communication with washington , in substance there could be little change under her administration as far as foreign policy is concerned .
the turkey question one likely contentious issue , janes and dettke noted , was merkel 's opposition to turkey becoming a full member of the european union which put her at odds with washington . nonetheless , analysts say , relations under merkel are unlikely to be any worse than they have been with schröder . " i think that -lrb- if merkel wins -rrb- there 's going to be much more of an effort to say ' let 's see where we agree ... ' , " janes said .

washington is watching sunday 's election and , secretly , hoping for a merkel victory .
but the promise of better relations is off-set by areas of potential dispute . should conservative angela merkel sweep to victory in sunday 's elections , it could mean a fresh start for strained us-german relations , according to analysts . after dipping to new lows under chancellor gerhard schröder and his center-left coalition , with differences over iraq and the partnership linking germany , france and russia undermining ties , the relationship seems to have stabilized of late .
but a victory by merkel , an atlanticist like her mentor helmut kohl , could make ties to washington a lot friendlier . " what is happening in germany is a catalyst for change , " said rockwell schnabel , former us ambassador to the european union and author of a new book on the eu and its contentious relations with the united states . merkel appears to be " a closer friend of the united states and therefore would lead a policy that would be more pro-american and pro-atlanticist , " he added . merkel 's priorities after riding a wave of anti-bush sentiment to victory in 2002 , germany 's miserable economic state has forced schröder to focus on domestic issues in his uphill battle to re-election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- might do things differently than her predecessor -lrb- left -rrb- opinion polls show that merkel , candidate for the christian democrats , has a good chance at becoming the country 's first female chancellor .
but up to 30 percent of the electorate remains undecided . merkel , 51 , has said that one of her priorities if elected would be mending the poisoned relationship with the united states , while still not sending troops to iraq .
washington is also interested in her aggressive pro-free market agenda . although bush officials refuse to publicly comment on the outcome of the sunday vote , privately they say a merkel victory would be a welcome change . a fresh start , without " leftovers " " if the administration representatives are honest they 'll tell you ' well this is a fresh start and merkel 's victory would be a good thing ' , " said jackson janes , director of the american institute for contemporary german studies . " we got a lot of leftovers with the schröder team and we 'll probably never be able to change that , so if we get a new team in berlin it 's an opportunity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jackson janes janes -lrb- photo -rrb- and others warned , however , that if merkel wins on sunday , the bush administration should n't rush to pop the champagne corks .
" i do n't think that we here in washington should escalate our expectations that her parameters would be significantly bigger than schröder 's , " janes said . dieter dettke , executive director of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , which is close to schröder 's spd , in washington , said that while merkel would certainly work hard to establish smoother lines of communication with washington , in substance there could be little change under her administration as far as foreign policy is concerned .
the turkey question one likely contentious issue , janes and dettke noted , was merkel 's opposition to turkey becoming a full member of the european union which put her at odds with washington . nonetheless , analysts say , relations under merkel are unlikely to be any worse than they have been with schröder . " i think that -lrb- if merkel wins -rrb- there 's going to be much more of an effort to say ' let 's see where we agree ... ' , " janes said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.09.2005 germany 's unions face decisive moment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionally a force in germany , unions ' power is on the wane many are calling the upcoming vote key to determining germany 's economic future .
it 's just as crucial for the country 's trade unions , which could see their power greatly reduced by a conservative-liberal government . the chairman of germany 's dgb trade union federation , michael sommer , was all smiles as he stood side by side with chancellor gerhard schröder last week at the dgb headquarters .
just months ago , the two would n't even shake each the other 's hand after the bitter recriminations that were thrown from both sides over welfare and labor market reforms put in place by schröder .
at the kiss-and-make-up session , however , sommer was , while not commanding , strongly suggesting that germany 's trade union members vote for schröder and keep the current social democratic-green coalition in power for four more years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer , dgb chairman , right , and chancellor gerhard schröder , left , brief the media following their their talks at the dgb headquarters in berlin .
" it 's about nothing less than determining the future of this society , " sommer said .
in the back of his mind , however , he might have been thinking about the future of germany 's trade union movement , which is looking more uncertain these days , especially if a coalition of angela merkel 's conservative union bloc and the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- form the next government .
while sommer had his problems with his traditional allies - schröder 's social democrats , whose reforms were seen as " socially unjust " - the alternative looks even worse .
in these somewhat desperate times , better to go with the lesser of two evils .
" if the majority of voters vote for the union and the fdp , these parties could attempt to break the back of the unions , like margaret thatcher did in great britain , " sommer told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
and while once unions in the uk were mighty forces , today they are but a shadow of their former selves .
" unions lost that fight -lrb- over reforms -rrb- , " said hagen lesch , an expert on wage policy at the cologne institute for economic research .
" the thinking is to hang on to what they have now . "
traditional force trade unions in germany have traditionally been a powerful force in the labor market .
unions , in often tough negotiations with employers , set wage agreements that apply to entire sectors of the labor market .
in the postwar era , that has translated into regular pay increases for workers , generous holiday and sick-time allowances , and labor conditions that are the envy of much of the world .
bildunterschrift : steelworkers protesting but things have changed on the labor landscape and the once shining reputation of german trade unions is looking tarnished .
the country 's unemployment rate , which has been rising since the 1970s and is now at almost 12 percent , seems impossible to get down .
the pressures of globalization and the outsourcing of many manufacturing jobs means the traditional models - a job for life , an ever-increasing standard of living , cradle-to-grave security - are proving unsustainable .
the economy is stuck with anemic growth rates and often hovers just above recession .
economists , business leaders and some politicians have been calling for reform , for more self-responsibility , more flexibility and less government intervention and state support .
unions have resisted those appeals , claiming they hurt workers , and have begun to be seen - depending on which side of the labor and political spectrum one stands - as roadblocks to growth or protectors of the common man .
however , among the political classes , the former category of opinion appears to be in the ascendant .
change , it is a-comin ' ?
the conservative cdu party , led by angela merkel , who is likely to become germany 's next , and first female , chancellor , has said the unions will likely be looking at change if she forms the next government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel she wants to take away some of their most cherished power - that of setting sector-wide wage agreements - and allow staff and management at individual companies to decide if they want to determine their own pay scales .
merkel has said she wants germany to continue to have strong unions , but that they should be more flexible .
" one ca n't say you 're for a strong union and at the same time , erode wage autonomy .
that 's a contradiction , " said hans-joachim schabedoth , head of the policy department of the dgb .
according to him , conservatives are playing a dangerous game in attempting to eviscerate union power .
history has shown , if a government wants to maintain a majority , or its popularity , it has to pay attention to union interests , he said . the current anti-union strategy was going against the best interests of the larger society , he added .
" our role is to ensure that people benefit from their own work and that social questions are considered in the larger economy so that social problems do n't grow , " he said .
" therefore we 're worried about the current state of things . "
overall decline but the role of unions , in the minds of the populace at least , seems to have lost of its importance .
de-unionization has been a phenomenon over the past two decades all over the world .
since the 1980s , the share of wage earners who are also union members has declined in all but a few countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , the trend is the same .
membership of the dgb 's affiliated trade unions dropped by nearly 5 percent in 2004 and is now at just over 7 million .
unions also face the problem of an aging membership , which does not portend well for the future .
membership of young people -lrb- 16-25 -rrb- within the dgb dropped considerably from 15 percent in the early 1980s to about 5 percent today .
that slow decline could be revved up considerably after sunday 's vote , should the center-right and the free-market liberals prove triumphant .
if unions lose their main power position - the setting of sector-wide wage agreements - it could well cause many workers to reconsider their union memberships and spend their dues money elsewhere .
other considerations by merkel & co . , such as loosening job protection laws , liberalizing store opening hours , and rethinking policies on worker participation in company management , if they go through , would also be defeats for unions and could further push them to the periphery of a germany that appears to be embarking on a more free-market course . kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder seeks unions ' support ten days ahead of germany 's general elections , chancellor gerhard schröder made a show of unity with a major trade union boss , brushing aside the repeated clashes that have marked his seven years in power .

it 's just as crucial for the country 's trade unions , which could see their power greatly reduced by a conservative-liberal government . the chairman of germany 's dgb trade union federation , michael sommer , was all smiles as he stood side by side with chancellor gerhard schröder last week at the dgb headquarters .
just months ago , the two would n't even shake each the other 's hand after the bitter recriminations that were thrown from both sides over welfare and labor market reforms put in place by schröder .
at the kiss-and-make-up session , however , sommer was , while not commanding , strongly suggesting that germany 's trade union members vote for schröder and keep the current social democratic-green coalition in power for four more years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer , dgb chairman , right , and chancellor gerhard schröder , left , brief the media following their their talks at the dgb headquarters in berlin .
" it 's about nothing less than determining the future of this society , " sommer said .
in the back of his mind , however , he might have been thinking about the future of germany 's trade union movement , which is looking more uncertain these days , especially if a coalition of angela merkel 's conservative union bloc and the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- form the next government .
while sommer had his problems with his traditional allies - schröder 's social democrats , whose reforms were seen as " socially unjust " - the alternative looks even worse .
in these somewhat desperate times , better to go with the lesser of two evils .
" if the majority of voters vote for the union and the fdp , these parties could attempt to break the back of the unions , like margaret thatcher did in great britain , " sommer told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
and while once unions in the uk were mighty forces , today they are but a shadow of their former selves .
" unions lost that fight -lrb- over reforms -rrb- , " said hagen lesch , an expert on wage policy at the cologne institute for economic research .
" the thinking is to hang on to what they have now . "
traditional force trade unions in germany have traditionally been a powerful force in the labor market .
unions , in often tough negotiations with employers , set wage agreements that apply to entire sectors of the labor market .
in the postwar era , that has translated into regular pay increases for workers , generous holiday and sick-time allowances , and labor conditions that are the envy of much of the world .
bildunterschrift : steelworkers protesting but things have changed on the labor landscape and the once shining reputation of german trade unions is looking tarnished .
the country 's unemployment rate , which has been rising since the 1970s and is now at almost 12 percent , seems impossible to get down .
the pressures of globalization and the outsourcing of many manufacturing jobs means the traditional models - a job for life , an ever-increasing standard of living , cradle-to-grave security - are proving unsustainable .
the economy is stuck with anemic growth rates and often hovers just above recession .
economists , business leaders and some politicians have been calling for reform , for more self-responsibility , more flexibility and less government intervention and state support .
unions have resisted those appeals , claiming they hurt workers , and have begun to be seen - depending on which side of the labor and political spectrum one stands - as roadblocks to growth or protectors of the common man .
however , among the political classes , the former category of opinion appears to be in the ascendant .
change , it is a-comin ' ?
the conservative cdu party , led by angela merkel , who is likely to become germany 's next , and first female , chancellor , has said the unions will likely be looking at change if she forms the next government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel she wants to take away some of their most cherished power - that of setting sector-wide wage agreements - and allow staff and management at individual companies to decide if they want to determine their own pay scales .
merkel has said she wants germany to continue to have strong unions , but that they should be more flexible .
" one ca n't say you 're for a strong union and at the same time , erode wage autonomy .
that 's a contradiction , " said hans-joachim schabedoth , head of the policy department of the dgb .
according to him , conservatives are playing a dangerous game in attempting to eviscerate union power .
history has shown , if a government wants to maintain a majority , or its popularity , it has to pay attention to union interests , he said . the current anti-union strategy was going against the best interests of the larger society , he added .
" our role is to ensure that people benefit from their own work and that social questions are considered in the larger economy so that social problems do n't grow , " he said .
" therefore we 're worried about the current state of things . "
overall decline but the role of unions , in the minds of the populace at least , seems to have lost of its importance .
de-unionization has been a phenomenon over the past two decades all over the world .
since the 1980s , the share of wage earners who are also union members has declined in all but a few countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , the trend is the same .
membership of the dgb 's affiliated trade unions dropped by nearly 5 percent in 2004 and is now at just over 7 million .
unions also face the problem of an aging membership , which does not portend well for the future .
membership of young people -lrb- 16-25 -rrb- within the dgb dropped considerably from 15 percent in the early 1980s to about 5 percent today .
that slow decline could be revved up considerably after sunday 's vote , should the center-right and the free-market liberals prove triumphant .
if unions lose their main power position - the setting of sector-wide wage agreements - it could well cause many workers to reconsider their union memberships and spend their dues money elsewhere .
other considerations by merkel & co . , such as loosening job protection laws , liberalizing store opening hours , and rethinking policies on worker participation in company management , if they go through , would also be defeats for unions and could further push them to the periphery of a germany that appears to be embarking on a more free-market course . kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder seeks unions ' support ten days ahead of germany 's general elections , chancellor gerhard schröder made a show of unity with a major trade union boss , brushing aside the repeated clashes that have marked his seven years in power .

the pressures of globalization and the outsourcing of many manufacturing jobs means the traditional models - a job for life , an ever-increasing standard of living , cradle-to-grave security - are proving unsustainable .
the economy is stuck with anemic growth rates and often hovers just above recession .
economists , business leaders and some politicians have been calling for reform , for more self-responsibility , more flexibility and less government intervention and state support .
unions have resisted those appeals , claiming they hurt workers , and have begun to be seen - depending on which side of the labor and political spectrum one stands - as roadblocks to growth or protectors of the common man .
however , among the political classes , the former category of opinion appears to be in the ascendant .
change , it is a-comin ' ?
the conservative cdu party , led by angela merkel , who is likely to become germany 's next , and first female , chancellor , has said the unions will likely be looking at change if she forms the next government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel she wants to take away some of their most cherished power - that of setting sector-wide wage agreements - and allow staff and management at individual companies to decide if they want to determine their own pay scales .
merkel has said she wants germany to continue to have strong unions , but that they should be more flexible .
" one ca n't say you 're for a strong union and at the same time , erode wage autonomy .
that 's a contradiction , " said hans-joachim schabedoth , head of the policy department of the dgb .
according to him , conservatives are playing a dangerous game in attempting to eviscerate union power .
history has shown , if a government wants to maintain a majority , or its popularity , it has to pay attention to union interests , he said . the current anti-union strategy was going against the best interests of the larger society , he added .
" our role is to ensure that people benefit from their own work and that social questions are considered in the larger economy so that social problems do n't grow , " he said .
" therefore we 're worried about the current state of things . "
overall decline but the role of unions , in the minds of the populace at least , seems to have lost of its importance .
de-unionization has been a phenomenon over the past two decades all over the world .
since the 1980s , the share of wage earners who are also union members has declined in all but a few countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , the trend is the same .
membership of the dgb 's affiliated trade unions dropped by nearly 5 percent in 2004 and is now at just over 7 million .
unions also face the problem of an aging membership , which does not portend well for the future .
membership of young people -lrb- 16-25 -rrb- within the dgb dropped considerably from 15 percent in the early 1980s to about 5 percent today .
that slow decline could be revved up considerably after sunday 's vote , should the center-right and the free-market liberals prove triumphant .
if unions lose their main power position - the setting of sector-wide wage agreements - it could well cause many workers to reconsider their union memberships and spend their dues money elsewhere .
other considerations by merkel & co . , such as loosening job protection laws , liberalizing store opening hours , and rethinking policies on worker participation in company management , if they go through , would also be defeats for unions and could further push them to the periphery of a germany that appears to be embarking on a more free-market course . kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder seeks unions ' support ten days ahead of germany 's general elections , chancellor gerhard schröder made a show of unity with a major trade union boss , brushing aside the repeated clashes that have marked his seven years in power .

" the moon is the next worthy goal , " said astronaut manfred messerschmid during the symposium , adding that the celestial body is only 1,000 hours away from the earth , unlike mars which takes a 1,000 days to reach .
the companies also urged the creation of an unmanned european research station on the moon .
they said in a statement that a gigantic long wave radio telescope would be installed on the back of the moon by 2015 to research a completely unknown side of the universe .
the aerospace firms added that they hoped the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- would shoulder the costs of the project which is estimated at around 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- .

that 's too late for the scientists , researchers and industry representatives assembled in bremen on thursday , who stressed that europe had to do more , and quickly , in space research if it wanted to keep up with other nations .
manfred fuchs , head of the bremen-based aerospace company ohb said that other countries had long been involved in missions to the moon .
he criticized the fact that the issue unfortunately " is n't the first priority " in europe and warned that germany , as the biggest country in europe , could n't afford to sit back while countries such as the us , russia , japan , china and india planned and realized their own space programs .
money the biggest problem most scientists and industry representatives admitted that the biggest stumbling block to european aerospace research is the paucity of funds .
evert dudok , president of eads space transportation , said that a central problem in germany was the slim budget for space research .
that amount plus the funds germany receives from esa add up to just about 700 million euros , dudok pointed out and added that the budget for this year had already been completely allocated .

messerschmidt said that the german research ministry 's budget allocation for space research had already fallen to 11 percent from 20 percent .
" we have to stop this process , " messerschmit said .
manfred fuchs pointed out that nations like japan had already massively increased their space research budgets .
however , a spokesman for the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- was skeptical of the ambitious plans of aerospace industry representatives .
he told spiegel online that the " big goal " of the dlr remained the international space station iss and the docking of the european space research module colombus .
a " quantum leap " aerospace industry experts for now have pinned their hopes on a more realistic goal : building a giant radio telescope on the moon by 2015 , which in dudok 's words would bring a " quantum leap for radio astronomy . "

" the moon is the next worthy goal , " said astronaut manfred messerschmid during the symposium , adding that the celestial body is only 1,000 hours away from the earth , unlike mars which takes a 1,000 days to reach .
the companies also urged the creation of an unmanned european research station on the moon .
they said in a statement that a gigantic long wave radio telescope would be installed on the back of the moon by 2015 to research a completely unknown side of the universe .
the aerospace firms added that they hoped the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- would shoulder the costs of the project which is estimated at around 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- .
esa , which is headquartered in paris , is expected to debate the issue during its next conference , in december .
europe could lag in space exploration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa 's aurora mission will explore the solar system esa 's aurora project , which began in 2001 , does include plans for a manned mars mission as well as a manned mission to the moon .
esa wants to head to mars and the moon , but not before 2033 and 2024 respectively .
that 's too late for the scientists , researchers and industry representatives assembled in bremen on thursday , who stressed that europe had to do more , and quickly , in space research if it wanted to keep up with other nations .
manfred fuchs , head of the bremen-based aerospace company ohb said that other countries had long been involved in missions to the moon .
he criticized the fact that the issue unfortunately " is n't the first priority " in europe and warned that germany , as the biggest country in europe , could n't afford to sit back while countries such as the us , russia , japan , china and india planned and realized their own space programs .
money the biggest problem most scientists and industry representatives admitted that the biggest stumbling block to european aerospace research is the paucity of funds .
evert dudok , president of eads space transportation , said that a central problem in germany was the slim budget for space research .
that amount plus the funds germany receives from esa add up to just about 700 million euros , dudok pointed out and added that the budget for this year had already been completely allocated .
" we demand a raise of 15 percent or 100 million euros to finally get some leeway , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of the esa landing unit ' huygens ' -lrb- left -rrb- separating from the ' cassini ' orbiter as the spacecraft advances titan , saturn 's biggest moon both eads space transportation and ohb as well astronaut ernst messerschmidt have appealed to the german government for support and more funds .
messerschmidt said that the german research ministry 's budget allocation for space research had already fallen to 11 percent from 20 percent .
" we have to stop this process , " messerschmit said .
manfred fuchs pointed out that nations like japan had already massively increased their space research budgets .
however , a spokesman for the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- was skeptical of the ambitious plans of aerospace industry representatives .

dw-world summarizes the main points of the race set to end sept .
18 . a process that was riddled with pitfalls when it started in july will come to an end on sunday , when germans decide who will sit in the chancellery for the next four years .
already upset about his coalition 's inability to push through necessary economic and welfare reforms due to constant blockades from the opposition and inner-party bickering , and after suffering damning regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , chancellor gerhard schröder called for a vote of confidence he hoped to - and did - lose , as a way of introducing early elections .
german president horst köhler and the country 's highest court approved the move , deciding that schröder 's ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens did indeed fulfill the necessary legal criteria to dissolve parliament - not having enough of a mandate to run the government effectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler took the entire 21 days allotted to him before deciding to dissolve parliament köhler did his duty " it is my duty as president to decide this issue according to the law , " köhler -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a national television broadcast on july 22 .
" i think it is best to have a new election to let the people decide . "
the decision pleased the majority of german voters and all the major political parties .
since receiving the official thumbs up , the parties ' campaigns have been dominated by their different visions of how to deal with germany 's sluggish economy and high unemployment .
schröder urges voters to stay the course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder insists his reforms have germany on the right track in part , schröder 's unpopular market and labor reforms led to the need for new elections in the first place , but as the campaigning wraps up , he continues to insist that germany has taken the right route .
" we are going in the right direction , " schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- said during his party 's caucus .
" and we need to stay the course . "
like schröder , angela merkel , the opposition christian democratic party 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- chancellor candidate , continues zigzagging across the country holding two rallies a day to win over the voters who could tip the scales in their favor .
rather than speculating on possible coalitions - as one-third of voters are reportedly undecided - merkel has been spending more time in public trying to win votes with sharp criticism of governmental policies that she blames for nearly 5 million unemployed and a budget that continuously breaks european union stability pact rules .
" there is no reason that a re-elected spd parliamentary group would be able to implement new reforms , " she said .
" they may be willing to be in the government , but they are not able . "
union slipping in polls since debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until july , merkel 's party was well ahead of the spd in the polls , at times even enjoying an absolute majority .
but merkel has seen her lead slip away since july , when the cdu revealed plans to increase national sales tax by 2 percent .
the real downturn came after a televised debate between merkel and schröder on sept .
4 , in which the chancellor again proved himself to be both media-savvy and telegenic , while his challenger managed to squeeze through the broadcast without too many glaring gaffes .
since then , schröder has increased his party 's take of the vote to 33 percent and put an end to the newly-formed left party 's double-digit poll results .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's comments did n't give merkel much of a hand with voters unfortunate comments from edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , leader of the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , and runner-up to schröder in the 2002 election , did further damage to the conservatives ' campaign .
stoiber called eastern germans " frustrated " and less capable than the voters in his home state of bavaria .
parties split on reforms merkel 's woes have only been multiplied by paul kirchhof , a potential finance minister who the cdu leader introduced as key to the reforms her government would carry out upon election .
but members of the party base have scorned the heidelberg economics professor , saying his radical changes to germany 's tax code go too far beyond the party platform they have supported .
though the spd 's campaign has not been as turbulent as the cdu / csu 's , it remains to be seen whether schröder can earn enough votes to stay in power and carry through his reform plans , or whether the cdu / csu will get a chance at trying to bring germany back up to speed . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german election enters final phase with five days to before germany elects a new government , both chancellor gerhard schröder and opposition frontrunner angela merkel are confident they can gain a majority and avoid a so-called grand coalition .

dw-world summarizes the main points of the race set to end sept .
18 . a process that was riddled with pitfalls when it started in july will come to an end on sunday , when germans decide who will sit in the chancellery for the next four years .
already upset about his coalition 's inability to push through necessary economic and welfare reforms due to constant blockades from the opposition and inner-party bickering , and after suffering damning regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , chancellor gerhard schröder called for a vote of confidence he hoped to - and did - lose , as a way of introducing early elections .
german president horst köhler and the country 's highest court approved the move , deciding that schröder 's ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens did indeed fulfill the necessary legal criteria to dissolve parliament - not having enough of a mandate to run the government effectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler took the entire 21 days allotted to him before deciding to dissolve parliament köhler did his duty " it is my duty as president to decide this issue according to the law , " köhler -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a national television broadcast on july 22 .
" i think it is best to have a new election to let the people decide . "
the decision pleased the majority of german voters and all the major political parties .
since receiving the official thumbs up , the parties ' campaigns have been dominated by their different visions of how to deal with germany 's sluggish economy and high unemployment .
schröder urges voters to stay the course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder insists his reforms have germany on the right track in part , schröder 's unpopular market and labor reforms led to the need for new elections in the first place , but as the campaigning wraps up , he continues to insist that germany has taken the right route .
" we are going in the right direction , " schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- said during his party 's caucus .
" and we need to stay the course . "
like schröder , angela merkel , the opposition christian democratic party 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- chancellor candidate , continues zigzagging across the country holding two rallies a day to win over the voters who could tip the scales in their favor .
rather than speculating on possible coalitions - as one-third of voters are reportedly undecided - merkel has been spending more time in public trying to win votes with sharp criticism of governmental policies that she blames for nearly 5 million unemployed and a budget that continuously breaks european union stability pact rules .
" there is no reason that a re-elected spd parliamentary group would be able to implement new reforms , " she said .
" they may be willing to be in the government , but they are not able . "
union slipping in polls since debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until july , merkel 's party was well ahead of the spd in the polls , at times even enjoying an absolute majority .
but merkel has seen her lead slip away since july , when the cdu revealed plans to increase national sales tax by 2 percent .
the real downturn came after a televised debate between merkel and schröder on sept .
4 , in which the chancellor again proved himself to be both media-savvy and telegenic , while his challenger managed to squeeze through the broadcast without too many glaring gaffes .
since then , schröder has increased his party 's take of the vote to 33 percent and put an end to the newly-formed left party 's double-digit poll results .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's comments did n't give merkel much of a hand with voters unfortunate comments from edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , leader of the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , and runner-up to schröder in the 2002 election , did further damage to the conservatives ' campaign .
stoiber called eastern germans " frustrated " and less capable than the voters in his home state of bavaria .
parties split on reforms merkel 's woes have only been multiplied by paul kirchhof , a potential finance minister who the cdu leader introduced as key to the reforms her government would carry out upon election .
but members of the party base have scorned the heidelberg economics professor , saying his radical changes to germany 's tax code go too far beyond the party platform they have supported .
though the spd 's campaign has not been as turbulent as the cdu / csu 's , it remains to be seen whether schröder can earn enough votes to stay in power and carry through his reform plans , or whether the cdu / csu will get a chance at trying to bring germany back up to speed . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german election enters final phase with five days to before germany elects a new government , both chancellor gerhard schröder and opposition frontrunner angela merkel are confident they can gain a majority and avoid a so-called grand coalition .

" the moon is the next worthy goal , " said astronaut manfred messerschmid during the symposium , adding that the celestial body is only 1,000 hours away from the earth , unlike mars which takes a 1,000 days to reach .
the companies also urged the creation of an unmanned european research station on the moon .
they said in a statement that a gigantic long wave radio telescope would be installed on the back of the moon by 2015 to research a completely unknown side of the universe .
the aerospace firms added that they hoped the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- would shoulder the costs of the project which is estimated at around 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- .
esa , which is headquartered in paris , is expected to debate the issue during its next conference , in december .
europe could lag in space exploration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa 's aurora mission will explore the solar system esa 's aurora project , which began in 2001 , does include plans for a manned mars mission as well as a manned mission to the moon .
esa wants to head to mars and the moon , but not before 2033 and 2024 respectively .
that 's too late for the scientists , researchers and industry representatives assembled in bremen on thursday , who stressed that europe had to do more , and quickly , in space research if it wanted to keep up with other nations .
manfred fuchs , head of the bremen-based aerospace company ohb said that other countries had long been involved in missions to the moon .
he criticized the fact that the issue unfortunately " is n't the first priority " in europe and warned that germany , as the biggest country in europe , could n't afford to sit back while countries such as the us , russia , japan , china and india planned and realized their own space programs .
money the biggest problem most scientists and industry representatives admitted that the biggest stumbling block to european aerospace research is the paucity of funds .
evert dudok , president of eads space transportation , said that a central problem in germany was the slim budget for space research .
that amount plus the funds germany receives from esa add up to just about 700 million euros , dudok pointed out and added that the budget for this year had already been completely allocated .
" we demand a raise of 15 percent or 100 million euros to finally get some leeway , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of the esa landing unit ' huygens ' -lrb- left -rrb- separating from the ' cassini ' orbiter as the spacecraft advances titan , saturn 's biggest moon both eads space transportation and ohb as well astronaut ernst messerschmidt have appealed to the german government for support and more funds .
messerschmidt said that the german research ministry 's budget allocation for space research had already fallen to 11 percent from 20 percent .
" we have to stop this process , " messerschmit said .
manfred fuchs pointed out that nations like japan had already massively increased their space research budgets .
however , a spokesman for the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- was skeptical of the ambitious plans of aerospace industry representatives .
he told spiegel online that the " big goal " of the dlr remained the international space station iss and the docking of the european space research module colombus .
a " quantum leap " aerospace industry experts for now have pinned their hopes on a more realistic goal : building a giant radio telescope on the moon by 2015 , which in dudok 's words would bring a " quantum leap for radio astronomy . "
eads space transportation is already working with dutch researchers on the telescope .
the apparatus , which will be transported with the help of a ariane 5 rocket , will consist of 100 small antennae and will cover an initial radius of 300 meters , if all goes according to plan .

bildunterschrift : speaking at the un general assembly , fischer stressed that unsuccessful negotiations so far about expanding the security council should be reopened .
he added that he was hopeful that a watered-down plan adopted by the general assembly to restructure the world body still " leaves the door open " for further progress . " we will continue to work patiently on reform , " the minister told german reporters .
fischer quashed rumors that reform of the un 's highest-ranking body had been put on hold , saying that " the pressure of relationships makes this reform necessary . "
he underlined that the german government was not primarily concerned about getting permanent membership , but rather wanted to bestow more legitimacy on the world body by ensuring that it no longer reflected the world of 1945 but rather that of the 21st century .
opposition from us and china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council has five permanent members - the us , russia , china , france and great britain .
the remaining ten members are elected for a period of two years .
germany has launched a joint bid along with japan , india and brazil for permanent membership .
the group known as " g4 " agreed thursday on the sidelines of the un summit to continue to pursue efforts towards that end .
the g4 had submitted a plan to boost the council 's membership from its current 15 to 25 , with six new permanent seats and four new non-permanent seats .
their first bid ran into opposition from the united states and china and failed to get crucial support from africa for the necessary two-thirds of member countries ' votes in the un general assembly to change the world body 's charter .
fischer 's appeal to reform and expand the security council was lent support by the remaining g4 members on thursday , many of whom appeared optimistic about their chances .
g4 not dead " the g4 exists .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi in a speech to the un world summit , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , fresh off a thumping election victory at home , pleaded the case for change on the security council .
" the world has changed dramatically over the last 60 years .
asia and africa , once under the shackles of colonialism , are now significant players in our global community , " koizumi told other leaders .
" for the last 60 years , japan has determinedly pursued a course of development as a peace-loving nation , making a unique and significant contribution to the peace and prosperity of the world , " he said .
" the composition of the security council must reflect these fundamental changes .
japan is convinced that security council reform is a just cause for the international community - as is the deletion of the long-obsolete ' enemy state ' clauses from the un charter , " koizumi added .
japan was one of the vanquished nations in 1945 , but now has the world 's second-largest economy and is the second-biggest contributor to the un budget .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.09.2005 merkel 's fans in washington großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would a merkel victory mean for transatlantic relations ?
washington is watching sunday 's election and , secretly , hoping for a merkel victory .
but the promise of better relations is off-set by areas of potential dispute . should conservative angela merkel sweep to victory in sunday 's elections , it could mean a fresh start for strained us-german relations , according to analysts . after dipping to new lows under chancellor gerhard schröder and his center-left coalition , with differences over iraq and the partnership linking germany , france and russia undermining ties , the relationship seems to have stabilized of late .
but a victory by merkel , an atlanticist like her mentor helmut kohl , could make ties to washington a lot friendlier . " what is happening in germany is a catalyst for change , " said rockwell schnabel , former us ambassador to the european union and author of a new book on the eu and its contentious relations with the united states . merkel appears to be " a closer friend of the united states and therefore would lead a policy that would be more pro-american and pro-atlanticist , " he added . merkel 's priorities after riding a wave of anti-bush sentiment to victory in 2002 , germany 's miserable economic state has forced schröder to focus on domestic issues in his uphill battle to re-election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- might do things differently than her predecessor -lrb- left -rrb- opinion polls show that merkel , candidate for the christian democrats , has a good chance at becoming the country 's first female chancellor .
but up to 30 percent of the electorate remains undecided . merkel , 51 , has said that one of her priorities if elected would be mending the poisoned relationship with the united states , while still not sending troops to iraq .
washington is also interested in her aggressive pro-free market agenda . although bush officials refuse to publicly comment on the outcome of the sunday vote , privately they say a merkel victory would be a welcome change . a fresh start , without " leftovers " " if the administration representatives are honest they 'll tell you ' well this is a fresh start and merkel 's victory would be a good thing ' , " said jackson janes , director of the american institute for contemporary german studies . " we got a lot of leftovers with the schröder team and we 'll probably never be able to change that , so if we get a new team in berlin it 's an opportunity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jackson janes janes -lrb- photo -rrb- and others warned , however , that if merkel wins on sunday , the bush administration should n't rush to pop the champagne corks .
" i do n't think that we here in washington should escalate our expectations that her parameters would be significantly bigger than schröder 's , " janes said . dieter dettke , executive director of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , which is close to schröder 's spd , in washington , said that while merkel would certainly work hard to establish smoother lines of communication with washington , in substance there could be little change under her administration as far as foreign policy is concerned .
the turkey question one likely contentious issue , janes and dettke noted , was merkel 's opposition to turkey becoming a full member of the european union which put her at odds with washington . nonetheless , analysts say , relations under merkel are unlikely to be any worse than they have been with schröder . " i think that -lrb- if merkel wins -rrb- there 's going to be much more of an effort to say ' let 's see where we agree ... ' , " janes said . " in the case of schröder , there was a great deal of concern that they were thinking more about differences rather than commonalities .

the relatives of bavarian king ludwig ii are resigned to the fact that they have a colorful legacy to look back on , but a descendant of the king 's stable master does n't want anyone to pass that legacy onto his forebear . king ludwig ii -lrb- 1845-86 -rrb- , who was rumored to have been a good-looking man with an excellent reputation among his subjects , was known to keep a diary that documented his difficulties reconciling his catholic faith and his sexual desires .
indeed , many people suspected him of overly-friendly relationships with his male servants - especially the head of the stables .
the relationship was so well-known that it made its way into a song in alfred wolfsteiner 's book , geschichte in liedern : eine zeitreise durch die oberpfalz -lrb- history in song : a trip in time through the upper palatinate -rrb- , which alludes to a homosexual relationship between the ludwig and the stable master .
bildunterschrift : ludwig 's castle neuschwanstein while the king 's sexual preference is open to debate - he postponed his wedding numerous times before canceling it altogether - the stable master 's great-grandson michael siegfried graf von holnstein does n't want anyone calling his father 's-father 's-father gay .
" it injures his reputation and is an insult .
i 'm not going to let that happen . " he said , according to berlin 's tabloid bz . " if it remain uncontested , it could be seen as a confirmation . "
and von holnstein is n't taking it lying down , but is instead trying to protect his ancestor 's reputation by suing wolfsteiner as well as the book 's publisher , herbert wittl , for 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 305,000 -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reinventing the bavarian myth once a rural kingdom , bavaria has turned into one of germany 's high-tech centers .

merkel herself has said the franco-german motor would continue if she became chancellor , through she stated it would not be an " exclusive " relationship nor one directed against other eu members .

she is vehemently opposed to turkey 's bid to join the european union , which could please chirac .
initially an enthusiastic supporter of ankara 's bid , he has become more ambivalent on the subject after the french electorate made clear its resistance to the idea .
merkel was also likely to continue the current government 's soft-spoken approach on human rights in both russia and china but stop short of echoing current german chancellor gerhard schröder 's and chirac 's call to lift the eu arms embargo against beijing .
in the end , though , a long-awaited turnaround in the economic fortunes of the two countries may be the impetus to revive their partnership .

washington is watching sunday 's election and , secretly , hoping for a merkel victory .
but the promise of better relations is off-set by areas of potential dispute . should conservative angela merkel sweep to victory in sunday 's elections , it could mean a fresh start for strained us-german relations , according to analysts . after dipping to new lows under chancellor gerhard schröder and his center-left coalition , with differences over iraq and the partnership linking germany , france and russia undermining ties , the relationship seems to have stabilized of late .
but a victory by merkel , an atlanticist like her mentor helmut kohl , could make ties to washington a lot friendlier . " what is happening in germany is a catalyst for change , " said rockwell schnabel , former us ambassador to the european union and author of a new book on the eu and its contentious relations with the united states . merkel appears to be " a closer friend of the united states and therefore would lead a policy that would be more pro-american and pro-atlanticist , " he added . merkel 's priorities after riding a wave of anti-bush sentiment to victory in 2002 , germany 's miserable economic state has forced schröder to focus on domestic issues in his uphill battle to re-election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- might do things differently than her predecessor -lrb- left -rrb- opinion polls show that merkel , candidate for the christian democrats , has a good chance at becoming the country 's first female chancellor .
but up to 30 percent of the electorate remains undecided . merkel , 51 , has said that one of her priorities if elected would be mending the poisoned relationship with the united states , while still not sending troops to iraq .
washington is also interested in her aggressive pro-free market agenda . although bush officials refuse to publicly comment on the outcome of the sunday vote , privately they say a merkel victory would be a welcome change . a fresh start , without " leftovers " " if the administration representatives are honest they 'll tell you ' well this is a fresh start and merkel 's victory would be a good thing ' , " said jackson janes , director of the american institute for contemporary german studies . " we got a lot of leftovers with the schröder team and we 'll probably never be able to change that , so if we get a new team in berlin it 's an opportunity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jackson janes janes -lrb- photo -rrb- and others warned , however , that if merkel wins on sunday , the bush administration should n't rush to pop the champagne corks .
" i do n't think that we here in washington should escalate our expectations that her parameters would be significantly bigger than schröder 's , " janes said . dieter dettke , executive director of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , which is close to schröder 's spd , in washington , said that while merkel would certainly work hard to establish smoother lines of communication with washington , in substance there could be little change under her administration as far as foreign policy is concerned .
the turkey question one likely contentious issue , janes and dettke noted , was merkel 's opposition to turkey becoming a full member of the european union which put her at odds with washington . nonetheless , analysts say , relations under merkel are unlikely to be any worse than they have been with schröder . " i think that -lrb- if merkel wins -rrb- there 's going to be much more of an effort to say ' let 's see where we agree ... ' , " janes said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.09.2005 merkel 's fans in washington großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would a merkel victory mean for transatlantic relations ?
washington is watching sunday 's election and , secretly , hoping for a merkel victory .
but the promise of better relations is off-set by areas of potential dispute . should conservative angela merkel sweep to victory in sunday 's elections , it could mean a fresh start for strained us-german relations , according to analysts . after dipping to new lows under chancellor gerhard schröder and his center-left coalition , with differences over iraq and the partnership linking germany , france and russia undermining ties , the relationship seems to have stabilized of late .
but a victory by merkel , an atlanticist like her mentor helmut kohl , could make ties to washington a lot friendlier . " what is happening in germany is a catalyst for change , " said rockwell schnabel , former us ambassador to the european union and author of a new book on the eu and its contentious relations with the united states . merkel appears to be " a closer friend of the united states and therefore would lead a policy that would be more pro-american and pro-atlanticist , " he added . merkel 's priorities after riding a wave of anti-bush sentiment to victory in 2002 , germany 's miserable economic state has forced schröder to focus on domestic issues in his uphill battle to re-election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- might do things differently than her predecessor -lrb- left -rrb- opinion polls show that merkel , candidate for the christian democrats , has a good chance at becoming the country 's first female chancellor .
but up to 30 percent of the electorate remains undecided . merkel , 51 , has said that one of her priorities if elected would be mending the poisoned relationship with the united states , while still not sending troops to iraq .
washington is also interested in her aggressive pro-free market agenda . although bush officials refuse to publicly comment on the outcome of the sunday vote , privately they say a merkel victory would be a welcome change . a fresh start , without " leftovers " " if the administration representatives are honest they 'll tell you ' well this is a fresh start and merkel 's victory would be a good thing ' , " said jackson janes , director of the american institute for contemporary german studies . " we got a lot of leftovers with the schröder team and we 'll probably never be able to change that , so if we get a new team in berlin it 's an opportunity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jackson janes janes -lrb- photo -rrb- and others warned , however , that if merkel wins on sunday , the bush administration should n't rush to pop the champagne corks .
" i do n't think that we here in washington should escalate our expectations that her parameters would be significantly bigger than schröder 's , " janes said . dieter dettke , executive director of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , which is close to schröder 's spd , in washington , said that while merkel would certainly work hard to establish smoother lines of communication with washington , in substance there could be little change under her administration as far as foreign policy is concerned .
the turkey question one likely contentious issue , janes and dettke noted , was merkel 's opposition to turkey becoming a full member of the european union which put her at odds with washington . nonetheless , analysts say , relations under merkel are unlikely to be any worse than they have been with schröder . " i think that -lrb- if merkel wins -rrb- there 's going to be much more of an effort to say ' let 's see where we agree ... ' , " janes said . " in the case of schröder , there was a great deal of concern that they were thinking more about differences rather than commonalities .

the relatives of bavarian king ludwig ii are resigned to the fact that they have a colorful legacy to look back on , but a descendant of the king 's stable master does n't want anyone to pass that legacy onto his forebear . king ludwig ii -lrb- 1845-86 -rrb- , who was rumored to have been a good-looking man with an excellent reputation among his subjects , was known to keep a diary that documented his difficulties reconciling his catholic faith and his sexual desires .
indeed , many people suspected him of overly-friendly relationships with his male servants - especially the head of the stables .
the relationship was so well-known that it made its way into a song in alfred wolfsteiner 's book , geschichte in liedern : eine zeitreise durch die oberpfalz -lrb- history in song : a trip in time through the upper palatinate -rrb- , which alludes to a homosexual relationship between the ludwig and the stable master .

" it injures his reputation and is an insult .
i 'm not going to let that happen . " he said , according to berlin 's tabloid bz . " if it remain uncontested , it could be seen as a confirmation . "
and von holnstein is n't taking it lying down , but is instead trying to protect his ancestor 's reputation by suing wolfsteiner as well as the book 's publisher , herbert wittl , for 250,000 euros -lrb- $ 305,000 -rrb- . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reinventing the bavarian myth once a rural kingdom , bavaria has turned into one of germany 's high-tech centers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.09.2005 eu fails to agree in deadlock over turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is still divided on how turkey fits in the bloc european union member states again failed to agree on friday how to respond to turkey 's refusal to recognize cyprus , clouding ankara 's eu prospects as it prepares to start entry talks next month . eu diplomats said that a meeting of ambassadors from the european union 's 25 states - their second this week - ended without a response , deemed politically important before the accession negotiations begin on october 3 .
" the meeting of the ambassadors is over .
there has not been any major shift in the countries ' positions , " one diplomat told reuters .
the eu 's british presidency , which has been trying to resolve the issue for weeks , has conceded that it may have to call a special meeting of eu foreign ministers , possibly on sept .
26 , an agreement can not be reached soon .
still hope for a deal but a presidency spokesman tried to sound upbeat after the ambassadors met .
" it was a good discussion .
considerable progress was made and we hope to reach an agreement soon , " he said .
" we remain hopeful that we wo n't have to drag the ministers to brussels . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has been unwilling to recognize the nikosia government turkey drew criticism in july when , while signing a protocol extending a customs accord with the eu to the bloc 's 10 newest states - including cyprus - it simultaneously declared this did not amount to a recognition of the nicosia government .
the eu ministers are seeking agreement on a " counter-declaration , " but differences over how strongly it should press ankara to recognize the island member state have so far prevented an accord .
cyprus , which gained independence from britain in 1960 , has struggled to emerge from its three-decade-long division into predominantly greek-cypriot and turkish-cypriot sectors .
the island has been split since 1974 when the turkish military occupied the northern third in response to a greek-inspired coup .
turkey supports the turkish cypriot breakaway state in the north of the mediterranean island , while cyprus 's greek cypriot government represents the whole island in the eu .
british-french agreement fails earlier this week , britain and france sought support for a compromise stating that turkey should recognize cyprus before joining , but that failed to win enough backing when the ambassadors first met on wednesday .
the latest draft for the friday meeting , seen by afp , contained a paragraph proposing that the eu tell ankara that " prior recognition of all member states is a necessary component of accession . "
without providing additional details , an eu diplomat said that cyprus , its closest ally greece as well as the czech republic had refused to accept the wording .
cyprus previously stated it wanted the eu to create deadlines for turkey to fulfill in its process of recognizing the mediterranean island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus wants access to turkish ports and airports cyprus wants access to turkish ports the draft also warned that failure by turkey to fully implement the ankara accord - notably by allowing cypriot ships and planes to use its ports and airports - will slow down the pace of membership talks .
" failure to implement its obligations in full will affect the overall progress in the negotiations , " the draft said .
the eu diplomat said that this warning " was acceptable to all member states . "
while the eu debates what position to take , ankara has grown increasingly impatient , with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan accusing the bloc of " rude " diplomatic conduct for placing new conditions on its bid to become a member .
turkey said it would recognize cyprus only after a broad international agreement , possibly sponsored by the united nations , to end the division of the island .
ankara argues that although it occupied the northern part of the island in 1974 to protect the turkish population following a pro-greek coup , it is not responsible for the continuing division of cyprus . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de uk and france mull deal on turkey standoff britain and france have agreed that turkey must recognize cyprus before joining the european union , as a possible compromise to clear the way for accession talks next month , according to diplomatic sources .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.09.2005 eu fails to agree in deadlock over turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is still divided on how turkey fits in the bloc european union member states again failed to agree on friday how to respond to turkey 's refusal to recognize cyprus , clouding ankara 's eu prospects as it prepares to start entry talks next month . eu diplomats said that a meeting of ambassadors from the european union 's 25 states - their second this week - ended without a response , deemed politically important before the accession negotiations begin on october 3 .
" the meeting of the ambassadors is over .
there has not been any major shift in the countries ' positions , " one diplomat told reuters .
the eu 's british presidency , which has been trying to resolve the issue for weeks , has conceded that it may have to call a special meeting of eu foreign ministers , possibly on sept .
26 , an agreement can not be reached soon .
still hope for a deal but a presidency spokesman tried to sound upbeat after the ambassadors met .
" it was a good discussion .
considerable progress was made and we hope to reach an agreement soon , " he said .
" we remain hopeful that we wo n't have to drag the ministers to brussels . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has been unwilling to recognize the nikosia government turkey drew criticism in july when , while signing a protocol extending a customs accord with the eu to the bloc 's 10 newest states - including cyprus - it simultaneously declared this did not amount to a recognition of the nicosia government .
the eu ministers are seeking agreement on a " counter-declaration , " but differences over how strongly it should press ankara to recognize the island member state have so far prevented an accord .
cyprus , which gained independence from britain in 1960 , has struggled to emerge from its three-decade-long division into predominantly greek-cypriot and turkish-cypriot sectors .
the island has been split since 1974 when the turkish military occupied the northern third in response to a greek-inspired coup .
turkey supports the turkish cypriot breakaway state in the north of the mediterranean island , while cyprus 's greek cypriot government represents the whole island in the eu .
british-french agreement fails earlier this week , britain and france sought support for a compromise stating that turkey should recognize cyprus before joining , but that failed to win enough backing when the ambassadors first met on wednesday .
the latest draft for the friday meeting , seen by afp , contained a paragraph proposing that the eu tell ankara that " prior recognition of all member states is a necessary component of accession . "
without providing additional details , an eu diplomat said that cyprus , its closest ally greece as well as the czech republic had refused to accept the wording .
cyprus previously stated it wanted the eu to create deadlines for turkey to fulfill in its process of recognizing the mediterranean island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus wants access to turkish ports and airports cyprus wants access to turkish ports the draft also warned that failure by turkey to fully implement the ankara accord - notably by allowing cypriot ships and planes to use its ports and airports - will slow down the pace of membership talks .
" failure to implement its obligations in full will affect the overall progress in the negotiations , " the draft said .
the eu diplomat said that this warning " was acceptable to all member states . "
while the eu debates what position to take , ankara has grown increasingly impatient , with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan accusing the bloc of " rude " diplomatic conduct for placing new conditions on its bid to become a member .
turkey said it would recognize cyprus only after a broad international agreement , possibly sponsored by the united nations , to end the division of the island .
ankara argues that although it occupied the northern part of the island in 1974 to protect the turkish population following a pro-greek coup , it is not responsible for the continuing division of cyprus . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de uk and france mull deal on turkey standoff britain and france have agreed that turkey must recognize cyprus before joining the european union , as a possible compromise to clear the way for accession talks next month , according to diplomatic sources .

" the meeting of the ambassadors is over .
there has not been any major shift in the countries ' positions , " one diplomat told reuters .
the eu 's british presidency , which has been trying to resolve the issue for weeks , has conceded that it may have to call a special meeting of eu foreign ministers , possibly on sept .
26 , an agreement can not be reached soon .
still hope for a deal but a presidency spokesman tried to sound upbeat after the ambassadors met .
" it was a good discussion .
considerable progress was made and we hope to reach an agreement soon , " he said .
" we remain hopeful that we wo n't have to drag the ministers to brussels . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has been unwilling to recognize the nikosia government turkey drew criticism in july when , while signing a protocol extending a customs accord with the eu to the bloc 's 10 newest states - including cyprus - it simultaneously declared this did not amount to a recognition of the nicosia government .
the eu ministers are seeking agreement on a " counter-declaration , " but differences over how strongly it should press ankara to recognize the island member state have so far prevented an accord .
cyprus , which gained independence from britain in 1960 , has struggled to emerge from its three-decade-long division into predominantly greek-cypriot and turkish-cypriot sectors .
the island has been split since 1974 when the turkish military occupied the northern third in response to a greek-inspired coup .
turkey supports the turkish cypriot breakaway state in the north of the mediterranean island , while cyprus 's greek cypriot government represents the whole island in the eu .
british-french agreement fails earlier this week , britain and france sought support for a compromise stating that turkey should recognize cyprus before joining , but that failed to win enough backing when the ambassadors first met on wednesday .
the latest draft for the friday meeting , seen by afp , contained a paragraph proposing that the eu tell ankara that " prior recognition of all member states is a necessary component of accession . "
without providing additional details , an eu diplomat said that cyprus , its closest ally greece as well as the czech republic had refused to accept the wording .
cyprus previously stated it wanted the eu to create deadlines for turkey to fulfill in its process of recognizing the mediterranean island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus wants access to turkish ports and airports cyprus wants access to turkish ports the draft also warned that failure by turkey to fully implement the ankara accord - notably by allowing cypriot ships and planes to use its ports and airports - will slow down the pace of membership talks .
" failure to implement its obligations in full will affect the overall progress in the negotiations , " the draft said .
the eu diplomat said that this warning " was acceptable to all member states . "
while the eu debates what position to take , ankara has grown increasingly impatient , with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan accusing the bloc of " rude " diplomatic conduct for placing new conditions on its bid to become a member .
turkey said it would recognize cyprus only after a broad international agreement , possibly sponsored by the united nations , to end the division of the island .
ankara argues that although it occupied the northern part of the island in 1974 to protect the turkish population following a pro-greek coup , it is not responsible for the continuing division of cyprus . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de uk and france mull deal on turkey standoff britain and france have agreed that turkey must recognize cyprus before joining the european union , as a possible compromise to clear the way for accession talks next month , according to diplomatic sources .

waits is known to staunchly oppose commercialization of his music .

" the moon is the next worthy goal , " said astronaut manfred messerschmid during the symposium , adding that the celestial body is only 1,000 hours away from the earth , unlike mars which takes a 1,000 days to reach .
the companies also urged the creation of an unmanned european research station on the moon .
they said in a statement that a gigantic long wave radio telescope would be installed on the back of the moon by 2015 to research a completely unknown side of the universe .
the aerospace firms added that they hoped the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- would shoulder the costs of the project which is estimated at around 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- .

that 's too late for the scientists , researchers and industry representatives assembled in bremen on thursday , who stressed that europe had to do more , and quickly , in space research if it wanted to keep up with other nations .
manfred fuchs , head of the bremen-based aerospace company ohb said that other countries had long been involved in missions to the moon .
he criticized the fact that the issue unfortunately " is n't the first priority " in europe and warned that germany , as the biggest country in europe , could n't afford to sit back while countries such as the us , russia , japan , china and india planned and realized their own space programs .

evert dudok , president of eads space transportation , said that a central problem in germany was the slim budget for space research .
that amount plus the funds germany receives from esa add up to just about 700 million euros , dudok pointed out and added that the budget for this year had already been completely allocated .

messerschmidt said that the german research ministry 's budget allocation for space research had already fallen to 11 percent from 20 percent .
" we have to stop this process , " messerschmit said .
manfred fuchs pointed out that nations like japan had already massively increased their space research budgets .
however , a spokesman for the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- was skeptical of the ambitious plans of aerospace industry representatives .
he told spiegel online that the " big goal " of the dlr remained the international space station iss and the docking of the european space research module colombus .
a " quantum leap " aerospace industry experts for now have pinned their hopes on a more realistic goal : building a giant radio telescope on the moon by 2015 , which in dudok 's words would bring a " quantum leap for radio astronomy . "

" the moon is the next worthy goal , " said astronaut manfred messerschmid during the symposium , adding that the celestial body is only 1,000 hours away from the earth , unlike mars which takes a 1,000 days to reach .
the companies also urged the creation of an unmanned european research station on the moon .
they said in a statement that a gigantic long wave radio telescope would be installed on the back of the moon by 2015 to research a completely unknown side of the universe .
the aerospace firms added that they hoped the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- would shoulder the costs of the project which is estimated at around 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- .
esa , which is headquartered in paris , is expected to debate the issue during its next conference , in december .
europe could lag in space exploration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa 's aurora mission will explore the solar system esa 's aurora project , which began in 2001 , does include plans for a manned mars mission as well as a manned mission to the moon .
esa wants to head to mars and the moon , but not before 2033 and 2024 respectively .
that 's too late for the scientists , researchers and industry representatives assembled in bremen on thursday , who stressed that europe had to do more , and quickly , in space research if it wanted to keep up with other nations .
manfred fuchs , head of the bremen-based aerospace company ohb said that other countries had long been involved in missions to the moon .
he criticized the fact that the issue unfortunately " is n't the first priority " in europe and warned that germany , as the biggest country in europe , could n't afford to sit back while countries such as the us , russia , japan , china and india planned and realized their own space programs .
money the biggest problem most scientists and industry representatives admitted that the biggest stumbling block to european aerospace research is the paucity of funds .
evert dudok , president of eads space transportation , said that a central problem in germany was the slim budget for space research .
that amount plus the funds germany receives from esa add up to just about 700 million euros , dudok pointed out and added that the budget for this year had already been completely allocated .
" we demand a raise of 15 percent or 100 million euros to finally get some leeway , " he said .

messerschmidt said that the german research ministry 's budget allocation for space research had already fallen to 11 percent from 20 percent .
" we have to stop this process , " messerschmit said .
manfred fuchs pointed out that nations like japan had already massively increased their space research budgets .
however , a spokesman for the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- was skeptical of the ambitious plans of aerospace industry representatives .
he told spiegel online that the " big goal " of the dlr remained the international space station iss and the docking of the european space research module colombus .
a " quantum leap " aerospace industry experts for now have pinned their hopes on a more realistic goal : building a giant radio telescope on the moon by 2015 , which in dudok 's words would bring a " quantum leap for radio astronomy . "
eads space transportation is already working with dutch researchers on the telescope .
the apparatus , which will be transported with the help of a ariane 5 rocket , will consist of 100 small antennae and will cover an initial radius of 300 meters , if all goes according to plan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.09.2005 germany 's unions face decisive moment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionally a force in germany , unions ' power is on the wane many are calling the upcoming vote key to determining germany 's economic future .
it 's just as crucial for the country 's trade unions , which could see their power greatly reduced by a conservative-liberal government . the chairman of germany 's dgb trade union federation , michael sommer , was all smiles as he stood side by side with chancellor gerhard schröder last week at the dgb headquarters .
just months ago , the two would n't even shake each the other 's hand after the bitter recriminations that were thrown from both sides over welfare and labor market reforms put in place by schröder .
at the kiss-and-make-up session , however , sommer was , while not commanding , strongly suggesting that germany 's trade union members vote for schröder and keep the current social democratic-green coalition in power for four more years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer , dgb chairman , right , and chancellor gerhard schröder , left , brief the media following their their talks at the dgb headquarters in berlin .
" it 's about nothing less than determining the future of this society , " sommer said .
in the back of his mind , however , he might have been thinking about the future of germany 's trade union movement , which is looking more uncertain these days , especially if a coalition of angela merkel 's conservative union bloc and the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- form the next government .
while sommer had his problems with his traditional allies - schröder 's social democrats , whose reforms were seen as " socially unjust " - the alternative looks even worse .
in these somewhat desperate times , better to go with the lesser of two evils .
" if the majority of voters vote for the union and the fdp , these parties could attempt to break the back of the unions , like margaret thatcher did in great britain , " sommer told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
and while once unions in the uk were mighty forces , today they are but a shadow of their former selves .
" unions lost that fight -lrb- over reforms -rrb- , " said hagen lesch , an expert on wage policy at the cologne institute for economic research .
" the thinking is to hang on to what they have now . "
traditional force trade unions in germany have traditionally been a powerful force in the labor market .
unions , in often tough negotiations with employers , set wage agreements that apply to entire sectors of the labor market .
in the postwar era , that has translated into regular pay increases for workers , generous holiday and sick-time allowances , and labor conditions that are the envy of much of the world .
bildunterschrift : steelworkers protesting but things have changed on the labor landscape and the once shining reputation of german trade unions is looking tarnished .
the country 's unemployment rate , which has been rising since the 1970s and is now at almost 12 percent , seems impossible to get down .
the pressures of globalization and the outsourcing of many manufacturing jobs means the traditional models - a job for life , an ever-increasing standard of living , cradle-to-grave security - are proving unsustainable .
the economy is stuck with anemic growth rates and often hovers just above recession .
economists , business leaders and some politicians have been calling for reform , for more self-responsibility , more flexibility and less government intervention and state support .
unions have resisted those appeals , claiming they hurt workers , and have begun to be seen - depending on which side of the labor and political spectrum one stands - as roadblocks to growth or protectors of the common man .
however , among the political classes , the former category of opinion appears to be in the ascendant .
change , it is a-comin ' ?
the conservative cdu party , led by angela merkel , who is likely to become germany 's next , and first female , chancellor , has said the unions will likely be looking at change if she forms the next government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel she wants to take away some of their most cherished power - that of setting sector-wide wage agreements - and allow staff and management at individual companies to decide if they want to determine their own pay scales .
merkel has said she wants germany to continue to have strong unions , but that they should be more flexible .
" one ca n't say you 're for a strong union and at the same time , erode wage autonomy .

it 's just as crucial for the country 's trade unions , which could see their power greatly reduced by a conservative-liberal government . the chairman of germany 's dgb trade union federation , michael sommer , was all smiles as he stood side by side with chancellor gerhard schröder last week at the dgb headquarters .
just months ago , the two would n't even shake each the other 's hand after the bitter recriminations that were thrown from both sides over welfare and labor market reforms put in place by schröder .
at the kiss-and-make-up session , however , sommer was , while not commanding , strongly suggesting that germany 's trade union members vote for schröder and keep the current social democratic-green coalition in power for four more years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer , dgb chairman , right , and chancellor gerhard schröder , left , brief the media following their their talks at the dgb headquarters in berlin .
" it 's about nothing less than determining the future of this society , " sommer said .
in the back of his mind , however , he might have been thinking about the future of germany 's trade union movement , which is looking more uncertain these days , especially if a coalition of angela merkel 's conservative union bloc and the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- form the next government .
while sommer had his problems with his traditional allies - schröder 's social democrats , whose reforms were seen as " socially unjust " - the alternative looks even worse .
in these somewhat desperate times , better to go with the lesser of two evils .
" if the majority of voters vote for the union and the fdp , these parties could attempt to break the back of the unions , like margaret thatcher did in great britain , " sommer told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
and while once unions in the uk were mighty forces , today they are but a shadow of their former selves .
" unions lost that fight -lrb- over reforms -rrb- , " said hagen lesch , an expert on wage policy at the cologne institute for economic research .
" the thinking is to hang on to what they have now . "
traditional force trade unions in germany have traditionally been a powerful force in the labor market .
unions , in often tough negotiations with employers , set wage agreements that apply to entire sectors of the labor market .
in the postwar era , that has translated into regular pay increases for workers , generous holiday and sick-time allowances , and labor conditions that are the envy of much of the world .
bildunterschrift : steelworkers protesting but things have changed on the labor landscape and the once shining reputation of german trade unions is looking tarnished .
the country 's unemployment rate , which has been rising since the 1970s and is now at almost 12 percent , seems impossible to get down .
the pressures of globalization and the outsourcing of many manufacturing jobs means the traditional models - a job for life , an ever-increasing standard of living , cradle-to-grave security - are proving unsustainable .
the economy is stuck with anemic growth rates and often hovers just above recession .
economists , business leaders and some politicians have been calling for reform , for more self-responsibility , more flexibility and less government intervention and state support .
unions have resisted those appeals , claiming they hurt workers , and have begun to be seen - depending on which side of the labor and political spectrum one stands - as roadblocks to growth or protectors of the common man .
however , among the political classes , the former category of opinion appears to be in the ascendant .
change , it is a-comin ' ?
the conservative cdu party , led by angela merkel , who is likely to become germany 's next , and first female , chancellor , has said the unions will likely be looking at change if she forms the next government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel she wants to take away some of their most cherished power - that of setting sector-wide wage agreements - and allow staff and management at individual companies to decide if they want to determine their own pay scales .
merkel has said she wants germany to continue to have strong unions , but that they should be more flexible .
" one ca n't say you 're for a strong union and at the same time , erode wage autonomy .
that 's a contradiction , " said hans-joachim schabedoth , head of the policy department of the dgb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.09.2005 germany 's unions face decisive moment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionally a force in germany , unions ' power is on the wane many are calling the upcoming vote key to determining germany 's economic future .
it 's just as crucial for the country 's trade unions , which could see their power greatly reduced by a conservative-liberal government . the chairman of germany 's dgb trade union federation , michael sommer , was all smiles as he stood side by side with chancellor gerhard schröder last week at the dgb headquarters .
just months ago , the two would n't even shake each the other 's hand after the bitter recriminations that were thrown from both sides over welfare and labor market reforms put in place by schröder .
at the kiss-and-make-up session , however , sommer was , while not commanding , strongly suggesting that germany 's trade union members vote for schröder and keep the current social democratic-green coalition in power for four more years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer , dgb chairman , right , and chancellor gerhard schröder , left , brief the media following their their talks at the dgb headquarters in berlin .
" it 's about nothing less than determining the future of this society , " sommer said .
in the back of his mind , however , he might have been thinking about the future of germany 's trade union movement , which is looking more uncertain these days , especially if a coalition of angela merkel 's conservative union bloc and the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- form the next government .
while sommer had his problems with his traditional allies - schröder 's social democrats , whose reforms were seen as " socially unjust " - the alternative looks even worse .
in these somewhat desperate times , better to go with the lesser of two evils .
" if the majority of voters vote for the union and the fdp , these parties could attempt to break the back of the unions , like margaret thatcher did in great britain , " sommer told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
and while once unions in the uk were mighty forces , today they are but a shadow of their former selves .
" unions lost that fight -lrb- over reforms -rrb- , " said hagen lesch , an expert on wage policy at the cologne institute for economic research .
" the thinking is to hang on to what they have now . "
traditional force trade unions in germany have traditionally been a powerful force in the labor market .
unions , in often tough negotiations with employers , set wage agreements that apply to entire sectors of the labor market .
in the postwar era , that has translated into regular pay increases for workers , generous holiday and sick-time allowances , and labor conditions that are the envy of much of the world .
bildunterschrift : steelworkers protesting but things have changed on the labor landscape and the once shining reputation of german trade unions is looking tarnished .
the country 's unemployment rate , which has been rising since the 1970s and is now at almost 12 percent , seems impossible to get down .
the pressures of globalization and the outsourcing of many manufacturing jobs means the traditional models - a job for life , an ever-increasing standard of living , cradle-to-grave security - are proving unsustainable .
the economy is stuck with anemic growth rates and often hovers just above recession .
economists , business leaders and some politicians have been calling for reform , for more self-responsibility , more flexibility and less government intervention and state support .
unions have resisted those appeals , claiming they hurt workers , and have begun to be seen - depending on which side of the labor and political spectrum one stands - as roadblocks to growth or protectors of the common man .
however , among the political classes , the former category of opinion appears to be in the ascendant .
change , it is a-comin ' ?
the conservative cdu party , led by angela merkel , who is likely to become germany 's next , and first female , chancellor , has said the unions will likely be looking at change if she forms the next government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel she wants to take away some of their most cherished power - that of setting sector-wide wage agreements - and allow staff and management at individual companies to decide if they want to determine their own pay scales .
merkel has said she wants germany to continue to have strong unions , but that they should be more flexible .
" one ca n't say you 're for a strong union and at the same time , erode wage autonomy .
that 's a contradiction , " said hans-joachim schabedoth , head of the policy department of the dgb .
according to him , conservatives are playing a dangerous game in attempting to eviscerate union power .
history has shown , if a government wants to maintain a majority , or its popularity , it has to pay attention to union interests , he said . the current anti-union strategy was going against the best interests of the larger society , he added .
" our role is to ensure that people benefit from their own work and that social questions are considered in the larger economy so that social problems do n't grow , " he said .
" therefore we 're worried about the current state of things . "
overall decline but the role of unions , in the minds of the populace at least , seems to have lost of its importance .
de-unionization has been a phenomenon over the past two decades all over the world .
since the 1980s , the share of wage earners who are also union members has declined in all but a few countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , the trend is the same .
membership of the dgb 's affiliated trade unions dropped by nearly 5 percent in 2004 and is now at just over 7 million .
unions also face the problem of an aging membership , which does not portend well for the future .
membership of young people -lrb- 16-25 -rrb- within the dgb dropped considerably from 15 percent in the early 1980s to about 5 percent today .
that slow decline could be revved up considerably after sunday 's vote , should the center-right and the free-market liberals prove triumphant .
if unions lose their main power position - the setting of sector-wide wage agreements - it could well cause many workers to reconsider their union memberships and spend their dues money elsewhere .
other considerations by merkel & co . , such as loosening job protection laws , liberalizing store opening hours , and rethinking policies on worker participation in company management , if they go through , would also be defeats for unions and could further push them to the periphery of a germany that appears to be embarking on a more free-market course . kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder seeks unions ' support ten days ahead of germany 's general elections , chancellor gerhard schröder made a show of unity with a major trade union boss , brushing aside the repeated clashes that have marked his seven years in power .

dw-world summarizes the main points of the race set to end sept .
18 . a process that was riddled with pitfalls when it started in july will come to an end on sunday , when germans decide who will sit in the chancellery for the next four years .
already upset about his coalition 's inability to push through necessary economic and welfare reforms due to constant blockades from the opposition and inner-party bickering , and after suffering damning regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , chancellor gerhard schröder called for a vote of confidence he hoped to - and did - lose , as a way of introducing early elections .
german president horst köhler and the country 's highest court approved the move , deciding that schröder 's ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens did indeed fulfill the necessary legal criteria to dissolve parliament - not having enough of a mandate to run the government effectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler took the entire 21 days allotted to him before deciding to dissolve parliament köhler did his duty " it is my duty as president to decide this issue according to the law , " köhler -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a national television broadcast on july 22 .
" i think it is best to have a new election to let the people decide . "
the decision pleased the majority of german voters and all the major political parties .
since receiving the official thumbs up , the parties ' campaigns have been dominated by their different visions of how to deal with germany 's sluggish economy and high unemployment .
schröder urges voters to stay the course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder insists his reforms have germany on the right track in part , schröder 's unpopular market and labor reforms led to the need for new elections in the first place , but as the campaigning wraps up , he continues to insist that germany has taken the right route .
" we are going in the right direction , " schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- said during his party 's caucus .
" and we need to stay the course . "
like schröder , angela merkel , the opposition christian democratic party 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- chancellor candidate , continues zigzagging across the country holding two rallies a day to win over the voters who could tip the scales in their favor .
rather than speculating on possible coalitions - as one-third of voters are reportedly undecided - merkel has been spending more time in public trying to win votes with sharp criticism of governmental policies that she blames for nearly 5 million unemployed and a budget that continuously breaks european union stability pact rules .
" there is no reason that a re-elected spd parliamentary group would be able to implement new reforms , " she said .
" they may be willing to be in the government , but they are not able . "
union slipping in polls since debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until july , merkel 's party was well ahead of the spd in the polls , at times even enjoying an absolute majority .
but merkel has seen her lead slip away since july , when the cdu revealed plans to increase national sales tax by 2 percent .
the real downturn came after a televised debate between merkel and schröder on sept .
4 , in which the chancellor again proved himself to be both media-savvy and telegenic , while his challenger managed to squeeze through the broadcast without too many glaring gaffes .
since then , schröder has increased his party 's take of the vote to 33 percent and put an end to the newly-formed left party 's double-digit poll results .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's comments did n't give merkel much of a hand with voters unfortunate comments from edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , leader of the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , and runner-up to schröder in the 2002 election , did further damage to the conservatives ' campaign .
stoiber called eastern germans " frustrated " and less capable than the voters in his home state of bavaria .
parties split on reforms merkel 's woes have only been multiplied by paul kirchhof , a potential finance minister who the cdu leader introduced as key to the reforms her government would carry out upon election .
but members of the party base have scorned the heidelberg economics professor , saying his radical changes to germany 's tax code go too far beyond the party platform they have supported .
though the spd 's campaign has not been as turbulent as the cdu / csu 's , it remains to be seen whether schröder can earn enough votes to stay in power and carry through his reform plans , or whether the cdu / csu will get a chance at trying to bring germany back up to speed . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german election enters final phase with five days to before germany elects a new government , both chancellor gerhard schröder and opposition frontrunner angela merkel are confident they can gain a majority and avoid a so-called grand coalition .

dw-world summarizes the main points of the race set to end sept .
18 . a process that was riddled with pitfalls when it started in july will come to an end on sunday , when germans decide who will sit in the chancellery for the next four years .
already upset about his coalition 's inability to push through necessary economic and welfare reforms due to constant blockades from the opposition and inner-party bickering , and after suffering damning regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , chancellor gerhard schröder called for a vote of confidence he hoped to - and did - lose , as a way of introducing early elections .
german president horst köhler and the country 's highest court approved the move , deciding that schröder 's ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens did indeed fulfill the necessary legal criteria to dissolve parliament - not having enough of a mandate to run the government effectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler took the entire 21 days allotted to him before deciding to dissolve parliament köhler did his duty " it is my duty as president to decide this issue according to the law , " köhler -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a national television broadcast on july 22 .
" i think it is best to have a new election to let the people decide . "
the decision pleased the majority of german voters and all the major political parties .
since receiving the official thumbs up , the parties ' campaigns have been dominated by their different visions of how to deal with germany 's sluggish economy and high unemployment .
schröder urges voters to stay the course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder insists his reforms have germany on the right track in part , schröder 's unpopular market and labor reforms led to the need for new elections in the first place , but as the campaigning wraps up , he continues to insist that germany has taken the right route .
" we are going in the right direction , " schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- said during his party 's caucus .
" and we need to stay the course . "
like schröder , angela merkel , the opposition christian democratic party 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- chancellor candidate , continues zigzagging across the country holding two rallies a day to win over the voters who could tip the scales in their favor .
rather than speculating on possible coalitions - as one-third of voters are reportedly undecided - merkel has been spending more time in public trying to win votes with sharp criticism of governmental policies that she blames for nearly 5 million unemployed and a budget that continuously breaks european union stability pact rules .
" there is no reason that a re-elected spd parliamentary group would be able to implement new reforms , " she said .
" they may be willing to be in the government , but they are not able . "
union slipping in polls since debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until july , merkel 's party was well ahead of the spd in the polls , at times even enjoying an absolute majority .
but merkel has seen her lead slip away since july , when the cdu revealed plans to increase national sales tax by 2 percent .
the real downturn came after a televised debate between merkel and schröder on sept .
4 , in which the chancellor again proved himself to be both media-savvy and telegenic , while his challenger managed to squeeze through the broadcast without too many glaring gaffes .
since then , schröder has increased his party 's take of the vote to 33 percent and put an end to the newly-formed left party 's double-digit poll results .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's comments did n't give merkel much of a hand with voters unfortunate comments from edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , leader of the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , and runner-up to schröder in the 2002 election , did further damage to the conservatives ' campaign .
stoiber called eastern germans " frustrated " and less capable than the voters in his home state of bavaria .
parties split on reforms merkel 's woes have only been multiplied by paul kirchhof , a potential finance minister who the cdu leader introduced as key to the reforms her government would carry out upon election .
but members of the party base have scorned the heidelberg economics professor , saying his radical changes to germany 's tax code go too far beyond the party platform they have supported .
though the spd 's campaign has not been as turbulent as the cdu / csu 's , it remains to be seen whether schröder can earn enough votes to stay in power and carry through his reform plans , or whether the cdu / csu will get a chance at trying to bring germany back up to speed . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german election enters final phase with five days to before germany elects a new government , both chancellor gerhard schröder and opposition frontrunner angela merkel are confident they can gain a majority and avoid a so-called grand coalition .

bildunterschrift : speaking at the un general assembly , fischer stressed that unsuccessful negotiations so far about expanding the security council should be reopened .
he added that he was hopeful that a watered-down plan adopted by the general assembly to restructure the world body still " leaves the door open " for further progress . " we will continue to work patiently on reform , " the minister told german reporters .
fischer quashed rumors that reform of the un 's highest-ranking body had been put on hold , saying that " the pressure of relationships makes this reform necessary . "
he underlined that the german government was not primarily concerned about getting permanent membership , but rather wanted to bestow more legitimacy on the world body by ensuring that it no longer reflected the world of 1945 but rather that of the 21st century .
opposition from us and china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council has five permanent members - the us , russia , china , france and great britain .
the remaining ten members are elected for a period of two years .
germany has launched a joint bid along with japan , india and brazil for permanent membership .
the group known as " g4 " agreed thursday on the sidelines of the un summit to continue to pursue efforts towards that end .
the g4 had submitted a plan to boost the council 's membership from its current 15 to 25 , with six new permanent seats and four new non-permanent seats .
their first bid ran into opposition from the united states and china and failed to get crucial support from africa for the necessary two-thirds of member countries ' votes in the un general assembly to change the world body 's charter .
fischer 's appeal to reform and expand the security council was lent support by the remaining g4 members on thursday , many of whom appeared optimistic about their chances .
g4 not dead " the g4 exists .
the g4 will continue to work for united nations reform , " indian foreign minister natwar singh said .
singh added that their proposal could be reintroduced at the 60th session of the un general assembly with some changes .
" we are confident that it -lrb- reform -rrb- will happen , " said brazilian foreign minister celso amorim .
japan in particular , made a strong case for the security council to be more inclusive and meet the challenges of a changing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi in a speech to the un world summit , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , fresh off a thumping election victory at home , pleaded the case for change on the security council .
" the world has changed dramatically over the last 60 years .
asia and africa , once under the shackles of colonialism , are now significant players in our global community , " koizumi told other leaders .
" for the last 60 years , japan has determinedly pursued a course of development as a peace-loving nation , making a unique and significant contribution to the peace and prosperity of the world , " he said .
" the composition of the security council must reflect these fundamental changes .
japan is convinced that security council reform is a just cause for the international community - as is the deletion of the long-obsolete ' enemy state ' clauses from the un charter , " koizumi added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.09.2005 merkel 's fans in washington großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would a merkel victory mean for transatlantic relations ?
washington is watching sunday 's election and , secretly , hoping for a merkel victory .
but the promise of better relations is off-set by areas of potential dispute . should conservative angela merkel sweep to victory in sunday 's elections , it could mean a fresh start for strained us-german relations , according to analysts . after dipping to new lows under chancellor gerhard schröder and his center-left coalition , with differences over iraq and the partnership linking germany , france and russia undermining ties , the relationship seems to have stabilized of late .
but a victory by merkel , an atlanticist like her mentor helmut kohl , could make ties to washington a lot friendlier . " what is happening in germany is a catalyst for change , " said rockwell schnabel , former us ambassador to the european union and author of a new book on the eu and its contentious relations with the united states . merkel appears to be " a closer friend of the united states and therefore would lead a policy that would be more pro-american and pro-atlanticist , " he added . merkel 's priorities after riding a wave of anti-bush sentiment to victory in 2002 , germany 's miserable economic state has forced schröder to focus on domestic issues in his uphill battle to re-election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- might do things differently than her predecessor -lrb- left -rrb- opinion polls show that merkel , candidate for the christian democrats , has a good chance at becoming the country 's first female chancellor .
but up to 30 percent of the electorate remains undecided . merkel , 51 , has said that one of her priorities if elected would be mending the poisoned relationship with the united states , while still not sending troops to iraq .
washington is also interested in her aggressive pro-free market agenda . although bush officials refuse to publicly comment on the outcome of the sunday vote , privately they say a merkel victory would be a welcome change . a fresh start , without " leftovers " " if the administration representatives are honest they 'll tell you ' well this is a fresh start and merkel 's victory would be a good thing ' , " said jackson janes , director of the american institute for contemporary german studies . " we got a lot of leftovers with the schröder team and we 'll probably never be able to change that , so if we get a new team in berlin it 's an opportunity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jackson janes janes -lrb- photo -rrb- and others warned , however , that if merkel wins on sunday , the bush administration should n't rush to pop the champagne corks .
" i do n't think that we here in washington should escalate our expectations that her parameters would be significantly bigger than schröder 's , " janes said . dieter dettke , executive director of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , which is close to schröder 's spd , in washington , said that while merkel would certainly work hard to establish smoother lines of communication with washington , in substance there could be little change under her administration as far as foreign policy is concerned .
the turkey question one likely contentious issue , janes and dettke noted , was merkel 's opposition to turkey becoming a full member of the european union which put her at odds with washington . nonetheless , analysts say , relations under merkel are unlikely to be any worse than they have been with schröder . " i think that -lrb- if merkel wins -rrb- there 's going to be much more of an effort to say ' let 's see where we agree ... ' , " janes said . " in the case of schröder , there was a great deal of concern that they were thinking more about differences rather than commonalities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.09.2005 germany 's unions face decisive moment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditionally a force in germany , unions ' power is on the wane many are calling the upcoming vote key to determining germany 's economic future .
it 's just as crucial for the country 's trade unions , which could see their power greatly reduced by a conservative-liberal government . the chairman of germany 's dgb trade union federation , michael sommer , was all smiles as he stood side by side with chancellor gerhard schröder last week at the dgb headquarters .
just months ago , the two would n't even shake each the other 's hand after the bitter recriminations that were thrown from both sides over welfare and labor market reforms put in place by schröder .
at the kiss-and-make-up session , however , sommer was , while not commanding , strongly suggesting that germany 's trade union members vote for schröder and keep the current social democratic-green coalition in power for four more years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer , dgb chairman , right , and chancellor gerhard schröder , left , brief the media following their their talks at the dgb headquarters in berlin .
" it 's about nothing less than determining the future of this society , " sommer said .
in the back of his mind , however , he might have been thinking about the future of germany 's trade union movement , which is looking more uncertain these days , especially if a coalition of angela merkel 's conservative union bloc and the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- form the next government .
while sommer had his problems with his traditional allies - schröder 's social democrats , whose reforms were seen as " socially unjust " - the alternative looks even worse .
in these somewhat desperate times , better to go with the lesser of two evils .
" if the majority of voters vote for the union and the fdp , these parties could attempt to break the back of the unions , like margaret thatcher did in great britain , " sommer told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
and while once unions in the uk were mighty forces , today they are but a shadow of their former selves .
" unions lost that fight -lrb- over reforms -rrb- , " said hagen lesch , an expert on wage policy at the cologne institute for economic research .
" the thinking is to hang on to what they have now . "
traditional force trade unions in germany have traditionally been a powerful force in the labor market .
unions , in often tough negotiations with employers , set wage agreements that apply to entire sectors of the labor market .
in the postwar era , that has translated into regular pay increases for workers , generous holiday and sick-time allowances , and labor conditions that are the envy of much of the world .
bildunterschrift : steelworkers protesting but things have changed on the labor landscape and the once shining reputation of german trade unions is looking tarnished .
the country 's unemployment rate , which has been rising since the 1970s and is now at almost 12 percent , seems impossible to get down .
the pressures of globalization and the outsourcing of many manufacturing jobs means the traditional models - a job for life , an ever-increasing standard of living , cradle-to-grave security - are proving unsustainable .
the economy is stuck with anemic growth rates and often hovers just above recession .
economists , business leaders and some politicians have been calling for reform , for more self-responsibility , more flexibility and less government intervention and state support .
unions have resisted those appeals , claiming they hurt workers , and have begun to be seen - depending on which side of the labor and political spectrum one stands - as roadblocks to growth or protectors of the common man .
however , among the political classes , the former category of opinion appears to be in the ascendant .
change , it is a-comin ' ?
the conservative cdu party , led by angela merkel , who is likely to become germany 's next , and first female , chancellor , has said the unions will likely be looking at change if she forms the next government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel she wants to take away some of their most cherished power - that of setting sector-wide wage agreements - and allow staff and management at individual companies to decide if they want to determine their own pay scales .
merkel has said she wants germany to continue to have strong unions , but that they should be more flexible .
" one ca n't say you 're for a strong union and at the same time , erode wage autonomy .
that 's a contradiction , " said hans-joachim schabedoth , head of the policy department of the dgb .
according to him , conservatives are playing a dangerous game in attempting to eviscerate union power .
history has shown , if a government wants to maintain a majority , or its popularity , it has to pay attention to union interests , he said . the current anti-union strategy was going against the best interests of the larger society , he added .
" our role is to ensure that people benefit from their own work and that social questions are considered in the larger economy so that social problems do n't grow , " he said .
" therefore we 're worried about the current state of things . "
overall decline but the role of unions , in the minds of the populace at least , seems to have lost of its importance .
de-unionization has been a phenomenon over the past two decades all over the world .
since the 1980s , the share of wage earners who are also union members has declined in all but a few countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , the trend is the same .
membership of the dgb 's affiliated trade unions dropped by nearly 5 percent in 2004 and is now at just over 7 million .
unions also face the problem of an aging membership , which does not portend well for the future .
membership of young people -lrb- 16-25 -rrb- within the dgb dropped considerably from 15 percent in the early 1980s to about 5 percent today .
that slow decline could be revved up considerably after sunday 's vote , should the center-right and the free-market liberals prove triumphant .
if unions lose their main power position - the setting of sector-wide wage agreements - it could well cause many workers to reconsider their union memberships and spend their dues money elsewhere .
other considerations by merkel & co . , such as loosening job protection laws , liberalizing store opening hours , and rethinking policies on worker participation in company management , if they go through , would also be defeats for unions and could further push them to the periphery of a germany that appears to be embarking on a more free-market course . kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder seeks unions ' support ten days ahead of germany 's general elections , chancellor gerhard schröder made a show of unity with a major trade union boss , brushing aside the repeated clashes that have marked his seven years in power .

it 's just as crucial for the country 's trade unions , which could see their power greatly reduced by a conservative-liberal government . the chairman of germany 's dgb trade union federation , michael sommer , was all smiles as he stood side by side with chancellor gerhard schröder last week at the dgb headquarters .
just months ago , the two would n't even shake each the other 's hand after the bitter recriminations that were thrown from both sides over welfare and labor market reforms put in place by schröder .
at the kiss-and-make-up session , however , sommer was , while not commanding , strongly suggesting that germany 's trade union members vote for schröder and keep the current social democratic-green coalition in power for four more years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer , dgb chairman , right , and chancellor gerhard schröder , left , brief the media following their their talks at the dgb headquarters in berlin .
" it 's about nothing less than determining the future of this society , " sommer said .
in the back of his mind , however , he might have been thinking about the future of germany 's trade union movement , which is looking more uncertain these days , especially if a coalition of angela merkel 's conservative union bloc and the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- form the next government .
while sommer had his problems with his traditional allies - schröder 's social democrats , whose reforms were seen as " socially unjust " - the alternative looks even worse .
in these somewhat desperate times , better to go with the lesser of two evils .
" if the majority of voters vote for the union and the fdp , these parties could attempt to break the back of the unions , like margaret thatcher did in great britain , " sommer told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
and while once unions in the uk were mighty forces , today they are but a shadow of their former selves .
" unions lost that fight -lrb- over reforms -rrb- , " said hagen lesch , an expert on wage policy at the cologne institute for economic research .
" the thinking is to hang on to what they have now . "
traditional force trade unions in germany have traditionally been a powerful force in the labor market .
unions , in often tough negotiations with employers , set wage agreements that apply to entire sectors of the labor market .
in the postwar era , that has translated into regular pay increases for workers , generous holiday and sick-time allowances , and labor conditions that are the envy of much of the world .
bildunterschrift : steelworkers protesting but things have changed on the labor landscape and the once shining reputation of german trade unions is looking tarnished .
the country 's unemployment rate , which has been rising since the 1970s and is now at almost 12 percent , seems impossible to get down .
the pressures of globalization and the outsourcing of many manufacturing jobs means the traditional models - a job for life , an ever-increasing standard of living , cradle-to-grave security - are proving unsustainable .
the economy is stuck with anemic growth rates and often hovers just above recession .
economists , business leaders and some politicians have been calling for reform , for more self-responsibility , more flexibility and less government intervention and state support .
unions have resisted those appeals , claiming they hurt workers , and have begun to be seen - depending on which side of the labor and political spectrum one stands - as roadblocks to growth or protectors of the common man .
however , among the political classes , the former category of opinion appears to be in the ascendant .

he added that he was hopeful that a watered-down plan adopted by the general assembly to restructure the world body still " leaves the door open " for further progress . " we will continue to work patiently on reform , " the minister told german reporters .
fischer quashed rumors that reform of the un 's highest-ranking body had been put on hold , saying that " the pressure of relationships makes this reform necessary . "
he underlined that the german government was not primarily concerned about getting permanent membership , but rather wanted to bestow more legitimacy on the world body by ensuring that it no longer reflected the world of 1945 but rather that of the 21st century .
opposition from us and china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council has five permanent members - the us , russia , china , france and great britain .
the remaining ten members are elected for a period of two years .
germany has launched a joint bid along with japan , india and brazil for permanent membership .
the group known as " g4 " agreed thursday on the sidelines of the un summit to continue to pursue efforts towards that end .
the g4 had submitted a plan to boost the council 's membership from its current 15 to 25 , with six new permanent seats and four new non-permanent seats .
their first bid ran into opposition from the united states and china and failed to get crucial support from africa for the necessary two-thirds of member countries ' votes in the un general assembly to change the world body 's charter .
fischer 's appeal to reform and expand the security council was lent support by the remaining g4 members on thursday , many of whom appeared optimistic about their chances .
g4 not dead " the g4 exists .
the g4 will continue to work for united nations reform , " indian foreign minister natwar singh said .
singh added that their proposal could be reintroduced at the 60th session of the un general assembly with some changes .
" we are confident that it -lrb- reform -rrb- will happen , " said brazilian foreign minister celso amorim .
japan in particular , made a strong case for the security council to be more inclusive and meet the challenges of a changing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi in a speech to the un world summit , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , fresh off a thumping election victory at home , pleaded the case for change on the security council .
" the world has changed dramatically over the last 60 years .
asia and africa , once under the shackles of colonialism , are now significant players in our global community , " koizumi told other leaders .
" for the last 60 years , japan has determinedly pursued a course of development as a peace-loving nation , making a unique and significant contribution to the peace and prosperity of the world , " he said .
" the composition of the security council must reflect these fundamental changes .
japan is convinced that security council reform is a just cause for the international community - as is the deletion of the long-obsolete ' enemy state ' clauses from the un charter , " koizumi added .
japan was one of the vanquished nations in 1945 , but now has the world 's second-largest economy and is the second-biggest contributor to the un budget .
germany has made a similar case as europe 's biggest economy .

dw-world summarizes the main points of the race set to end sept .
18 . a process that was riddled with pitfalls when it started in july will come to an end on sunday , when germans decide who will sit in the chancellery for the next four years .
already upset about his coalition 's inability to push through necessary economic and welfare reforms due to constant blockades from the opposition and inner-party bickering , and after suffering damning regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , chancellor gerhard schröder called for a vote of confidence he hoped to - and did - lose , as a way of introducing early elections .
german president horst köhler and the country 's highest court approved the move , deciding that schröder 's ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens did indeed fulfill the necessary legal criteria to dissolve parliament - not having enough of a mandate to run the government effectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler took the entire 21 days allotted to him before deciding to dissolve parliament köhler did his duty " it is my duty as president to decide this issue according to the law , " köhler -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a national television broadcast on july 22 .
" i think it is best to have a new election to let the people decide . "
the decision pleased the majority of german voters and all the major political parties .
since receiving the official thumbs up , the parties ' campaigns have been dominated by their different visions of how to deal with germany 's sluggish economy and high unemployment .
schröder urges voters to stay the course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder insists his reforms have germany on the right track in part , schröder 's unpopular market and labor reforms led to the need for new elections in the first place , but as the campaigning wraps up , he continues to insist that germany has taken the right route .
" we are going in the right direction , " schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- said during his party 's caucus .
" and we need to stay the course . "
like schröder , angela merkel , the opposition christian democratic party 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- chancellor candidate , continues zigzagging across the country holding two rallies a day to win over the voters who could tip the scales in their favor .
rather than speculating on possible coalitions - as one-third of voters are reportedly undecided - merkel has been spending more time in public trying to win votes with sharp criticism of governmental policies that she blames for nearly 5 million unemployed and a budget that continuously breaks european union stability pact rules .
" there is no reason that a re-elected spd parliamentary group would be able to implement new reforms , " she said .
" they may be willing to be in the government , but they are not able . "
union slipping in polls since debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until july , merkel 's party was well ahead of the spd in the polls , at times even enjoying an absolute majority .
but merkel has seen her lead slip away since july , when the cdu revealed plans to increase national sales tax by 2 percent .
the real downturn came after a televised debate between merkel and schröder on sept .
4 , in which the chancellor again proved himself to be both media-savvy and telegenic , while his challenger managed to squeeze through the broadcast without too many glaring gaffes .
since then , schröder has increased his party 's take of the vote to 33 percent and put an end to the newly-formed left party 's double-digit poll results .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's comments did n't give merkel much of a hand with voters unfortunate comments from edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , leader of the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , and runner-up to schröder in the 2002 election , did further damage to the conservatives ' campaign .
stoiber called eastern germans " frustrated " and less capable than the voters in his home state of bavaria .
parties split on reforms merkel 's woes have only been multiplied by paul kirchhof , a potential finance minister who the cdu leader introduced as key to the reforms her government would carry out upon election .
but members of the party base have scorned the heidelberg economics professor , saying his radical changes to germany 's tax code go too far beyond the party platform they have supported .
though the spd 's campaign has not been as turbulent as the cdu / csu 's , it remains to be seen whether schröder can earn enough votes to stay in power and carry through his reform plans , or whether the cdu / csu will get a chance at trying to bring germany back up to speed . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german election enters final phase with five days to before germany elects a new government , both chancellor gerhard schröder and opposition frontrunner angela merkel are confident they can gain a majority and avoid a so-called grand coalition .

already upset about his coalition 's inability to push through necessary economic and welfare reforms due to constant blockades from the opposition and inner-party bickering , and after suffering damning regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , chancellor gerhard schröder called for a vote of confidence he hoped to - and did - lose , as a way of introducing early elections .

bildunterschrift : speaking at the un general assembly , fischer stressed that unsuccessful negotiations so far about expanding the security council should be reopened .
he added that he was hopeful that a watered-down plan adopted by the general assembly to restructure the world body still " leaves the door open " for further progress . " we will continue to work patiently on reform , " the minister told german reporters .
fischer quashed rumors that reform of the un 's highest-ranking body had been put on hold , saying that " the pressure of relationships makes this reform necessary . "
he underlined that the german government was not primarily concerned about getting permanent membership , but rather wanted to bestow more legitimacy on the world body by ensuring that it no longer reflected the world of 1945 but rather that of the 21st century .
opposition from us and china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council has five permanent members - the us , russia , china , france and great britain .
the remaining ten members are elected for a period of two years .
germany has launched a joint bid along with japan , india and brazil for permanent membership .
the group known as " g4 " agreed thursday on the sidelines of the un summit to continue to pursue efforts towards that end .
the g4 had submitted a plan to boost the council 's membership from its current 15 to 25 , with six new permanent seats and four new non-permanent seats .
their first bid ran into opposition from the united states and china and failed to get crucial support from africa for the necessary two-thirds of member countries ' votes in the un general assembly to change the world body 's charter .
fischer 's appeal to reform and expand the security council was lent support by the remaining g4 members on thursday , many of whom appeared optimistic about their chances .
g4 not dead " the g4 exists .
the g4 will continue to work for united nations reform , " indian foreign minister natwar singh said .
singh added that their proposal could be reintroduced at the 60th session of the un general assembly with some changes .
" we are confident that it -lrb- reform -rrb- will happen , " said brazilian foreign minister celso amorim .
japan in particular , made a strong case for the security council to be more inclusive and meet the challenges of a changing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi in a speech to the un world summit , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , fresh off a thumping election victory at home , pleaded the case for change on the security council .
" the world has changed dramatically over the last 60 years .
asia and africa , once under the shackles of colonialism , are now significant players in our global community , " koizumi told other leaders .
" for the last 60 years , japan has determinedly pursued a course of development as a peace-loving nation , making a unique and significant contribution to the peace and prosperity of the world , " he said .
" the composition of the security council must reflect these fundamental changes .
japan is convinced that security council reform is a just cause for the international community - as is the deletion of the long-obsolete ' enemy state ' clauses from the un charter , " koizumi added .
japan was one of the vanquished nations in 1945 , but now has the world 's second-largest economy and is the second-biggest contributor to the un budget .

" the moon is the next worthy goal , " said astronaut manfred messerschmid during the symposium , adding that the celestial body is only 1,000 hours away from the earth , unlike mars which takes a 1,000 days to reach .
the companies also urged the creation of an unmanned european research station on the moon .
they said in a statement that a gigantic long wave radio telescope would be installed on the back of the moon by 2015 to research a completely unknown side of the universe .
the aerospace firms added that they hoped the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- would shoulder the costs of the project which is estimated at around 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- .
esa , which is headquartered in paris , is expected to debate the issue during its next conference , in december .
europe could lag in space exploration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa 's aurora mission will explore the solar system esa 's aurora project , which began in 2001 , does include plans for a manned mars mission as well as a manned mission to the moon .
esa wants to head to mars and the moon , but not before 2033 and 2024 respectively .
that 's too late for the scientists , researchers and industry representatives assembled in bremen on thursday , who stressed that europe had to do more , and quickly , in space research if it wanted to keep up with other nations .
manfred fuchs , head of the bremen-based aerospace company ohb said that other countries had long been involved in missions to the moon .
he criticized the fact that the issue unfortunately " is n't the first priority " in europe and warned that germany , as the biggest country in europe , could n't afford to sit back while countries such as the us , russia , japan , china and india planned and realized their own space programs .
money the biggest problem most scientists and industry representatives admitted that the biggest stumbling block to european aerospace research is the paucity of funds .
evert dudok , president of eads space transportation , said that a central problem in germany was the slim budget for space research .
that amount plus the funds germany receives from esa add up to just about 700 million euros , dudok pointed out and added that the budget for this year had already been completely allocated .
" we demand a raise of 15 percent or 100 million euros to finally get some leeway , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of the esa landing unit ' huygens ' -lrb- left -rrb- separating from the ' cassini ' orbiter as the spacecraft advances titan , saturn 's biggest moon both eads space transportation and ohb as well astronaut ernst messerschmidt have appealed to the german government for support and more funds .
messerschmidt said that the german research ministry 's budget allocation for space research had already fallen to 11 percent from 20 percent .
" we have to stop this process , " messerschmit said .
manfred fuchs pointed out that nations like japan had already massively increased their space research budgets .
however , a spokesman for the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- was skeptical of the ambitious plans of aerospace industry representatives .
he told spiegel online that the " big goal " of the dlr remained the international space station iss and the docking of the european space research module colombus .
a " quantum leap " aerospace industry experts for now have pinned their hopes on a more realistic goal : building a giant radio telescope on the moon by 2015 , which in dudok 's words would bring a " quantum leap for radio astronomy . "
eads space transportation is already working with dutch researchers on the telescope .
the apparatus , which will be transported with the help of a ariane 5 rocket , will consist of 100 small antennae and will cover an initial radius of 300 meters , if all goes according to plan .

they said in a statement that a gigantic long wave radio telescope would be installed on the back of the moon by 2015 to research a completely unknown side of the universe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.09.2005 merkel 's fans in washington großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would a merkel victory mean for transatlantic relations ?
washington is watching sunday 's election and , secretly , hoping for a merkel victory .
but the promise of better relations is off-set by areas of potential dispute . should conservative angela merkel sweep to victory in sunday 's elections , it could mean a fresh start for strained us-german relations , according to analysts . after dipping to new lows under chancellor gerhard schröder and his center-left coalition , with differences over iraq and the partnership linking germany , france and russia undermining ties , the relationship seems to have stabilized of late .
but a victory by merkel , an atlanticist like her mentor helmut kohl , could make ties to washington a lot friendlier . " what is happening in germany is a catalyst for change , " said rockwell schnabel , former us ambassador to the european union and author of a new book on the eu and its contentious relations with the united states . merkel appears to be " a closer friend of the united states and therefore would lead a policy that would be more pro-american and pro-atlanticist , " he added . merkel 's priorities after riding a wave of anti-bush sentiment to victory in 2002 , germany 's miserable economic state has forced schröder to focus on domestic issues in his uphill battle to re-election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- might do things differently than her predecessor -lrb- left -rrb- opinion polls show that merkel , candidate for the christian democrats , has a good chance at becoming the country 's first female chancellor .
but up to 30 percent of the electorate remains undecided . merkel , 51 , has said that one of her priorities if elected would be mending the poisoned relationship with the united states , while still not sending troops to iraq .
washington is also interested in her aggressive pro-free market agenda . although bush officials refuse to publicly comment on the outcome of the sunday vote , privately they say a merkel victory would be a welcome change . a fresh start , without " leftovers " " if the administration representatives are honest they 'll tell you ' well this is a fresh start and merkel 's victory would be a good thing ' , " said jackson janes , director of the american institute for contemporary german studies . " we got a lot of leftovers with the schröder team and we 'll probably never be able to change that , so if we get a new team in berlin it 's an opportunity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jackson janes janes -lrb- photo -rrb- and others warned , however , that if merkel wins on sunday , the bush administration should n't rush to pop the champagne corks .
" i do n't think that we here in washington should escalate our expectations that her parameters would be significantly bigger than schröder 's , " janes said . dieter dettke , executive director of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , which is close to schröder 's spd , in washington , said that while merkel would certainly work hard to establish smoother lines of communication with washington , in substance there could be little change under her administration as far as foreign policy is concerned .
the turkey question one likely contentious issue , janes and dettke noted , was merkel 's opposition to turkey becoming a full member of the european union which put her at odds with washington . nonetheless , analysts say , relations under merkel are unlikely to be any worse than they have been with schröder . " i think that -lrb- if merkel wins -rrb- there 's going to be much more of an effort to say ' let 's see where we agree ... ' , " janes said . " in the case of schröder , there was a great deal of concern that they were thinking more about differences rather than commonalities .

" there 's something mechanical today in the franco-german relationship that needs to be given new legitimacy , " said jean-dominique giuliani , head of the robert schuman foundation in paris .
merkel herself has said the franco-german motor would continue if she became chancellor , through she stated it would not be an " exclusive " relationship nor one directed against other eu members .
merkel signaled that she would maintain several foreign policy positions , including support for environmental protection and the international criminal court - both issues that align with chirac 's views .
she is vehemently opposed to turkey 's bid to join the european union , which could please chirac .
initially an enthusiastic supporter of ankara 's bid , he has become more ambivalent on the subject after the french electorate made clear its resistance to the idea .
merkel was also likely to continue the current government 's soft-spoken approach on human rights in both russia and china but stop short of echoing current german chancellor gerhard schröder 's and chirac 's call to lift the eu arms embargo against beijing .
in the end , though , a long-awaited turnaround in the economic fortunes of the two countries may be the impetus to revive their partnership .
" the basis of the problems in the franco-german relationship are economic in nature , " said giuliani . dw-world.de merkel 's fans in washington washington is watching sunday 's election and , secretly , hoping for a merkel victory .
but the promise of better relations is off-set by areas of potential dispute .

" the moon is the next worthy goal , " said astronaut manfred messerschmid during the symposium , adding that the celestial body is only 1,000 hours away from the earth , unlike mars which takes a 1,000 days to reach .
the companies also urged the creation of an unmanned european research station on the moon .
they said in a statement that a gigantic long wave radio telescope would be installed on the back of the moon by 2015 to research a completely unknown side of the universe .
the aerospace firms added that they hoped the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- would shoulder the costs of the project which is estimated at around 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- .
esa , which is headquartered in paris , is expected to debate the issue during its next conference , in december .
europe could lag in space exploration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa 's aurora mission will explore the solar system esa 's aurora project , which began in 2001 , does include plans for a manned mars mission as well as a manned mission to the moon .
esa wants to head to mars and the moon , but not before 2033 and 2024 respectively .
that 's too late for the scientists , researchers and industry representatives assembled in bremen on thursday , who stressed that europe had to do more , and quickly , in space research if it wanted to keep up with other nations .
manfred fuchs , head of the bremen-based aerospace company ohb said that other countries had long been involved in missions to the moon .
he criticized the fact that the issue unfortunately " is n't the first priority " in europe and warned that germany , as the biggest country in europe , could n't afford to sit back while countries such as the us , russia , japan , china and india planned and realized their own space programs .
money the biggest problem most scientists and industry representatives admitted that the biggest stumbling block to european aerospace research is the paucity of funds .
evert dudok , president of eads space transportation , said that a central problem in germany was the slim budget for space research .
that amount plus the funds germany receives from esa add up to just about 700 million euros , dudok pointed out and added that the budget for this year had already been completely allocated .
" we demand a raise of 15 percent or 100 million euros to finally get some leeway , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of the esa landing unit ' huygens ' -lrb- left -rrb- separating from the ' cassini ' orbiter as the spacecraft advances titan , saturn 's biggest moon both eads space transportation and ohb as well astronaut ernst messerschmidt have appealed to the german government for support and more funds .
messerschmidt said that the german research ministry 's budget allocation for space research had already fallen to 11 percent from 20 percent .
" we have to stop this process , " messerschmit said .
manfred fuchs pointed out that nations like japan had already massively increased their space research budgets .
however , a spokesman for the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- was skeptical of the ambitious plans of aerospace industry representatives .
he told spiegel online that the " big goal " of the dlr remained the international space station iss and the docking of the european space research module colombus .
a " quantum leap " aerospace industry experts for now have pinned their hopes on a more realistic goal : building a giant radio telescope on the moon by 2015 , which in dudok 's words would bring a " quantum leap for radio astronomy . "
eads space transportation is already working with dutch researchers on the telescope .
the apparatus , which will be transported with the help of a ariane 5 rocket , will consist of 100 small antennae and will cover an initial radius of 300 meters , if all goes according to plan .

this year 's slogan " meeting music , " was the vision behind the event which has become one of the world 's - and definitely europe 's - biggest and most important entertainment industry gathering . for three days , the 796 exhibitors from 48 countries attended the international platform for music and entertainment in the exhibition halls near western berlin 's radio tower , the funkturm .
this year 's numbers mark a 20 percent increase compared with last year 's exhibitor totals , organizers said . today your love , tomorrow the world leading industry names , such as universal music , warner music and nokia , took part , along with small independent labels and music groups from germany and abroad , particularly from this year 's partner country , spain .
vodafone , apple itunes , musicload , napster and msn music international also had stands at the fair . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : telecommunications companies , brand names and games people " are all part of the makeup of popkomm 's attendance , " popkomm director katja bittner said .
" we need people who not only create music or work in music as their core business , but also see music as a new chance to develop their own business . "
at home in berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the singer leo , " la bestia " of the spanish group stravaganzza sang on wednesday at popkomm 's " spanish night " in its second year since moving to berlin - after 15 years in cologne - popkomm 's organizers see the german capital as an ideal starting block for a confab that has endured some difficult times .
converting popkomm skeptics into believers has been just one of the main challenges for organizers .
" the plan was to give the conference a new profile - of being a business platform for the music and entertainment industry .
we wanted to create an event where people could get the most benefit through preparation , " bittner said .
in the past , she acknowledged , popkomm was often viewed as a party for the music industry where business came second . more then just a " trade show " the key to popkomm 's success is its triple threat line-up as a trade fair , a conference and a music festival . this year organizers also again opted for a later starting date for the event .
in previous years , the conference took place during the peak summer month of august - a traditional soft spot for european business when executives typically take annual leave . # b # one of the high notes of this year 's festival was its focus on live music . perhaps taking a cue from other successful music festivals such as america 's south by southwest festival in austin , texas , the 2005 popkomm spread live acts around 30 clubs and venues across berlin . on wednesday , popkomm hosted the imea 2005 awards -lrb- innovation in music & entertainment awards -rrb- .
the new york-based ksolo received the first prize by for their interactive internet karaoke service , which is considered a breakthrough in the karaoke business . for the first time ever , gospel artists will be honored in an awards ceremony on friday , when the fair closes its doors until next year .

washington is watching sunday 's election and , secretly , hoping for a merkel victory .
but the promise of better relations is off-set by areas of potential dispute . should conservative angela merkel sweep to victory in sunday 's elections , it could mean a fresh start for strained us-german relations , according to analysts . after dipping to new lows under chancellor gerhard schröder and his center-left coalition , with differences over iraq and the partnership linking germany , france and russia undermining ties , the relationship seems to have stabilized of late .
but a victory by merkel , an atlanticist like her mentor helmut kohl , could make ties to washington a lot friendlier . " what is happening in germany is a catalyst for change , " said rockwell schnabel , former us ambassador to the european union and author of a new book on the eu and its contentious relations with the united states . merkel appears to be " a closer friend of the united states and therefore would lead a policy that would be more pro-american and pro-atlanticist , " he added . merkel 's priorities after riding a wave of anti-bush sentiment to victory in 2002 , germany 's miserable economic state has forced schröder to focus on domestic issues in his uphill battle to re-election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- might do things differently than her predecessor -lrb- left -rrb- opinion polls show that merkel , candidate for the christian democrats , has a good chance at becoming the country 's first female chancellor .
but up to 30 percent of the electorate remains undecided . merkel , 51 , has said that one of her priorities if elected would be mending the poisoned relationship with the united states , while still not sending troops to iraq .
washington is also interested in her aggressive pro-free market agenda . although bush officials refuse to publicly comment on the outcome of the sunday vote , privately they say a merkel victory would be a welcome change . a fresh start , without " leftovers " " if the administration representatives are honest they 'll tell you ' well this is a fresh start and merkel 's victory would be a good thing ' , " said jackson janes , director of the american institute for contemporary german studies . " we got a lot of leftovers with the schröder team and we 'll probably never be able to change that , so if we get a new team in berlin it 's an opportunity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jackson janes janes -lrb- photo -rrb- and others warned , however , that if merkel wins on sunday , the bush administration should n't rush to pop the champagne corks .
" i do n't think that we here in washington should escalate our expectations that her parameters would be significantly bigger than schröder 's , " janes said . dieter dettke , executive director of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , which is close to schröder 's spd , in washington , said that while merkel would certainly work hard to establish smoother lines of communication with washington , in substance there could be little change under her administration as far as foreign policy is concerned .
the turkey question one likely contentious issue , janes and dettke noted , was merkel 's opposition to turkey becoming a full member of the european union which put her at odds with washington . nonetheless , analysts say , relations under merkel are unlikely to be any worse than they have been with schröder . " i think that -lrb- if merkel wins -rrb- there 's going to be much more of an effort to say ' let 's see where we agree ... ' , " janes said .

bildunterschrift : speaking at the un general assembly , fischer stressed that unsuccessful negotiations so far about expanding the security council should be reopened .
he added that he was hopeful that a watered-down plan adopted by the general assembly to restructure the world body still " leaves the door open " for further progress . " we will continue to work patiently on reform , " the minister told german reporters .
fischer quashed rumors that reform of the un 's highest-ranking body had been put on hold , saying that " the pressure of relationships makes this reform necessary . "
he underlined that the german government was not primarily concerned about getting permanent membership , but rather wanted to bestow more legitimacy on the world body by ensuring that it no longer reflected the world of 1945 but rather that of the 21st century .
opposition from us and china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council has five permanent members - the us , russia , china , france and great britain .
the remaining ten members are elected for a period of two years .
germany has launched a joint bid along with japan , india and brazil for permanent membership .
the group known as " g4 " agreed thursday on the sidelines of the un summit to continue to pursue efforts towards that end .
the g4 had submitted a plan to boost the council 's membership from its current 15 to 25 , with six new permanent seats and four new non-permanent seats .
their first bid ran into opposition from the united states and china and failed to get crucial support from africa for the necessary two-thirds of member countries ' votes in the un general assembly to change the world body 's charter .
fischer 's appeal to reform and expand the security council was lent support by the remaining g4 members on thursday , many of whom appeared optimistic about their chances .
g4 not dead " the g4 exists .
the g4 will continue to work for united nations reform , " indian foreign minister natwar singh said .
singh added that their proposal could be reintroduced at the 60th session of the un general assembly with some changes .

the relatives of bavarian king ludwig ii are resigned to the fact that they have a colorful legacy to look back on , but a descendant of the king 's stable master does n't want anyone to pass that legacy onto his forebear . king ludwig ii -lrb- 1845-86 -rrb- , who was rumored to have been a good-looking man with an excellent reputation among his subjects , was known to keep a diary that documented his difficulties reconciling his catholic faith and his sexual desires .
indeed , many people suspected him of overly-friendly relationships with his male servants - especially the head of the stables .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.09.2005 eu fails to agree in deadlock over turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is still divided on how turkey fits in the bloc european union member states again failed to agree on friday how to respond to turkey 's refusal to recognize cyprus , clouding ankara 's eu prospects as it prepares to start entry talks next month . eu diplomats said that a meeting of ambassadors from the european union 's 25 states - their second this week - ended without a response , deemed politically important before the accession negotiations begin on october 3 .
" the meeting of the ambassadors is over .
there has not been any major shift in the countries ' positions , " one diplomat told reuters .
the eu 's british presidency , which has been trying to resolve the issue for weeks , has conceded that it may have to call a special meeting of eu foreign ministers , possibly on sept .
26 , an agreement can not be reached soon .
still hope for a deal but a presidency spokesman tried to sound upbeat after the ambassadors met .
" it was a good discussion .
considerable progress was made and we hope to reach an agreement soon , " he said .
" we remain hopeful that we wo n't have to drag the ministers to brussels . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has been unwilling to recognize the nikosia government turkey drew criticism in july when , while signing a protocol extending a customs accord with the eu to the bloc 's 10 newest states - including cyprus - it simultaneously declared this did not amount to a recognition of the nicosia government .
the eu ministers are seeking agreement on a " counter-declaration , " but differences over how strongly it should press ankara to recognize the island member state have so far prevented an accord .
cyprus , which gained independence from britain in 1960 , has struggled to emerge from its three-decade-long division into predominantly greek-cypriot and turkish-cypriot sectors .
the island has been split since 1974 when the turkish military occupied the northern third in response to a greek-inspired coup .
turkey supports the turkish cypriot breakaway state in the north of the mediterranean island , while cyprus 's greek cypriot government represents the whole island in the eu .
british-french agreement fails earlier this week , britain and france sought support for a compromise stating that turkey should recognize cyprus before joining , but that failed to win enough backing when the ambassadors first met on wednesday .
the latest draft for the friday meeting , seen by afp , contained a paragraph proposing that the eu tell ankara that " prior recognition of all member states is a necessary component of accession . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has been unwilling to recognize the nikosia government turkey drew criticism in july when , while signing a protocol extending a customs accord with the eu to the bloc 's 10 newest states - including cyprus - it simultaneously declared this did not amount to a recognition of the nicosia government .
the eu ministers are seeking agreement on a " counter-declaration , " but differences over how strongly it should press ankara to recognize the island member state have so far prevented an accord .
cyprus , which gained independence from britain in 1960 , has struggled to emerge from its three-decade-long division into predominantly greek-cypriot and turkish-cypriot sectors .
the island has been split since 1974 when the turkish military occupied the northern third in response to a greek-inspired coup .
turkey supports the turkish cypriot breakaway state in the north of the mediterranean island , while cyprus 's greek cypriot government represents the whole island in the eu .
british-french agreement fails earlier this week , britain and france sought support for a compromise stating that turkey should recognize cyprus before joining , but that failed to win enough backing when the ambassadors first met on wednesday .
the latest draft for the friday meeting , seen by afp , contained a paragraph proposing that the eu tell ankara that " prior recognition of all member states is a necessary component of accession . "
without providing additional details , an eu diplomat said that cyprus , its closest ally greece as well as the czech republic had refused to accept the wording .
cyprus previously stated it wanted the eu to create deadlines for turkey to fulfill in its process of recognizing the mediterranean island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus wants access to turkish ports and airports cyprus wants access to turkish ports the draft also warned that failure by turkey to fully implement the ankara accord - notably by allowing cypriot ships and planes to use its ports and airports - will slow down the pace of membership talks .
" failure to implement its obligations in full will affect the overall progress in the negotiations , " the draft said .
the eu diplomat said that this warning " was acceptable to all member states . "
while the eu debates what position to take , ankara has grown increasingly impatient , with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan accusing the bloc of " rude " diplomatic conduct for placing new conditions on its bid to become a member .
turkey said it would recognize cyprus only after a broad international agreement , possibly sponsored by the united nations , to end the division of the island .
ankara argues that although it occupied the northern part of the island in 1974 to protect the turkish population following a pro-greek coup , it is not responsible for the continuing division of cyprus . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de uk and france mull deal on turkey standoff britain and france have agreed that turkey must recognize cyprus before joining the european union , as a possible compromise to clear the way for accession talks next month , according to diplomatic sources .

dw-world summarizes the main points of the race set to end sept .
18 . a process that was riddled with pitfalls when it started in july will come to an end on sunday , when germans decide who will sit in the chancellery for the next four years .
already upset about his coalition 's inability to push through necessary economic and welfare reforms due to constant blockades from the opposition and inner-party bickering , and after suffering damning regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , chancellor gerhard schröder called for a vote of confidence he hoped to - and did - lose , as a way of introducing early elections .
german president horst köhler and the country 's highest court approved the move , deciding that schröder 's ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens did indeed fulfill the necessary legal criteria to dissolve parliament - not having enough of a mandate to run the government effectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler took the entire 21 days allotted to him before deciding to dissolve parliament köhler did his duty " it is my duty as president to decide this issue according to the law , " köhler -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a national television broadcast on july 22 .
" i think it is best to have a new election to let the people decide . "
the decision pleased the majority of german voters and all the major political parties .
since receiving the official thumbs up , the parties ' campaigns have been dominated by their different visions of how to deal with germany 's sluggish economy and high unemployment .
schröder urges voters to stay the course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder insists his reforms have germany on the right track in part , schröder 's unpopular market and labor reforms led to the need for new elections in the first place , but as the campaigning wraps up , he continues to insist that germany has taken the right route .
" we are going in the right direction , " schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- said during his party 's caucus .
" and we need to stay the course . "
like schröder , angela merkel , the opposition christian democratic party 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- chancellor candidate , continues zigzagging across the country holding two rallies a day to win over the voters who could tip the scales in their favor .
rather than speculating on possible coalitions - as one-third of voters are reportedly undecided - merkel has been spending more time in public trying to win votes with sharp criticism of governmental policies that she blames for nearly 5 million unemployed and a budget that continuously breaks european union stability pact rules .
" there is no reason that a re-elected spd parliamentary group would be able to implement new reforms , " she said .
" they may be willing to be in the government , but they are not able . "
union slipping in polls since debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until july , merkel 's party was well ahead of the spd in the polls , at times even enjoying an absolute majority .
but merkel has seen her lead slip away since july , when the cdu revealed plans to increase national sales tax by 2 percent .
the real downturn came after a televised debate between merkel and schröder on sept .
4 , in which the chancellor again proved himself to be both media-savvy and telegenic , while his challenger managed to squeeze through the broadcast without too many glaring gaffes .
since then , schröder has increased his party 's take of the vote to 33 percent and put an end to the newly-formed left party 's double-digit poll results .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's comments did n't give merkel much of a hand with voters unfortunate comments from edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , leader of the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , and runner-up to schröder in the 2002 election , did further damage to the conservatives ' campaign .
stoiber called eastern germans " frustrated " and less capable than the voters in his home state of bavaria .
parties split on reforms merkel 's woes have only been multiplied by paul kirchhof , a potential finance minister who the cdu leader introduced as key to the reforms her government would carry out upon election .
but members of the party base have scorned the heidelberg economics professor , saying his radical changes to germany 's tax code go too far beyond the party platform they have supported .
though the spd 's campaign has not been as turbulent as the cdu / csu 's , it remains to be seen whether schröder can earn enough votes to stay in power and carry through his reform plans , or whether the cdu / csu will get a chance at trying to bring germany back up to speed . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german election enters final phase with five days to before germany elects a new government , both chancellor gerhard schröder and opposition frontrunner angela merkel are confident they can gain a majority and avoid a so-called grand coalition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.09.2005 merkel 's fans in washington großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what would a merkel victory mean for transatlantic relations ?
washington is watching sunday 's election and , secretly , hoping for a merkel victory .
but the promise of better relations is off-set by areas of potential dispute . should conservative angela merkel sweep to victory in sunday 's elections , it could mean a fresh start for strained us-german relations , according to analysts . after dipping to new lows under chancellor gerhard schröder and his center-left coalition , with differences over iraq and the partnership linking germany , france and russia undermining ties , the relationship seems to have stabilized of late .
but a victory by merkel , an atlanticist like her mentor helmut kohl , could make ties to washington a lot friendlier . " what is happening in germany is a catalyst for change , " said rockwell schnabel , former us ambassador to the european union and author of a new book on the eu and its contentious relations with the united states . merkel appears to be " a closer friend of the united states and therefore would lead a policy that would be more pro-american and pro-atlanticist , " he added . merkel 's priorities after riding a wave of anti-bush sentiment to victory in 2002 , germany 's miserable economic state has forced schröder to focus on domestic issues in his uphill battle to re-election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- might do things differently than her predecessor -lrb- left -rrb- opinion polls show that merkel , candidate for the christian democrats , has a good chance at becoming the country 's first female chancellor .
but up to 30 percent of the electorate remains undecided . merkel , 51 , has said that one of her priorities if elected would be mending the poisoned relationship with the united states , while still not sending troops to iraq .
washington is also interested in her aggressive pro-free market agenda . although bush officials refuse to publicly comment on the outcome of the sunday vote , privately they say a merkel victory would be a welcome change . a fresh start , without " leftovers " " if the administration representatives are honest they 'll tell you ' well this is a fresh start and merkel 's victory would be a good thing ' , " said jackson janes , director of the american institute for contemporary german studies . " we got a lot of leftovers with the schröder team and we 'll probably never be able to change that , so if we get a new team in berlin it 's an opportunity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jackson janes janes -lrb- photo -rrb- and others warned , however , that if merkel wins on sunday , the bush administration should n't rush to pop the champagne corks .
" i do n't think that we here in washington should escalate our expectations that her parameters would be significantly bigger than schröder 's , " janes said . dieter dettke , executive director of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , which is close to schröder 's spd , in washington , said that while merkel would certainly work hard to establish smoother lines of communication with washington , in substance there could be little change under her administration as far as foreign policy is concerned .
the turkey question one likely contentious issue , janes and dettke noted , was merkel 's opposition to turkey becoming a full member of the european union which put her at odds with washington . nonetheless , analysts say , relations under merkel are unlikely to be any worse than they have been with schröder . " i think that -lrb- if merkel wins -rrb- there 's going to be much more of an effort to say ' let 's see where we agree ... ' , " janes said . " in the case of schröder , there was a great deal of concern that they were thinking more about differences rather than commonalities .

washington is watching sunday 's election and , secretly , hoping for a merkel victory .
but the promise of better relations is off-set by areas of potential dispute . should conservative angela merkel sweep to victory in sunday 's elections , it could mean a fresh start for strained us-german relations , according to analysts . after dipping to new lows under chancellor gerhard schröder and his center-left coalition , with differences over iraq and the partnership linking germany , france and russia undermining ties , the relationship seems to have stabilized of late .
but a victory by merkel , an atlanticist like her mentor helmut kohl , could make ties to washington a lot friendlier . " what is happening in germany is a catalyst for change , " said rockwell schnabel , former us ambassador to the european union and author of a new book on the eu and its contentious relations with the united states . merkel appears to be " a closer friend of the united states and therefore would lead a policy that would be more pro-american and pro-atlanticist , " he added . merkel 's priorities after riding a wave of anti-bush sentiment to victory in 2002 , germany 's miserable economic state has forced schröder to focus on domestic issues in his uphill battle to re-election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- might do things differently than her predecessor -lrb- left -rrb- opinion polls show that merkel , candidate for the christian democrats , has a good chance at becoming the country 's first female chancellor .
but up to 30 percent of the electorate remains undecided . merkel , 51 , has said that one of her priorities if elected would be mending the poisoned relationship with the united states , while still not sending troops to iraq .
washington is also interested in her aggressive pro-free market agenda . although bush officials refuse to publicly comment on the outcome of the sunday vote , privately they say a merkel victory would be a welcome change . a fresh start , without " leftovers " " if the administration representatives are honest they 'll tell you ' well this is a fresh start and merkel 's victory would be a good thing ' , " said jackson janes , director of the american institute for contemporary german studies . " we got a lot of leftovers with the schröder team and we 'll probably never be able to change that , so if we get a new team in berlin it 's an opportunity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jackson janes janes -lrb- photo -rrb- and others warned , however , that if merkel wins on sunday , the bush administration should n't rush to pop the champagne corks .
" i do n't think that we here in washington should escalate our expectations that her parameters would be significantly bigger than schröder 's , " janes said . dieter dettke , executive director of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , which is close to schröder 's spd , in washington , said that while merkel would certainly work hard to establish smoother lines of communication with washington , in substance there could be little change under her administration as far as foreign policy is concerned .
the turkey question one likely contentious issue , janes and dettke noted , was merkel 's opposition to turkey becoming a full member of the european union which put her at odds with washington . nonetheless , analysts say , relations under merkel are unlikely to be any worse than they have been with schröder . " i think that -lrb- if merkel wins -rrb- there 's going to be much more of an effort to say ' let 's see where we agree ... ' , " janes said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.09.2005 european aerospace aims for the moon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this would be a dream come true for european aerospace leading german aerospace companies have urged the creation of an unmanned european space station on the moon , warning that europe could otherwise lose out to other nations in the race for space exploration and research . during a conference in the northern german city of bremen hosted by the german aerospace industries association -lrb- dglr -rrb- on thursday , leading lights from the german aerospace industry and representatives from the fields of science and space technology agreed that european space research had to focus on the moon if it wanted to remain competitive .
" the moon is the next worthy goal , " said astronaut manfred messerschmid during the symposium , adding that the celestial body is only 1,000 hours away from the earth , unlike mars which takes a 1,000 days to reach .
the companies also urged the creation of an unmanned european research station on the moon .
they said in a statement that a gigantic long wave radio telescope would be installed on the back of the moon by 2015 to research a completely unknown side of the universe .
the aerospace firms added that they hoped the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- would shoulder the costs of the project which is estimated at around 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- .
esa , which is headquartered in paris , is expected to debate the issue during its next conference , in december .
europe could lag in space exploration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa 's aurora mission will explore the solar system esa 's aurora project , which began in 2001 , does include plans for a manned mars mission as well as a manned mission to the moon .
esa wants to head to mars and the moon , but not before 2033 and 2024 respectively .
that 's too late for the scientists , researchers and industry representatives assembled in bremen on thursday , who stressed that europe had to do more , and quickly , in space research if it wanted to keep up with other nations .
manfred fuchs , head of the bremen-based aerospace company ohb said that other countries had long been involved in missions to the moon .
he criticized the fact that the issue unfortunately " is n't the first priority " in europe and warned that germany , as the biggest country in europe , could n't afford to sit back while countries such as the us , russia , japan , china and india planned and realized their own space programs .
money the biggest problem most scientists and industry representatives admitted that the biggest stumbling block to european aerospace research is the paucity of funds .
evert dudok , president of eads space transportation , said that a central problem in germany was the slim budget for space research .
that amount plus the funds germany receives from esa add up to just about 700 million euros , dudok pointed out and added that the budget for this year had already been completely allocated .
" we demand a raise of 15 percent or 100 million euros to finally get some leeway , " he said .

messerschmidt said that the german research ministry 's budget allocation for space research had already fallen to 11 percent from 20 percent .
" we have to stop this process , " messerschmit said .
manfred fuchs pointed out that nations like japan had already massively increased their space research budgets .
however , a spokesman for the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- was skeptical of the ambitious plans of aerospace industry representatives .
he told spiegel online that the " big goal " of the dlr remained the international space station iss and the docking of the european space research module colombus .
a " quantum leap " aerospace industry experts for now have pinned their hopes on a more realistic goal : building a giant radio telescope on the moon by 2015 , which in dudok 's words would bring a " quantum leap for radio astronomy . "
eads space transportation is already working with dutch researchers on the telescope .
the apparatus , which will be transported with the help of a ariane 5 rocket , will consist of 100 small antennae and will cover an initial radius of 300 meters , if all goes according to plan .

" it 's sensational .
we certainly had n't thought there 'd be as much , " said hans-joachim bischoff , spokesman for bookmaker eurosportwetten , of interest in betting on the elections , according to reuters news agency .
eurosportwetten has taken bets from tens of thousands of germans since chancellor gerhard schröder in may called for elections a year ahead of schedule .
around 7 percent of their german business is now focused on sunday 's election outcome .
conservative leader angela merkel is the overwhelming favorite to oust schröder .

it 's just as crucial for the country 's trade unions , which could see their power greatly reduced by a conservative-liberal government . the chairman of germany 's dgb trade union federation , michael sommer , was all smiles as he stood side by side with chancellor gerhard schröder last week at the dgb headquarters .
just months ago , the two would n't even shake each the other 's hand after the bitter recriminations that were thrown from both sides over welfare and labor market reforms put in place by schröder .
at the kiss-and-make-up session , however , sommer was , while not commanding , strongly suggesting that germany 's trade union members vote for schröder and keep the current social democratic-green coalition in power for four more years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer , dgb chairman , right , and chancellor gerhard schröder , left , brief the media following their their talks at the dgb headquarters in berlin .
" it 's about nothing less than determining the future of this society , " sommer said .
in the back of his mind , however , he might have been thinking about the future of germany 's trade union movement , which is looking more uncertain these days , especially if a coalition of angela merkel 's conservative union bloc and the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- form the next government .
while sommer had his problems with his traditional allies - schröder 's social democrats , whose reforms were seen as " socially unjust " - the alternative looks even worse .
in these somewhat desperate times , better to go with the lesser of two evils .
" if the majority of voters vote for the union and the fdp , these parties could attempt to break the back of the unions , like margaret thatcher did in great britain , " sommer told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
and while once unions in the uk were mighty forces , today they are but a shadow of their former selves .
" unions lost that fight -lrb- over reforms -rrb- , " said hagen lesch , an expert on wage policy at the cologne institute for economic research .
" the thinking is to hang on to what they have now . "
traditional force trade unions in germany have traditionally been a powerful force in the labor market .
unions , in often tough negotiations with employers , set wage agreements that apply to entire sectors of the labor market .
in the postwar era , that has translated into regular pay increases for workers , generous holiday and sick-time allowances , and labor conditions that are the envy of much of the world .
bildunterschrift : steelworkers protesting but things have changed on the labor landscape and the once shining reputation of german trade unions is looking tarnished .
the country 's unemployment rate , which has been rising since the 1970s and is now at almost 12 percent , seems impossible to get down .
the pressures of globalization and the outsourcing of many manufacturing jobs means the traditional models - a job for life , an ever-increasing standard of living , cradle-to-grave security - are proving unsustainable .
the economy is stuck with anemic growth rates and often hovers just above recession .
economists , business leaders and some politicians have been calling for reform , for more self-responsibility , more flexibility and less government intervention and state support .
unions have resisted those appeals , claiming they hurt workers , and have begun to be seen - depending on which side of the labor and political spectrum one stands - as roadblocks to growth or protectors of the common man .
however , among the political classes , the former category of opinion appears to be in the ascendant .
change , it is a-comin ' ?
the conservative cdu party , led by angela merkel , who is likely to become germany 's next , and first female , chancellor , has said the unions will likely be looking at change if she forms the next government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel she wants to take away some of their most cherished power - that of setting sector-wide wage agreements - and allow staff and management at individual companies to decide if they want to determine their own pay scales .
merkel has said she wants germany to continue to have strong unions , but that they should be more flexible .
" one ca n't say you 're for a strong union and at the same time , erode wage autonomy .
that 's a contradiction , " said hans-joachim schabedoth , head of the policy department of the dgb .
according to him , conservatives are playing a dangerous game in attempting to eviscerate union power .
history has shown , if a government wants to maintain a majority , or its popularity , it has to pay attention to union interests , he said . the current anti-union strategy was going against the best interests of the larger society , he added .
" our role is to ensure that people benefit from their own work and that social questions are considered in the larger economy so that social problems do n't grow , " he said .
" therefore we 're worried about the current state of things . "
overall decline but the role of unions , in the minds of the populace at least , seems to have lost of its importance .
de-unionization has been a phenomenon over the past two decades all over the world .
since the 1980s , the share of wage earners who are also union members has declined in all but a few countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , the trend is the same .
membership of the dgb 's affiliated trade unions dropped by nearly 5 percent in 2004 and is now at just over 7 million .
unions also face the problem of an aging membership , which does not portend well for the future .
membership of young people -lrb- 16-25 -rrb- within the dgb dropped considerably from 15 percent in the early 1980s to about 5 percent today .
that slow decline could be revved up considerably after sunday 's vote , should the center-right and the free-market liberals prove triumphant .
if unions lose their main power position - the setting of sector-wide wage agreements - it could well cause many workers to reconsider their union memberships and spend their dues money elsewhere .
other considerations by merkel & co . , such as loosening job protection laws , liberalizing store opening hours , and rethinking policies on worker participation in company management , if they go through , would also be defeats for unions and could further push them to the periphery of a germany that appears to be embarking on a more free-market course . kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder seeks unions ' support ten days ahead of germany 's general elections , chancellor gerhard schröder made a show of unity with a major trade union boss , brushing aside the repeated clashes that have marked his seven years in power .

" if the majority of voters vote for the union and the fdp , these parties could attempt to break the back of the unions , like margaret thatcher did in great britain , " sommer told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
and while once unions in the uk were mighty forces , today they are but a shadow of their former selves .
" unions lost that fight -lrb- over reforms -rrb- , " said hagen lesch , an expert on wage policy at the cologne institute for economic research .
" the thinking is to hang on to what they have now . "
traditional force trade unions in germany have traditionally been a powerful force in the labor market .
unions , in often tough negotiations with employers , set wage agreements that apply to entire sectors of the labor market .
in the postwar era , that has translated into regular pay increases for workers , generous holiday and sick-time allowances , and labor conditions that are the envy of much of the world .
bildunterschrift : steelworkers protesting but things have changed on the labor landscape and the once shining reputation of german trade unions is looking tarnished .
the country 's unemployment rate , which has been rising since the 1970s and is now at almost 12 percent , seems impossible to get down .
the pressures of globalization and the outsourcing of many manufacturing jobs means the traditional models - a job for life , an ever-increasing standard of living , cradle-to-grave security - are proving unsustainable .
the economy is stuck with anemic growth rates and often hovers just above recession .
economists , business leaders and some politicians have been calling for reform , for more self-responsibility , more flexibility and less government intervention and state support .
unions have resisted those appeals , claiming they hurt workers , and have begun to be seen - depending on which side of the labor and political spectrum one stands - as roadblocks to growth or protectors of the common man .
however , among the political classes , the former category of opinion appears to be in the ascendant .
change , it is a-comin ' ?
the conservative cdu party , led by angela merkel , who is likely to become germany 's next , and first female , chancellor , has said the unions will likely be looking at change if she forms the next government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel she wants to take away some of their most cherished power - that of setting sector-wide wage agreements - and allow staff and management at individual companies to decide if they want to determine their own pay scales .
merkel has said she wants germany to continue to have strong unions , but that they should be more flexible .
" one ca n't say you 're for a strong union and at the same time , erode wage autonomy .
that 's a contradiction , " said hans-joachim schabedoth , head of the policy department of the dgb .
according to him , conservatives are playing a dangerous game in attempting to eviscerate union power .
history has shown , if a government wants to maintain a majority , or its popularity , it has to pay attention to union interests , he said . the current anti-union strategy was going against the best interests of the larger society , he added .
" our role is to ensure that people benefit from their own work and that social questions are considered in the larger economy so that social problems do n't grow , " he said .
" therefore we 're worried about the current state of things . "
overall decline but the role of unions , in the minds of the populace at least , seems to have lost of its importance .
de-unionization has been a phenomenon over the past two decades all over the world .
since the 1980s , the share of wage earners who are also union members has declined in all but a few countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , the trend is the same .
membership of the dgb 's affiliated trade unions dropped by nearly 5 percent in 2004 and is now at just over 7 million .
unions also face the problem of an aging membership , which does not portend well for the future .
membership of young people -lrb- 16-25 -rrb- within the dgb dropped considerably from 15 percent in the early 1980s to about 5 percent today .
that slow decline could be revved up considerably after sunday 's vote , should the center-right and the free-market liberals prove triumphant .
if unions lose their main power position - the setting of sector-wide wage agreements - it could well cause many workers to reconsider their union memberships and spend their dues money elsewhere .
other considerations by merkel & co . , such as loosening job protection laws , liberalizing store opening hours , and rethinking policies on worker participation in company management , if they go through , would also be defeats for unions and could further push them to the periphery of a germany that appears to be embarking on a more free-market course . kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder seeks unions ' support ten days ahead of germany 's general elections , chancellor gerhard schröder made a show of unity with a major trade union boss , brushing aside the repeated clashes that have marked his seven years in power .

washington is watching sunday 's election and , secretly , hoping for a merkel victory .
but the promise of better relations is off-set by areas of potential dispute . should conservative angela merkel sweep to victory in sunday 's elections , it could mean a fresh start for strained us-german relations , according to analysts . after dipping to new lows under chancellor gerhard schröder and his center-left coalition , with differences over iraq and the partnership linking germany , france and russia undermining ties , the relationship seems to have stabilized of late .
but a victory by merkel , an atlanticist like her mentor helmut kohl , could make ties to washington a lot friendlier . " what is happening in germany is a catalyst for change , " said rockwell schnabel , former us ambassador to the european union and author of a new book on the eu and its contentious relations with the united states . merkel appears to be " a closer friend of the united states and therefore would lead a policy that would be more pro-american and pro-atlanticist , " he added . merkel 's priorities after riding a wave of anti-bush sentiment to victory in 2002 , germany 's miserable economic state has forced schröder to focus on domestic issues in his uphill battle to re-election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- might do things differently than her predecessor -lrb- left -rrb- opinion polls show that merkel , candidate for the christian democrats , has a good chance at becoming the country 's first female chancellor .
but up to 30 percent of the electorate remains undecided . merkel , 51 , has said that one of her priorities if elected would be mending the poisoned relationship with the united states , while still not sending troops to iraq .
washington is also interested in her aggressive pro-free market agenda . although bush officials refuse to publicly comment on the outcome of the sunday vote , privately they say a merkel victory would be a welcome change . a fresh start , without " leftovers " " if the administration representatives are honest they 'll tell you ' well this is a fresh start and merkel 's victory would be a good thing ' , " said jackson janes , director of the american institute for contemporary german studies . " we got a lot of leftovers with the schröder team and we 'll probably never be able to change that , so if we get a new team in berlin it 's an opportunity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jackson janes janes -lrb- photo -rrb- and others warned , however , that if merkel wins on sunday , the bush administration should n't rush to pop the champagne corks .
" i do n't think that we here in washington should escalate our expectations that her parameters would be significantly bigger than schröder 's , " janes said . dieter dettke , executive director of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , which is close to schröder 's spd , in washington , said that while merkel would certainly work hard to establish smoother lines of communication with washington , in substance there could be little change under her administration as far as foreign policy is concerned .
the turkey question one likely contentious issue , janes and dettke noted , was merkel 's opposition to turkey becoming a full member of the european union which put her at odds with washington . nonetheless , analysts say , relations under merkel are unlikely to be any worse than they have been with schröder . " i think that -lrb- if merkel wins -rrb- there 's going to be much more of an effort to say ' let 's see where we agree ... ' , " janes said .

washington is watching sunday 's election and , secretly , hoping for a merkel victory .
but the promise of better relations is off-set by areas of potential dispute . should conservative angela merkel sweep to victory in sunday 's elections , it could mean a fresh start for strained us-german relations , according to analysts . after dipping to new lows under chancellor gerhard schröder and his center-left coalition , with differences over iraq and the partnership linking germany , france and russia undermining ties , the relationship seems to have stabilized of late .
but a victory by merkel , an atlanticist like her mentor helmut kohl , could make ties to washington a lot friendlier . " what is happening in germany is a catalyst for change , " said rockwell schnabel , former us ambassador to the european union and author of a new book on the eu and its contentious relations with the united states . merkel appears to be " a closer friend of the united states and therefore would lead a policy that would be more pro-american and pro-atlanticist , " he added . merkel 's priorities after riding a wave of anti-bush sentiment to victory in 2002 , germany 's miserable economic state has forced schröder to focus on domestic issues in his uphill battle to re-election . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- right -rrb- might do things differently than her predecessor -lrb- left -rrb- opinion polls show that merkel , candidate for the christian democrats , has a good chance at becoming the country 's first female chancellor .
but up to 30 percent of the electorate remains undecided . merkel , 51 , has said that one of her priorities if elected would be mending the poisoned relationship with the united states , while still not sending troops to iraq .
washington is also interested in her aggressive pro-free market agenda . although bush officials refuse to publicly comment on the outcome of the sunday vote , privately they say a merkel victory would be a welcome change . a fresh start , without " leftovers " " if the administration representatives are honest they 'll tell you ' well this is a fresh start and merkel 's victory would be a good thing ' , " said jackson janes , director of the american institute for contemporary german studies . " we got a lot of leftovers with the schröder team and we 'll probably never be able to change that , so if we get a new team in berlin it 's an opportunity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jackson janes janes -lrb- photo -rrb- and others warned , however , that if merkel wins on sunday , the bush administration should n't rush to pop the champagne corks .
" i do n't think that we here in washington should escalate our expectations that her parameters would be significantly bigger than schröder 's , " janes said . dieter dettke , executive director of germany 's friedrich ebert foundation , which is close to schröder 's spd , in washington , said that while merkel would certainly work hard to establish smoother lines of communication with washington , in substance there could be little change under her administration as far as foreign policy is concerned .
the turkey question one likely contentious issue , janes and dettke noted , was merkel 's opposition to turkey becoming a full member of the european union which put her at odds with washington . nonetheless , analysts say , relations under merkel are unlikely to be any worse than they have been with schröder . " i think that -lrb- if merkel wins -rrb- there 's going to be much more of an effort to say ' let 's see where we agree ... ' , " janes said .

it 's just as crucial for the country 's trade unions , which could see their power greatly reduced by a conservative-liberal government . the chairman of germany 's dgb trade union federation , michael sommer , was all smiles as he stood side by side with chancellor gerhard schröder last week at the dgb headquarters .
just months ago , the two would n't even shake each the other 's hand after the bitter recriminations that were thrown from both sides over welfare and labor market reforms put in place by schröder .
at the kiss-and-make-up session , however , sommer was , while not commanding , strongly suggesting that germany 's trade union members vote for schröder and keep the current social democratic-green coalition in power for four more years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer , dgb chairman , right , and chancellor gerhard schröder , left , brief the media following their their talks at the dgb headquarters in berlin .
" it 's about nothing less than determining the future of this society , " sommer said .
in the back of his mind , however , he might have been thinking about the future of germany 's trade union movement , which is looking more uncertain these days , especially if a coalition of angela merkel 's conservative union bloc and the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- form the next government .
while sommer had his problems with his traditional allies - schröder 's social democrats , whose reforms were seen as " socially unjust " - the alternative looks even worse .
in these somewhat desperate times , better to go with the lesser of two evils .
" if the majority of voters vote for the union and the fdp , these parties could attempt to break the back of the unions , like margaret thatcher did in great britain , " sommer told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
and while once unions in the uk were mighty forces , today they are but a shadow of their former selves .
" unions lost that fight -lrb- over reforms -rrb- , " said hagen lesch , an expert on wage policy at the cologne institute for economic research .
" the thinking is to hang on to what they have now . "
traditional force trade unions in germany have traditionally been a powerful force in the labor market .
unions , in often tough negotiations with employers , set wage agreements that apply to entire sectors of the labor market .
in the postwar era , that has translated into regular pay increases for workers , generous holiday and sick-time allowances , and labor conditions that are the envy of much of the world .
bildunterschrift : steelworkers protesting but things have changed on the labor landscape and the once shining reputation of german trade unions is looking tarnished .
the country 's unemployment rate , which has been rising since the 1970s and is now at almost 12 percent , seems impossible to get down .
the pressures of globalization and the outsourcing of many manufacturing jobs means the traditional models - a job for life , an ever-increasing standard of living , cradle-to-grave security - are proving unsustainable .
the economy is stuck with anemic growth rates and often hovers just above recession .
economists , business leaders and some politicians have been calling for reform , for more self-responsibility , more flexibility and less government intervention and state support .
unions have resisted those appeals , claiming they hurt workers , and have begun to be seen - depending on which side of the labor and political spectrum one stands - as roadblocks to growth or protectors of the common man .
however , among the political classes , the former category of opinion appears to be in the ascendant .
change , it is a-comin ' ?
the conservative cdu party , led by angela merkel , who is likely to become germany 's next , and first female , chancellor , has said the unions will likely be looking at change if she forms the next government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel she wants to take away some of their most cherished power - that of setting sector-wide wage agreements - and allow staff and management at individual companies to decide if they want to determine their own pay scales .
merkel has said she wants germany to continue to have strong unions , but that they should be more flexible .
" one ca n't say you 're for a strong union and at the same time , erode wage autonomy .
that 's a contradiction , " said hans-joachim schabedoth , head of the policy department of the dgb .
according to him , conservatives are playing a dangerous game in attempting to eviscerate union power .
history has shown , if a government wants to maintain a majority , or its popularity , it has to pay attention to union interests , he said . the current anti-union strategy was going against the best interests of the larger society , he added .
" our role is to ensure that people benefit from their own work and that social questions are considered in the larger economy so that social problems do n't grow , " he said .
" therefore we 're worried about the current state of things . "
overall decline but the role of unions , in the minds of the populace at least , seems to have lost of its importance .
de-unionization has been a phenomenon over the past two decades all over the world .
since the 1980s , the share of wage earners who are also union members has declined in all but a few countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , the trend is the same .
membership of the dgb 's affiliated trade unions dropped by nearly 5 percent in 2004 and is now at just over 7 million .
unions also face the problem of an aging membership , which does not portend well for the future .
membership of young people -lrb- 16-25 -rrb- within the dgb dropped considerably from 15 percent in the early 1980s to about 5 percent today .
that slow decline could be revved up considerably after sunday 's vote , should the center-right and the free-market liberals prove triumphant .
if unions lose their main power position - the setting of sector-wide wage agreements - it could well cause many workers to reconsider their union memberships and spend their dues money elsewhere .
other considerations by merkel & co . , such as loosening job protection laws , liberalizing store opening hours , and rethinking policies on worker participation in company management , if they go through , would also be defeats for unions and could further push them to the periphery of a germany that appears to be embarking on a more free-market course . kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder seeks unions ' support ten days ahead of germany 's general elections , chancellor gerhard schröder made a show of unity with a major trade union boss , brushing aside the repeated clashes that have marked his seven years in power .

it 's just as crucial for the country 's trade unions , which could see their power greatly reduced by a conservative-liberal government . the chairman of germany 's dgb trade union federation , michael sommer , was all smiles as he stood side by side with chancellor gerhard schröder last week at the dgb headquarters .
just months ago , the two would n't even shake each the other 's hand after the bitter recriminations that were thrown from both sides over welfare and labor market reforms put in place by schröder .
at the kiss-and-make-up session , however , sommer was , while not commanding , strongly suggesting that germany 's trade union members vote for schröder and keep the current social democratic-green coalition in power for four more years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael sommer , dgb chairman , right , and chancellor gerhard schröder , left , brief the media following their their talks at the dgb headquarters in berlin .
" it 's about nothing less than determining the future of this society , " sommer said .
in the back of his mind , however , he might have been thinking about the future of germany 's trade union movement , which is looking more uncertain these days , especially if a coalition of angela merkel 's conservative union bloc and the free-market liberals -lrb- fdp -rrb- form the next government .
while sommer had his problems with his traditional allies - schröder 's social democrats , whose reforms were seen as " socially unjust " - the alternative looks even worse .
in these somewhat desperate times , better to go with the lesser of two evils .
" if the majority of voters vote for the union and the fdp , these parties could attempt to break the back of the unions , like margaret thatcher did in great britain , " sommer told the tagesspiegel newspaper .
and while once unions in the uk were mighty forces , today they are but a shadow of their former selves .
" unions lost that fight -lrb- over reforms -rrb- , " said hagen lesch , an expert on wage policy at the cologne institute for economic research .
" the thinking is to hang on to what they have now . "
traditional force trade unions in germany have traditionally been a powerful force in the labor market .
unions , in often tough negotiations with employers , set wage agreements that apply to entire sectors of the labor market .
in the postwar era , that has translated into regular pay increases for workers , generous holiday and sick-time allowances , and labor conditions that are the envy of much of the world .
bildunterschrift : steelworkers protesting but things have changed on the labor landscape and the once shining reputation of german trade unions is looking tarnished .
the country 's unemployment rate , which has been rising since the 1970s and is now at almost 12 percent , seems impossible to get down .
the pressures of globalization and the outsourcing of many manufacturing jobs means the traditional models - a job for life , an ever-increasing standard of living , cradle-to-grave security - are proving unsustainable .
the economy is stuck with anemic growth rates and often hovers just above recession .
economists , business leaders and some politicians have been calling for reform , for more self-responsibility , more flexibility and less government intervention and state support .
unions have resisted those appeals , claiming they hurt workers , and have begun to be seen - depending on which side of the labor and political spectrum one stands - as roadblocks to growth or protectors of the common man .
however , among the political classes , the former category of opinion appears to be in the ascendant .
change , it is a-comin ' ?
the conservative cdu party , led by angela merkel , who is likely to become germany 's next , and first female , chancellor , has said the unions will likely be looking at change if she forms the next government .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel she wants to take away some of their most cherished power - that of setting sector-wide wage agreements - and allow staff and management at individual companies to decide if they want to determine their own pay scales .
merkel has said she wants germany to continue to have strong unions , but that they should be more flexible .
" one ca n't say you 're for a strong union and at the same time , erode wage autonomy .
that 's a contradiction , " said hans-joachim schabedoth , head of the policy department of the dgb .
according to him , conservatives are playing a dangerous game in attempting to eviscerate union power .
history has shown , if a government wants to maintain a majority , or its popularity , it has to pay attention to union interests , he said . the current anti-union strategy was going against the best interests of the larger society , he added .
" our role is to ensure that people benefit from their own work and that social questions are considered in the larger economy so that social problems do n't grow , " he said .
" therefore we 're worried about the current state of things . "
overall decline but the role of unions , in the minds of the populace at least , seems to have lost of its importance .
de-unionization has been a phenomenon over the past two decades all over the world .
since the 1980s , the share of wage earners who are also union members has declined in all but a few countries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in germany , the trend is the same .
membership of the dgb 's affiliated trade unions dropped by nearly 5 percent in 2004 and is now at just over 7 million .
unions also face the problem of an aging membership , which does not portend well for the future .
membership of young people -lrb- 16-25 -rrb- within the dgb dropped considerably from 15 percent in the early 1980s to about 5 percent today .

dw-world summarizes the main points of the race set to end sept .
18 . a process that was riddled with pitfalls when it started in july will come to an end on sunday , when germans decide who will sit in the chancellery for the next four years .
already upset about his coalition 's inability to push through necessary economic and welfare reforms due to constant blockades from the opposition and inner-party bickering , and after suffering damning regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , chancellor gerhard schröder called for a vote of confidence he hoped to - and did - lose , as a way of introducing early elections .
german president horst köhler and the country 's highest court approved the move , deciding that schröder 's ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens did indeed fulfill the necessary legal criteria to dissolve parliament - not having enough of a mandate to run the government effectively .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : köhler took the entire 21 days allotted to him before deciding to dissolve parliament köhler did his duty " it is my duty as president to decide this issue according to the law , " köhler -lrb- photo -rrb- said in a national television broadcast on july 22 .
" i think it is best to have a new election to let the people decide . "
the decision pleased the majority of german voters and all the major political parties .
since receiving the official thumbs up , the parties ' campaigns have been dominated by their different visions of how to deal with germany 's sluggish economy and high unemployment .
schröder urges voters to stay the course bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder insists his reforms have germany on the right track in part , schröder 's unpopular market and labor reforms led to the need for new elections in the first place , but as the campaigning wraps up , he continues to insist that germany has taken the right route .
" we are going in the right direction , " schröder -lrb- photo -rrb- said during his party 's caucus .
" and we need to stay the course . "
like schröder , angela merkel , the opposition christian democratic party 's -lrb- cdu -rrb- chancellor candidate , continues zigzagging across the country holding two rallies a day to win over the voters who could tip the scales in their favor .
rather than speculating on possible coalitions - as one-third of voters are reportedly undecided - merkel has been spending more time in public trying to win votes with sharp criticism of governmental policies that she blames for nearly 5 million unemployed and a budget that continuously breaks european union stability pact rules .
" there is no reason that a re-elected spd parliamentary group would be able to implement new reforms , " she said .
" they may be willing to be in the government , but they are not able . "
union slipping in polls since debate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : until july , merkel 's party was well ahead of the spd in the polls , at times even enjoying an absolute majority .
but merkel has seen her lead slip away since july , when the cdu revealed plans to increase national sales tax by 2 percent .
the real downturn came after a televised debate between merkel and schröder on sept .
4 , in which the chancellor again proved himself to be both media-savvy and telegenic , while his challenger managed to squeeze through the broadcast without too many glaring gaffes .
since then , schröder has increased his party 's take of the vote to 33 percent and put an end to the newly-formed left party 's double-digit poll results .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's comments did n't give merkel much of a hand with voters unfortunate comments from edmund stoiber -lrb- photo -rrb- , leader of the christian social union , the cdu 's bavarian sister party , and runner-up to schröder in the 2002 election , did further damage to the conservatives ' campaign .
stoiber called eastern germans " frustrated " and less capable than the voters in his home state of bavaria .
parties split on reforms merkel 's woes have only been multiplied by paul kirchhof , a potential finance minister who the cdu leader introduced as key to the reforms her government would carry out upon election .
but members of the party base have scorned the heidelberg economics professor , saying his radical changes to germany 's tax code go too far beyond the party platform they have supported .
though the spd 's campaign has not been as turbulent as the cdu / csu 's , it remains to be seen whether schröder can earn enough votes to stay in power and carry through his reform plans , or whether the cdu / csu will get a chance at trying to bring germany back up to speed . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german election enters final phase with five days to before germany elects a new government , both chancellor gerhard schröder and opposition frontrunner angela merkel are confident they can gain a majority and avoid a so-called grand coalition .

already upset about his coalition 's inability to push through necessary economic and welfare reforms due to constant blockades from the opposition and inner-party bickering , and after suffering damning regional elections in north rhine-westphalia , chancellor gerhard schröder called for a vote of confidence he hoped to - and did - lose , as a way of introducing early elections .
german president horst köhler and the country 's highest court approved the move , deciding that schröder 's ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and greens did indeed fulfill the necessary legal criteria to dissolve parliament - not having enough of a mandate to run the government effectively .

bildunterschrift : speaking at the un general assembly , fischer stressed that unsuccessful negotiations so far about expanding the security council should be reopened .
he added that he was hopeful that a watered-down plan adopted by the general assembly to restructure the world body still " leaves the door open " for further progress . " we will continue to work patiently on reform , " the minister told german reporters .
fischer quashed rumors that reform of the un 's highest-ranking body had been put on hold , saying that " the pressure of relationships makes this reform necessary . "
he underlined that the german government was not primarily concerned about getting permanent membership , but rather wanted to bestow more legitimacy on the world body by ensuring that it no longer reflected the world of 1945 but rather that of the 21st century .
opposition from us and china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un security council has five permanent members - the us , russia , china , france and great britain .
the remaining ten members are elected for a period of two years .
germany has launched a joint bid along with japan , india and brazil for permanent membership .
the group known as " g4 " agreed thursday on the sidelines of the un summit to continue to pursue efforts towards that end .
the g4 had submitted a plan to boost the council 's membership from its current 15 to 25 , with six new permanent seats and four new non-permanent seats .
their first bid ran into opposition from the united states and china and failed to get crucial support from africa for the necessary two-thirds of member countries ' votes in the un general assembly to change the world body 's charter .
fischer 's appeal to reform and expand the security council was lent support by the remaining g4 members on thursday , many of whom appeared optimistic about their chances .
g4 not dead " the g4 exists .
the g4 will continue to work for united nations reform , " indian foreign minister natwar singh said .
singh added that their proposal could be reintroduced at the 60th session of the un general assembly with some changes .
" we are confident that it -lrb- reform -rrb- will happen , " said brazilian foreign minister celso amorim .
japan in particular , made a strong case for the security council to be more inclusive and meet the challenges of a changing world .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi in a speech to the un world summit , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , fresh off a thumping election victory at home , pleaded the case for change on the security council .
" the world has changed dramatically over the last 60 years .
asia and africa , once under the shackles of colonialism , are now significant players in our global community , " koizumi told other leaders .
" for the last 60 years , japan has determinedly pursued a course of development as a peace-loving nation , making a unique and significant contribution to the peace and prosperity of the world , " he said .
" the composition of the security council must reflect these fundamental changes .
japan is convinced that security council reform is a just cause for the international community - as is the deletion of the long-obsolete ' enemy state ' clauses from the un charter , " koizumi added .
japan was one of the vanquished nations in 1945 , but now has the world 's second-largest economy and is the second-biggest contributor to the un budget .
germany has made a similar case as europe 's biggest economy .

bildunterschrift : speaking at the un general assembly , fischer stressed that unsuccessful negotiations so far about expanding the security council should be reopened .
he added that he was hopeful that a watered-down plan adopted by the general assembly to restructure the world body still " leaves the door open " for further progress . " we will continue to work patiently on reform , " the minister told german reporters .
fischer quashed rumors that reform of the un 's highest-ranking body had been put on hold , saying that " the pressure of relationships makes this reform necessary . "
he underlined that the german government was not primarily concerned about getting permanent membership , but rather wanted to bestow more legitimacy on the world body by ensuring that it no longer reflected the world of 1945 but rather that of the 21st century .

the remaining ten members are elected for a period of two years .
germany has launched a joint bid along with japan , india and brazil for permanent membership .
the group known as " g4 " agreed thursday on the sidelines of the un summit to continue to pursue efforts towards that end .
the g4 had submitted a plan to boost the council 's membership from its current 15 to 25 , with six new permanent seats and four new non-permanent seats .
their first bid ran into opposition from the united states and china and failed to get crucial support from africa for the necessary two-thirds of member countries ' votes in the un general assembly to change the world body 's charter .
fischer 's appeal to reform and expand the security council was lent support by the remaining g4 members on thursday , many of whom appeared optimistic about their chances .
g4 not dead " the g4 exists .
the g4 will continue to work for united nations reform , " indian foreign minister natwar singh said .
singh added that their proposal could be reintroduced at the 60th session of the un general assembly with some changes .

" we had a very thorough exchange of the different positions of the eu-3 and the new government of iran , " british foreign secretary jack straw told reporters after the 80-minute session with iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said the ministers had a " very frank discussion " in the first talks between iran and the so-called eu-3 since a may 25 session in geneva . meeting with new president the ministers later sat down with iran 's new president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who planned to unveil what tehran called new proposals to resolve the standoff , in a speech in new york saturday . " we 're going to listen carefully to what the president has to say and we 'll take it from there , " straw said afterwards . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer and others trying to avert showdown european union foreign policy chief javier solana , who also attended the meeting with ahmadinejad along with german foreign minister joschka fischer , stressed there were no actual negotiations . " we have only prepared the ground , " solana told reporters .
" if it is possible to continue ? .
it 's not clear yet .
we have to wait until the speech . " possible referral to security council douste-blazy insisted the eu-3 strategy had always been to avoid involving the security council , but added that the next step would depend on how far ahmadinejad 's speech goes in addressing the europeans ' concerns . " if there 's no movement , no change ... it 's not at all impossible that there will be a referral to the council , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's president-elect mahmoud ahmadinejad to outline iran plans saturday ´ annan organized the meeting between iran and the eu-3 , which has been trying for nearly two years to wean tehran off its suspected nuclear arms ambitions with economic and security incentives . russia opposed on the margins of the summit , russian president vladimir also huddled with ahmadinejad but a russian official who was present for the first half of the hour-long meeting said the two leaders did not discuss tehran 's nuclear program . russia is building a nuclear power plant in bushehr , iran , a move which has sparked controversy as the united states and other western countries accuse iran of seeking to secretly build nuclear weapons . moscow has indicated it will not support hauling iran before the un security council over its suspected weapons-related nuclear program , as sought by the united states and its european allies . making his debut appearance on the international stage wednesday , ahmadinejad lashed out at western " interventionism " but did not touch the thorny nuclear issue when he addressed the general assembly . ahmadinejad has defended his country 's nuclear program as purely peaceful . the united states has been lobbying for world support to refer iran to the un security council for possible sanctions but has signaled it may not have enough backing when the iaea board convenes monday . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-3 seek nuclear talks with iran germany , france and britain sought talks with iran on the sidelines of the un summit as washington signaled it needed more time to enlist support for possible un sanctions against tehran over its nuclear program .

" the meeting of the ambassadors is over .
there has not been any major shift in the countries ' positions , " one diplomat told reuters .
the eu 's british presidency , which has been trying to resolve the issue for weeks , has conceded that it may have to call a special meeting of eu foreign ministers , possibly on sept .
26 , an agreement can not be reached soon .
still hope for a deal but a presidency spokesman tried to sound upbeat after the ambassadors met .
" it was a good discussion .
considerable progress was made and we hope to reach an agreement soon , " he said .
" we remain hopeful that we wo n't have to drag the ministers to brussels . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has been unwilling to recognize the nikosia government turkey drew criticism in july when , while signing a protocol extending a customs accord with the eu to the bloc 's 10 newest states - including cyprus - it simultaneously declared this did not amount to a recognition of the nicosia government .
the eu ministers are seeking agreement on a " counter-declaration , " but differences over how strongly it should press ankara to recognize the island member state have so far prevented an accord .
cyprus , which gained independence from britain in 1960 , has struggled to emerge from its three-decade-long division into predominantly greek-cypriot and turkish-cypriot sectors .
the island has been split since 1974 when the turkish military occupied the northern third in response to a greek-inspired coup .
turkey supports the turkish cypriot breakaway state in the north of the mediterranean island , while cyprus 's greek cypriot government represents the whole island in the eu .
british-french agreement fails earlier this week , britain and france sought support for a compromise stating that turkey should recognize cyprus before joining , but that failed to win enough backing when the ambassadors first met on wednesday .
the latest draft for the friday meeting , seen by afp , contained a paragraph proposing that the eu tell ankara that " prior recognition of all member states is a necessary component of accession . "
without providing additional details , an eu diplomat said that cyprus , its closest ally greece as well as the czech republic had refused to accept the wording .
cyprus previously stated it wanted the eu to create deadlines for turkey to fulfill in its process of recognizing the mediterranean island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus wants access to turkish ports and airports cyprus wants access to turkish ports the draft also warned that failure by turkey to fully implement the ankara accord - notably by allowing cypriot ships and planes to use its ports and airports - will slow down the pace of membership talks .
" failure to implement its obligations in full will affect the overall progress in the negotiations , " the draft said .
the eu diplomat said that this warning " was acceptable to all member states . "
while the eu debates what position to take , ankara has grown increasingly impatient , with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan accusing the bloc of " rude " diplomatic conduct for placing new conditions on its bid to become a member .
turkey said it would recognize cyprus only after a broad international agreement , possibly sponsored by the united nations , to end the division of the island .
ankara argues that although it occupied the northern part of the island in 1974 to protect the turkish population following a pro-greek coup , it is not responsible for the continuing division of cyprus . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de uk and france mull deal on turkey standoff britain and france have agreed that turkey must recognize cyprus before joining the european union , as a possible compromise to clear the way for accession talks next month , according to diplomatic sources .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has been unwilling to recognize the nikosia government turkey drew criticism in july when , while signing a protocol extending a customs accord with the eu to the bloc 's 10 newest states - including cyprus - it simultaneously declared this did not amount to a recognition of the nicosia government .
the eu ministers are seeking agreement on a " counter-declaration , " but differences over how strongly it should press ankara to recognize the island member state have so far prevented an accord .
cyprus , which gained independence from britain in 1960 , has struggled to emerge from its three-decade-long division into predominantly greek-cypriot and turkish-cypriot sectors .
the island has been split since 1974 when the turkish military occupied the northern third in response to a greek-inspired coup .
turkey supports the turkish cypriot breakaway state in the north of the mediterranean island , while cyprus 's greek cypriot government represents the whole island in the eu .
british-french agreement fails earlier this week , britain and france sought support for a compromise stating that turkey should recognize cyprus before joining , but that failed to win enough backing when the ambassadors first met on wednesday .
the latest draft for the friday meeting , seen by afp , contained a paragraph proposing that the eu tell ankara that " prior recognition of all member states is a necessary component of accession . "
without providing additional details , an eu diplomat said that cyprus , its closest ally greece as well as the czech republic had refused to accept the wording .
cyprus previously stated it wanted the eu to create deadlines for turkey to fulfill in its process of recognizing the mediterranean island .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyprus wants access to turkish ports and airports cyprus wants access to turkish ports the draft also warned that failure by turkey to fully implement the ankara accord - notably by allowing cypriot ships and planes to use its ports and airports - will slow down the pace of membership talks .
" failure to implement its obligations in full will affect the overall progress in the negotiations , " the draft said .
the eu diplomat said that this warning " was acceptable to all member states . "
while the eu debates what position to take , ankara has grown increasingly impatient , with prime minister recep tayyip erdogan accusing the bloc of " rude " diplomatic conduct for placing new conditions on its bid to become a member .
turkey said it would recognize cyprus only after a broad international agreement , possibly sponsored by the united nations , to end the division of the island .
ankara argues that although it occupied the northern part of the island in 1974 to protect the turkish population following a pro-greek coup , it is not responsible for the continuing division of cyprus . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de uk and france mull deal on turkey standoff britain and france have agreed that turkey must recognize cyprus before joining the european union , as a possible compromise to clear the way for accession talks next month , according to diplomatic sources .

" the moon is the next worthy goal , " said astronaut manfred messerschmid during the symposium , adding that the celestial body is only 1,000 hours away from the earth , unlike mars which takes a 1,000 days to reach .
the companies also urged the creation of an unmanned european research station on the moon .
they said in a statement that a gigantic long wave radio telescope would be installed on the back of the moon by 2015 to research a completely unknown side of the universe .
the aerospace firms added that they hoped the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- would shoulder the costs of the project which is estimated at around 1 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.23 billion -rrb- .
esa , which is headquartered in paris , is expected to debate the issue during its next conference , in december .
europe could lag in space exploration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa 's aurora mission will explore the solar system esa 's aurora project , which began in 2001 , does include plans for a manned mars mission as well as a manned mission to the moon .
esa wants to head to mars and the moon , but not before 2033 and 2024 respectively .
that 's too late for the scientists , researchers and industry representatives assembled in bremen on thursday , who stressed that europe had to do more , and quickly , in space research if it wanted to keep up with other nations .
manfred fuchs , head of the bremen-based aerospace company ohb said that other countries had long been involved in missions to the moon .
he criticized the fact that the issue unfortunately " is n't the first priority " in europe and warned that germany , as the biggest country in europe , could n't afford to sit back while countries such as the us , russia , japan , china and india planned and realized their own space programs .
money the biggest problem most scientists and industry representatives admitted that the biggest stumbling block to european aerospace research is the paucity of funds .
evert dudok , president of eads space transportation , said that a central problem in germany was the slim budget for space research .
that amount plus the funds germany receives from esa add up to just about 700 million euros , dudok pointed out and added that the budget for this year had already been completely allocated .
" we demand a raise of 15 percent or 100 million euros to finally get some leeway , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an artist 's impression of the esa landing unit ' huygens ' -lrb- left -rrb- separating from the ' cassini ' orbiter as the spacecraft advances titan , saturn 's biggest moon both eads space transportation and ohb as well astronaut ernst messerschmidt have appealed to the german government for support and more funds .
messerschmidt said that the german research ministry 's budget allocation for space research had already fallen to 11 percent from 20 percent .
" we have to stop this process , " messerschmit said .
manfred fuchs pointed out that nations like japan had already massively increased their space research budgets .
however , a spokesman for the german aerospace center -lrb- dlr -rrb- was skeptical of the ambitious plans of aerospace industry representatives .
he told spiegel online that the " big goal " of the dlr remained the international space station iss and the docking of the european space research module colombus .
a " quantum leap " aerospace industry experts for now have pinned their hopes on a more realistic goal : building a giant radio telescope on the moon by 2015 , which in dudok 's words would bring a " quantum leap for radio astronomy . "
eads space transportation is already working with dutch researchers on the telescope .
the apparatus , which will be transported with the help of a ariane 5 rocket , will consist of 100 small antennae and will cover an initial radius of 300 meters , if all goes according to plan .

labour prime minister helen clark wants to wrap up a third election victory , but is being pushed to the wire by the national party 's don brash .
late campaigning was disrupted when a man threatened to blow himself up unless ms clark spoke to him .
police arrested a man early on friday after a 14-hour siege in a hotel in the northern city of tauranga .
police said they found a fake bomb .
it is thought the man , described as a 57-year-old slovakian , was angry about a visa ruling .
more than 2,000 people had to be evacuated during the siege .
' bargaining chip ' new zealanders vote on saturday , with the latest opinion polls showing the two leading parties neck-and-neck .
mr brash , a former central bank governor , has only been in parliament for three years , but has shaken up the establishment by vowing to soften new zealand 's ban on nuclear-powered vessels in its ports , and to discard some privileges for the country 's native maori .
profile : helen clark he says the long-standing nuclear ban is stifling relations with the united states , and its renegotiation could help with a free trade deal .
ms clark said : " what -lsb- that -rsb- tells me is that they really do n't share the deep-held values of new zealanders to be nuclear-free and proud and independent .
they see it as just a bargaining chip for something else .
i think that 's wrong . "
mr brash has also pledged to do away with the seven seats reserved for maori mps and welfare policies aimed at the indigenous group .
the challenger , who also promises tax cuts , said he was planning to visit new zealand 's three major cities of wellington , auckland and christchurch on friday .
neither party is expected to win an outright majority , but will probably have to rely on smaller parties to make up a coalition .

the 64-year-old former head of new zealand 's central bank does not live up to his surname , and is known for his soft voice and mild manners .
his opponents portray him as a political novice - he only entered parliament in 2002 - as well as being a hard-nosed economist bent on reducing public services .
but his promises to cut taxes and oil prices , as well as ending preferential treatment for the indigenous maori population , won him a growing number of followers ahead of the general election .
given little chance of winning six months ago , the national party is now neck-and-neck in the polls with prime minister helen clark 's labour party .
banking background the son of a socialist presbyterian minister , mr brash initially thought about following his father into the church .
but he eventually decided to become an economist , doing a doctorate on the impact of us corporate investment in australia and later working for the world bank .
this experience , he says , had a profound influence on his political standpoint .
" my conversion was completed working on the problems of economic development , " he said in his first speech to parliament in 2002 .
" i saw with my own eyes the well-intentioned central planning of government after government lead their countries to disaster . "
he made his first attempt to break into politics in 1980 , unsuccessfully standing for the national party in an auckland by-election .
he returned to economics and took the job of governor of the reserve bank of new zealand in 1988 , a position he held for a record 14 years .
he finally became a politician in december 2002 , just a month after his party 's second straight election defeat , and rapidly rose up the ranks to oust bill english as leader in october 2003 .
critics of mr brash have highlighted his affair with singaporean secretary je lan lee in the early 1980s .
he left his wife and eventually married je lan lee in 1989 .
he has also been criticised over the involvement of a shadowy christian group called the exclusive brethren in his party 's election campaign .
he gained enemies for lending his support to the us-led war in iraq , which labour opposed , and has divided public opinion with his plans to end affirmative action programmes for maoris .
but mr brash 's supporters have described him as hardworking and intelligent , and even his relative inexperience in politics seems to have worked in his favour .
" the public have already become cynical about politicians , and to some extent they see me as one already , but to the extent that they do n't , i think that 's an advantage , " he said in a recent interview .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- german unemployment weighs on voters home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business market data economy companies health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : friday , 16 september 2005 , 07:14 gmt 08:14 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version german unemployment weighs on voters by tim weber business editor , bbc news website , reporting from germany as german voters go to the polls on sunday , unemployment will be a key issue .
despite tough labour market reforms , the number of unemployed has risen to 5m .
and germany 's jobless are getting despondent .
there are days when it feels like one big nightmare donata wittmann donata wittmann is dejected .
for 34 years she worked in the same factory , but she lost her job in december 2002 .
since then she has not had steady work , despite applying for jobs as far away as austria .
her husband kurt , who had worked there for 23 years , lost his job the year before .
they live in neustadt bei coburg in bavaria , and with unemployment running at 15 % there are very few jobs going .
now , new labour market reforms are beginning to bite .
at the moment , she gets 900 euro -lrb- £ 610 , $ 1,100 -rrb- in benefits a month , her husband 208 euro .
since the money did n't cover the bills , he sold part of his record collection on ebay .
but when the benefits office discovered their extra income , it demanded repayment of half-a-year 's worth of welfare payments .
new laws - the so-called hartz iv reforms - will soon cut her payments to just a few hundred euro .
they can barely afford the two bedroom flat where they lived for 22 years , and may have to move out shortly .
" there are days when all this feels just like one big nightmare , " says the 51-year-old mrs wittmann .
the long-term problem german calculation jobless : 4.76 million unemployment rate : 11.6 % ilo calculation jobless : 3.94 million unemployment rate : 9.2 % source : bundesagentur fuer arbeit is the economy recovering ?
germany recorded 5.2m people without a job earlier this year - a post-war record .
the numbers have fallen back below the five million mark since , and are even lower using the standardised european way of measuring unemployment .
but the impact has been devastating , not just on those without a job , but for the wider economy as well .
" high unemployment stops consumers from spending , and reduces the overall buying power , and the result is even less economic growth , " says dr rainer hecker , who runs loewe , a german consumer electronics firm .
unemployment has been the big topic of this election campaign , and all parties have promised to solve the problem .
in reality though , none of them has offered any new solutions .
the longer the problem persists , the worse the situation gets .
nearly 40 % of the unemployed - some 1.8m - have been out of a job for more than a year .
anybody who has been unemployed that long finds it difficult to get work again .
their stories are depressingly similar : andreas juraschek , 43 , had been willing to do all kinds of jobs - shop assistant , security guard , trucker , selling adverts , varnishing furniture - but all his employers were struggling firms who could not afford to keep him on .
out of a job for two years , he has applied in vain for 50 or 60 jobs .
new labour laws have forced him to work for the local council for 1.50 euro an hour .
hans-juergen schneider , 49 , is an engineer with project management experience .
first out of a job in 2000 , he tried to run his own hotel in eastern germany .
the venture quickly failed and for nearly two years he has been looking for work .
last year he wrote 286 job applications , all without success .
tanya diettmar is 22 years old and a trained secretary with language skills .
during the past year she applied for 120 jobs , and although she got close to a few , she was never hired .
before the berlin wall came down , west germany had an elaborate programme to deal with such cases .
the government employment agency paid for retraining courses to match skills with demand .
andreas juraschek : forced to work for 1.50 euro an hour but after unification in 1991 , the system collapsed under the sheer weight of numbers , as thousands of east germans lost their jobs .
today nearly 35 % of germany 's long-term unemployed have hardly any formal qualifications .
" the quality of the job applicants i see is getting worse and worse , " says rainer bosecker , head of personnel at saint-gobain ceramics in roedental , which is currently hiring .
" their motivation , their knowledge and their preparation are just not up to scratch , " he complains .
mrs wittmann , for example , received only her former employer 's in-house training , but the job centre refuses to send her on any courses , she says .
living in jena , eastern germany , 52-year-old kaethe winter had more luck .
the job centre paid for a three-year training course to prepare her for work in the hospitality industry , but prospective employers told her she was " too old " .
two english courses and a special training programme for unemployed academics later , she is in and out of short-term jobs and dozens of applications have got her nowhere .
reforms under fire to get germany out of the economic hole , chancellor gerhard schroeder social democratic government has enacted labour reforms like none before .
it 's easier to hire and fire .
it 's more tax-efficient to set up a small firm .
unemployment and welfare benefits have been cut and rolled into one , to force people to leave what the germans call the " soziale haengematte " , the welfare hammock .
people who have been without a job for a long time are offered poorly-paid " one-euro jobs " in the public sector , to help them get used to regular work again .
the employment offices have been restructured to provide more localised services .
so far , though , these and other reforms have had little impact , and everybody is frustrated - including the employers .
" i used to have a single point of contact at the job centre , " says saint-gobain 's mr bosecker , " but since the reforms i have to talk to five different people . "
" all the reforms have done is to change the way unemployment is managed , not to make it go away , " believes dr hecker at loewe .
the limits of flexibility many economists praise the reforms .
they believe the tougher laws have persuaded both workers and trade unions to be more flexible .
indeed , across the country trade unions have accepted lower wages and more flexible working hours .

"
and many people set limits to how flexible they want to be .
when saint-gobain closed its factory in erlangen and moved all 75 jobs to its main plant in nearby roedental - a bit over an hour 's drive away - only seven or eight of the workforce were prepared to follow their jobs .
" people rather work in lower paid , lower qualified jobs than move a hundred kilometres away , " says mr bosecker .
even sharp cuts in benefits ca n't persuade everybody to take up opportunities .
stefan otto , a 44-year-old engineer and software developer , has been out of a job since april 2003 .

" i used to get 60-70 % of the participants back into work , but our region recently lost 5,000 jobs in just 18 months , and since then it 's been really difficult , " says mr fehn .
he has set up a support network , the " club of the jobseekers " .
they help each other to stay motivated , but the good news stories are all too rare .
one club member , 28-year-old carpenter christian marterer , was unemployed for two-and-a-half years .

despite tough labour market reforms , the number of unemployed has risen to 5m .
and germany 's jobless are getting despondent .
there are days when it feels like one big nightmare donata wittmann donata wittmann is dejected .
for 34 years she worked in the same factory , but she lost her job in december 2002 .
since then she has not had steady work , despite applying for jobs as far away as austria .
her husband kurt , who had worked there for 23 years , lost his job the year before .
they live in neustadt bei coburg in bavaria , and with unemployment running at 15 % there are very few jobs going .
now , new labour market reforms are beginning to bite .
at the moment , she gets 900 euro -lrb- £ 610 , $ 1,100 -rrb- in benefits a month , her husband 208 euro .
since the money did n't cover the bills , he sold part of his record collection on ebay .
but when the benefits office discovered their extra income , it demanded repayment of half-a-year 's worth of welfare payments .
new laws - the so-called hartz iv reforms - will soon cut her payments to just a few hundred euro .
they can barely afford the two bedroom flat where they lived for 22 years , and may have to move out shortly .
" there are days when all this feels just like one big nightmare , " says the 51-year-old mrs wittmann .
the long-term problem german calculation jobless : 4.76 million unemployment rate : 11.6 % ilo calculation jobless : 3.94 million unemployment rate : 9.2 % source : bundesagentur fuer arbeit is the economy recovering ?
germany recorded 5.2m people without a job earlier this year - a post-war record .
the numbers have fallen back below the five million mark since , and are even lower using the standardised european way of measuring unemployment .
but the impact has been devastating , not just on those without a job , but for the wider economy as well .
" high unemployment stops consumers from spending , and reduces the overall buying power , and the result is even less economic growth , " says dr rainer hecker , who runs loewe , a german consumer electronics firm .
unemployment has been the big topic of this election campaign , and all parties have promised to solve the problem .
in reality though , none of them has offered any new solutions .
the longer the problem persists , the worse the situation gets .
nearly 40 % of the unemployed - some 1.8m - have been out of a job for more than a year .
anybody who has been unemployed that long finds it difficult to get work again .
their stories are depressingly similar : andreas juraschek , 43 , had been willing to do all kinds of jobs - shop assistant , security guard , trucker , selling adverts , varnishing furniture - but all his employers were struggling firms who could not afford to keep him on .
out of a job for two years , he has applied in vain for 50 or 60 jobs .
new labour laws have forced him to work for the local council for 1.50 euro an hour .
hans-juergen schneider , 49 , is an engineer with project management experience .
first out of a job in 2000 , he tried to run his own hotel in eastern germany .
the venture quickly failed and for nearly two years he has been looking for work .
last year he wrote 286 job applications , all without success .
tanya diettmar is 22 years old and a trained secretary with language skills .
during the past year she applied for 120 jobs , and although she got close to a few , she was never hired .
before the berlin wall came down , west germany had an elaborate programme to deal with such cases .
the government employment agency paid for retraining courses to match skills with demand .
andreas juraschek : forced to work for 1.50 euro an hour but after unification in 1991 , the system collapsed under the sheer weight of numbers , as thousands of east germans lost their jobs .
today nearly 35 % of germany 's long-term unemployed have hardly any formal qualifications .
" the quality of the job applicants i see is getting worse and worse , " says rainer bosecker , head of personnel at saint-gobain ceramics in roedental , which is currently hiring .
" their motivation , their knowledge and their preparation are just not up to scratch , " he complains .
mrs wittmann , for example , received only her former employer 's in-house training , but the job centre refuses to send her on any courses , she says .
living in jena , eastern germany , 52-year-old kaethe winter had more luck .
the job centre paid for a three-year training course to prepare her for work in the hospitality industry , but prospective employers told her she was " too old " .
two english courses and a special training programme for unemployed academics later , she is in and out of short-term jobs and dozens of applications have got her nowhere .
reforms under fire to get germany out of the economic hole , chancellor gerhard schroeder social democratic government has enacted labour reforms like none before .
it 's easier to hire and fire .
it 's more tax-efficient to set up a small firm .
unemployment and welfare benefits have been cut and rolled into one , to force people to leave what the germans call the " soziale haengematte " , the welfare hammock .
people who have been without a job for a long time are offered poorly-paid " one-euro jobs " in the public sector , to help them get used to regular work again .

survey results for 2005 revealed that , out of 180 sharks spotted over a 10-week period , 172 were sighted in scottish waters .
the study was carried out by the wildlife trust 's basking shark project .
sightings have shot up over the last few years and experts believe climate change is a factor , with the sharks following plankton from warmer seas .
in 2003 , just 40 basking sharks were spotted off the scottish coast .
but over the same period last year , 120 basking sharks were spotted , with 106 of them in scottish waters .
the survey boat covers the english channel , the irish sea , the firth of clyde and the hebrides before working its way down the west coast back to plymouth .
scotland 's seas provide a valuable food source for many different species laura bateson marine officer for scotland these sightings of the 11-metre long fish in scottish waters are in stark contrast to other marine species which have dwindled across scotland in the past year .
earlier this month , a report indicated that seabirds had suffered one of the worst breeding seasons on record , with major failures of certain species , particularly in the west coast reserves such as tiree , st kilda and canna .
it is thought this slump could be due to a lack of sandeels , which the birds feed on .
the skipper of the survey boat , colin speedie , said : " despite the devastating year for seabirds and other marine creatures in scotland , basking sharks seem to have benefited from the abundance and quality of their main food source - plankton - and are following their food supply .
" although there are a number of reasons that could have caused this availability , climate change does factor here , as the warmer currents south of the border are pushing the plankton northwards . "
' eerily silent ' laura bateson , joint marine programme officer for scotland , said : " scotland 's seas provide a valuable food source for many different species .
" the lack of sandeels in our seas has had a massively destructive effect on seabird populations , but more widely on the whole of the dependent food chain .
" the seas on the west coast of scotland , normally teeming with seabirds , have become eerily silent with sightings of minke whales and even the normally common porpoises more rare this year . "
basking sharks , along with 23 species of whales and dolphins , are part of 44,000 species supported by scotland 's coast and seas .
they can weigh more than five tonnes and can filter sea water equivalent to that held in an olympic-sized swimming pool every hour .
the scottish wildlife trust has joined forces with wwf scotland to promote the protection of species such as the basking shark .

survey results for 2005 revealed that , out of 180 sharks spotted over a 10-week period , 172 were sighted in scottish waters .
the study was carried out by the wildlife trust 's basking shark project .
sightings have shot up over the last few years and experts believe climate change is a factor , with the sharks following plankton from warmer seas .
in 2003 , just 40 basking sharks were spotted off the scottish coast .
but over the same period last year , 120 basking sharks were spotted , with 106 of them in scottish waters .
the survey boat covers the english channel , the irish sea , the firth of clyde and the hebrides before working its way down the west coast back to plymouth . "
scotland 's seas provide a valuable food source for many different species " laura bateson marine officer for scotland these sightings of the 11-metre long fish in scottish waters are in stark contrast to other marine species which have dwindled across scotland in the past year .
earlier this month , a report indicated that seabirds had suffered one of the worst breeding seasons on record , with major failures of certain species , particularly in the west coast reserves such as tiree , st kilda and canna .
it is thought this slump could be due to a lack of sandeels , which the birds feed on .
the skipper of the survey boat , colin speedie , said : " despite the devastating year for seabirds and other marine creatures in scotland , basking sharks seem to have benefited from the abundance and quality of their main food source - plankton - and are following their food supply .
" although there are a number of reasons that could have caused this availability , climate change does factor here , as the warmer currents south of the border are pushing the plankton northwards . "
' eerily silent ' laura bateson , joint marine programme officer for scotland , said : " scotland 's seas provide a valuable food source for many different species .
" the lack of sandeels in our seas has had a massively destructive effect on seabird populations , but more widely on the whole of the dependent food chain .
" the seas on the west coast of scotland , normally teeming with seabirds , have become eerily silent with sightings of minke whales and even the normally common porpoises more rare this year . "
basking sharks , along with 23 species of whales and dolphins , are part of 44,000 species supported by scotland 's coast and seas .
they can weigh more than five tonnes and can filter sea water equivalent to that held in an olympic-sized swimming pool every hour .
the scottish wildlife trust has joined forces with wwf scotland to promote the protection of species such as the basking shark .

justice minister frederick carew said this amount was unreasonable , but other benefits were being considered .
since the war 's end in 2002 , the amputees said ex-fighters have received training and cash for disarming .
but the many people mutilated by both sides in 10-year war have to make their living by begging , they said .
some 50,000 people died in the war in which horrific atrocities were committed .
there are as yet no reliable statistics on the number of amputees and war victims in sierra leone but it is thought the figure may run into several thousands .
losing patience " we want the government to start paying the compensation right now , " said lamin jusu jarka , the chairman of the amputee and war wounded association , told a stormy meeting with the attorney general and mr carew . "
we have been incapacitated but it seems the government cares less about our fate " woman amputee a trust fund for war victims was one of the recommendations made in last month 's report from the truth and reconciliation commission .
mr carew assured the amputees their plight was at top of the government 's agenda and was committed to the trust fund .
" i am working on a cabinet paper that would guarantee the amputees and war wounded free medical care , free education for their spouses through to university level and free transportation , among other benefits , " he said .
however , a £ 3,000 monthly payout for each amputee , he said , was out of the question .
" even the monthly salary of the president is far below what they are demanding .
it sounds unreasonable . "
' cheated ' but many war victims are losing patience and accuse the government of making empty promises .
" right now we are suffering .
we ca n't meet our children 's school bills and other commitments .
we have been incapacitated but it seems the government cares little about our fate , " said a 34-year old female amputee from kono in the east .
sahr momodu , whose left leg was chopped by rebel forces in 1994 , said he felt cheated as those who mutilated him have been compensated for disarming .
after the war , the thousands of amputees housed at a camp in west the capital , freetown , dubbed the amputee camp , were relocated to their home districts .
but only 400 of them have so far benefited from a shelter scheme organised by the norwegian refugee council , mr jusu jarka said .
a un-backed war crimes court has been set up to try those , from both sides , who bear the " greatest responsibility " for the wartime brutalities .

here , jose tembe looks at education in mozambique .
most schools were destroyed and many teachers killed in the war of the 26 classrooms in laulane primary school in the mozambican capital , maputo - eight have no desks and no chairs .
" our school is full to bursting point , " says headmistress ilda wava " children are forced to study seated on the floor . "
since the end of mozambique 's 16-year civil war - in which most schools were destroyed and many teachers killed - the government has been working hard to expand its education network .
it says the number of primary schools have increased from 6,500 to nearly 9,000 in the last 13 years , allowing more than one million children to get a school place .
' not perfect ' but the education system faces problems including shortages of schools , qualified teachers and textbooks .
we lack enough teachers , which is the same problem for other schools teacher charles jamisse mozambique looks back " this school is the only one in this neighbourhood teaching all the seven primary school grades , which makes it practically impossible to absorb all local children of school-going age , " says ms wava .
" we tried to double the number of pupils in each classroom , but many children continue to have no places . "
ms wava also says the overcrowding has impacted on the performance of her pupils , and teachers .
" our working conditions are n't perfect , " admits english teacher charles jamisse .
" but we have essentials , our main problem is manpower - we lack enough teachers , which is the same problem for other schools . "
enthusiasm despite studying under difficult conditions , the students at the school are enthusiastic .
of course we have big challenges , one of which is to have more girls in schools education adviser manuel lobo " i like studying because school is important for the future , " says almirante a schoolboy in standard six .
but manuel lobo , adviser to the minister of education , recognises the difficulties and says his ministry would like to do better .
" -lsb- however -rsb- , at this point and with the current resources at the ministry of education , we think that we 're doing our best in this area , " he says .
he feels they are on track to achieve the millennium development goal of universal primary education by 2015 .
" of course we have big challenges , one of which is to have more girls in schools , " mr lobo says .
" also we would like to have more women working in teaching and as school heads . "
deadline michael klaus , who works for the un children 's fund , one of mozambique 's education partners , says that taking into account the country 's state in 1992 the level of reconstruction in the education sector is positive .
key un targets for 2015 halve the number of people living on less than $ 1 a day halve the number of people without safe drinking water halve the number of people who suffer from hunger enable all children to complete primary school halt and reverse the spread of aids and malaria should we help the poor ?
despite this progress , he thinks there 's no room for complacency .
" i think the country has gone quite far but really a lot needs to be done .
" an additional effort especially needs to be made to eliminate gender disparities in education . "
and does he think the government will make the 2015 deadline ?
" it 's difficult to say , but from what we know it 's more unlikely than likely , " he says .

" our school is full to bursting point , " says headmistress ilda wava " children are forced to study seated on the floor . "
since the end of mozambique 's 16-year civil war - in which most schools were destroyed and many teachers killed - the government has been working hard to expand its education network .
it says the number of primary schools have increased from 6,500 to nearly 9,000 in the last 13 years , allowing more than one million children to get a school place .
' not perfect ' but the education system faces problems including shortages of schools , qualified teachers and textbooks .
we lack enough teachers , which is the same problem for other schools teacher charles jamisse mozambique looks back " this school is the only one in this neighbourhood teaching all the seven primary school grades , which makes it practically impossible to absorb all local children of school-going age , " says ms wava .
" we tried to double the number of pupils in each classroom , but many children continue to have no places . "
ms wava also says the overcrowding has impacted on the performance of her pupils , and teachers .
" our working conditions are n't perfect , " admits english teacher charles jamisse .
" but we have essentials , our main problem is manpower - we lack enough teachers , which is the same problem for other schools . "
enthusiasm despite studying under difficult conditions , the students at the school are enthusiastic .
of course we have big challenges , one of which is to have more girls in schools education adviser manuel lobo " i like studying because school is important for the future , " says almirante a schoolboy in standard six .
but manuel lobo , adviser to the minister of education , recognises the difficulties and says his ministry would like to do better .
" -lsb- however -rsb- , at this point and with the current resources at the ministry of education , we think that we 're doing our best in this area , " he says .
he feels they are on track to achieve the millennium development goal of universal primary education by 2015 .
" of course we have big challenges , one of which is to have more girls in schools , " mr lobo says .
" also we would like to have more women working in teaching and as school heads . "
deadline michael klaus , who works for the un children 's fund , one of mozambique 's education partners , says that taking into account the country 's state in 1992 the level of reconstruction in the education sector is positive .
key un targets for 2015 halve the number of people living on less than $ 1 a day halve the number of people without safe drinking water halve the number of people who suffer from hunger enable all children to complete primary school halt and reverse the spread of aids and malaria should we help the poor ?
despite this progress , he thinks there 's no room for complacency .
" i think the country has gone quite far but really a lot needs to be done .
" an additional effort especially needs to be made to eliminate gender disparities in education . "
and does he think the government will make the 2015 deadline ?
" it 's difficult to say , but from what we know it 's more unlikely than likely , " he says .

mr blair pledged to start calling bluffs made on tariffs and subsidies , ahead of a world trade organisation meeting in hong kong in december .
he spoke alongside campaigner bob geldof at the un summit in new york .
later mr blair joined former us president bill clinton to launch a programme aiming at tackling poverty .
the clinton global initiative also aims at finding solutions to climate change and key world issues by involving politicians , business leaders , activists and academics .
geldof said he was " not thrilled " with the progress made over pledges on debt , trade and development aid .
he gave the un a mark of four out of ten for failing to make monumental pledges on debt , trade and development aid . "
if we end up with a failure in december that will echo right around the world " tony blair he said the best the summit had achieved was to reiterate what was agreed at the g8 summit in gleneagles , scotland , two months ago .
" i understand this is a process but the process should have been accelerated and added to at the un , " geldof said .
both he and the uk prime minister agreed world leaders could not afford to fail to achieve agreement at december 's crucial wto meeting .
they hope trade ministers can work out a new global trade pact which will cut subsidies and reduce tariffs , with an emphasis on freeing up agricultural markets for poorer countries .
mr blair warned world leaders there were just 100 days to go before the hong kong meeting .
" everybody around the world at the moment is trying to call each other 's bluff on this world trade .

" i am not prepared to have that , at least not without the most monumental struggle , " he said .
the prime minister told bbc news the wto talks would be " definitive , frankly , about whether the world 's prepared to opt for free trade or not " .
mr blair joined mr clinton to launch a programme aiming to tackle poverty , climate change and key world issues by involving politicians , business leaders , activists and academics in seeking solutions .

" but getting all of these people in one place to focus on these critical problems with a commitment to what each of us can really do to change them is an important first step . "
mr blair highlighted the benefits of free trade , and again stressed the need for a positive outcome at the trade talks .
he said : " if we are serious about tackling global poverty we have got to have a successful outcome .
" the big test is collective international leadership and it is a test we have to pass . "

its producers said the show - which opened on 14 august at new york 's broadhurst theatre - would play its final performance on 24 september .
created with the help of lennon 's widow yoko ono , the musical had a troubled history that included major rewrites and a postponed opening night .

written and directed by don scardino , lennon had been criticised for what the new york times called its " ono-centric " view of its subject 's life .

john lennon and yoko ono lived in new york subsequent reports that british director david leveaux had been brought in to replace scardino were denied by producer allan mckeown .
based on lennon 's songs and interviews , the show depicted the music icon at various stages in his life and cast a black actor as sir paul mccartney .

in a demonstration at the tokyo game show , nintendo boss satoru iwata showed off a wireless controller that closely resembled a tv remote control .
motion sensors on the controller translate its movements into game action , allowing it to be used as a virtual sword , baseball bat or racket .
although the revolution 's controllers are public , nintendo has yet to reveal details about the console 's hardware .
wider appeal mr iwata said the controller resembled a remote control because that device was familiar to so many people .
xbox 360 set for november launch " its intuitive form allows both experienced and new gamers to stand on the same starting line , " he said during his keynote address at the show .
mr iwata said the revolution controller and console was aimed at converting new users to gaming who were scared off by the fast pace of existing games .
" if we ca n't do that , we might as well stand back and watch the market die off , " he said .
the wireless sensor-studded controller is a break with the past because before now most game consoles have used a two-handed device studded with buttons .
the revolution 's controller can be used to fight with on-screen weapons such as swords or control vehicles and characters but was also capable of representing quite delicate movements , said mr iwata .
three-way battle satoru iwata revealed the controller at the tokyo games show during the demonstration during mr iwata 's speech , the controller was seen being used by players to conduct an on-screen orchestra , play a virtual musical instrument and even use an in-game dentists ' drill .
the slim controller can be used one-handed or can be fitted with an extension cord that links it to a familiar thumb-controlled joystick .
nintendo 's revolution console will be released in 2006 but it is likely to appear after launches by rivals microsoft and sony .
earlier this week microsoft announced that its xbox 360 will launch in the us on 22 november , with europe and japan following at the start of december .

"
the united nations -lrb- un -rrb- is 60 years old , and 150 world leaders have been in new york to mark the anniversary with a world summit intended to revitalise the organisation after years in which its credibility and status have greatly declined .
sadly , and despite claims of substantial progress from politicians and their spin doctors , the summit has failed .
there was no agreement on disarmament , no reform of the security council and no commitment to aid targets that might help alleviate poverty .
even the security council 's condemnation of terrorism was undermined by a failure to agree what " terrorism " actually means .
digital equality the disappointment was clearly expressed by the un 's secretary-general kofi annan .
" we have not yet achieved the sweeping and fundamental reform that i and many others believe is required , " he told delegates .
one area that will inevitably suffer as a result are efforts to improve access to the internet , yet the global digital divide is becoming a major development issue precisely because of the net 's success in the developed world .
education , trading and social contacts increasingly depend on it , and being cut off from the network is now just as damaging to a local economy as trade barriers or tariffs . "
without the technologies and the practical solutions to the problems on the ground , the politicians will have nothing to fund " when the un general assembly adopted the millennium declaration in september 2000 , it committed to achieving eight goals by 2015 , including the achievement of universal primary education , work to combat hiv / aids and the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger in the world .
later , recognising the importance of information and communication technologies in achieving these goals , the world summit on the information society -lrb- wsis -rrb- was convened to consider how to build the framework of an " all-inclusive and equitable " information society .
the first wsis meeting took place in geneva in 2003 , and it meets again in tunis later this year .
but without a clear mandate from the un the discussions seem doomed to be ineffectual , filled with well-meaning platitudes but unable to deliver either resources or political change .
since the politicians are failing us , we need to look elsewhere for breakthroughs that can change people 's lives by making it possible for them to get online so that we can let the next five billion users join those of us who already have a connection to the net .
part of the problem is how we ensure the network reaches everyone , but the problems do not stop there .
throughout the world there are people working on a whole range of technologies , from fuel cells that can provide a reliable power source for rural networks to the much-publicised $ 100 computer project led by nicholas negroponte at mit , and all of this work is important .
ideas welcomed one of the research bodies funding academic work in the uk , the epsrc , has offered £ 1m from its " ideas factory " budget to pay for " novel and adventurous approaches " to the challenge of bridging the global digital divide .
instead of just asking academics to send in bids for some or all of the pot , they are holding a five-day meeting near bath later in the year , inviting researchers from the widest possible range of disciplines to work together and come up with new ideas and new ways of tackling the problem .
it is called a " sandpit " , and according to cambridge university computer scientist alan blackwell , who will be leading the discussion , it is a great way to encourage creativity and generate unexpected approaches and project proposals .
it is also a good way for researchers in different areas to discover new perspectives , find out what other people are up to and broaden their horizons .
and after five days there should be a fundable research project that can make a difference to the digitally dispossessed .
initiatives like this are absolutely vital , and i can not wait to see what they come up with .
but we can not afford to give up on the political process entirely .
whatever great ideas we have for low-cost computers or new energy supplies , bridging the global digital divide requires us to bridge another divide first - the one between the world 's senior politicians and the people who can come up with creative and affordable solutions to practical problems .
we must not forget that high-level action is capable of delivering resources at a level that university researchers , voluntary organisations or even businesses can only dream of - $ 50bn of aid for the area affected by hurricane katrina shows what can be done once the political will is there .
without the technologies and the practical solutions to the problems on the ground , the politicians will have nothing to fund .
while five days of debate , discussion and , inevitably , disagreement in bath for £ 1m of funding may not seem like it is going to change the world , we may be surprised by what emerges when a bunch of clever people are given a chance to think out loud .
and then we can try to make the politicians listen to what they say . "

everyone should have access to global networks the united nations -lrb- un -rrb- is 60 years old , and 150 world leaders have been in new york to mark the anniversary with a world summit intended to revitalise the organisation after years in which its credibility and status have greatly declined .
sadly , and despite claims of substantial progress from politicians and their spin doctors , the summit has failed .
there was no agreement on disarmament , no reform of the security council and no commitment to aid targets that might help alleviate poverty .
even the security council 's condemnation of terrorism was undermined by a failure to agree what " terrorism " actually means .

since the politicians are failing us , we need to look elsewhere for breakthroughs that can change people 's lives by making it possible for them to get online so that we can let the next five billion users join those of us who already have a connection to the net .
part of the problem is how we ensure the network reaches everyone , but the problems do not stop there .

everyone should have access to global networks the united nations -lrb- un -rrb- is 60 years old , and 150 world leaders have been in new york to mark the anniversary with a world summit intended to revitalise the organisation after years in which its credibility and status have greatly declined .
sadly , and despite claims of substantial progress from politicians and their spin doctors , the summit has failed .
there was no agreement on disarmament , no reform of the security council and no commitment to aid targets that might help alleviate poverty .
even the security council 's condemnation of terrorism was undermined by a failure to agree what " terrorism " actually means .
digital equality the disappointment was clearly expressed by the un 's secretary-general kofi annan .
" we have not yet achieved the sweeping and fundamental reform that i and many others believe is required , " he told delegates .
one area that will inevitably suffer as a result are efforts to improve access to the internet , yet the global digital divide is becoming a major development issue precisely because of the net 's success in the developed world .
education , trading and social contacts increasingly depend on it , and being cut off from the network is now just as damaging to a local economy as trade barriers or tariffs .
without the technologies and the practical solutions to the problems on the ground , the politicians will have nothing to fund in depth : un world summit on the information society when the un general assembly adopted the millennium declaration in september 2000 , it committed to achieving eight goals by 2015 , including the achievement of universal primary education , work to combat hiv / aids and the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger in the world .
later , recognising the importance of information and communication technologies in achieving these goals , the world summit on the information society -lrb- wsis -rrb- was convened to consider how to build the framework of an " all-inclusive and equitable " information society .
the first wsis meeting took place in geneva in 2003 , and it meets again in tunis later this year .
but without a clear mandate from the un the discussions seem doomed to be ineffectual , filled with well-meaning platitudes but unable to deliver either resources or political change .
since the politicians are failing us , we need to look elsewhere for breakthroughs that can change people 's lives by making it possible for them to get online so that we can let the next five billion users join those of us who already have a connection to the net .

with british cuisine no longer a national joke , food tourism is booming .
foodies , rejoice .
this weekend sees a smorgasbord of food festivals , in which the bountiful produce of yorkshire , south wales , northern ireland and scotland will be celebrated .
these are but a taster for british food fortnight , which starts the following weekend .
for no longer is british food synonymous with fish , chips and roast dinners -lrb- except , of course , for jacques chirac , who has complained that only the finns have worse cuisine -rrb- .
rick stein champions local produce during the 20th century , industrialisation began to threaten artisan producers and many abandoned their traditional techniques .
but in the past two decades , there 's been a resurgence in demand for quality products made by time-honoured methods .
the appetite is growing for regional produce , such as somerset cider , caerphilly cheese and cromer crabs .
food tourism has become big business , worth nearly £ 4bn a year .
in a recent survey of tourist perceptions of the uk food industry , two-thirds of britons said that food and drink influenced their holiday choice .
the west country , wales and scotland occupied the top three destinations .
since the malt whisky trail was set up around scottish distilleries several decades ago , the number of food and drink trails has multiplied .
new additions include a wine trail around the south-east , sausage trails in the midlands and the north-west , and a lake district afternoon tea trail .
alexia robinson , the organiser of british food fortnight , says food adds to a visitor 's experience of a place .
" taste is one of our senses .
we usually experience a place visually , such as on a castle or cathedral tour , so why not add to that through our taste buds ? "
chocolate and caviar , by heston blumenthal of bray 's fat duck even once-sleepy backwaters such as bray in berkshire , padstow in cornwall and shropshire 's ludlow have become gastronomic hotspots thanks to star chefs heston blumenthal , rick stein and shaun hill -lrb- who has since closed the michelin-starred merchant house , which in 2003 ranked among the world 's top 20 eateries -rrb- .
and the latest series of bbc two 's full on food - pitched firmly at the growing foodie market - catered for the interest in regional produce by dispatching a chef to find the tastiest local treats , be it ice cream , wild salmon or real ale .
taste of home for alexia robinson , the variety of local specialities reflects the uk 's diverse geography .
many regional dishes have evolved over centuries using ingredients best suited to the conditions and lifestyles of that area .
nation of foodies britain produces 700 regional cheeses - more than france it has 600 varieties of apple and 125 species of fish and shellfish in its waters for british food fortnight , the bbc 's action network website will detail local projects cheese varieties are one such example , as is the cornish pasty , devised to provide a filling lunch for the county 's lead miners .
and niche habitats such as salt marshes in wales give lamb from the area a distinctive taste .
what producers and caterers find is that the more local a food seems , the better the sales pitch .
hence detailed menus which name-check the farm which supplies the meat or the allotment where they grow their own asparagus .
for provenance sells , says ms robinson .
" people want to know where their food comes from .
i 've even seen a wonderful menu entry for apple and blackberry pie , ' all blackberries picked from our local hedgerows ' . "
she says that holidaymakers want foods which emphasise the heritage and culture of a place .
" if you stay in a gloucestershire b & b , for example , you 'll probably be served sausages made from gloucester old spot pigs .
in the north of england , tourists seek out potted shrimps , and apple pie is popular in kent . "
and who , at the seaside , has n't been lured into an establishment famed for serving the best fish ' n ' chips on that stretch of coast ?
food miles nor do we need to travel to track down regional delights .
food as tourist trap delicatessens now stock british goodies as well as the more usual olives and italian meats .
farmers ' markets typically draw crowds , with london 's borough market recently voted the capital 's top tourist attraction .
with producers and fine food stockists going online , tasty treats from around the uk can be delivered to your door .
food also holds a key place in the " think globally , act locally " debate .
some buyers are keen to support local businesses , or protect the environment by avoiding foods which have been transported long distances .
environmentalists and tourism bosses alike must be heartened that two-thirds of britons say they would consider holidaying at home , rather than jet off somewhere sunny , because of the food and drink on offer .
bon appetit indeed .

the fund would allow the un to respond to natural disasters and other emergencies within a matter of days rather than weeks it can take now .
the british government has promised almost half of the total sum .
the pledges came during the world summit in new york , and the proposed fund will be debated by the united nations later in the year .
fighting ' fires ' " when a crisis comes , it is to the united nations that we look , " the uk 's international development secretary hilary benn told reporters .
" the un presses the fire alarm ; but in order to get the engine out of the station , it has to pass round the hat to put petrol in the tank and water in the hoses . "
the proposed new fund , known as the central emergency response fund , would replace a current arrangement under which the un can give loans for emergency operations with one which disburses grants .
the total envisaged is us $ 500m -lrb- £ 280m -rrb- per year , 10 times the sum available now .
at the world summit , six countries pledged a total of us $ 145m to the fund 's first year ; britain 's share is us $ 70m -lrb- £ 40m -rrb- , and sweden 's us $ 40m -lrb- £ 20m -rrb- .
the other partners are norway , the netherlands , switzerland and luxembourg .
swift and certain jan egeland , the un 's under secretary general for humanitarian affairs , welcomed the move .
" our responses are very uneven , " he said , " and it often takes time for us to get money to teams in niger , to anti-locust teams , to darfur before mortality goes up .
" now we will be able to say ' let 's go ' in three to four days rather than three to four weeks . "
mr egeland also said it would enable the un to deal with crises which are currently beyond its capabilities .
the six countries anticipate further pledges of support before the end of the world summit , possibly from african nations .
the proposal , which relates to a clause in the world summit draft outcome document to improve " the timeliness and predictability of humanitarian funding " , will go to the un general assembly for approval in november .
