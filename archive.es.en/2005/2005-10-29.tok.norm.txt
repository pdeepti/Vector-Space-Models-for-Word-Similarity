the " red devils " are floundering towards the bottom of the league but the german-born turk has big plans . kaiserslautern managed to advance another round this week in the german cup .
they did it with a hard-fought 4-2 away victory on tuesday against third division side erfurt .
yet the win did nothing to relieve the pressure on coach michael henke .
in the bundesliga , lautern are just a point away from the relegation zone .
dissension inside the team and from outside -lrb- the fans -rrb- is reaching a fevered pitch . after the cup match on tuesday , henke railed against the erfurt squad by calling them " scheiss-ossis , " or " crap easterners " for not kicking the ball out of bounds towards the end of the game when a lautern player lay injured on the ground . it was indicative of the heat that henke and the team have been feeling over the past few weeks as they counted one disappointing match after another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesliga goalkeepers have been at the mercy of kaiserslautern 's halil altintop -lrb- l -rrb- this season one lautern player , forward halil altintop , has been spared the misery - at least directly .
while his teammates in back , the defenders , resemble more a sieve than a solid wall by giving up 25 goals so far , altintop has alone tallied 10 strikes , sharing the top slot in the bundesliga with bremen 's miroslav klose . " whoever allows that many goals in ten games should have nothing to do with this league , " was altintop 's reaction after last week 's 4-1 shellacking by mönchengladbach . dangerous strikers desired everywhere the fans are resorting to anything and everything to express their frustration with the club that over the past few years has been making a steady , plunge to the bottom of the standings . the joy of the 1997-98 title with coach otto rehhagel at the helm is long just a dream .
two weeks ago , the hard-core supporters vented their frustration by entering the stadium five minutes after the starting whistle - and were promptly penalized when they entered the fritz walter stadium as dortmund went out on top in the seventh minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twin brother hamit altintop -lrb- r -rrb- has found a spot on the turkish national squad it would be the game , though , that manager 's heads in the league turned to the small city in the far west of germany .
altintop would equal dortmund 's ebi smolarek 's hat trick with one of his own to preserve at least one point for kaiserslautern . all of a sudden , halil altintop was a hot commodity .
one club in particular would be a natural for the 22-year-old turk who was born in gelsenkirchen - schalke .
his twin brother hamit already plays for the " royal blues , " so it would hardly be a surprise if halil returned to his hometown . " since i 've been with lautern , there has always been speculation about schalke , " he told sport-bild magazine .
one thing is certain , altintop , who plays on the turkish national squad and whose contract expires in june 2006 , will leave kaiserslautern at the end of the season .
lautern president rene c. jäggi understands altintop 's desire to depart the crisis-riddled club . " he definitely wants to play in international competition and he could make much more money with any top european club , " jäggi said . aspirations for turkey also while the speculation is still swirling around altintop , he not only is eyeing just whom he might play for in the bundesliga .
he wants to secure himself a spot with the turkish national team that is still fighting to qualify for the world cup in germany and believes that only when he is playing against the top clubs in europe will he have a chance of wearing turkish red on the pitch and not just on the bench . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the life of a striker is not easy as altintop -lrb- l -rrb- finds out against dortmund " a coach simply prefers a player who plays for a top club , " he said in sport-bild after seeing no action in the country 's world cup qualifiers in september despite an impressive start in the bundesliga .
" you have to play against teams like inter milan . " england 's wayne rooney found that out at everton and moved to manchester united .
that wo n't be possible for altintop if he stays at kaiserslautern .
just as the " red devils " announced that it left the red and entered the black by making a small profit in the 2004-05 business year , they will have to find a replacement for the striker who could give the club a going-away president by shooting enough goals to keep lautern in the top division . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chelsea 's robert huth singing the blues robert huth must be asking himself what happened .

some 200 university students from more than 20 universities in 12 countries participated in the project under the esa 's initiative . the satellite is about the size of a standard washing machine and weighs about 62 kilograms . from the drawing board to the launch pad , the project took just 18 months with students relying on the internet as their principal means of exchanging data .
the esa provided the entire funding . " they -lrb- the satellites -rrb- are all in what we called a polar orbit , little below some 700 kilometers above our head so to speak and they have a number of technology experiments on board , " said heidi graff , a spokeswoman for esa .
" they are also testing a special new kind of solar cell , which is better in quality than the standard used to be , they will have a camera on board to try to take observation pictures and they have certain equipment on board with which they will communicate with radio amateurs all over the world , " graff added . hands-on training but even more than the technology , the uniqueness of the project lies in the fact that the entire undertaking was completed by the students themselves . the sseti , which provided the framework for the mission , was launched by esa ’ s education department in 2000 to get european students involved in real space missions , and well as give them practical hands-on experience and encourage them to take up careers in space technology and science . " it 's all done and built by the students themselves .
we more or less only financed the technical check out to make it qualify to go for launch .
it is the students who really have to get the credit , " said graff . one of the students , jürgen schlutz from the university of stuttgart who is one of 15 students studying aerospace engineering in the project propulsion team , said the hands-on training had been valuable . " we are all students of engineering but it 's a pretty much a theoretical approach , we did n't do much in the way of hardware -lrb- until now -rrb- , " schlutz said . " what we learned in the project was actually to build - what comes extra is all the involvement in the project itself , in project management , the work with student teams all over europe , the technical aspect and intercultural co-operation was something that was very valuable for team members , " he added . mark caldwell -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european aerospace aims for the moon leading german aerospace companies have urged the creation of an unmanned european space station on the moon , warning that europe could otherwise lose out to other nations in the race for space exploration and research .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.10.2005 airbus a380 deliveries run into rough weather großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 touched down in frankfurt amid thick fog the airbus a380 made a flawless test landing in germany saturday .
despite its success , the european aircraft maker wo n't be delivering the gigantic planes on time to its buyers .
experts say it wo n't dent airbus ' image . it was an event few aviation fans were willing to miss .
as a prototype of the gigantic a380 , the world 's largest passenger airliner , swooped down from the skies to make a perfect landing at the frankfurt airport on saturday morning amid thick fog , tens of thousands of spectators held their breath in awe . while some clambered on stools they had brought along to get a good look at the 290-ton heavy machine coming to a halt at terminal 2 of the rhein-main airport , others held their cameras and mobile phones above their heads to capture the image . it was the first test landing of the long-haul aircraft outside the testing facilities in france and the main aim is to check the handling and maintenance of the a380 at a civil airport .
the aircraft will fly back to toulouse in france on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 is the world 's largest passenger plane it 's exactly a year since the a380 , designed to carry up to 853 passengers , took to the skies for the first time .
since its maiden flight on april 27 , the aircraft has undergone 110 test flights , clocking 380 flying hours , said tore prang , a spokesman of airbus . " the test results are excellent .
the performance is much better than expected , " he said , adding that it also held true for the craft 's fuel-consumption - at 2.9 liters of kerosene for 100 kilometers per passenger . the low consumption - 12 percent lower than all other large aircraft according to airbus - is an important selling point given that fuel usage now accounts for around 16 to 20 percent of the overall costs of an airline . delivery marred by delays until now , 16 customers have placed orders for 159 a380s which cost 292 million euros -lrb- $ 353 million -rrb- apiece .
the gulf-based airline emirates is the biggest buyer with 41 orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 final assembly line near toulouse but , what 's annoyed many is the fact that the european aircraft manufacturer has delayed the delivery of the airplanes .
thus , singapore airlines , which wanted to get the first of its 10 ordered airplanes by march , now has to wait longer . " the a380 will fly for 30 years - it 's not just a big deal if the planes begin flying in the first or the second half of the year , " said prang .
the amount of compensation that airbus has to shell out for its waiting customers , remains under wraps . the delivery is now scheduled to begin in december 2006 provided there are no further hiccups . one of the biggest hurdles is reportedly evacuating passengers from the plane .
according to international regulations , in the case of an emergency , 873 passengers must be able to leave the aircraft in the dark within 90 seconds by using slides . airbus however insists there are no more hitches on that front . " i 'm confident that there wo n't be any problems there , " said tore prang .
but , airbus has delayed tests for far and an evacuation check is now slated for feb 2006 . " encouraging start " however , some say that teething problems are normal when it comes to mammoth projects . it 's not unusual that there are delays , according to ulrich horstmann , aviation analyst at the bayerische landesbank .
horstmann predicted that the a380 would have a shining future .
he added that the 159 orders were an encouraging start given that many airlines only develop new jets after they prove their value on the market . " airbus can rake in returns due to its monopoly because there are n't any other aircraft in that class and boeing ca n't give a befitting reply , " said horstmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german lufthansa boeing 747 takes off at the frankfurt airport the american rival is developing a larger version of the 1969-created jumbo jet in the form of its 747 advanced , which with 450 seats can carry 50 more passengers . " but the 747 is perceived as an old aircraft , " according to horstmann . the americans however have a different strategy .
instead of concentrating on a new giant aircraft , boeing is expending its energies on developing the 787 , a long-haul aircraft with 250 seats .
in future , flexible direct flights will play a greater role than has been the case until now , is the american thinking .
at the same time , the market for large aircraft is too small to make a new development - which cost 13 billion euros in the case of the a380 - profitable . airbus catches up however airbus spokesman prang does n't buy the argument . " all airports which have growth problems have welcomed the arrival of the a380 , " prang said .
london 's heathrow airport for instance could then reach 10 million extra passengers by 2016 thanks to the a380 without having to organize more take-offs and landings , he pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus believes air passenger numbers worldwide will treble and , in the coming years , the worldwide air passenger figures would rise threefold , having an effect on all class segments , prang added . " boeing only has one strategy , we have both , " he said , pointing towards the planned a340 long-haul aircraft for around 300 passengers .
airbus is currently developing the a350 , an aircraft in the same class as boeing 's 787 .
it 's expected to hit the market by 2010 . " airbus has got lots of things right , " said aviation expert horstmann .
" just 10 years ago , it was the small player , which boeing did n't take seriously enough .
but , in the meantime it has convincing offers in all segments of civil aviation . " when it came to aircrafts with a seating capacity of more than 100 , boeing and aircraft manufacturer mcdonnell-douglas which boeing took over had a market share of 70 percent until the mid-1990s .
but now with over 50 percent of the market share , airbus is leading the way . horstmann does n't believe that the balance will tip sharply . " a two-way share of the pie is closer to a monopoly than one thinks , " he said . " they -lrb- airbus and boeing -rrb- may lower prices in individual instances , but they wo n't be in a cut-throat competition .

despite its success , the european aircraft maker wo n't be delivering the gigantic planes on time to its buyers .
experts say it wo n't dent airbus ' image . it was an event few aviation fans were willing to miss .
as a prototype of the gigantic a380 , the world 's largest passenger airliner , swooped down from the skies to make a perfect landing at the frankfurt airport on saturday morning amid thick fog , tens of thousands of spectators held their breath in awe . while some clambered on stools they had brought along to get a good look at the 290-ton heavy machine coming to a halt at terminal 2 of the rhein-main airport , others held their cameras and mobile phones above their heads to capture the image . it was the first test landing of the long-haul aircraft outside the testing facilities in france and the main aim is to check the handling and maintenance of the a380 at a civil airport .
the aircraft will fly back to toulouse in france on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 is the world 's largest passenger plane it 's exactly a year since the a380 , designed to carry up to 853 passengers , took to the skies for the first time .
since its maiden flight on april 27 , the aircraft has undergone 110 test flights , clocking 380 flying hours , said tore prang , a spokesman of airbus . " the test results are excellent .
the performance is much better than expected , " he said , adding that it also held true for the craft 's fuel-consumption - at 2.9 liters of kerosene for 100 kilometers per passenger . the low consumption - 12 percent lower than all other large aircraft according to airbus - is an important selling point given that fuel usage now accounts for around 16 to 20 percent of the overall costs of an airline . delivery marred by delays until now , 16 customers have placed orders for 159 a380s which cost 292 million euros -lrb- $ 353 million -rrb- apiece .
the gulf-based airline emirates is the biggest buyer with 41 orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 final assembly line near toulouse but , what 's annoyed many is the fact that the european aircraft manufacturer has delayed the delivery of the airplanes .
thus , singapore airlines , which wanted to get the first of its 10 ordered airplanes by march , now has to wait longer . " the a380 will fly for 30 years - it 's not just a big deal if the planes begin flying in the first or the second half of the year , " said prang .
the amount of compensation that airbus has to shell out for its waiting customers , remains under wraps . the delivery is now scheduled to begin in december 2006 provided there are no further hiccups . one of the biggest hurdles is reportedly evacuating passengers from the plane .
according to international regulations , in the case of an emergency , 873 passengers must be able to leave the aircraft in the dark within 90 seconds by using slides . airbus however insists there are no more hitches on that front . " i 'm confident that there wo n't be any problems there , " said tore prang .
but , airbus has delayed tests for far and an evacuation check is now slated for feb 2006 . " encouraging start " however , some say that teething problems are normal when it comes to mammoth projects . it 's not unusual that there are delays , according to ulrich horstmann , aviation analyst at the bayerische landesbank .
horstmann predicted that the a380 would have a shining future .
he added that the 159 orders were an encouraging start given that many airlines only develop new jets after they prove their value on the market . " airbus can rake in returns due to its monopoly because there are n't any other aircraft in that class and boeing ca n't give a befitting reply , " said horstmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german lufthansa boeing 747 takes off at the frankfurt airport the american rival is developing a larger version of the 1969-created jumbo jet in the form of its 747 advanced , which with 450 seats can carry 50 more passengers . " but the 747 is perceived as an old aircraft , " according to horstmann . the americans however have a different strategy .
instead of concentrating on a new giant aircraft , boeing is expending its energies on developing the 787 , a long-haul aircraft with 250 seats .
in future , flexible direct flights will play a greater role than has been the case until now , is the american thinking .
at the same time , the market for large aircraft is too small to make a new development - which cost 13 billion euros in the case of the a380 - profitable . airbus catches up however airbus spokesman prang does n't buy the argument . " all airports which have growth problems have welcomed the arrival of the a380 , " prang said .
london 's heathrow airport for instance could then reach 10 million extra passengers by 2016 thanks to the a380 without having to organize more take-offs and landings , he pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus believes air passenger numbers worldwide will treble and , in the coming years , the worldwide air passenger figures would rise threefold , having an effect on all class segments , prang added . " boeing only has one strategy , we have both , " he said , pointing towards the planned a340 long-haul aircraft for around 300 passengers .

from hate and evil a community of reconciliation can grow , which makes peace possible . " german president horst köhler acknowledged in his speech that many critics had suggested before the project began that the money would have been better spent on rebuilding the broken-down former east germany .
" did eastern germany not need roads , roofs and factories more than an expensive church ?
but a group of residents said dresden needed more .
and now we can see that those people were right , " köhler said .
the baroque church stood for decades as a decapitated , empty shell .
but that changed in 1990 when a group of people began gathering funds to rebuild it .
now , after a decade of reconstruction , the frauenkirche stands once again in its full splendor , with sunday 's consecration ceremony officially reopening the church to the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche in ruins in 1945 people from around the world are visiting dresden for the festivities . outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder and his designated successor , angela merkel are there . britain , which led the bombing raids , has contributed more than one million euros in donations towards the reconstruction and the duke of kent , who is patron of the fundraising dresden trust , is attending sunday 's ceremony to represent the british royal family . the tens of thousands of spectators at sunday 's consecration can marvel at a golden cross and orb donated by the english city of coventry , which itself was flattened by german bombing during world war ii . the " sto n e bell " retur n s dresdeners themselves are particularly elated that their frauenkirche is finally opening its doors for protestant services following its restoration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church was rebuilt according to original plans until 1945 , the " stone bell " atop the frauenkirche lent the dresden skyline its distinctive silhouette .
ilse walter remembers when the church was bombed by british and american forces during world war ii . " spring was almost in the air on feb .
13 , 1945 , " she said .
" i remember it vividly .
i was sitting in the living room with my family listening to the radio .
they were playing relatively happy , light music when suddenly , right in the middle of the song , we heard the air raid sirens . " what ki n d of memorial ? what followed was one of the most destructive of all allied attacks , with tens of thousands losing their lives .
the city , dubbed " florence on the elbe " for its baroque splendor , was practically wiped out .
from a military perspective , no one even knows why the city was targeted .
the end of the war was already in sight , dresden had no garrisons , and its industry was outside city borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche -lrb- left -rrb- is now part of dresden 's skyline again but destroyed it was and with it , dresden 's frauenkirche .
as the city was being rebuilt in the following decades , the church remained in shambles - a skeletal reference to an ugly past . many dresden citizens felt it should stay that way - a necessary reminder of war 's destruction .
but for others , the dilapidated frauenkirche was an eyesore .
it was time to move on , they believed .
not forget , but progress . a merger of past a n d prese n t in the end , those in favor of rebuilding the frauenkirche won .
yet the restored church 's architectural design reflects only part of the baroque style from the 1700s , when the original frauenkirche was built . " we had to delve into the baroque and middle ages and study how the stones were laid back then , " said eberhard burger , the reconstruction director .
" we have done that the same way now , but we 've used better materials .
so the reconstructed building is based on a mix of old and new techniques . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church 's new golden cross about a third of the new frauenkirche building is made from the old , dark-colored stones that were left in the ruins .
the rest are new , light colored sandstones .
together they create a kind of mosaic of past and present .
the golden cross atop the church 's dome was even created by the son of an english pilot who dropped bombs on dresden in 1945 .
and of course , there is a new organ . a global project the total cost of the project came to 180 million euros -lrb- $ 218 million -rrb- . german historian arnulf baring , who as a boy witnessed the bombing in dresden , said he believes the project was worth the enormous cost and said it showed that germans could find elements of their past of which they can be proud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recreated frescoes inside the church " the frauenkirche was more than a church , it was a symbol of the downfall of a city , " baring told der spiegel magazine .
" i think it is a good thing that germans , wherever possible , regain part of their old cities , so they know that we come from somewhere . " and ludwig güttler , the chairman of the society to promote the reconstruction of the frauenkirche , said many nations had played a part in helping to restore the church to its former glory . " i am enormously grateful , " he told afp news service .

from hate and evil a community of reconciliation can grow , which makes peace possible . " german president horst köhler acknowledged in his speech that many critics had suggested before the project began that the money would have been better spent on rebuilding the broken-down former east germany .
" did eastern germany not need roads , roofs and factories more than an expensive church ?
but a group of residents said dresden needed more .
and now we can see that those people were right , " köhler said .
the baroque church stood for decades as a decapitated , empty shell .
but that changed in 1990 when a group of people began gathering funds to rebuild it .
now , after a decade of reconstruction , the frauenkirche stands once again in its full splendor , with sunday 's consecration ceremony officially reopening the church to the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche in ruins in 1945 people from around the world are visiting dresden for the festivities . outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder and his designated successor , angela merkel are there . britain , which led the bombing raids , has contributed more than one million euros in donations towards the reconstruction and the duke of kent , who is patron of the fundraising dresden trust , is attending sunday 's ceremony to represent the british royal family . the tens of thousands of spectators at sunday 's consecration can marvel at a golden cross and orb donated by the english city of coventry , which itself was flattened by german bombing during world war ii . the " sto n e bell " retur n s dresdeners themselves are particularly elated that their frauenkirche is finally opening its doors for protestant services following its restoration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church was rebuilt according to original plans until 1945 , the " stone bell " atop the frauenkirche lent the dresden skyline its distinctive silhouette .
ilse walter remembers when the church was bombed by british and american forces during world war ii . " spring was almost in the air on feb .
13 , 1945 , " she said .
" i remember it vividly .
i was sitting in the living room with my family listening to the radio .
they were playing relatively happy , light music when suddenly , right in the middle of the song , we heard the air raid sirens . " what ki n d of memorial ? what followed was one of the most destructive of all allied attacks , with tens of thousands losing their lives .
the city , dubbed " florence on the elbe " for its baroque splendor , was practically wiped out .
from a military perspective , no one even knows why the city was targeted .
the end of the war was already in sight , dresden had no garrisons , and its industry was outside city borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche -lrb- left -rrb- is now part of dresden 's skyline again but destroyed it was and with it , dresden 's frauenkirche .
as the city was being rebuilt in the following decades , the church remained in shambles - a skeletal reference to an ugly past . many dresden citizens felt it should stay that way - a necessary reminder of war 's destruction .
but for others , the dilapidated frauenkirche was an eyesore .
it was time to move on , they believed .
not forget , but progress . a merger of past a n d prese n t in the end , those in favor of rebuilding the frauenkirche won .
yet the restored church 's architectural design reflects only part of the baroque style from the 1700s , when the original frauenkirche was built . " we had to delve into the baroque and middle ages and study how the stones were laid back then , " said eberhard burger , the reconstruction director .
" we have done that the same way now , but we 've used better materials .
so the reconstructed building is based on a mix of old and new techniques . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church 's new golden cross about a third of the new frauenkirche building is made from the old , dark-colored stones that were left in the ruins .
the rest are new , light colored sandstones .
together they create a kind of mosaic of past and present .
the golden cross atop the church 's dome was even created by the son of an english pilot who dropped bombs on dresden in 1945 .
and of course , there is a new organ . a global project the total cost of the project came to 180 million euros -lrb- $ 218 million -rrb- . german historian arnulf baring , who as a boy witnessed the bombing in dresden , said he believes the project was worth the enormous cost and said it showed that germans could find elements of their past of which they can be proud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recreated frescoes inside the church " the frauenkirche was more than a church , it was a symbol of the downfall of a city , " baring told der spiegel magazine .
" i think it is a good thing that germans , wherever possible , regain part of their old cities , so they know that we come from somewhere .

bremen and hamburg also win as the top trio in the league is beginning to pull away . a five-game winning streak has done much to dampen the spirits of cologne 's fans but it did n't stop 50,000 of them from streaming to the rhein energie stadium to see their side face bayern munich .
the crowd fired their club on to a strong first-half performance that was highlighted by matthias scherz ' third season goal and a 1-0 lead .
but they filed out of the grounds disappointed as bayern defender lucio and midfielder michael ballack scored second-half goals to give munich the victory . the loss heightens the crisis in cologne as coach uwe rapolder has to wonder what can be done to gather the club 's first victory since a 2-1 defeat of mönchengladbach on september 17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich coach felix magath waves his arms in disbelief but his side would win 2-1 in cologne it was not to be against a less than satisfactory performance from bayern in the eyes their coach felix magath .
that 's why it 's good to have international performers like lucio and ballack who can turn around even a bleak game . " we can be happy about a lucky victory , " commented magath dryly . it came about with some help from the referee whose decisions affected the game 's outcome .
ballack 's gamewinning head ball goal came in the 74th minute off a corner kick wrongly awarded to the league-leaders .
then in the waning moments , cologne were denied a penalty kick as lucio apparently used his hands to deflect the ball in the penalty box .
as magath said , it was a lucky victory . bremen overcome weak start to win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen 's miroslav klose clinches his fists in joy over his 11th strike of the season werder bremen remain two points behind munich in the standings after a clear 4-1 win over guests frankfurt .
the central germans came into bremen with a convincing 6-3 thrashing of cologne under their belts .
the excellent effort continued and coach friedhelm funkel 's team proved they could play with the best of them when ioannis amanatidis put them up 1-0 in the 19th minute . after that though , thomas schaaf 's bremen took control of the game .
international midfielder torsten frings knotted up the game with a head ball in the 29th minute and the score was 1-1 at half .
tim borowski scored twice and miroslav klose also found the net for his league-leading 11th goal although it was preceded by a hand ball . " after the go-ahead goal in the second half we could n't keep up with bremen .
it was a deserved victory for werder , " admitted funkel . third-place hamburg also kept pace with the best , and in the process handed schalke their first loss of the season .
defender mehdi mahdavikia scored the lone goal in the 19th minute in a roughly-played match in which referee fandel handed out five yellow cards and sent off schalke stopper christian poulsen for two bookings .
the " royal blues " now are a massive ten points behind bayern as this campaign is taking on the appearance of a three-horse race . gladbach series halted the biggest surprise in this young season has been borussia mönchengladbach .
they lost to their namesakes from dortmund 2-1 .
gladbach were never really in this match as the homeside borussia dortmund dictated play most of the game .
nevertheless , gladbach remain in fifth-place , even on points with schalke and berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a common sight : stuttgart 's goalkeeper dirk heinen watches the ball rolling over the goalline hertha berlin benefited from the schalke and gladbach losses in the most entertaining match on saturday , drawing 3-3 with stuttgart .
the guests from berlin led 1-0 after one half and then the fireworks began as the lead changed hand two times .
colorful berlin midfielder marchelinho has found his form again , having scored once and assisting on the other two goals .
stuttgart coach giovanni trapattoni 's side never surrendered though .
mario gomez got the equalizer with seven minutes remaining to save the italian coach who has had to listen to loads of rumors about his release this past week for the next match against nuremberg . henke also given a reprieve just like in stuttgart , kaiserslautern 's coach michael henke has been suffering under his squad 's sub-par performance .
he made the right decision as his team was behind 2-1 in the 87th minute by bringing on rarely-used turkish striker berkant götkan .
the 25-year old scored just three minutes later for a 2-2 final . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there , there , everything 's just fine , " would seem to be lautern coach michael henke 's -lrb- l -rrb- reaction " i 'm very disappointed , " said leverkusen coach michael skibbe who has yet to win in three matches with the club .
" that so many of our players were pushing up front -lrb- at the end -rrb- was completely unnecessary . " wolfsburg had gone through a tough three weeks .
coach holger fach 's side had come away with four hard-earned points against bayern munich , hamburg and schalke .
the game against duisburg was a well-deserved break but they underestimated the " zebras " who scored their second victory of the season , and even escaped the relegation zone with a 2-0 win that was hardly threatened by the toothless wolves . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wanted : a better team for altintop kaiserslautern 's halil altintop together with bremen 's miroslav klose , tops the bundesliga in goalscoring .

from hate and evil a community of reconciliation can grow , which makes peace possible . " german president horst köhler acknowledged in his speech that many critics had suggested before the project began that the money would have been better spent on rebuilding the broken-down former east germany .
" did eastern germany not need roads , roofs and factories more than an expensive church ?
but a group of residents said dresden needed more .
and now we can see that those people were right , " köhler said .
the baroque church stood for decades as a decapitated , empty shell .
but that changed in 1990 when a group of people began gathering funds to rebuild it .
now , after a decade of reconstruction , the frauenkirche stands once again in its full splendor , with sunday 's consecration ceremony officially reopening the church to the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche in ruins in 1945 people from around the world are visiting dresden for the festivities . outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder and his designated successor , angela merkel are there . britain , which led the bombing raids , has contributed more than one million euros in donations towards the reconstruction and the duke of kent , who is patron of the fundraising dresden trust , is attending sunday 's ceremony to represent the british royal family . the tens of thousands of spectators at sunday 's consecration can marvel at a golden cross and orb donated by the english city of coventry , which itself was flattened by german bombing during world war ii . the " sto n e bell " retur n s dresdeners themselves are particularly elated that their frauenkirche is finally opening its doors for protestant services following its restoration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church was rebuilt according to original plans until 1945 , the " stone bell " atop the frauenkirche lent the dresden skyline its distinctive silhouette .
ilse walter remembers when the church was bombed by british and american forces during world war ii . " spring was almost in the air on feb .
13 , 1945 , " she said .
" i remember it vividly .
i was sitting in the living room with my family listening to the radio .
they were playing relatively happy , light music when suddenly , right in the middle of the song , we heard the air raid sirens . " what ki n d of memorial ? what followed was one of the most destructive of all allied attacks , with tens of thousands losing their lives .
the city , dubbed " florence on the elbe " for its baroque splendor , was practically wiped out .
from a military perspective , no one even knows why the city was targeted .
the end of the war was already in sight , dresden had no garrisons , and its industry was outside city borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche -lrb- left -rrb- is now part of dresden 's skyline again but destroyed it was and with it , dresden 's frauenkirche .
as the city was being rebuilt in the following decades , the church remained in shambles - a skeletal reference to an ugly past . many dresden citizens felt it should stay that way - a necessary reminder of war 's destruction .
but for others , the dilapidated frauenkirche was an eyesore .
it was time to move on , they believed .
not forget , but progress . a merger of past a n d prese n t in the end , those in favor of rebuilding the frauenkirche won .
yet the restored church 's architectural design reflects only part of the baroque style from the 1700s , when the original frauenkirche was built . " we had to delve into the baroque and middle ages and study how the stones were laid back then , " said eberhard burger , the reconstruction director .
" we have done that the same way now , but we 've used better materials .
so the reconstructed building is based on a mix of old and new techniques . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church 's new golden cross about a third of the new frauenkirche building is made from the old , dark-colored stones that were left in the ruins .
the rest are new , light colored sandstones .
together they create a kind of mosaic of past and present .
the golden cross atop the church 's dome was even created by the son of an english pilot who dropped bombs on dresden in 1945 .
and of course , there is a new organ . a global project the total cost of the project came to 180 million euros -lrb- $ 218 million -rrb- . german historian arnulf baring , who as a boy witnessed the bombing in dresden , said he believes the project was worth the enormous cost and said it showed that germans could find elements of their past of which they can be proud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recreated frescoes inside the church " the frauenkirche was more than a church , it was a symbol of the downfall of a city , " baring told der spiegel magazine .
" i think it is a good thing that germans , wherever possible , regain part of their old cities , so they know that we come from somewhere . " and ludwig güttler , the chairman of the society to promote the reconstruction of the frauenkirche , said many nations had played a part in helping to restore the church to its former glory . " i am enormously grateful , " he told afp news service .
" not just for the donations , which have just kept coming , but for the level of interest shown by other countries .
so many people can say that this project is theirs - whether they be britons , americans , danes , poles or whatever else .

the company said on friday that it already mentioned the case in one of its previous quarterly reports and that it rejected any further public comments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is one of the prime accused the siemens group is said to have paid about 1.6 million dollars in bribes to saddam in support of deals involving power plant turbines . siemens representatives says the company wouldn ’ t make any comment at this point in time and have called the report " premature and unjustified .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 29.10.2005 top trio pulls away in bundesliga großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a beaten munich keeper oliver kahn -lrb- r -rrb- would celebrate in the end german international midfielder michael ballack 's header saved three points for bayern munich in cologne .
bremen and hamburg also win as the top trio in the league is beginning to pull away . a five-game winning streak has done much to dampen the spirits of cologne 's fans but it did n't stop 50,000 of them from streaming to the rhein energie stadium to see their side face bayern munich .
the crowd fired their club on to a strong first-half performance that was highlighted by matthias scherz ' third season goal and a 1-0 lead .
but they filed out of the grounds disappointed as bayern defender lucio and midfielder michael ballack scored second-half goals to give munich the victory . the loss heightens the crisis in cologne as coach uwe rapolder has to wonder what can be done to gather the club 's first victory since a 2-1 defeat of mönchengladbach on september 17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich coach felix magath waves his arms in disbelief but his side would win 2-1 in cologne it was not to be against a less than satisfactory performance from bayern in the eyes their coach felix magath .
that 's why it 's good to have international performers like lucio and ballack who can turn around even a bleak game . " we can be happy about a lucky victory , " commented magath dryly . it came about with some help from the referee whose decisions affected the game 's outcome .
ballack 's gamewinning head ball goal came in the 74th minute off a corner kick wrongly awarded to the league-leaders .
then in the waning moments , cologne were denied a penalty kick as lucio apparently used his hands to deflect the ball in the penalty box .
as magath said , it was a lucky victory . bremen overcome weak start to win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen 's miroslav klose clinches his fists in joy over his 11th strike of the season werder bremen remain two points behind munich in the standings after a clear 4-1 win over guests frankfurt .
the central germans came into bremen with a convincing 6-3 thrashing of cologne under their belts .
the excellent effort continued and coach friedhelm funkel 's team proved they could play with the best of them when ioannis amanatidis put them up 1-0 in the 19th minute . after that though , thomas schaaf 's bremen took control of the game .
international midfielder torsten frings knotted up the game with a head ball in the 29th minute and the score was 1-1 at half .
tim borowski scored twice and miroslav klose also found the net for his league-leading 11th goal although it was preceded by a hand ball . " after the go-ahead goal in the second half we could n't keep up with bremen .
it was a deserved victory for werder , " admitted funkel . third-place hamburg also kept pace with the best , and in the process handed schalke their first loss of the season .
defender mehdi mahdavikia scored the lone goal in the 19th minute in a roughly-played match in which referee fandel handed out five yellow cards and sent off schalke stopper christian poulsen for two bookings .
the " royal blues " now are a massive ten points behind bayern as this campaign is taking on the appearance of a three-horse race . gladbach series halted the biggest surprise in this young season has been borussia mönchengladbach .
they lost to their namesakes from dortmund 2-1 .
gladbach were never really in this match as the homeside borussia dortmund dictated play most of the game .
nevertheless , gladbach remain in fifth-place , even on points with schalke and berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a common sight : stuttgart 's goalkeeper dirk heinen watches the ball rolling over the goalline hertha berlin benefited from the schalke and gladbach losses in the most entertaining match on saturday , drawing 3-3 with stuttgart .
the guests from berlin led 1-0 after one half and then the fireworks began as the lead changed hand two times .
colorful berlin midfielder marchelinho has found his form again , having scored once and assisting on the other two goals .
stuttgart coach giovanni trapattoni 's side never surrendered though .
mario gomez got the equalizer with seven minutes remaining to save the italian coach who has had to listen to loads of rumors about his release this past week for the next match against nuremberg . henke also given a reprieve just like in stuttgart , kaiserslautern 's coach michael henke has been suffering under his squad 's sub-par performance .
he made the right decision as his team was behind 2-1 in the 87th minute by bringing on rarely-used turkish striker berkant götkan .
the 25-year old scored just three minutes later for a 2-2 final . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there , there , everything 's just fine , " would seem to be lautern coach michael henke 's -lrb- l -rrb- reaction " i 'm very disappointed , " said leverkusen coach michael skibbe who has yet to win in three matches with the club .
" that so many of our players were pushing up front -lrb- at the end -rrb- was completely unnecessary . " wolfsburg had gone through a tough three weeks .
coach holger fach 's side had come away with four hard-earned points against bayern munich , hamburg and schalke .
the game against duisburg was a well-deserved break but they underestimated the " zebras " who scored their second victory of the season , and even escaped the relegation zone with a 2-0 win that was hardly threatened by the toothless wolves . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wanted : a better team for altintop kaiserslautern 's halil altintop together with bremen 's miroslav klose , tops the bundesliga in goalscoring .

the " red devils " are floundering towards the bottom of the league but the german-born turk has big plans . kaiserslautern managed to advance another round this week in the german cup .
they did it with a hard-fought 4-2 away victory on tuesday against third division side erfurt .
yet the win did nothing to relieve the pressure on coach michael henke .
in the bundesliga , lautern are just a point away from the relegation zone .
dissension inside the team and from outside -lrb- the fans -rrb- is reaching a fevered pitch . after the cup match on tuesday , henke railed against the erfurt squad by calling them " scheiss-ossis , " or " crap easterners " for not kicking the ball out of bounds towards the end of the game when a lautern player lay injured on the ground . it was indicative of the heat that henke and the team have been feeling over the past few weeks as they counted one disappointing match after another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesliga goalkeepers have been at the mercy of kaiserslautern 's halil altintop -lrb- l -rrb- this season one lautern player , forward halil altintop , has been spared the misery - at least directly .
while his teammates in back , the defenders , resemble more a sieve than a solid wall by giving up 25 goals so far , altintop has alone tallied 10 strikes , sharing the top slot in the bundesliga with bremen 's miroslav klose . " whoever allows that many goals in ten games should have nothing to do with this league , " was altintop 's reaction after last week 's 4-1 shellacking by mönchengladbach . dangerous strikers desired everywhere the fans are resorting to anything and everything to express their frustration with the club that over the past few years has been making a steady , plunge to the bottom of the standings . the joy of the 1997-98 title with coach otto rehhagel at the helm is long just a dream .
two weeks ago , the hard-core supporters vented their frustration by entering the stadium five minutes after the starting whistle - and were promptly penalized when they entered the fritz walter stadium as dortmund went out on top in the seventh minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twin brother hamit altintop -lrb- r -rrb- has found a spot on the turkish national squad it would be the game , though , that manager 's heads in the league turned to the small city in the far west of germany .
altintop would equal dortmund 's ebi smolarek 's hat trick with one of his own to preserve at least one point for kaiserslautern . all of a sudden , halil altintop was a hot commodity .
one club in particular would be a natural for the 22-year-old turk who was born in gelsenkirchen - schalke .
his twin brother hamit already plays for the " royal blues , " so it would hardly be a surprise if halil returned to his hometown . " since i 've been with lautern , there has always been speculation about schalke , " he told sport-bild magazine .
one thing is certain , altintop , who plays on the turkish national squad and whose contract expires in june 2006 , will leave kaiserslautern at the end of the season .
lautern president rene c. jäggi understands altintop 's desire to depart the crisis-riddled club . " he definitely wants to play in international competition and he could make much more money with any top european club , " jäggi said . aspirations for turkey also while the speculation is still swirling around altintop , he not only is eyeing just whom he might play for in the bundesliga .
he wants to secure himself a spot with the turkish national team that is still fighting to qualify for the world cup in germany and believes that only when he is playing against the top clubs in europe will he have a chance of wearing turkish red on the pitch and not just on the bench . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the life of a striker is not easy as altintop -lrb- l -rrb- finds out against dortmund " a coach simply prefers a player who plays for a top club , " he said in sport-bild after seeing no action in the country 's world cup qualifiers in september despite an impressive start in the bundesliga .
" you have to play against teams like inter milan . " england 's wayne rooney found that out at everton and moved to manchester united .
that wo n't be possible for altintop if he stays at kaiserslautern .
just as the " red devils " announced that it left the red and entered the black by making a small profit in the 2004-05 business year , they will have to find a replacement for the striker who could give the club a going-away president by shooting enough goals to keep lautern in the top division . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chelsea 's robert huth singing the blues robert huth must be asking himself what happened .
once seen as a key element in the reinvigoration of the national team , the fast-moving train has derailed .

the company said on friday that it already mentioned the case in one of its previous quarterly reports and that it rejected any further public comments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is one of the prime accused the siemens group is said to have paid about 1.6 million dollars in bribes to saddam in support of deals involving power plant turbines . siemens representatives says the company wouldn ’ t make any comment at this point in time and have called the report " premature and unjustified . " fresh debate about business ethics but , mark pieth , an investigator on the volcker panel , argued that investigators found clear evidence into the wrongdoings of german companies . " we have documents supporting our allegations , " he said .
" they are available to everyone and clearly document all traces we ’ ve found .
i ’ m convinced our report provides enough evidence for legal proceedings against the firms to start immediately . " paul volcker ’ s findings have unleashed a fresh debate about business ethics in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business corruption in germany has long been a cause of worry for transparency international hans jürgen elzholtz , from the corruption watchdog transparency international , said the two corporations had adopted anti-corruption strategies long ago .
they should now be wondering , he argued , how the system could have been circumvented by individual staff members . he also urged german prosecutors to start a full investigation into the cases of bribery . " german laws against bribery are sufficient and appropriate , " he said .
" they just need to be fully applied .
it is now a question of resources in the justice system and enough public pressure to start a full legal proceedings .
i hope we ’ ll see that happening very soon . " smaller fish should n't go unpunished elzholtz also expressed the hope that prosecutors wouldn ’ t just focus on the two high-profile cases involving daimlerchrysler and siemens . the huge number of smaller companies that had given kickbacks to the saddam regime shouldn ’ t go unpunished , he said . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans accused of bribery in un corruption scandal siemens and daimlerchrysler are among the more than 2,000 companies from 66 countries that paid kickbacks to saddam hussein 's government , according to an independent report on the un 's oil-for-food program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.10.2005 airbus a380 deliveries run into rough weather großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 touched down in frankfurt amid thick fog the airbus a380 made a flawless test landing in germany saturday .
despite its success , the european aircraft maker wo n't be delivering the gigantic planes on time to its buyers .
experts say it wo n't dent airbus ' image . it was an event few aviation fans were willing to miss .
as a prototype of the gigantic a380 , the world 's largest passenger airliner , swooped down from the skies to make a perfect landing at the frankfurt airport on saturday morning amid thick fog , tens of thousands of spectators held their breath in awe . while some clambered on stools they had brought along to get a good look at the 290-ton heavy machine coming to a halt at terminal 2 of the rhein-main airport , others held their cameras and mobile phones above their heads to capture the image . it was the first test landing of the long-haul aircraft outside the testing facilities in france and the main aim is to check the handling and maintenance of the a380 at a civil airport .
the aircraft will fly back to toulouse in france on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 is the world 's largest passenger plane it 's exactly a year since the a380 , designed to carry up to 853 passengers , took to the skies for the first time .
since its maiden flight on april 27 , the aircraft has undergone 110 test flights , clocking 380 flying hours , said tore prang , a spokesman of airbus . " the test results are excellent .
the performance is much better than expected , " he said , adding that it also held true for the craft 's fuel-consumption - at 2.9 liters of kerosene for 100 kilometers per passenger . the low consumption - 12 percent lower than all other large aircraft according to airbus - is an important selling point given that fuel usage now accounts for around 16 to 20 percent of the overall costs of an airline . delivery marred by delays until now , 16 customers have placed orders for 159 a380s which cost 292 million euros -lrb- $ 353 million -rrb- apiece .
the gulf-based airline emirates is the biggest buyer with 41 orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 final assembly line near toulouse but , what 's annoyed many is the fact that the european aircraft manufacturer has delayed the delivery of the airplanes .
thus , singapore airlines , which wanted to get the first of its 10 ordered airplanes by march , now has to wait longer . " the a380 will fly for 30 years - it 's not just a big deal if the planes begin flying in the first or the second half of the year , " said prang .
the amount of compensation that airbus has to shell out for its waiting customers , remains under wraps . the delivery is now scheduled to begin in december 2006 provided there are no further hiccups . one of the biggest hurdles is reportedly evacuating passengers from the plane .
according to international regulations , in the case of an emergency , 873 passengers must be able to leave the aircraft in the dark within 90 seconds by using slides . airbus however insists there are no more hitches on that front . " i 'm confident that there wo n't be any problems there , " said tore prang .
but , airbus has delayed tests for far and an evacuation check is now slated for feb 2006 . " encouraging start " however , some say that teething problems are normal when it comes to mammoth projects . it 's not unusual that there are delays , according to ulrich horstmann , aviation analyst at the bayerische landesbank .
horstmann predicted that the a380 would have a shining future .
he added that the 159 orders were an encouraging start given that many airlines only develop new jets after they prove their value on the market . " airbus can rake in returns due to its monopoly because there are n't any other aircraft in that class and boeing ca n't give a befitting reply , " said horstmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german lufthansa boeing 747 takes off at the frankfurt airport the american rival is developing a larger version of the 1969-created jumbo jet in the form of its 747 advanced , which with 450 seats can carry 50 more passengers . " but the 747 is perceived as an old aircraft , " according to horstmann . the americans however have a different strategy .
instead of concentrating on a new giant aircraft , boeing is expending its energies on developing the 787 , a long-haul aircraft with 250 seats .
in future , flexible direct flights will play a greater role than has been the case until now , is the american thinking .
at the same time , the market for large aircraft is too small to make a new development - which cost 13 billion euros in the case of the a380 - profitable . airbus catches up however airbus spokesman prang does n't buy the argument . " all airports which have growth problems have welcomed the arrival of the a380 , " prang said .
london 's heathrow airport for instance could then reach 10 million extra passengers by 2016 thanks to the a380 without having to organize more take-offs and landings , he pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus believes air passenger numbers worldwide will treble and , in the coming years , the worldwide air passenger figures would rise threefold , having an effect on all class segments , prang added . " boeing only has one strategy , we have both , " he said , pointing towards the planned a340 long-haul aircraft for around 300 passengers .
airbus is currently developing the a350 , an aircraft in the same class as boeing 's 787 .
it 's expected to hit the market by 2010 . " airbus has got lots of things right , " said aviation expert horstmann .
" just 10 years ago , it was the small player , which boeing did n't take seriously enough .
but , in the meantime it has convincing offers in all segments of civil aviation . " when it came to aircrafts with a seating capacity of more than 100 , boeing and aircraft manufacturer mcdonnell-douglas which boeing took over had a market share of 70 percent until the mid-1990s .
but now with over 50 percent of the market share , airbus is leading the way . horstmann does n't believe that the balance will tip sharply . " a two-way share of the pie is closer to a monopoly than one thinks , " he said . " they -lrb- airbus and boeing -rrb- may lower prices in individual instances , but they wo n't be in a cut-throat competition .

from hate and evil a community of reconciliation can grow , which makes peace possible . " german president horst köhler acknowledged in his speech that many critics had suggested before the project began that the money would have been better spent on rebuilding the broken-down former east germany .
" did eastern germany not need roads , roofs and factories more than an expensive church ?
but a group of residents said dresden needed more .
and now we can see that those people were right , " köhler said .
the baroque church stood for decades as a decapitated , empty shell .
but that changed in 1990 when a group of people began gathering funds to rebuild it .
now , after a decade of reconstruction , the frauenkirche stands once again in its full splendor , with sunday 's consecration ceremony officially reopening the church to the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche in ruins in 1945 people from around the world are visiting dresden for the festivities . outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder and his designated successor , angela merkel are there . britain , which led the bombing raids , has contributed more than one million euros in donations towards the reconstruction and the duke of kent , who is patron of the fundraising dresden trust , is attending sunday 's ceremony to represent the british royal family . the tens of thousands of spectators at sunday 's consecration can marvel at a golden cross and orb donated by the english city of coventry , which itself was flattened by german bombing during world war ii . the " sto n e bell " retur n s dresdeners themselves are particularly elated that their frauenkirche is finally opening its doors for protestant services following its restoration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church was rebuilt according to original plans until 1945 , the " stone bell " atop the frauenkirche lent the dresden skyline its distinctive silhouette .
ilse walter remembers when the church was bombed by british and american forces during world war ii . " spring was almost in the air on feb .
13 , 1945 , " she said .
" i remember it vividly .
i was sitting in the living room with my family listening to the radio .
they were playing relatively happy , light music when suddenly , right in the middle of the song , we heard the air raid sirens . " what ki n d of memorial ? what followed was one of the most destructive of all allied attacks , with tens of thousands losing their lives .
the city , dubbed " florence on the elbe " for its baroque splendor , was practically wiped out .
from a military perspective , no one even knows why the city was targeted .
the end of the war was already in sight , dresden had no garrisons , and its industry was outside city borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche -lrb- left -rrb- is now part of dresden 's skyline again but destroyed it was and with it , dresden 's frauenkirche .
as the city was being rebuilt in the following decades , the church remained in shambles - a skeletal reference to an ugly past . many dresden citizens felt it should stay that way - a necessary reminder of war 's destruction .
but for others , the dilapidated frauenkirche was an eyesore .
it was time to move on , they believed .
not forget , but progress . a merger of past a n d prese n t in the end , those in favor of rebuilding the frauenkirche won .
yet the restored church 's architectural design reflects only part of the baroque style from the 1700s , when the original frauenkirche was built . " we had to delve into the baroque and middle ages and study how the stones were laid back then , " said eberhard burger , the reconstruction director .
" we have done that the same way now , but we 've used better materials .
so the reconstructed building is based on a mix of old and new techniques . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church 's new golden cross about a third of the new frauenkirche building is made from the old , dark-colored stones that were left in the ruins .
the rest are new , light colored sandstones .
together they create a kind of mosaic of past and present .
the golden cross atop the church 's dome was even created by the son of an english pilot who dropped bombs on dresden in 1945 .
and of course , there is a new organ . a global project the total cost of the project came to 180 million euros -lrb- $ 218 million -rrb- . german historian arnulf baring , who as a boy witnessed the bombing in dresden , said he believes the project was worth the enormous cost and said it showed that germans could find elements of their past of which they can be proud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recreated frescoes inside the church " the frauenkirche was more than a church , it was a symbol of the downfall of a city , " baring told der spiegel magazine .
" i think it is a good thing that germans , wherever possible , regain part of their old cities , so they know that we come from somewhere . " and ludwig güttler , the chairman of the society to promote the reconstruction of the frauenkirche , said many nations had played a part in helping to restore the church to its former glory . " i am enormously grateful , " he told afp news service .
" not just for the donations , which have just kept coming , but for the level of interest shown by other countries .
so many people can say that this project is theirs - whether they be britons , americans , danes , poles or whatever else .

together with the german soccer federation , a new initiative has been kicked off to get the ball rolling . " we have five million jobless people in germany - the dfb -lrb- german soccer federation -rrb- must n't close its eyes to such a development , " said dfb managing director theo zwanziger when he , along with federal labor agency -lrb- ba -rrb- board member heinrich alt , kicked off a job initiative that is supposed to help up to 100,000 unemployed find work through next year 's world cup . it 's a mantra that has been reiterated time and again before any large sporting or cultural spectacle .
when a country or city competes for large international events such as the olympics , the soccer world cup , or the world 's fair , not only is the sole attraction of the happening a selling point .
frequently , politicians and big business promise huge bonuses for the location : tourists with money to spend , improved infrastructure - and jobs . next year 's world cup in germany is no different .
matches will be played in 12 cities and the grounds where they will take place must be top notch .
new stadiums have been built , older ones renovated .
the construction industry has capitalized and will continue to do so .
next june and july , some one million spectators must be fed and housed bringing big benefits to the hotel and gastronomy industry . hotline for potential employers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo zwanziger -lrb- l -rrb- of the dfb and heirnich alt from the employment agency talk jobs and world cup in the face of germany 's gloomy economic perspective , particularly on the job market , the labor agency and business groups do n't want the world 's largest sporting event to be just a one-time thing .
so , under the title " an employment affair - the fastest way to the right employer , " the project aims for between 50,000 to 100,000 jobs to be created .
the labor agency has established a telephone hotline in frankfurt to take calls from employers who are looking for workers in the run-up to the tournament .
within 48 hours of an employer 's call to the ba , the agency is supposed to provide a list of possible job candidates . companies from world cup cities are already taking advantage of the hotline .
an event organizer in leipzig needs 400 workers .
in hamburg , a temporary job agency has announced positions for 20 cooks .
a security service in kaiserslautern is looking for 500 guards . long-term perspectives for a few what i hear from the chambers of industry and commerce in frankfurt , they predict 1,000 jobs with long-term perspectives , " said alt .
" if i take that and multiply if by 12 for each world cup city , that 's 12,000 new jobs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction of stadiums , here the allianz arena , has provided work for thousands in germany for those 12,000 , that 's a piece of good news .
and it wo n't only be lower paying jobs such as kitchen help , janitorial duties or security services .
also experts for it services or even translators will be sought after .
and if the work should not result in a full-time position , nearly everyone has been quick to mention the positive aspects of the short-term engagement . " even if many receive just temporary contracts , many will get their foot in the door of a company through the world cup , " said katja hartmann , a spokeswoman for manpower , one of the world 's largest private employment agencies . dfb president zwanziger said that the sport of soccer and its players must not close their eyes to the plight of those going through difficult times caused by unemployment .
because of the world cup , many will find work , if for just the short or middle term , but even that would be a success and give " a number of people a little more reason to hope .

from hate and evil a community of reconciliation can grow , which makes peace possible . " german president horst köhler acknowledged in his speech that many critics had suggested before the project began that the money would have been better spent on rebuilding the broken-down former east germany .
" did eastern germany not need roads , roofs and factories more than an expensive church ?
but a group of residents said dresden needed more .
and now we can see that those people were right , " köhler said .
the baroque church stood for decades as a decapitated , empty shell .
but that changed in 1990 when a group of people began gathering funds to rebuild it .
now , after a decade of reconstruction , the frauenkirche stands once again in its full splendor , with sunday 's consecration ceremony officially reopening the church to the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche in ruins in 1945 people from around the world are visiting dresden for the festivities . outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder and his designated successor , angela merkel are there . britain , which led the bombing raids , has contributed more than one million euros in donations towards the reconstruction and the duke of kent , who is patron of the fundraising dresden trust , is attending sunday 's ceremony to represent the british royal family . the tens of thousands of spectators at sunday 's consecration can marvel at a golden cross and orb donated by the english city of coventry , which itself was flattened by german bombing during world war ii . the " sto n e bell " retur n s dresdeners themselves are particularly elated that their frauenkirche is finally opening its doors for protestant services following its restoration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church was rebuilt according to original plans until 1945 , the " stone bell " atop the frauenkirche lent the dresden skyline its distinctive silhouette .
ilse walter remembers when the church was bombed by british and american forces during world war ii . " spring was almost in the air on feb .
13 , 1945 , " she said .
" i remember it vividly .
i was sitting in the living room with my family listening to the radio .
they were playing relatively happy , light music when suddenly , right in the middle of the song , we heard the air raid sirens . " what ki n d of memorial ? what followed was one of the most destructive of all allied attacks , with tens of thousands losing their lives .
the city , dubbed " florence on the elbe " for its baroque splendor , was practically wiped out .
from a military perspective , no one even knows why the city was targeted .
the end of the war was already in sight , dresden had no garrisons , and its industry was outside city borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche -lrb- left -rrb- is now part of dresden 's skyline again but destroyed it was and with it , dresden 's frauenkirche .
as the city was being rebuilt in the following decades , the church remained in shambles - a skeletal reference to an ugly past . many dresden citizens felt it should stay that way - a necessary reminder of war 's destruction .
but for others , the dilapidated frauenkirche was an eyesore .
it was time to move on , they believed .
not forget , but progress . a merger of past a n d prese n t in the end , those in favor of rebuilding the frauenkirche won .
yet the restored church 's architectural design reflects only part of the baroque style from the 1700s , when the original frauenkirche was built . " we had to delve into the baroque and middle ages and study how the stones were laid back then , " said eberhard burger , the reconstruction director .
" we have done that the same way now , but we 've used better materials .
so the reconstructed building is based on a mix of old and new techniques . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church 's new golden cross about a third of the new frauenkirche building is made from the old , dark-colored stones that were left in the ruins .
the rest are new , light colored sandstones .
together they create a kind of mosaic of past and present .
the golden cross atop the church 's dome was even created by the son of an english pilot who dropped bombs on dresden in 1945 .
and of course , there is a new organ . a global project the total cost of the project came to 180 million euros -lrb- $ 218 million -rrb- . german historian arnulf baring , who as a boy witnessed the bombing in dresden , said he believes the project was worth the enormous cost and said it showed that germans could find elements of their past of which they can be proud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recreated frescoes inside the church " the frauenkirche was more than a church , it was a symbol of the downfall of a city , " baring told der spiegel magazine .
" i think it is a good thing that germans , wherever possible , regain part of their old cities , so they know that we come from somewhere . " and ludwig güttler , the chairman of the society to promote the reconstruction of the frauenkirche , said many nations had played a part in helping to restore the church to its former glory . " i am enormously grateful , " he told afp news service .

they were playing relatively happy , light music when suddenly , right in the middle of the song , we heard the air raid sirens . " what ki n d of memorial ? what followed was one of the most destructive of all allied attacks , with tens of thousands losing their lives .
the city , dubbed " florence on the elbe " for its baroque splendor , was practically wiped out .
from a military perspective , no one even knows why the city was targeted .
the end of the war was already in sight , dresden had no garrisons , and its industry was outside city borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche -lrb- left -rrb- is now part of dresden 's skyline again but destroyed it was and with it , dresden 's frauenkirche .
as the city was being rebuilt in the following decades , the church remained in shambles - a skeletal reference to an ugly past . many dresden citizens felt it should stay that way - a necessary reminder of war 's destruction .
but for others , the dilapidated frauenkirche was an eyesore .
it was time to move on , they believed .
not forget , but progress . a merger of past a n d prese n t in the end , those in favor of rebuilding the frauenkirche won .
yet the restored church 's architectural design reflects only part of the baroque style from the 1700s , when the original frauenkirche was built . " we had to delve into the baroque and middle ages and study how the stones were laid back then , " said eberhard burger , the reconstruction director .

the golden cross atop the church 's dome was even created by the son of an english pilot who dropped bombs on dresden in 1945 .

some 200 university students from more than 20 universities in 12 countries participated in the project under the esa 's initiative . the satellite is about the size of a standard washing machine and weighs about 62 kilograms . from the drawing board to the launch pad , the project took just 18 months with students relying on the internet as their principal means of exchanging data .
the esa provided the entire funding . " they -lrb- the satellites -rrb- are all in what we called a polar orbit , little below some 700 kilometers above our head so to speak and they have a number of technology experiments on board , " said heidi graff , a spokeswoman for esa .
" they are also testing a special new kind of solar cell , which is better in quality than the standard used to be , they will have a camera on board to try to take observation pictures and they have certain equipment on board with which they will communicate with radio amateurs all over the world , " graff added . hands-on training but even more than the technology , the uniqueness of the project lies in the fact that the entire undertaking was completed by the students themselves . the sseti , which provided the framework for the mission , was launched by esa ’ s education department in 2000 to get european students involved in real space missions , and well as give them practical hands-on experience and encourage them to take up careers in space technology and science . " it 's all done and built by the students themselves .
we more or less only financed the technical check out to make it qualify to go for launch .
it is the students who really have to get the credit , " said graff . one of the students , jürgen schlutz from the university of stuttgart who is one of 15 students studying aerospace engineering in the project propulsion team , said the hands-on training had been valuable . " we are all students of engineering but it 's a pretty much a theoretical approach , we did n't do much in the way of hardware -lrb- until now -rrb- , " schlutz said . " what we learned in the project was actually to build - what comes extra is all the involvement in the project itself , in project management , the work with student teams all over europe , the technical aspect and intercultural co-operation was something that was very valuable for team members , " he added . mark caldwell -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european aerospace aims for the moon leading german aerospace companies have urged the creation of an unmanned european space station on the moon , warning that europe could otherwise lose out to other nations in the race for space exploration and research .

from hate and evil a community of reconciliation can grow , which makes peace possible . " german president horst köhler acknowledged in his speech that many critics had suggested before the project began that the money would have been better spent on rebuilding the broken-down former east germany .
" did eastern germany not need roads , roofs and factories more than an expensive church ?
but a group of residents said dresden needed more .
and now we can see that those people were right , " köhler said .
the baroque church stood for decades as a decapitated , empty shell .
but that changed in 1990 when a group of people began gathering funds to rebuild it .
now , after a decade of reconstruction , the frauenkirche stands once again in its full splendor , with sunday 's consecration ceremony officially reopening the church to the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche in ruins in 1945 people from around the world are visiting dresden for the festivities . outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder and his designated successor , angela merkel are there . britain , which led the bombing raids , has contributed more than one million euros in donations towards the reconstruction and the duke of kent , who is patron of the fundraising dresden trust , is attending sunday 's ceremony to represent the british royal family . the tens of thousands of spectators at sunday 's consecration can marvel at a golden cross and orb donated by the english city of coventry , which itself was flattened by german bombing during world war ii . the " sto n e bell " retur n s dresdeners themselves are particularly elated that their frauenkirche is finally opening its doors for protestant services following its restoration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church was rebuilt according to original plans until 1945 , the " stone bell " atop the frauenkirche lent the dresden skyline its distinctive silhouette .

despite its success , the european aircraft maker wo n't be delivering the gigantic planes on time to its buyers .
experts say it wo n't dent airbus ' image . it was an event few aviation fans were willing to miss .
as a prototype of the gigantic a380 , the world 's largest passenger airliner , swooped down from the skies to make a perfect landing at the frankfurt airport on saturday morning amid thick fog , tens of thousands of spectators held their breath in awe . while some clambered on stools they had brought along to get a good look at the 290-ton heavy machine coming to a halt at terminal 2 of the rhein-main airport , others held their cameras and mobile phones above their heads to capture the image . it was the first test landing of the long-haul aircraft outside the testing facilities in france and the main aim is to check the handling and maintenance of the a380 at a civil airport .
the aircraft will fly back to toulouse in france on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 is the world 's largest passenger plane it 's exactly a year since the a380 , designed to carry up to 853 passengers , took to the skies for the first time .
since its maiden flight on april 27 , the aircraft has undergone 110 test flights , clocking 380 flying hours , said tore prang , a spokesman of airbus . " the test results are excellent .
the performance is much better than expected , " he said , adding that it also held true for the craft 's fuel-consumption - at 2.9 liters of kerosene for 100 kilometers per passenger . the low consumption - 12 percent lower than all other large aircraft according to airbus - is an important selling point given that fuel usage now accounts for around 16 to 20 percent of the overall costs of an airline . delivery marred by delays until now , 16 customers have placed orders for 159 a380s which cost 292 million euros -lrb- $ 353 million -rrb- apiece .
the gulf-based airline emirates is the biggest buyer with 41 orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 final assembly line near toulouse but , what 's annoyed many is the fact that the european aircraft manufacturer has delayed the delivery of the airplanes .
thus , singapore airlines , which wanted to get the first of its 10 ordered airplanes by march , now has to wait longer . " the a380 will fly for 30 years - it 's not just a big deal if the planes begin flying in the first or the second half of the year , " said prang .
the amount of compensation that airbus has to shell out for its waiting customers , remains under wraps . the delivery is now scheduled to begin in december 2006 provided there are no further hiccups . one of the biggest hurdles is reportedly evacuating passengers from the plane .
according to international regulations , in the case of an emergency , 873 passengers must be able to leave the aircraft in the dark within 90 seconds by using slides . airbus however insists there are no more hitches on that front . " i 'm confident that there wo n't be any problems there , " said tore prang .
but , airbus has delayed tests for far and an evacuation check is now slated for feb 2006 . " encouraging start " however , some say that teething problems are normal when it comes to mammoth projects . it 's not unusual that there are delays , according to ulrich horstmann , aviation analyst at the bayerische landesbank .
horstmann predicted that the a380 would have a shining future .
he added that the 159 orders were an encouraging start given that many airlines only develop new jets after they prove their value on the market . " airbus can rake in returns due to its monopoly because there are n't any other aircraft in that class and boeing ca n't give a befitting reply , " said horstmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german lufthansa boeing 747 takes off at the frankfurt airport the american rival is developing a larger version of the 1969-created jumbo jet in the form of its 747 advanced , which with 450 seats can carry 50 more passengers . " but the 747 is perceived as an old aircraft , " according to horstmann . the americans however have a different strategy .
instead of concentrating on a new giant aircraft , boeing is expending its energies on developing the 787 , a long-haul aircraft with 250 seats .
in future , flexible direct flights will play a greater role than has been the case until now , is the american thinking .
at the same time , the market for large aircraft is too small to make a new development - which cost 13 billion euros in the case of the a380 - profitable . airbus catches up however airbus spokesman prang does n't buy the argument . " all airports which have growth problems have welcomed the arrival of the a380 , " prang said .
london 's heathrow airport for instance could then reach 10 million extra passengers by 2016 thanks to the a380 without having to organize more take-offs and landings , he pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus believes air passenger numbers worldwide will treble and , in the coming years , the worldwide air passenger figures would rise threefold , having an effect on all class segments , prang added . " boeing only has one strategy , we have both , " he said , pointing towards the planned a340 long-haul aircraft for around 300 passengers .
airbus is currently developing the a350 , an aircraft in the same class as boeing 's 787 .
it 's expected to hit the market by 2010 . " airbus has got lots of things right , " said aviation expert horstmann .
" just 10 years ago , it was the small player , which boeing did n't take seriously enough .
but , in the meantime it has convincing offers in all segments of civil aviation . " when it came to aircrafts with a seating capacity of more than 100 , boeing and aircraft manufacturer mcdonnell-douglas which boeing took over had a market share of 70 percent until the mid-1990s .
but now with over 50 percent of the market share , airbus is leading the way . horstmann does n't believe that the balance will tip sharply . " a two-way share of the pie is closer to a monopoly than one thinks , " he said . " they -lrb- airbus and boeing -rrb- may lower prices in individual instances , but they wo n't be in a cut-throat competition .

as a prototype of the gigantic a380 , the world 's largest passenger airliner , swooped down from the skies to make a perfect landing at the frankfurt airport on saturday morning amid thick fog , tens of thousands of spectators held their breath in awe . while some clambered on stools they had brought along to get a good look at the 290-ton heavy machine coming to a halt at terminal 2 of the rhein-main airport , others held their cameras and mobile phones above their heads to capture the image . it was the first test landing of the long-haul aircraft outside the testing facilities in france and the main aim is to check the handling and maintenance of the a380 at a civil airport .
the aircraft will fly back to toulouse in france on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 is the world 's largest passenger plane it 's exactly a year since the a380 , designed to carry up to 853 passengers , took to the skies for the first time .
since its maiden flight on april 27 , the aircraft has undergone 110 test flights , clocking 380 flying hours , said tore prang , a spokesman of airbus . " the test results are excellent .
the performance is much better than expected , " he said , adding that it also held true for the craft 's fuel-consumption - at 2.9 liters of kerosene for 100 kilometers per passenger . the low consumption - 12 percent lower than all other large aircraft according to airbus - is an important selling point given that fuel usage now accounts for around 16 to 20 percent of the overall costs of an airline . delivery marred by delays until now , 16 customers have placed orders for 159 a380s which cost 292 million euros -lrb- $ 353 million -rrb- apiece .
the gulf-based airline emirates is the biggest buyer with 41 orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 final assembly line near toulouse but , what 's annoyed many is the fact that the european aircraft manufacturer has delayed the delivery of the airplanes .
thus , singapore airlines , which wanted to get the first of its 10 ordered airplanes by march , now has to wait longer . " the a380 will fly for 30 years - it 's not just a big deal if the planes begin flying in the first or the second half of the year , " said prang .
the amount of compensation that airbus has to shell out for its waiting customers , remains under wraps . the delivery is now scheduled to begin in december 2006 provided there are no further hiccups . one of the biggest hurdles is reportedly evacuating passengers from the plane .
according to international regulations , in the case of an emergency , 873 passengers must be able to leave the aircraft in the dark within 90 seconds by using slides . airbus however insists there are no more hitches on that front . " i 'm confident that there wo n't be any problems there , " said tore prang .
but , airbus has delayed tests for far and an evacuation check is now slated for feb 2006 . " encouraging start " however , some say that teething problems are normal when it comes to mammoth projects . it 's not unusual that there are delays , according to ulrich horstmann , aviation analyst at the bayerische landesbank .
horstmann predicted that the a380 would have a shining future .
he added that the 159 orders were an encouraging start given that many airlines only develop new jets after they prove their value on the market . " airbus can rake in returns due to its monopoly because there are n't any other aircraft in that class and boeing ca n't give a befitting reply , " said horstmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german lufthansa boeing 747 takes off at the frankfurt airport the american rival is developing a larger version of the 1969-created jumbo jet in the form of its 747 advanced , which with 450 seats can carry 50 more passengers . " but the 747 is perceived as an old aircraft , " according to horstmann . the americans however have a different strategy .
instead of concentrating on a new giant aircraft , boeing is expending its energies on developing the 787 , a long-haul aircraft with 250 seats .
in future , flexible direct flights will play a greater role than has been the case until now , is the american thinking .
at the same time , the market for large aircraft is too small to make a new development - which cost 13 billion euros in the case of the a380 - profitable . airbus catches up however airbus spokesman prang does n't buy the argument . " all airports which have growth problems have welcomed the arrival of the a380 , " prang said .
london 's heathrow airport for instance could then reach 10 million extra passengers by 2016 thanks to the a380 without having to organize more take-offs and landings , he pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus believes air passenger numbers worldwide will treble and , in the coming years , the worldwide air passenger figures would rise threefold , having an effect on all class segments , prang added . " boeing only has one strategy , we have both , " he said , pointing towards the planned a340 long-haul aircraft for around 300 passengers .
airbus is currently developing the a350 , an aircraft in the same class as boeing 's 787 .
it 's expected to hit the market by 2010 . " airbus has got lots of things right , " said aviation expert horstmann .
" just 10 years ago , it was the small player , which boeing did n't take seriously enough .
but , in the meantime it has convincing offers in all segments of civil aviation . " when it came to aircrafts with a seating capacity of more than 100 , boeing and aircraft manufacturer mcdonnell-douglas which boeing took over had a market share of 70 percent until the mid-1990s .
but now with over 50 percent of the market share , airbus is leading the way . horstmann does n't believe that the balance will tip sharply . " a two-way share of the pie is closer to a monopoly than one thinks , " he said .

he added that the 159 orders were an encouraging start given that many airlines only develop new jets after they prove their value on the market . " airbus can rake in returns due to its monopoly because there are n't any other aircraft in that class and boeing ca n't give a befitting reply , " said horstmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german lufthansa boeing 747 takes off at the frankfurt airport the american rival is developing a larger version of the 1969-created jumbo jet in the form of its 747 advanced , which with 450 seats can carry 50 more passengers . " but the 747 is perceived as an old aircraft , " according to horstmann . the americans however have a different strategy .
instead of concentrating on a new giant aircraft , boeing is expending its energies on developing the 787 , a long-haul aircraft with 250 seats .
in future , flexible direct flights will play a greater role than has been the case until now , is the american thinking .
at the same time , the market for large aircraft is too small to make a new development - which cost 13 billion euros in the case of the a380 - profitable . airbus catches up however airbus spokesman prang does n't buy the argument . " all airports which have growth problems have welcomed the arrival of the a380 , " prang said .
london 's heathrow airport for instance could then reach 10 million extra passengers by 2016 thanks to the a380 without having to organize more take-offs and landings , he pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus believes air passenger numbers worldwide will treble and , in the coming years , the worldwide air passenger figures would rise threefold , having an effect on all class segments , prang added . " boeing only has one strategy , we have both , " he said , pointing towards the planned a340 long-haul aircraft for around 300 passengers .
airbus is currently developing the a350 , an aircraft in the same class as boeing 's 787 .
it 's expected to hit the market by 2010 . " airbus has got lots of things right , " said aviation expert horstmann .
" just 10 years ago , it was the small player , which boeing did n't take seriously enough .
but , in the meantime it has convincing offers in all segments of civil aviation . " when it came to aircrafts with a seating capacity of more than 100 , boeing and aircraft manufacturer mcdonnell-douglas which boeing took over had a market share of 70 percent until the mid-1990s .
but now with over 50 percent of the market share , airbus is leading the way . horstmann does n't believe that the balance will tip sharply . " a two-way share of the pie is closer to a monopoly than one thinks , " he said . " they -lrb- airbus and boeing -rrb- may lower prices in individual instances , but they wo n't be in a cut-throat competition .

the " red devils " are floundering towards the bottom of the league but the german-born turk has big plans . kaiserslautern managed to advance another round this week in the german cup .
they did it with a hard-fought 4-2 away victory on tuesday against third division side erfurt .
yet the win did nothing to relieve the pressure on coach michael henke .
in the bundesliga , lautern are just a point away from the relegation zone .
dissension inside the team and from outside -lrb- the fans -rrb- is reaching a fevered pitch . after the cup match on tuesday , henke railed against the erfurt squad by calling them " scheiss-ossis , " or " crap easterners " for not kicking the ball out of bounds towards the end of the game when a lautern player lay injured on the ground . it was indicative of the heat that henke and the team have been feeling over the past few weeks as they counted one disappointing match after another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesliga goalkeepers have been at the mercy of kaiserslautern 's halil altintop -lrb- l -rrb- this season one lautern player , forward halil altintop , has been spared the misery - at least directly .
while his teammates in back , the defenders , resemble more a sieve than a solid wall by giving up 25 goals so far , altintop has alone tallied 10 strikes , sharing the top slot in the bundesliga with bremen 's miroslav klose . " whoever allows that many goals in ten games should have nothing to do with this league , " was altintop 's reaction after last week 's 4-1 shellacking by mönchengladbach . dangerous strikers desired everywhere the fans are resorting to anything and everything to express their frustration with the club that over the past few years has been making a steady , plunge to the bottom of the standings . the joy of the 1997-98 title with coach otto rehhagel at the helm is long just a dream .
two weeks ago , the hard-core supporters vented their frustration by entering the stadium five minutes after the starting whistle - and were promptly penalized when they entered the fritz walter stadium as dortmund went out on top in the seventh minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twin brother hamit altintop -lrb- r -rrb- has found a spot on the turkish national squad it would be the game , though , that manager 's heads in the league turned to the small city in the far west of germany .
altintop would equal dortmund 's ebi smolarek 's hat trick with one of his own to preserve at least one point for kaiserslautern . all of a sudden , halil altintop was a hot commodity .
one club in particular would be a natural for the 22-year-old turk who was born in gelsenkirchen - schalke .
his twin brother hamit already plays for the " royal blues , " so it would hardly be a surprise if halil returned to his hometown . " since i 've been with lautern , there has always been speculation about schalke , " he told sport-bild magazine .
one thing is certain , altintop , who plays on the turkish national squad and whose contract expires in june 2006 , will leave kaiserslautern at the end of the season .
lautern president rene c. jäggi understands altintop 's desire to depart the crisis-riddled club . " he definitely wants to play in international competition and he could make much more money with any top european club , " jäggi said . aspirations for turkey also while the speculation is still swirling around altintop , he not only is eyeing just whom he might play for in the bundesliga .
he wants to secure himself a spot with the turkish national team that is still fighting to qualify for the world cup in germany and believes that only when he is playing against the top clubs in europe will he have a chance of wearing turkish red on the pitch and not just on the bench . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the life of a striker is not easy as altintop -lrb- l -rrb- finds out against dortmund " a coach simply prefers a player who plays for a top club , " he said in sport-bild after seeing no action in the country 's world cup qualifiers in september despite an impressive start in the bundesliga .
" you have to play against teams like inter milan . " england 's wayne rooney found that out at everton and moved to manchester united .
that wo n't be possible for altintop if he stays at kaiserslautern .
just as the " red devils " announced that it left the red and entered the black by making a small profit in the 2004-05 business year , they will have to find a replacement for the striker who could give the club a going-away president by shooting enough goals to keep lautern in the top division . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chelsea 's robert huth singing the blues robert huth must be asking himself what happened .

bremen and hamburg also win as the top trio in the league is beginning to pull away . a five-game winning streak has done much to dampen the spirits of cologne 's fans but it did n't stop 50,000 of them from streaming to the rhein energie stadium to see their side face bayern munich .
the crowd fired their club on to a strong first-half performance that was highlighted by matthias scherz ' third season goal and a 1-0 lead .
but they filed out of the grounds disappointed as bayern defender lucio and midfielder michael ballack scored second-half goals to give munich the victory . the loss heightens the crisis in cologne as coach uwe rapolder has to wonder what can be done to gather the club 's first victory since a 2-1 defeat of mönchengladbach on september 17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich coach felix magath waves his arms in disbelief but his side would win 2-1 in cologne it was not to be against a less than satisfactory performance from bayern in the eyes their coach felix magath .
that 's why it 's good to have international performers like lucio and ballack who can turn around even a bleak game . " we can be happy about a lucky victory , " commented magath dryly . it came about with some help from the referee whose decisions affected the game 's outcome .
ballack 's gamewinning head ball goal came in the 74th minute off a corner kick wrongly awarded to the league-leaders .
then in the waning moments , cologne were denied a penalty kick as lucio apparently used his hands to deflect the ball in the penalty box .
as magath said , it was a lucky victory . bremen overcome weak start to win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen 's miroslav klose clinches his fists in joy over his 11th strike of the season werder bremen remain two points behind munich in the standings after a clear 4-1 win over guests frankfurt .

the excellent effort continued and coach friedhelm funkel 's team proved they could play with the best of them when ioannis amanatidis put them up 1-0 in the 19th minute . after that though , thomas schaaf 's bremen took control of the game .
international midfielder torsten frings knotted up the game with a head ball in the 29th minute and the score was 1-1 at half .
tim borowski scored twice and miroslav klose also found the net for his league-leading 11th goal although it was preceded by a hand ball . " after the go-ahead goal in the second half we could n't keep up with bremen .
it was a deserved victory for werder , " admitted funkel . third-place hamburg also kept pace with the best , and in the process handed schalke their first loss of the season .
defender mehdi mahdavikia scored the lone goal in the 19th minute in a roughly-played match in which referee fandel handed out five yellow cards and sent off schalke stopper christian poulsen for two bookings .
the " royal blues " now are a massive ten points behind bayern as this campaign is taking on the appearance of a three-horse race . gladbach series halted the biggest surprise in this young season has been borussia mönchengladbach .
they lost to their namesakes from dortmund 2-1 .

colorful berlin midfielder marchelinho has found his form again , having scored once and assisting on the other two goals .
stuttgart coach giovanni trapattoni 's side never surrendered though .

the " red devils " are floundering towards the bottom of the league but the german-born turk has big plans . kaiserslautern managed to advance another round this week in the german cup .
they did it with a hard-fought 4-2 away victory on tuesday against third division side erfurt .
yet the win did nothing to relieve the pressure on coach michael henke .
in the bundesliga , lautern are just a point away from the relegation zone .
dissension inside the team and from outside -lrb- the fans -rrb- is reaching a fevered pitch . after the cup match on tuesday , henke railed against the erfurt squad by calling them " scheiss-ossis , " or " crap easterners " for not kicking the ball out of bounds towards the end of the game when a lautern player lay injured on the ground . it was indicative of the heat that henke and the team have been feeling over the past few weeks as they counted one disappointing match after another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesliga goalkeepers have been at the mercy of kaiserslautern 's halil altintop -lrb- l -rrb- this season one lautern player , forward halil altintop , has been spared the misery - at least directly .
while his teammates in back , the defenders , resemble more a sieve than a solid wall by giving up 25 goals so far , altintop has alone tallied 10 strikes , sharing the top slot in the bundesliga with bremen 's miroslav klose . " whoever allows that many goals in ten games should have nothing to do with this league , " was altintop 's reaction after last week 's 4-1 shellacking by mönchengladbach . dangerous strikers desired everywhere the fans are resorting to anything and everything to express their frustration with the club that over the past few years has been making a steady , plunge to the bottom of the standings . the joy of the 1997-98 title with coach otto rehhagel at the helm is long just a dream .
two weeks ago , the hard-core supporters vented their frustration by entering the stadium five minutes after the starting whistle - and were promptly penalized when they entered the fritz walter stadium as dortmund went out on top in the seventh minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twin brother hamit altintop -lrb- r -rrb- has found a spot on the turkish national squad it would be the game , though , that manager 's heads in the league turned to the small city in the far west of germany .
altintop would equal dortmund 's ebi smolarek 's hat trick with one of his own to preserve at least one point for kaiserslautern . all of a sudden , halil altintop was a hot commodity .
one club in particular would be a natural for the 22-year-old turk who was born in gelsenkirchen - schalke .
his twin brother hamit already plays for the " royal blues , " so it would hardly be a surprise if halil returned to his hometown . " since i 've been with lautern , there has always been speculation about schalke , " he told sport-bild magazine .
one thing is certain , altintop , who plays on the turkish national squad and whose contract expires in june 2006 , will leave kaiserslautern at the end of the season .
lautern president rene c. jäggi understands altintop 's desire to depart the crisis-riddled club . " he definitely wants to play in international competition and he could make much more money with any top european club , " jäggi said . aspirations for turkey also while the speculation is still swirling around altintop , he not only is eyeing just whom he might play for in the bundesliga .
he wants to secure himself a spot with the turkish national team that is still fighting to qualify for the world cup in germany and believes that only when he is playing against the top clubs in europe will he have a chance of wearing turkish red on the pitch and not just on the bench . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the life of a striker is not easy as altintop -lrb- l -rrb- finds out against dortmund " a coach simply prefers a player who plays for a top club , " he said in sport-bild after seeing no action in the country 's world cup qualifiers in september despite an impressive start in the bundesliga .
" you have to play against teams like inter milan . " england 's wayne rooney found that out at everton and moved to manchester united .
that wo n't be possible for altintop if he stays at kaiserslautern .
just as the " red devils " announced that it left the red and entered the black by making a small profit in the 2004-05 business year , they will have to find a replacement for the striker who could give the club a going-away president by shooting enough goals to keep lautern in the top division . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chelsea 's robert huth singing the blues robert huth must be asking himself what happened .

some 200 university students from more than 20 universities in 12 countries participated in the project under the esa 's initiative . the satellite is about the size of a standard washing machine and weighs about 62 kilograms . from the drawing board to the launch pad , the project took just 18 months with students relying on the internet as their principal means of exchanging data .
the esa provided the entire funding . " they -lrb- the satellites -rrb- are all in what we called a polar orbit , little below some 700 kilometers above our head so to speak and they have a number of technology experiments on board , " said heidi graff , a spokeswoman for esa .
" they are also testing a special new kind of solar cell , which is better in quality than the standard used to be , they will have a camera on board to try to take observation pictures and they have certain equipment on board with which they will communicate with radio amateurs all over the world , " graff added . hands-on training but even more than the technology , the uniqueness of the project lies in the fact that the entire undertaking was completed by the students themselves . the sseti , which provided the framework for the mission , was launched by esa ’ s education department in 2000 to get european students involved in real space missions , and well as give them practical hands-on experience and encourage them to take up careers in space technology and science . " it 's all done and built by the students themselves .
we more or less only financed the technical check out to make it qualify to go for launch .
it is the students who really have to get the credit , " said graff . one of the students , jürgen schlutz from the university of stuttgart who is one of 15 students studying aerospace engineering in the project propulsion team , said the hands-on training had been valuable . " we are all students of engineering but it 's a pretty much a theoretical approach , we did n't do much in the way of hardware -lrb- until now -rrb- , " schlutz said . " what we learned in the project was actually to build - what comes extra is all the involvement in the project itself , in project management , the work with student teams all over europe , the technical aspect and intercultural co-operation was something that was very valuable for team members , " he added . mark caldwell -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european aerospace aims for the moon leading german aerospace companies have urged the creation of an unmanned european space station on the moon , warning that europe could otherwise lose out to other nations in the race for space exploration and research .

the " red devils " are floundering towards the bottom of the league but the german-born turk has big plans . kaiserslautern managed to advance another round this week in the german cup .
they did it with a hard-fought 4-2 away victory on tuesday against third division side erfurt .
yet the win did nothing to relieve the pressure on coach michael henke .
in the bundesliga , lautern are just a point away from the relegation zone .
dissension inside the team and from outside -lrb- the fans -rrb- is reaching a fevered pitch . after the cup match on tuesday , henke railed against the erfurt squad by calling them " scheiss-ossis , " or " crap easterners " for not kicking the ball out of bounds towards the end of the game when a lautern player lay injured on the ground . it was indicative of the heat that henke and the team have been feeling over the past few weeks as they counted one disappointing match after another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesliga goalkeepers have been at the mercy of kaiserslautern 's halil altintop -lrb- l -rrb- this season one lautern player , forward halil altintop , has been spared the misery - at least directly .
while his teammates in back , the defenders , resemble more a sieve than a solid wall by giving up 25 goals so far , altintop has alone tallied 10 strikes , sharing the top slot in the bundesliga with bremen 's miroslav klose . " whoever allows that many goals in ten games should have nothing to do with this league , " was altintop 's reaction after last week 's 4-1 shellacking by mönchengladbach . dangerous strikers desired everywhere the fans are resorting to anything and everything to express their frustration with the club that over the past few years has been making a steady , plunge to the bottom of the standings . the joy of the 1997-98 title with coach otto rehhagel at the helm is long just a dream .
two weeks ago , the hard-core supporters vented their frustration by entering the stadium five minutes after the starting whistle - and were promptly penalized when they entered the fritz walter stadium as dortmund went out on top in the seventh minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twin brother hamit altintop -lrb- r -rrb- has found a spot on the turkish national squad it would be the game , though , that manager 's heads in the league turned to the small city in the far west of germany .
altintop would equal dortmund 's ebi smolarek 's hat trick with one of his own to preserve at least one point for kaiserslautern . all of a sudden , halil altintop was a hot commodity .
one club in particular would be a natural for the 22-year-old turk who was born in gelsenkirchen - schalke .
his twin brother hamit already plays for the " royal blues , " so it would hardly be a surprise if halil returned to his hometown . " since i 've been with lautern , there has always been speculation about schalke , " he told sport-bild magazine .
one thing is certain , altintop , who plays on the turkish national squad and whose contract expires in june 2006 , will leave kaiserslautern at the end of the season .
lautern president rene c. jäggi understands altintop 's desire to depart the crisis-riddled club . " he definitely wants to play in international competition and he could make much more money with any top european club , " jäggi said . aspirations for turkey also while the speculation is still swirling around altintop , he not only is eyeing just whom he might play for in the bundesliga .
he wants to secure himself a spot with the turkish national team that is still fighting to qualify for the world cup in germany and believes that only when he is playing against the top clubs in europe will he have a chance of wearing turkish red on the pitch and not just on the bench . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the life of a striker is not easy as altintop -lrb- l -rrb- finds out against dortmund " a coach simply prefers a player who plays for a top club , " he said in sport-bild after seeing no action in the country 's world cup qualifiers in september despite an impressive start in the bundesliga .
" you have to play against teams like inter milan . " england 's wayne rooney found that out at everton and moved to manchester united .
that wo n't be possible for altintop if he stays at kaiserslautern .
just as the " red devils " announced that it left the red and entered the black by making a small profit in the 2004-05 business year , they will have to find a replacement for the striker who could give the club a going-away president by shooting enough goals to keep lautern in the top division . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chelsea 's robert huth singing the blues robert huth must be asking himself what happened .

together with the german soccer federation , a new initiative has been kicked off to get the ball rolling . " we have five million jobless people in germany - the dfb -lrb- german soccer federation -rrb- must n't close its eyes to such a development , " said dfb managing director theo zwanziger when he , along with federal labor agency -lrb- ba -rrb- board member heinrich alt , kicked off a job initiative that is supposed to help up to 100,000 unemployed find work through next year 's world cup . it 's a mantra that has been reiterated time and again before any large sporting or cultural spectacle .
when a country or city competes for large international events such as the olympics , the soccer world cup , or the world 's fair , not only is the sole attraction of the happening a selling point .
frequently , politicians and big business promise huge bonuses for the location : tourists with money to spend , improved infrastructure - and jobs . next year 's world cup in germany is no different .
matches will be played in 12 cities and the grounds where they will take place must be top notch .
new stadiums have been built , older ones renovated .
the construction industry has capitalized and will continue to do so .
next june and july , some one million spectators must be fed and housed bringing big benefits to the hotel and gastronomy industry . hotline for potential employers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo zwanziger -lrb- l -rrb- of the dfb and heirnich alt from the employment agency talk jobs and world cup in the face of germany 's gloomy economic perspective , particularly on the job market , the labor agency and business groups do n't want the world 's largest sporting event to be just a one-time thing .
so , under the title " an employment affair - the fastest way to the right employer , " the project aims for between 50,000 to 100,000 jobs to be created .
the labor agency has established a telephone hotline in frankfurt to take calls from employers who are looking for workers in the run-up to the tournament .
within 48 hours of an employer 's call to the ba , the agency is supposed to provide a list of possible job candidates . companies from world cup cities are already taking advantage of the hotline .
an event organizer in leipzig needs 400 workers .
in hamburg , a temporary job agency has announced positions for 20 cooks .
a security service in kaiserslautern is looking for 500 guards . long-term perspectives for a few what i hear from the chambers of industry and commerce in frankfurt , they predict 1,000 jobs with long-term perspectives , " said alt .
" if i take that and multiply if by 12 for each world cup city , that 's 12,000 new jobs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction of stadiums , here the allianz arena , has provided work for thousands in germany for those 12,000 , that 's a piece of good news .
and it wo n't only be lower paying jobs such as kitchen help , janitorial duties or security services .
also experts for it services or even translators will be sought after .
and if the work should not result in a full-time position , nearly everyone has been quick to mention the positive aspects of the short-term engagement . " even if many receive just temporary contracts , many will get their foot in the door of a company through the world cup , " said katja hartmann , a spokeswoman for manpower , one of the world 's largest private employment agencies . dfb president zwanziger said that the sport of soccer and its players must not close their eyes to the plight of those going through difficult times caused by unemployment .

bremen and hamburg also win as the top trio in the league is beginning to pull away . a five-game winning streak has done much to dampen the spirits of cologne 's fans but it did n't stop 50,000 of them from streaming to the rhein energie stadium to see their side face bayern munich .
the crowd fired their club on to a strong first-half performance that was highlighted by matthias scherz ' third season goal and a 1-0 lead .
but they filed out of the grounds disappointed as bayern defender lucio and midfielder michael ballack scored second-half goals to give munich the victory . the loss heightens the crisis in cologne as coach uwe rapolder has to wonder what can be done to gather the club 's first victory since a 2-1 defeat of mönchengladbach on september 17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich coach felix magath waves his arms in disbelief but his side would win 2-1 in cologne it was not to be against a less than satisfactory performance from bayern in the eyes their coach felix magath .
that 's why it 's good to have international performers like lucio and ballack who can turn around even a bleak game . " we can be happy about a lucky victory , " commented magath dryly . it came about with some help from the referee whose decisions affected the game 's outcome .
ballack 's gamewinning head ball goal came in the 74th minute off a corner kick wrongly awarded to the league-leaders .
then in the waning moments , cologne were denied a penalty kick as lucio apparently used his hands to deflect the ball in the penalty box .
as magath said , it was a lucky victory . bremen overcome weak start to win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen 's miroslav klose clinches his fists in joy over his 11th strike of the season werder bremen remain two points behind munich in the standings after a clear 4-1 win over guests frankfurt .

the excellent effort continued and coach friedhelm funkel 's team proved they could play with the best of them when ioannis amanatidis put them up 1-0 in the 19th minute . after that though , thomas schaaf 's bremen took control of the game .
international midfielder torsten frings knotted up the game with a head ball in the 29th minute and the score was 1-1 at half .
tim borowski scored twice and miroslav klose also found the net for his league-leading 11th goal although it was preceded by a hand ball . " after the go-ahead goal in the second half we could n't keep up with bremen .
it was a deserved victory for werder , " admitted funkel . third-place hamburg also kept pace with the best , and in the process handed schalke their first loss of the season .
defender mehdi mahdavikia scored the lone goal in the 19th minute in a roughly-played match in which referee fandel handed out five yellow cards and sent off schalke stopper christian poulsen for two bookings .
the " royal blues " now are a massive ten points behind bayern as this campaign is taking on the appearance of a three-horse race . gladbach series halted the biggest surprise in this young season has been borussia mönchengladbach .

some 200 university students from more than 20 universities in 12 countries participated in the project under the esa 's initiative . the satellite is about the size of a standard washing machine and weighs about 62 kilograms . from the drawing board to the launch pad , the project took just 18 months with students relying on the internet as their principal means of exchanging data .
the esa provided the entire funding . " they -lrb- the satellites -rrb- are all in what we called a polar orbit , little below some 700 kilometers above our head so to speak and they have a number of technology experiments on board , " said heidi graff , a spokeswoman for esa .
" they are also testing a special new kind of solar cell , which is better in quality than the standard used to be , they will have a camera on board to try to take observation pictures and they have certain equipment on board with which they will communicate with radio amateurs all over the world , " graff added . hands-on training but even more than the technology , the uniqueness of the project lies in the fact that the entire undertaking was completed by the students themselves . the sseti , which provided the framework for the mission , was launched by esa ’ s education department in 2000 to get european students involved in real space missions , and well as give them practical hands-on experience and encourage them to take up careers in space technology and science . " it 's all done and built by the students themselves .
we more or less only financed the technical check out to make it qualify to go for launch .
it is the students who really have to get the credit , " said graff . one of the students , jürgen schlutz from the university of stuttgart who is one of 15 students studying aerospace engineering in the project propulsion team , said the hands-on training had been valuable . " we are all students of engineering but it 's a pretty much a theoretical approach , we did n't do much in the way of hardware -lrb- until now -rrb- , " schlutz said . " what we learned in the project was actually to build - what comes extra is all the involvement in the project itself , in project management , the work with student teams all over europe , the technical aspect and intercultural co-operation was something that was very valuable for team members , " he added . mark caldwell -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european aerospace aims for the moon leading german aerospace companies have urged the creation of an unmanned european space station on the moon , warning that europe could otherwise lose out to other nations in the race for space exploration and research .

from hate and evil a community of reconciliation can grow , which makes peace possible . " german president horst köhler acknowledged in his speech that many critics had suggested before the project began that the money would have been better spent on rebuilding the broken-down former east germany .
" did eastern germany not need roads , roofs and factories more than an expensive church ?
but a group of residents said dresden needed more .
and now we can see that those people were right , " köhler said .
the baroque church stood for decades as a decapitated , empty shell .
but that changed in 1990 when a group of people began gathering funds to rebuild it .
now , after a decade of reconstruction , the frauenkirche stands once again in its full splendor , with sunday 's consecration ceremony officially reopening the church to the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche in ruins in 1945 people from around the world are visiting dresden for the festivities . outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder and his designated successor , angela merkel are there . britain , which led the bombing raids , has contributed more than one million euros in donations towards the reconstruction and the duke of kent , who is patron of the fundraising dresden trust , is attending sunday 's ceremony to represent the british royal family . the tens of thousands of spectators at sunday 's consecration can marvel at a golden cross and orb donated by the english city of coventry , which itself was flattened by german bombing during world war ii . the " sto n e bell " retur n s dresdeners themselves are particularly elated that their frauenkirche is finally opening its doors for protestant services following its restoration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church was rebuilt according to original plans until 1945 , the " stone bell " atop the frauenkirche lent the dresden skyline its distinctive silhouette .
ilse walter remembers when the church was bombed by british and american forces during world war ii . " spring was almost in the air on feb .
13 , 1945 , " she said .
" i remember it vividly .
i was sitting in the living room with my family listening to the radio .
they were playing relatively happy , light music when suddenly , right in the middle of the song , we heard the air raid sirens . " what ki n d of memorial ? what followed was one of the most destructive of all allied attacks , with tens of thousands losing their lives .
the city , dubbed " florence on the elbe " for its baroque splendor , was practically wiped out .
from a military perspective , no one even knows why the city was targeted .
the end of the war was already in sight , dresden had no garrisons , and its industry was outside city borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche -lrb- left -rrb- is now part of dresden 's skyline again but destroyed it was and with it , dresden 's frauenkirche .
as the city was being rebuilt in the following decades , the church remained in shambles - a skeletal reference to an ugly past . many dresden citizens felt it should stay that way - a necessary reminder of war 's destruction .
but for others , the dilapidated frauenkirche was an eyesore .
it was time to move on , they believed .
not forget , but progress . a merger of past a n d prese n t in the end , those in favor of rebuilding the frauenkirche won .
yet the restored church 's architectural design reflects only part of the baroque style from the 1700s , when the original frauenkirche was built . " we had to delve into the baroque and middle ages and study how the stones were laid back then , " said eberhard burger , the reconstruction director .
" we have done that the same way now , but we 've used better materials .
so the reconstructed building is based on a mix of old and new techniques . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church 's new golden cross about a third of the new frauenkirche building is made from the old , dark-colored stones that were left in the ruins .
the rest are new , light colored sandstones .
together they create a kind of mosaic of past and present .
the golden cross atop the church 's dome was even created by the son of an english pilot who dropped bombs on dresden in 1945 .
and of course , there is a new organ . a global project the total cost of the project came to 180 million euros -lrb- $ 218 million -rrb- . german historian arnulf baring , who as a boy witnessed the bombing in dresden , said he believes the project was worth the enormous cost and said it showed that germans could find elements of their past of which they can be proud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recreated frescoes inside the church " the frauenkirche was more than a church , it was a symbol of the downfall of a city , " baring told der spiegel magazine .
" i think it is a good thing that germans , wherever possible , regain part of their old cities , so they know that we come from somewhere . " and ludwig güttler , the chairman of the society to promote the reconstruction of the frauenkirche , said many nations had played a part in helping to restore the church to its former glory . " i am enormously grateful , " he told afp news service .
" not just for the donations , which have just kept coming , but for the level of interest shown by other countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.10.2005 airbus a380 deliveries run into rough weather großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 touched down in frankfurt amid thick fog the airbus a380 made a flawless test landing in germany saturday .
despite its success , the european aircraft maker wo n't be delivering the gigantic planes on time to its buyers .
experts say it wo n't dent airbus ' image . it was an event few aviation fans were willing to miss .
as a prototype of the gigantic a380 , the world 's largest passenger airliner , swooped down from the skies to make a perfect landing at the frankfurt airport on saturday morning amid thick fog , tens of thousands of spectators held their breath in awe . while some clambered on stools they had brought along to get a good look at the 290-ton heavy machine coming to a halt at terminal 2 of the rhein-main airport , others held their cameras and mobile phones above their heads to capture the image . it was the first test landing of the long-haul aircraft outside the testing facilities in france and the main aim is to check the handling and maintenance of the a380 at a civil airport .
the aircraft will fly back to toulouse in france on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 is the world 's largest passenger plane it 's exactly a year since the a380 , designed to carry up to 853 passengers , took to the skies for the first time .
since its maiden flight on april 27 , the aircraft has undergone 110 test flights , clocking 380 flying hours , said tore prang , a spokesman of airbus . " the test results are excellent .
the performance is much better than expected , " he said , adding that it also held true for the craft 's fuel-consumption - at 2.9 liters of kerosene for 100 kilometers per passenger . the low consumption - 12 percent lower than all other large aircraft according to airbus - is an important selling point given that fuel usage now accounts for around 16 to 20 percent of the overall costs of an airline . delivery marred by delays until now , 16 customers have placed orders for 159 a380s which cost 292 million euros -lrb- $ 353 million -rrb- apiece .
the gulf-based airline emirates is the biggest buyer with 41 orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 final assembly line near toulouse but , what 's annoyed many is the fact that the european aircraft manufacturer has delayed the delivery of the airplanes .
thus , singapore airlines , which wanted to get the first of its 10 ordered airplanes by march , now has to wait longer . " the a380 will fly for 30 years - it 's not just a big deal if the planes begin flying in the first or the second half of the year , " said prang .
the amount of compensation that airbus has to shell out for its waiting customers , remains under wraps . the delivery is now scheduled to begin in december 2006 provided there are no further hiccups . one of the biggest hurdles is reportedly evacuating passengers from the plane .
according to international regulations , in the case of an emergency , 873 passengers must be able to leave the aircraft in the dark within 90 seconds by using slides . airbus however insists there are no more hitches on that front . " i 'm confident that there wo n't be any problems there , " said tore prang .
but , airbus has delayed tests for far and an evacuation check is now slated for feb 2006 . " encouraging start " however , some say that teething problems are normal when it comes to mammoth projects . it 's not unusual that there are delays , according to ulrich horstmann , aviation analyst at the bayerische landesbank .
horstmann predicted that the a380 would have a shining future .
he added that the 159 orders were an encouraging start given that many airlines only develop new jets after they prove their value on the market . " airbus can rake in returns due to its monopoly because there are n't any other aircraft in that class and boeing ca n't give a befitting reply , " said horstmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german lufthansa boeing 747 takes off at the frankfurt airport the american rival is developing a larger version of the 1969-created jumbo jet in the form of its 747 advanced , which with 450 seats can carry 50 more passengers . " but the 747 is perceived as an old aircraft , " according to horstmann . the americans however have a different strategy .
instead of concentrating on a new giant aircraft , boeing is expending its energies on developing the 787 , a long-haul aircraft with 250 seats .
in future , flexible direct flights will play a greater role than has been the case until now , is the american thinking .
at the same time , the market for large aircraft is too small to make a new development - which cost 13 billion euros in the case of the a380 - profitable . airbus catches up however airbus spokesman prang does n't buy the argument . " all airports which have growth problems have welcomed the arrival of the a380 , " prang said .
london 's heathrow airport for instance could then reach 10 million extra passengers by 2016 thanks to the a380 without having to organize more take-offs and landings , he pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus believes air passenger numbers worldwide will treble and , in the coming years , the worldwide air passenger figures would rise threefold , having an effect on all class segments , prang added . " boeing only has one strategy , we have both , " he said , pointing towards the planned a340 long-haul aircraft for around 300 passengers .
airbus is currently developing the a350 , an aircraft in the same class as boeing 's 787 .
it 's expected to hit the market by 2010 . " airbus has got lots of things right , " said aviation expert horstmann .
" just 10 years ago , it was the small player , which boeing did n't take seriously enough .
but , in the meantime it has convincing offers in all segments of civil aviation . " when it came to aircrafts with a seating capacity of more than 100 , boeing and aircraft manufacturer mcdonnell-douglas which boeing took over had a market share of 70 percent until the mid-1990s .
but now with over 50 percent of the market share , airbus is leading the way . horstmann does n't believe that the balance will tip sharply . " a two-way share of the pie is closer to a monopoly than one thinks , " he said . " they -lrb- airbus and boeing -rrb- may lower prices in individual instances , but they wo n't be in a cut-throat competition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.10.2005 airbus a380 deliveries run into rough weather großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 touched down in frankfurt amid thick fog the airbus a380 made a flawless test landing in germany saturday .
despite its success , the european aircraft maker wo n't be delivering the gigantic planes on time to its buyers .
experts say it wo n't dent airbus ' image . it was an event few aviation fans were willing to miss .
as a prototype of the gigantic a380 , the world 's largest passenger airliner , swooped down from the skies to make a perfect landing at the frankfurt airport on saturday morning amid thick fog , tens of thousands of spectators held their breath in awe . while some clambered on stools they had brought along to get a good look at the 290-ton heavy machine coming to a halt at terminal 2 of the rhein-main airport , others held their cameras and mobile phones above their heads to capture the image . it was the first test landing of the long-haul aircraft outside the testing facilities in france and the main aim is to check the handling and maintenance of the a380 at a civil airport .
the aircraft will fly back to toulouse in france on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 is the world 's largest passenger plane it 's exactly a year since the a380 , designed to carry up to 853 passengers , took to the skies for the first time .
since its maiden flight on april 27 , the aircraft has undergone 110 test flights , clocking 380 flying hours , said tore prang , a spokesman of airbus . " the test results are excellent .
the performance is much better than expected , " he said , adding that it also held true for the craft 's fuel-consumption - at 2.9 liters of kerosene for 100 kilometers per passenger . the low consumption - 12 percent lower than all other large aircraft according to airbus - is an important selling point given that fuel usage now accounts for around 16 to 20 percent of the overall costs of an airline . delivery marred by delays until now , 16 customers have placed orders for 159 a380s which cost 292 million euros -lrb- $ 353 million -rrb- apiece .
the gulf-based airline emirates is the biggest buyer with 41 orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 final assembly line near toulouse but , what 's annoyed many is the fact that the european aircraft manufacturer has delayed the delivery of the airplanes .
thus , singapore airlines , which wanted to get the first of its 10 ordered airplanes by march , now has to wait longer . " the a380 will fly for 30 years - it 's not just a big deal if the planes begin flying in the first or the second half of the year , " said prang .
the amount of compensation that airbus has to shell out for its waiting customers , remains under wraps . the delivery is now scheduled to begin in december 2006 provided there are no further hiccups . one of the biggest hurdles is reportedly evacuating passengers from the plane .
according to international regulations , in the case of an emergency , 873 passengers must be able to leave the aircraft in the dark within 90 seconds by using slides . airbus however insists there are no more hitches on that front . " i 'm confident that there wo n't be any problems there , " said tore prang .
but , airbus has delayed tests for far and an evacuation check is now slated for feb 2006 . " encouraging start " however , some say that teething problems are normal when it comes to mammoth projects . it 's not unusual that there are delays , according to ulrich horstmann , aviation analyst at the bayerische landesbank .
horstmann predicted that the a380 would have a shining future .
he added that the 159 orders were an encouraging start given that many airlines only develop new jets after they prove their value on the market . " airbus can rake in returns due to its monopoly because there are n't any other aircraft in that class and boeing ca n't give a befitting reply , " said horstmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german lufthansa boeing 747 takes off at the frankfurt airport the american rival is developing a larger version of the 1969-created jumbo jet in the form of its 747 advanced , which with 450 seats can carry 50 more passengers . " but the 747 is perceived as an old aircraft , " according to horstmann . the americans however have a different strategy .
instead of concentrating on a new giant aircraft , boeing is expending its energies on developing the 787 , a long-haul aircraft with 250 seats .
in future , flexible direct flights will play a greater role than has been the case until now , is the american thinking .
at the same time , the market for large aircraft is too small to make a new development - which cost 13 billion euros in the case of the a380 - profitable . airbus catches up however airbus spokesman prang does n't buy the argument . " all airports which have growth problems have welcomed the arrival of the a380 , " prang said .
london 's heathrow airport for instance could then reach 10 million extra passengers by 2016 thanks to the a380 without having to organize more take-offs and landings , he pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus believes air passenger numbers worldwide will treble and , in the coming years , the worldwide air passenger figures would rise threefold , having an effect on all class segments , prang added . " boeing only has one strategy , we have both , " he said , pointing towards the planned a340 long-haul aircraft for around 300 passengers .
airbus is currently developing the a350 , an aircraft in the same class as boeing 's 787 .
it 's expected to hit the market by 2010 . " airbus has got lots of things right , " said aviation expert horstmann .
" just 10 years ago , it was the small player , which boeing did n't take seriously enough .
but , in the meantime it has convincing offers in all segments of civil aviation . " when it came to aircrafts with a seating capacity of more than 100 , boeing and aircraft manufacturer mcdonnell-douglas which boeing took over had a market share of 70 percent until the mid-1990s .
but now with over 50 percent of the market share , airbus is leading the way . horstmann does n't believe that the balance will tip sharply . " a two-way share of the pie is closer to a monopoly than one thinks , " he said . " they -lrb- airbus and boeing -rrb- may lower prices in individual instances , but they wo n't be in a cut-throat competition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 29.10.2005 top trio pulls away in bundesliga großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a beaten munich keeper oliver kahn -lrb- r -rrb- would celebrate in the end german international midfielder michael ballack 's header saved three points for bayern munich in cologne .
bremen and hamburg also win as the top trio in the league is beginning to pull away . a five-game winning streak has done much to dampen the spirits of cologne 's fans but it did n't stop 50,000 of them from streaming to the rhein energie stadium to see their side face bayern munich .
the crowd fired their club on to a strong first-half performance that was highlighted by matthias scherz ' third season goal and a 1-0 lead .
but they filed out of the grounds disappointed as bayern defender lucio and midfielder michael ballack scored second-half goals to give munich the victory . the loss heightens the crisis in cologne as coach uwe rapolder has to wonder what can be done to gather the club 's first victory since a 2-1 defeat of mönchengladbach on september 17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich coach felix magath waves his arms in disbelief but his side would win 2-1 in cologne it was not to be against a less than satisfactory performance from bayern in the eyes their coach felix magath .
that 's why it 's good to have international performers like lucio and ballack who can turn around even a bleak game . " we can be happy about a lucky victory , " commented magath dryly . it came about with some help from the referee whose decisions affected the game 's outcome .
ballack 's gamewinning head ball goal came in the 74th minute off a corner kick wrongly awarded to the league-leaders .
then in the waning moments , cologne were denied a penalty kick as lucio apparently used his hands to deflect the ball in the penalty box .
as magath said , it was a lucky victory . bremen overcome weak start to win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen 's miroslav klose clinches his fists in joy over his 11th strike of the season werder bremen remain two points behind munich in the standings after a clear 4-1 win over guests frankfurt .
the central germans came into bremen with a convincing 6-3 thrashing of cologne under their belts .
the excellent effort continued and coach friedhelm funkel 's team proved they could play with the best of them when ioannis amanatidis put them up 1-0 in the 19th minute . after that though , thomas schaaf 's bremen took control of the game .
international midfielder torsten frings knotted up the game with a head ball in the 29th minute and the score was 1-1 at half .
tim borowski scored twice and miroslav klose also found the net for his league-leading 11th goal although it was preceded by a hand ball . " after the go-ahead goal in the second half we could n't keep up with bremen .
it was a deserved victory for werder , " admitted funkel . third-place hamburg also kept pace with the best , and in the process handed schalke their first loss of the season .
defender mehdi mahdavikia scored the lone goal in the 19th minute in a roughly-played match in which referee fandel handed out five yellow cards and sent off schalke stopper christian poulsen for two bookings .
the " royal blues " now are a massive ten points behind bayern as this campaign is taking on the appearance of a three-horse race . gladbach series halted the biggest surprise in this young season has been borussia mönchengladbach .
they lost to their namesakes from dortmund 2-1 .
gladbach were never really in this match as the homeside borussia dortmund dictated play most of the game .
nevertheless , gladbach remain in fifth-place , even on points with schalke and berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a common sight : stuttgart 's goalkeeper dirk heinen watches the ball rolling over the goalline hertha berlin benefited from the schalke and gladbach losses in the most entertaining match on saturday , drawing 3-3 with stuttgart .
the guests from berlin led 1-0 after one half and then the fireworks began as the lead changed hand two times .
colorful berlin midfielder marchelinho has found his form again , having scored once and assisting on the other two goals .
stuttgart coach giovanni trapattoni 's side never surrendered though .
mario gomez got the equalizer with seven minutes remaining to save the italian coach who has had to listen to loads of rumors about his release this past week for the next match against nuremberg . henke also given a reprieve just like in stuttgart , kaiserslautern 's coach michael henke has been suffering under his squad 's sub-par performance .
he made the right decision as his team was behind 2-1 in the 87th minute by bringing on rarely-used turkish striker berkant götkan .
the 25-year old scored just three minutes later for a 2-2 final . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there , there , everything 's just fine , " would seem to be lautern coach michael henke 's -lrb- l -rrb- reaction " i 'm very disappointed , " said leverkusen coach michael skibbe who has yet to win in three matches with the club .
" that so many of our players were pushing up front -lrb- at the end -rrb- was completely unnecessary . " wolfsburg had gone through a tough three weeks .
coach holger fach 's side had come away with four hard-earned points against bayern munich , hamburg and schalke .
the game against duisburg was a well-deserved break but they underestimated the " zebras " who scored their second victory of the season , and even escaped the relegation zone with a 2-0 win that was hardly threatened by the toothless wolves . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wanted : a better team for altintop kaiserslautern 's halil altintop together with bremen 's miroslav klose , tops the bundesliga in goalscoring .

despite its success , the european aircraft maker wo n't be delivering the gigantic planes on time to its buyers .
experts say it wo n't dent airbus ' image . it was an event few aviation fans were willing to miss .
as a prototype of the gigantic a380 , the world 's largest passenger airliner , swooped down from the skies to make a perfect landing at the frankfurt airport on saturday morning amid thick fog , tens of thousands of spectators held their breath in awe . while some clambered on stools they had brought along to get a good look at the 290-ton heavy machine coming to a halt at terminal 2 of the rhein-main airport , others held their cameras and mobile phones above their heads to capture the image . it was the first test landing of the long-haul aircraft outside the testing facilities in france and the main aim is to check the handling and maintenance of the a380 at a civil airport .
the aircraft will fly back to toulouse in france on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 is the world 's largest passenger plane it 's exactly a year since the a380 , designed to carry up to 853 passengers , took to the skies for the first time .
since its maiden flight on april 27 , the aircraft has undergone 110 test flights , clocking 380 flying hours , said tore prang , a spokesman of airbus . " the test results are excellent .
the performance is much better than expected , " he said , adding that it also held true for the craft 's fuel-consumption - at 2.9 liters of kerosene for 100 kilometers per passenger . the low consumption - 12 percent lower than all other large aircraft according to airbus - is an important selling point given that fuel usage now accounts for around 16 to 20 percent of the overall costs of an airline . delivery marred by delays until now , 16 customers have placed orders for 159 a380s which cost 292 million euros -lrb- $ 353 million -rrb- apiece .
the gulf-based airline emirates is the biggest buyer with 41 orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 final assembly line near toulouse but , what 's annoyed many is the fact that the european aircraft manufacturer has delayed the delivery of the airplanes .
thus , singapore airlines , which wanted to get the first of its 10 ordered airplanes by march , now has to wait longer . " the a380 will fly for 30 years - it 's not just a big deal if the planes begin flying in the first or the second half of the year , " said prang .
the amount of compensation that airbus has to shell out for its waiting customers , remains under wraps . the delivery is now scheduled to begin in december 2006 provided there are no further hiccups . one of the biggest hurdles is reportedly evacuating passengers from the plane .
according to international regulations , in the case of an emergency , 873 passengers must be able to leave the aircraft in the dark within 90 seconds by using slides . airbus however insists there are no more hitches on that front . " i 'm confident that there wo n't be any problems there , " said tore prang .
but , airbus has delayed tests for far and an evacuation check is now slated for feb 2006 . " encouraging start " however , some say that teething problems are normal when it comes to mammoth projects . it 's not unusual that there are delays , according to ulrich horstmann , aviation analyst at the bayerische landesbank .
horstmann predicted that the a380 would have a shining future .
he added that the 159 orders were an encouraging start given that many airlines only develop new jets after they prove their value on the market . " airbus can rake in returns due to its monopoly because there are n't any other aircraft in that class and boeing ca n't give a befitting reply , " said horstmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german lufthansa boeing 747 takes off at the frankfurt airport the american rival is developing a larger version of the 1969-created jumbo jet in the form of its 747 advanced , which with 450 seats can carry 50 more passengers . " but the 747 is perceived as an old aircraft , " according to horstmann . the americans however have a different strategy .
instead of concentrating on a new giant aircraft , boeing is expending its energies on developing the 787 , a long-haul aircraft with 250 seats .
in future , flexible direct flights will play a greater role than has been the case until now , is the american thinking .
at the same time , the market for large aircraft is too small to make a new development - which cost 13 billion euros in the case of the a380 - profitable . airbus catches up however airbus spokesman prang does n't buy the argument . " all airports which have growth problems have welcomed the arrival of the a380 , " prang said .
london 's heathrow airport for instance could then reach 10 million extra passengers by 2016 thanks to the a380 without having to organize more take-offs and landings , he pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus believes air passenger numbers worldwide will treble and , in the coming years , the worldwide air passenger figures would rise threefold , having an effect on all class segments , prang added . " boeing only has one strategy , we have both , " he said , pointing towards the planned a340 long-haul aircraft for around 300 passengers .
airbus is currently developing the a350 , an aircraft in the same class as boeing 's 787 .
it 's expected to hit the market by 2010 . " airbus has got lots of things right , " said aviation expert horstmann .
" just 10 years ago , it was the small player , which boeing did n't take seriously enough .
but , in the meantime it has convincing offers in all segments of civil aviation . " when it came to aircrafts with a seating capacity of more than 100 , boeing and aircraft manufacturer mcdonnell-douglas which boeing took over had a market share of 70 percent until the mid-1990s .
but now with over 50 percent of the market share , airbus is leading the way . horstmann does n't believe that the balance will tip sharply . " a two-way share of the pie is closer to a monopoly than one thinks , " he said . " they -lrb- airbus and boeing -rrb- may lower prices in individual instances , but they wo n't be in a cut-throat competition .

since its maiden flight on april 27 , the aircraft has undergone 110 test flights , clocking 380 flying hours , said tore prang , a spokesman of airbus . " the test results are excellent .
the performance is much better than expected , " he said , adding that it also held true for the craft 's fuel-consumption - at 2.9 liters of kerosene for 100 kilometers per passenger . the low consumption - 12 percent lower than all other large aircraft according to airbus - is an important selling point given that fuel usage now accounts for around 16 to 20 percent of the overall costs of an airline . delivery marred by delays until now , 16 customers have placed orders for 159 a380s which cost 292 million euros -lrb- $ 353 million -rrb- apiece .
the gulf-based airline emirates is the biggest buyer with 41 orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 final assembly line near toulouse but , what 's annoyed many is the fact that the european aircraft manufacturer has delayed the delivery of the airplanes .
thus , singapore airlines , which wanted to get the first of its 10 ordered airplanes by march , now has to wait longer . " the a380 will fly for 30 years - it 's not just a big deal if the planes begin flying in the first or the second half of the year , " said prang .
the amount of compensation that airbus has to shell out for its waiting customers , remains under wraps . the delivery is now scheduled to begin in december 2006 provided there are no further hiccups . one of the biggest hurdles is reportedly evacuating passengers from the plane .
according to international regulations , in the case of an emergency , 873 passengers must be able to leave the aircraft in the dark within 90 seconds by using slides . airbus however insists there are no more hitches on that front . " i 'm confident that there wo n't be any problems there , " said tore prang .
but , airbus has delayed tests for far and an evacuation check is now slated for feb 2006 . " encouraging start " however , some say that teething problems are normal when it comes to mammoth projects . it 's not unusual that there are delays , according to ulrich horstmann , aviation analyst at the bayerische landesbank .
horstmann predicted that the a380 would have a shining future .
he added that the 159 orders were an encouraging start given that many airlines only develop new jets after they prove their value on the market . " airbus can rake in returns due to its monopoly because there are n't any other aircraft in that class and boeing ca n't give a befitting reply , " said horstmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german lufthansa boeing 747 takes off at the frankfurt airport the american rival is developing a larger version of the 1969-created jumbo jet in the form of its 747 advanced , which with 450 seats can carry 50 more passengers . " but the 747 is perceived as an old aircraft , " according to horstmann . the americans however have a different strategy .
instead of concentrating on a new giant aircraft , boeing is expending its energies on developing the 787 , a long-haul aircraft with 250 seats .
in future , flexible direct flights will play a greater role than has been the case until now , is the american thinking .
at the same time , the market for large aircraft is too small to make a new development - which cost 13 billion euros in the case of the a380 - profitable . airbus catches up however airbus spokesman prang does n't buy the argument . " all airports which have growth problems have welcomed the arrival of the a380 , " prang said .
london 's heathrow airport for instance could then reach 10 million extra passengers by 2016 thanks to the a380 without having to organize more take-offs and landings , he pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus believes air passenger numbers worldwide will treble and , in the coming years , the worldwide air passenger figures would rise threefold , having an effect on all class segments , prang added . " boeing only has one strategy , we have both , " he said , pointing towards the planned a340 long-haul aircraft for around 300 passengers .
airbus is currently developing the a350 , an aircraft in the same class as boeing 's 787 .
it 's expected to hit the market by 2010 . " airbus has got lots of things right , " said aviation expert horstmann .
" just 10 years ago , it was the small player , which boeing did n't take seriously enough .
but , in the meantime it has convincing offers in all segments of civil aviation . " when it came to aircrafts with a seating capacity of more than 100 , boeing and aircraft manufacturer mcdonnell-douglas which boeing took over had a market share of 70 percent until the mid-1990s .
but now with over 50 percent of the market share , airbus is leading the way . horstmann does n't believe that the balance will tip sharply . " a two-way share of the pie is closer to a monopoly than one thinks , " he said . " they -lrb- airbus and boeing -rrb- may lower prices in individual instances , but they wo n't be in a cut-throat competition .

the company said on friday that it already mentioned the case in one of its previous quarterly reports and that it rejected any further public comments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is one of the prime accused the siemens group is said to have paid about 1.6 million dollars in bribes to saddam in support of deals involving power plant turbines . siemens representatives says the company wouldn ’ t make any comment at this point in time and have called the report " premature and unjustified . " fresh debate about business ethics but , mark pieth , an investigator on the volcker panel , argued that investigators found clear evidence into the wrongdoings of german companies . " we have documents supporting our allegations , " he said .
" they are available to everyone and clearly document all traces we ’ ve found .
i ’ m convinced our report provides enough evidence for legal proceedings against the firms to start immediately . " paul volcker ’ s findings have unleashed a fresh debate about business ethics in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business corruption in germany has long been a cause of worry for transparency international hans jürgen elzholtz , from the corruption watchdog transparency international , said the two corporations had adopted anti-corruption strategies long ago .
they should now be wondering , he argued , how the system could have been circumvented by individual staff members . he also urged german prosecutors to start a full investigation into the cases of bribery . " german laws against bribery are sufficient and appropriate , " he said .
" they just need to be fully applied .
it is now a question of resources in the justice system and enough public pressure to start a full legal proceedings .
i hope we ’ ll see that happening very soon . " smaller fish should n't go unpunished elzholtz also expressed the hope that prosecutors wouldn ’ t just focus on the two high-profile cases involving daimlerchrysler and siemens . the huge number of smaller companies that had given kickbacks to the saddam regime shouldn ’ t go unpunished , he said . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans accused of bribery in un corruption scandal siemens and daimlerchrysler are among the more than 2,000 companies from 66 countries that paid kickbacks to saddam hussein 's government , according to an independent report on the un 's oil-for-food program .

from hate and evil a community of reconciliation can grow , which makes peace possible . " german president horst köhler acknowledged in his speech that many critics had suggested before the project began that the money would have been better spent on rebuilding the broken-down former east germany .
" did eastern germany not need roads , roofs and factories more than an expensive church ?
but a group of residents said dresden needed more .
and now we can see that those people were right , " köhler said .
the baroque church stood for decades as a decapitated , empty shell .
but that changed in 1990 when a group of people began gathering funds to rebuild it .
now , after a decade of reconstruction , the frauenkirche stands once again in its full splendor , with sunday 's consecration ceremony officially reopening the church to the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche in ruins in 1945 people from around the world are visiting dresden for the festivities . outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder and his designated successor , angela merkel are there . britain , which led the bombing raids , has contributed more than one million euros in donations towards the reconstruction and the duke of kent , who is patron of the fundraising dresden trust , is attending sunday 's ceremony to represent the british royal family . the tens of thousands of spectators at sunday 's consecration can marvel at a golden cross and orb donated by the english city of coventry , which itself was flattened by german bombing during world war ii . the " sto n e bell " retur n s dresdeners themselves are particularly elated that their frauenkirche is finally opening its doors for protestant services following its restoration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church was rebuilt according to original plans until 1945 , the " stone bell " atop the frauenkirche lent the dresden skyline its distinctive silhouette .
ilse walter remembers when the church was bombed by british and american forces during world war ii . " spring was almost in the air on feb .
13 , 1945 , " she said .
" i remember it vividly .
i was sitting in the living room with my family listening to the radio .
they were playing relatively happy , light music when suddenly , right in the middle of the song , we heard the air raid sirens . " what ki n d of memorial ? what followed was one of the most destructive of all allied attacks , with tens of thousands losing their lives .
the city , dubbed " florence on the elbe " for its baroque splendor , was practically wiped out .
from a military perspective , no one even knows why the city was targeted .
the end of the war was already in sight , dresden had no garrisons , and its industry was outside city borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche -lrb- left -rrb- is now part of dresden 's skyline again but destroyed it was and with it , dresden 's frauenkirche .
as the city was being rebuilt in the following decades , the church remained in shambles - a skeletal reference to an ugly past . many dresden citizens felt it should stay that way - a necessary reminder of war 's destruction .
but for others , the dilapidated frauenkirche was an eyesore .
it was time to move on , they believed .
not forget , but progress . a merger of past a n d prese n t in the end , those in favor of rebuilding the frauenkirche won .
yet the restored church 's architectural design reflects only part of the baroque style from the 1700s , when the original frauenkirche was built . " we had to delve into the baroque and middle ages and study how the stones were laid back then , " said eberhard burger , the reconstruction director .
" we have done that the same way now , but we 've used better materials .
so the reconstructed building is based on a mix of old and new techniques . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church 's new golden cross about a third of the new frauenkirche building is made from the old , dark-colored stones that were left in the ruins .
the rest are new , light colored sandstones .
together they create a kind of mosaic of past and present .
the golden cross atop the church 's dome was even created by the son of an english pilot who dropped bombs on dresden in 1945 .
and of course , there is a new organ . a global project the total cost of the project came to 180 million euros -lrb- $ 218 million -rrb- . german historian arnulf baring , who as a boy witnessed the bombing in dresden , said he believes the project was worth the enormous cost and said it showed that germans could find elements of their past of which they can be proud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recreated frescoes inside the church " the frauenkirche was more than a church , it was a symbol of the downfall of a city , " baring told der spiegel magazine .
" i think it is a good thing that germans , wherever possible , regain part of their old cities , so they know that we come from somewhere . " and ludwig güttler , the chairman of the society to promote the reconstruction of the frauenkirche , said many nations had played a part in helping to restore the church to its former glory . " i am enormously grateful , " he told afp news service .
" not just for the donations , which have just kept coming , but for the level of interest shown by other countries .
so many people can say that this project is theirs - whether they be britons , americans , danes , poles or whatever else .

some 200 university students from more than 20 universities in 12 countries participated in the project under the esa 's initiative . the satellite is about the size of a standard washing machine and weighs about 62 kilograms . from the drawing board to the launch pad , the project took just 18 months with students relying on the internet as their principal means of exchanging data .
the esa provided the entire funding . " they -lrb- the satellites -rrb- are all in what we called a polar orbit , little below some 700 kilometers above our head so to speak and they have a number of technology experiments on board , " said heidi graff , a spokeswoman for esa .
" they are also testing a special new kind of solar cell , which is better in quality than the standard used to be , they will have a camera on board to try to take observation pictures and they have certain equipment on board with which they will communicate with radio amateurs all over the world , " graff added . hands-on training but even more than the technology , the uniqueness of the project lies in the fact that the entire undertaking was completed by the students themselves . the sseti , which provided the framework for the mission , was launched by esa ’ s education department in 2000 to get european students involved in real space missions , and well as give them practical hands-on experience and encourage them to take up careers in space technology and science . " it 's all done and built by the students themselves .
we more or less only financed the technical check out to make it qualify to go for launch .
it is the students who really have to get the credit , " said graff . one of the students , jürgen schlutz from the university of stuttgart who is one of 15 students studying aerospace engineering in the project propulsion team , said the hands-on training had been valuable . " we are all students of engineering but it 's a pretty much a theoretical approach , we did n't do much in the way of hardware -lrb- until now -rrb- , " schlutz said . " what we learned in the project was actually to build - what comes extra is all the involvement in the project itself , in project management , the work with student teams all over europe , the technical aspect and intercultural co-operation was something that was very valuable for team members , " he added . mark caldwell -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european aerospace aims for the moon leading german aerospace companies have urged the creation of an unmanned european space station on the moon , warning that europe could otherwise lose out to other nations in the race for space exploration and research .

the " red devils " are floundering towards the bottom of the league but the german-born turk has big plans . kaiserslautern managed to advance another round this week in the german cup .
they did it with a hard-fought 4-2 away victory on tuesday against third division side erfurt .
yet the win did nothing to relieve the pressure on coach michael henke .
in the bundesliga , lautern are just a point away from the relegation zone .
dissension inside the team and from outside -lrb- the fans -rrb- is reaching a fevered pitch . after the cup match on tuesday , henke railed against the erfurt squad by calling them " scheiss-ossis , " or " crap easterners " for not kicking the ball out of bounds towards the end of the game when a lautern player lay injured on the ground . it was indicative of the heat that henke and the team have been feeling over the past few weeks as they counted one disappointing match after another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesliga goalkeepers have been at the mercy of kaiserslautern 's halil altintop -lrb- l -rrb- this season one lautern player , forward halil altintop , has been spared the misery - at least directly .
while his teammates in back , the defenders , resemble more a sieve than a solid wall by giving up 25 goals so far , altintop has alone tallied 10 strikes , sharing the top slot in the bundesliga with bremen 's miroslav klose . " whoever allows that many goals in ten games should have nothing to do with this league , " was altintop 's reaction after last week 's 4-1 shellacking by mönchengladbach . dangerous strikers desired everywhere the fans are resorting to anything and everything to express their frustration with the club that over the past few years has been making a steady , plunge to the bottom of the standings . the joy of the 1997-98 title with coach otto rehhagel at the helm is long just a dream .
two weeks ago , the hard-core supporters vented their frustration by entering the stadium five minutes after the starting whistle - and were promptly penalized when they entered the fritz walter stadium as dortmund went out on top in the seventh minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twin brother hamit altintop -lrb- r -rrb- has found a spot on the turkish national squad it would be the game , though , that manager 's heads in the league turned to the small city in the far west of germany .
altintop would equal dortmund 's ebi smolarek 's hat trick with one of his own to preserve at least one point for kaiserslautern . all of a sudden , halil altintop was a hot commodity .
one club in particular would be a natural for the 22-year-old turk who was born in gelsenkirchen - schalke .
his twin brother hamit already plays for the " royal blues , " so it would hardly be a surprise if halil returned to his hometown . " since i 've been with lautern , there has always been speculation about schalke , " he told sport-bild magazine .
one thing is certain , altintop , who plays on the turkish national squad and whose contract expires in june 2006 , will leave kaiserslautern at the end of the season .
lautern president rene c. jäggi understands altintop 's desire to depart the crisis-riddled club . " he definitely wants to play in international competition and he could make much more money with any top european club , " jäggi said . aspirations for turkey also while the speculation is still swirling around altintop , he not only is eyeing just whom he might play for in the bundesliga .
he wants to secure himself a spot with the turkish national team that is still fighting to qualify for the world cup in germany and believes that only when he is playing against the top clubs in europe will he have a chance of wearing turkish red on the pitch and not just on the bench . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the life of a striker is not easy as altintop -lrb- l -rrb- finds out against dortmund " a coach simply prefers a player who plays for a top club , " he said in sport-bild after seeing no action in the country 's world cup qualifiers in september despite an impressive start in the bundesliga .
" you have to play against teams like inter milan . " england 's wayne rooney found that out at everton and moved to manchester united .
that wo n't be possible for altintop if he stays at kaiserslautern .
just as the " red devils " announced that it left the red and entered the black by making a small profit in the 2004-05 business year , they will have to find a replacement for the striker who could give the club a going-away president by shooting enough goals to keep lautern in the top division . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chelsea 's robert huth singing the blues robert huth must be asking himself what happened .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 29.10.2005 top trio pulls away in bundesliga großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a beaten munich keeper oliver kahn -lrb- r -rrb- would celebrate in the end german international midfielder michael ballack 's header saved three points for bayern munich in cologne .
bremen and hamburg also win as the top trio in the league is beginning to pull away . a five-game winning streak has done much to dampen the spirits of cologne 's fans but it did n't stop 50,000 of them from streaming to the rhein energie stadium to see their side face bayern munich .
the crowd fired their club on to a strong first-half performance that was highlighted by matthias scherz ' third season goal and a 1-0 lead .
but they filed out of the grounds disappointed as bayern defender lucio and midfielder michael ballack scored second-half goals to give munich the victory . the loss heightens the crisis in cologne as coach uwe rapolder has to wonder what can be done to gather the club 's first victory since a 2-1 defeat of mönchengladbach on september 17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich coach felix magath waves his arms in disbelief but his side would win 2-1 in cologne it was not to be against a less than satisfactory performance from bayern in the eyes their coach felix magath .
that 's why it 's good to have international performers like lucio and ballack who can turn around even a bleak game . " we can be happy about a lucky victory , " commented magath dryly . it came about with some help from the referee whose decisions affected the game 's outcome .
ballack 's gamewinning head ball goal came in the 74th minute off a corner kick wrongly awarded to the league-leaders .
then in the waning moments , cologne were denied a penalty kick as lucio apparently used his hands to deflect the ball in the penalty box .
as magath said , it was a lucky victory . bremen overcome weak start to win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen 's miroslav klose clinches his fists in joy over his 11th strike of the season werder bremen remain two points behind munich in the standings after a clear 4-1 win over guests frankfurt .
the central germans came into bremen with a convincing 6-3 thrashing of cologne under their belts .
the excellent effort continued and coach friedhelm funkel 's team proved they could play with the best of them when ioannis amanatidis put them up 1-0 in the 19th minute . after that though , thomas schaaf 's bremen took control of the game .
international midfielder torsten frings knotted up the game with a head ball in the 29th minute and the score was 1-1 at half .
tim borowski scored twice and miroslav klose also found the net for his league-leading 11th goal although it was preceded by a hand ball . " after the go-ahead goal in the second half we could n't keep up with bremen .
it was a deserved victory for werder , " admitted funkel . third-place hamburg also kept pace with the best , and in the process handed schalke their first loss of the season .
defender mehdi mahdavikia scored the lone goal in the 19th minute in a roughly-played match in which referee fandel handed out five yellow cards and sent off schalke stopper christian poulsen for two bookings .
the " royal blues " now are a massive ten points behind bayern as this campaign is taking on the appearance of a three-horse race . gladbach series halted the biggest surprise in this young season has been borussia mönchengladbach .
they lost to their namesakes from dortmund 2-1 .
gladbach were never really in this match as the homeside borussia dortmund dictated play most of the game .
nevertheless , gladbach remain in fifth-place , even on points with schalke and berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a common sight : stuttgart 's goalkeeper dirk heinen watches the ball rolling over the goalline hertha berlin benefited from the schalke and gladbach losses in the most entertaining match on saturday , drawing 3-3 with stuttgart .
the guests from berlin led 1-0 after one half and then the fireworks began as the lead changed hand two times .
colorful berlin midfielder marchelinho has found his form again , having scored once and assisting on the other two goals .
stuttgart coach giovanni trapattoni 's side never surrendered though .
mario gomez got the equalizer with seven minutes remaining to save the italian coach who has had to listen to loads of rumors about his release this past week for the next match against nuremberg . henke also given a reprieve just like in stuttgart , kaiserslautern 's coach michael henke has been suffering under his squad 's sub-par performance .
he made the right decision as his team was behind 2-1 in the 87th minute by bringing on rarely-used turkish striker berkant götkan .
the 25-year old scored just three minutes later for a 2-2 final . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there , there , everything 's just fine , " would seem to be lautern coach michael henke 's -lrb- l -rrb- reaction " i 'm very disappointed , " said leverkusen coach michael skibbe who has yet to win in three matches with the club .
" that so many of our players were pushing up front -lrb- at the end -rrb- was completely unnecessary . " wolfsburg had gone through a tough three weeks .
coach holger fach 's side had come away with four hard-earned points against bayern munich , hamburg and schalke .
the game against duisburg was a well-deserved break but they underestimated the " zebras " who scored their second victory of the season , and even escaped the relegation zone with a 2-0 win that was hardly threatened by the toothless wolves . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wanted : a better team for altintop kaiserslautern 's halil altintop together with bremen 's miroslav klose , tops the bundesliga in goalscoring .

from hate and evil a community of reconciliation can grow , which makes peace possible . " german president horst köhler acknowledged in his speech that many critics had suggested before the project began that the money would have been better spent on rebuilding the broken-down former east germany .
" did eastern germany not need roads , roofs and factories more than an expensive church ?
but a group of residents said dresden needed more .
and now we can see that those people were right , " köhler said .
the baroque church stood for decades as a decapitated , empty shell .
but that changed in 1990 when a group of people began gathering funds to rebuild it .
now , after a decade of reconstruction , the frauenkirche stands once again in its full splendor , with sunday 's consecration ceremony officially reopening the church to the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche in ruins in 1945 people from around the world are visiting dresden for the festivities . outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder and his designated successor , angela merkel are there . britain , which led the bombing raids , has contributed more than one million euros in donations towards the reconstruction and the duke of kent , who is patron of the fundraising dresden trust , is attending sunday 's ceremony to represent the british royal family . the tens of thousands of spectators at sunday 's consecration can marvel at a golden cross and orb donated by the english city of coventry , which itself was flattened by german bombing during world war ii . the " sto n e bell " retur n s dresdeners themselves are particularly elated that their frauenkirche is finally opening its doors for protestant services following its restoration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church was rebuilt according to original plans until 1945 , the " stone bell " atop the frauenkirche lent the dresden skyline its distinctive silhouette .
ilse walter remembers when the church was bombed by british and american forces during world war ii . " spring was almost in the air on feb .
13 , 1945 , " she said .
" i remember it vividly .
i was sitting in the living room with my family listening to the radio .
they were playing relatively happy , light music when suddenly , right in the middle of the song , we heard the air raid sirens . " what ki n d of memorial ? what followed was one of the most destructive of all allied attacks , with tens of thousands losing their lives .
the city , dubbed " florence on the elbe " for its baroque splendor , was practically wiped out .
from a military perspective , no one even knows why the city was targeted .
the end of the war was already in sight , dresden had no garrisons , and its industry was outside city borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche -lrb- left -rrb- is now part of dresden 's skyline again but destroyed it was and with it , dresden 's frauenkirche .
as the city was being rebuilt in the following decades , the church remained in shambles - a skeletal reference to an ugly past . many dresden citizens felt it should stay that way - a necessary reminder of war 's destruction .
but for others , the dilapidated frauenkirche was an eyesore .
it was time to move on , they believed .
not forget , but progress . a merger of past a n d prese n t in the end , those in favor of rebuilding the frauenkirche won .
yet the restored church 's architectural design reflects only part of the baroque style from the 1700s , when the original frauenkirche was built . " we had to delve into the baroque and middle ages and study how the stones were laid back then , " said eberhard burger , the reconstruction director .
" we have done that the same way now , but we 've used better materials .
so the reconstructed building is based on a mix of old and new techniques . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church 's new golden cross about a third of the new frauenkirche building is made from the old , dark-colored stones that were left in the ruins .
the rest are new , light colored sandstones .
together they create a kind of mosaic of past and present .
the golden cross atop the church 's dome was even created by the son of an english pilot who dropped bombs on dresden in 1945 .
and of course , there is a new organ . a global project the total cost of the project came to 180 million euros -lrb- $ 218 million -rrb- . german historian arnulf baring , who as a boy witnessed the bombing in dresden , said he believes the project was worth the enormous cost and said it showed that germans could find elements of their past of which they can be proud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recreated frescoes inside the church " the frauenkirche was more than a church , it was a symbol of the downfall of a city , " baring told der spiegel magazine .
" i think it is a good thing that germans , wherever possible , regain part of their old cities , so they know that we come from somewhere . " and ludwig güttler , the chairman of the society to promote the reconstruction of the frauenkirche , said many nations had played a part in helping to restore the church to its former glory . " i am enormously grateful , " he told afp news service .
" not just for the donations , which have just kept coming , but for the level of interest shown by other countries .
so many people can say that this project is theirs - whether they be britons , americans , danes , poles or whatever else .

bremen and hamburg also win as the top trio in the league is beginning to pull away . a five-game winning streak has done much to dampen the spirits of cologne 's fans but it did n't stop 50,000 of them from streaming to the rhein energie stadium to see their side face bayern munich .
the crowd fired their club on to a strong first-half performance that was highlighted by matthias scherz ' third season goal and a 1-0 lead .
but they filed out of the grounds disappointed as bayern defender lucio and midfielder michael ballack scored second-half goals to give munich the victory . the loss heightens the crisis in cologne as coach uwe rapolder has to wonder what can be done to gather the club 's first victory since a 2-1 defeat of mönchengladbach on september 17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich coach felix magath waves his arms in disbelief but his side would win 2-1 in cologne it was not to be against a less than satisfactory performance from bayern in the eyes their coach felix magath .
that 's why it 's good to have international performers like lucio and ballack who can turn around even a bleak game . " we can be happy about a lucky victory , " commented magath dryly . it came about with some help from the referee whose decisions affected the game 's outcome .
ballack 's gamewinning head ball goal came in the 74th minute off a corner kick wrongly awarded to the league-leaders .
then in the waning moments , cologne were denied a penalty kick as lucio apparently used his hands to deflect the ball in the penalty box .
as magath said , it was a lucky victory . bremen overcome weak start to win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen 's miroslav klose clinches his fists in joy over his 11th strike of the season werder bremen remain two points behind munich in the standings after a clear 4-1 win over guests frankfurt .
the central germans came into bremen with a convincing 6-3 thrashing of cologne under their belts .
the excellent effort continued and coach friedhelm funkel 's team proved they could play with the best of them when ioannis amanatidis put them up 1-0 in the 19th minute . after that though , thomas schaaf 's bremen took control of the game .
international midfielder torsten frings knotted up the game with a head ball in the 29th minute and the score was 1-1 at half .
tim borowski scored twice and miroslav klose also found the net for his league-leading 11th goal although it was preceded by a hand ball . " after the go-ahead goal in the second half we could n't keep up with bremen .
it was a deserved victory for werder , " admitted funkel . third-place hamburg also kept pace with the best , and in the process handed schalke their first loss of the season .
defender mehdi mahdavikia scored the lone goal in the 19th minute in a roughly-played match in which referee fandel handed out five yellow cards and sent off schalke stopper christian poulsen for two bookings .
the " royal blues " now are a massive ten points behind bayern as this campaign is taking on the appearance of a three-horse race . gladbach series halted the biggest surprise in this young season has been borussia mönchengladbach .
they lost to their namesakes from dortmund 2-1 .
gladbach were never really in this match as the homeside borussia dortmund dictated play most of the game .
nevertheless , gladbach remain in fifth-place , even on points with schalke and berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a common sight : stuttgart 's goalkeeper dirk heinen watches the ball rolling over the goalline hertha berlin benefited from the schalke and gladbach losses in the most entertaining match on saturday , drawing 3-3 with stuttgart .
the guests from berlin led 1-0 after one half and then the fireworks began as the lead changed hand two times .
colorful berlin midfielder marchelinho has found his form again , having scored once and assisting on the other two goals .
stuttgart coach giovanni trapattoni 's side never surrendered though .
mario gomez got the equalizer with seven minutes remaining to save the italian coach who has had to listen to loads of rumors about his release this past week for the next match against nuremberg . henke also given a reprieve just like in stuttgart , kaiserslautern 's coach michael henke has been suffering under his squad 's sub-par performance .
he made the right decision as his team was behind 2-1 in the 87th minute by bringing on rarely-used turkish striker berkant götkan .
the 25-year old scored just three minutes later for a 2-2 final . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there , there , everything 's just fine , " would seem to be lautern coach michael henke 's -lrb- l -rrb- reaction " i 'm very disappointed , " said leverkusen coach michael skibbe who has yet to win in three matches with the club .
" that so many of our players were pushing up front -lrb- at the end -rrb- was completely unnecessary . " wolfsburg had gone through a tough three weeks .
coach holger fach 's side had come away with four hard-earned points against bayern munich , hamburg and schalke .
the game against duisburg was a well-deserved break but they underestimated the " zebras " who scored their second victory of the season , and even escaped the relegation zone with a 2-0 win that was hardly threatened by the toothless wolves . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wanted : a better team for altintop kaiserslautern 's halil altintop together with bremen 's miroslav klose , tops the bundesliga in goalscoring .

from hate and evil a community of reconciliation can grow , which makes peace possible . " german president horst köhler acknowledged in his speech that many critics had suggested before the project began that the money would have been better spent on rebuilding the broken-down former east germany .
" did eastern germany not need roads , roofs and factories more than an expensive church ?
but a group of residents said dresden needed more .
and now we can see that those people were right , " köhler said .
the baroque church stood for decades as a decapitated , empty shell .
but that changed in 1990 when a group of people began gathering funds to rebuild it .
now , after a decade of reconstruction , the frauenkirche stands once again in its full splendor , with sunday 's consecration ceremony officially reopening the church to the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche in ruins in 1945 people from around the world are visiting dresden for the festivities . outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder and his designated successor , angela merkel are there . britain , which led the bombing raids , has contributed more than one million euros in donations towards the reconstruction and the duke of kent , who is patron of the fundraising dresden trust , is attending sunday 's ceremony to represent the british royal family . the tens of thousands of spectators at sunday 's consecration can marvel at a golden cross and orb donated by the english city of coventry , which itself was flattened by german bombing during world war ii . the " sto n e bell " retur n s dresdeners themselves are particularly elated that their frauenkirche is finally opening its doors for protestant services following its restoration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church was rebuilt according to original plans until 1945 , the " stone bell " atop the frauenkirche lent the dresden skyline its distinctive silhouette .
ilse walter remembers when the church was bombed by british and american forces during world war ii . " spring was almost in the air on feb .
13 , 1945 , " she said .
" i remember it vividly .
i was sitting in the living room with my family listening to the radio .
they were playing relatively happy , light music when suddenly , right in the middle of the song , we heard the air raid sirens . " what ki n d of memorial ? what followed was one of the most destructive of all allied attacks , with tens of thousands losing their lives .
the city , dubbed " florence on the elbe " for its baroque splendor , was practically wiped out .
from a military perspective , no one even knows why the city was targeted .
the end of the war was already in sight , dresden had no garrisons , and its industry was outside city borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche -lrb- left -rrb- is now part of dresden 's skyline again but destroyed it was and with it , dresden 's frauenkirche .
as the city was being rebuilt in the following decades , the church remained in shambles - a skeletal reference to an ugly past . many dresden citizens felt it should stay that way - a necessary reminder of war 's destruction .
but for others , the dilapidated frauenkirche was an eyesore .
it was time to move on , they believed .
not forget , but progress . a merger of past a n d prese n t in the end , those in favor of rebuilding the frauenkirche won .
yet the restored church 's architectural design reflects only part of the baroque style from the 1700s , when the original frauenkirche was built . " we had to delve into the baroque and middle ages and study how the stones were laid back then , " said eberhard burger , the reconstruction director .
" we have done that the same way now , but we 've used better materials .
so the reconstructed building is based on a mix of old and new techniques . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church 's new golden cross about a third of the new frauenkirche building is made from the old , dark-colored stones that were left in the ruins .
the rest are new , light colored sandstones .
together they create a kind of mosaic of past and present .
the golden cross atop the church 's dome was even created by the son of an english pilot who dropped bombs on dresden in 1945 .
and of course , there is a new organ . a global project the total cost of the project came to 180 million euros -lrb- $ 218 million -rrb- . german historian arnulf baring , who as a boy witnessed the bombing in dresden , said he believes the project was worth the enormous cost and said it showed that germans could find elements of their past of which they can be proud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recreated frescoes inside the church " the frauenkirche was more than a church , it was a symbol of the downfall of a city , " baring told der spiegel magazine .
" i think it is a good thing that germans , wherever possible , regain part of their old cities , so they know that we come from somewhere . " and ludwig güttler , the chairman of the society to promote the reconstruction of the frauenkirche , said many nations had played a part in helping to restore the church to its former glory . " i am enormously grateful , " he told afp news service .
" not just for the donations , which have just kept coming , but for the level of interest shown by other countries .
so many people can say that this project is theirs - whether they be britons , americans , danes , poles or whatever else .

from hate and evil a community of reconciliation can grow , which makes peace possible . " german president horst köhler acknowledged in his speech that many critics had suggested before the project began that the money would have been better spent on rebuilding the broken-down former east germany .
" did eastern germany not need roads , roofs and factories more than an expensive church ?
but a group of residents said dresden needed more .
and now we can see that those people were right , " köhler said .
the baroque church stood for decades as a decapitated , empty shell .
but that changed in 1990 when a group of people began gathering funds to rebuild it .
now , after a decade of reconstruction , the frauenkirche stands once again in its full splendor , with sunday 's consecration ceremony officially reopening the church to the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche in ruins in 1945 people from around the world are visiting dresden for the festivities . outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder and his designated successor , angela merkel are there . britain , which led the bombing raids , has contributed more than one million euros in donations towards the reconstruction and the duke of kent , who is patron of the fundraising dresden trust , is attending sunday 's ceremony to represent the british royal family . the tens of thousands of spectators at sunday 's consecration can marvel at a golden cross and orb donated by the english city of coventry , which itself was flattened by german bombing during world war ii . the " sto n e bell " retur n s dresdeners themselves are particularly elated that their frauenkirche is finally opening its doors for protestant services following its restoration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church was rebuilt according to original plans until 1945 , the " stone bell " atop the frauenkirche lent the dresden skyline its distinctive silhouette .
ilse walter remembers when the church was bombed by british and american forces during world war ii . " spring was almost in the air on feb .
13 , 1945 , " she said .
" i remember it vividly .
i was sitting in the living room with my family listening to the radio .
they were playing relatively happy , light music when suddenly , right in the middle of the song , we heard the air raid sirens . " what ki n d of memorial ? what followed was one of the most destructive of all allied attacks , with tens of thousands losing their lives .
the city , dubbed " florence on the elbe " for its baroque splendor , was practically wiped out .
from a military perspective , no one even knows why the city was targeted .
the end of the war was already in sight , dresden had no garrisons , and its industry was outside city borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche -lrb- left -rrb- is now part of dresden 's skyline again but destroyed it was and with it , dresden 's frauenkirche .
as the city was being rebuilt in the following decades , the church remained in shambles - a skeletal reference to an ugly past . many dresden citizens felt it should stay that way - a necessary reminder of war 's destruction .
but for others , the dilapidated frauenkirche was an eyesore .
it was time to move on , they believed .
not forget , but progress . a merger of past a n d prese n t in the end , those in favor of rebuilding the frauenkirche won .
yet the restored church 's architectural design reflects only part of the baroque style from the 1700s , when the original frauenkirche was built . " we had to delve into the baroque and middle ages and study how the stones were laid back then , " said eberhard burger , the reconstruction director .
" we have done that the same way now , but we 've used better materials .
so the reconstructed building is based on a mix of old and new techniques . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church 's new golden cross about a third of the new frauenkirche building is made from the old , dark-colored stones that were left in the ruins .
the rest are new , light colored sandstones .
together they create a kind of mosaic of past and present .
the golden cross atop the church 's dome was even created by the son of an english pilot who dropped bombs on dresden in 1945 .
and of course , there is a new organ . a global project the total cost of the project came to 180 million euros -lrb- $ 218 million -rrb- . german historian arnulf baring , who as a boy witnessed the bombing in dresden , said he believes the project was worth the enormous cost and said it showed that germans could find elements of their past of which they can be proud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recreated frescoes inside the church " the frauenkirche was more than a church , it was a symbol of the downfall of a city , " baring told der spiegel magazine .
" i think it is a good thing that germans , wherever possible , regain part of their old cities , so they know that we come from somewhere . " and ludwig güttler , the chairman of the society to promote the reconstruction of the frauenkirche , said many nations had played a part in helping to restore the church to its former glory .

the " red devils " are floundering towards the bottom of the league but the german-born turk has big plans . kaiserslautern managed to advance another round this week in the german cup .
they did it with a hard-fought 4-2 away victory on tuesday against third division side erfurt .
yet the win did nothing to relieve the pressure on coach michael henke .
in the bundesliga , lautern are just a point away from the relegation zone .
dissension inside the team and from outside -lrb- the fans -rrb- is reaching a fevered pitch . after the cup match on tuesday , henke railed against the erfurt squad by calling them " scheiss-ossis , " or " crap easterners " for not kicking the ball out of bounds towards the end of the game when a lautern player lay injured on the ground . it was indicative of the heat that henke and the team have been feeling over the past few weeks as they counted one disappointing match after another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesliga goalkeepers have been at the mercy of kaiserslautern 's halil altintop -lrb- l -rrb- this season one lautern player , forward halil altintop , has been spared the misery - at least directly .
while his teammates in back , the defenders , resemble more a sieve than a solid wall by giving up 25 goals so far , altintop has alone tallied 10 strikes , sharing the top slot in the bundesliga with bremen 's miroslav klose . " whoever allows that many goals in ten games should have nothing to do with this league , " was altintop 's reaction after last week 's 4-1 shellacking by mönchengladbach . dangerous strikers desired everywhere the fans are resorting to anything and everything to express their frustration with the club that over the past few years has been making a steady , plunge to the bottom of the standings . the joy of the 1997-98 title with coach otto rehhagel at the helm is long just a dream .
two weeks ago , the hard-core supporters vented their frustration by entering the stadium five minutes after the starting whistle - and were promptly penalized when they entered the fritz walter stadium as dortmund went out on top in the seventh minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twin brother hamit altintop -lrb- r -rrb- has found a spot on the turkish national squad it would be the game , though , that manager 's heads in the league turned to the small city in the far west of germany .
altintop would equal dortmund 's ebi smolarek 's hat trick with one of his own to preserve at least one point for kaiserslautern . all of a sudden , halil altintop was a hot commodity .
one club in particular would be a natural for the 22-year-old turk who was born in gelsenkirchen - schalke .
his twin brother hamit already plays for the " royal blues , " so it would hardly be a surprise if halil returned to his hometown . " since i 've been with lautern , there has always been speculation about schalke , " he told sport-bild magazine .
one thing is certain , altintop , who plays on the turkish national squad and whose contract expires in june 2006 , will leave kaiserslautern at the end of the season .
lautern president rene c. jäggi understands altintop 's desire to depart the crisis-riddled club . " he definitely wants to play in international competition and he could make much more money with any top european club , " jäggi said . aspirations for turkey also while the speculation is still swirling around altintop , he not only is eyeing just whom he might play for in the bundesliga .
he wants to secure himself a spot with the turkish national team that is still fighting to qualify for the world cup in germany and believes that only when he is playing against the top clubs in europe will he have a chance of wearing turkish red on the pitch and not just on the bench . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the life of a striker is not easy as altintop -lrb- l -rrb- finds out against dortmund " a coach simply prefers a player who plays for a top club , " he said in sport-bild after seeing no action in the country 's world cup qualifiers in september despite an impressive start in the bundesliga .
" you have to play against teams like inter milan . " england 's wayne rooney found that out at everton and moved to manchester united .
that wo n't be possible for altintop if he stays at kaiserslautern .
just as the " red devils " announced that it left the red and entered the black by making a small profit in the 2004-05 business year , they will have to find a replacement for the striker who could give the club a going-away president by shooting enough goals to keep lautern in the top division . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chelsea 's robert huth singing the blues robert huth must be asking himself what happened .

one thing is certain , altintop , who plays on the turkish national squad and whose contract expires in june 2006 , will leave kaiserslautern at the end of the season .
lautern president rene c. jäggi understands altintop 's desire to depart the crisis-riddled club . " he definitely wants to play in international competition and he could make much more money with any top european club , " jäggi said . aspirations for turkey also while the speculation is still swirling around altintop , he not only is eyeing just whom he might play for in the bundesliga .
he wants to secure himself a spot with the turkish national team that is still fighting to qualify for the world cup in germany and believes that only when he is playing against the top clubs in europe will he have a chance of wearing turkish red on the pitch and not just on the bench . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the life of a striker is not easy as altintop -lrb- l -rrb- finds out against dortmund " a coach simply prefers a player who plays for a top club , " he said in sport-bild after seeing no action in the country 's world cup qualifiers in september despite an impressive start in the bundesliga .
" you have to play against teams like inter milan . " england 's wayne rooney found that out at everton and moved to manchester united .
that wo n't be possible for altintop if he stays at kaiserslautern .
just as the " red devils " announced that it left the red and entered the black by making a small profit in the 2004-05 business year , they will have to find a replacement for the striker who could give the club a going-away president by shooting enough goals to keep lautern in the top division . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chelsea 's robert huth singing the blues robert huth must be asking himself what happened .

together with the german soccer federation , a new initiative has been kicked off to get the ball rolling . " we have five million jobless people in germany - the dfb -lrb- german soccer federation -rrb- must n't close its eyes to such a development , " said dfb managing director theo zwanziger when he , along with federal labor agency -lrb- ba -rrb- board member heinrich alt , kicked off a job initiative that is supposed to help up to 100,000 unemployed find work through next year 's world cup . it 's a mantra that has been reiterated time and again before any large sporting or cultural spectacle .
when a country or city competes for large international events such as the olympics , the soccer world cup , or the world 's fair , not only is the sole attraction of the happening a selling point .
frequently , politicians and big business promise huge bonuses for the location : tourists with money to spend , improved infrastructure - and jobs . next year 's world cup in germany is no different .
matches will be played in 12 cities and the grounds where they will take place must be top notch .
new stadiums have been built , older ones renovated .
the construction industry has capitalized and will continue to do so .
next june and july , some one million spectators must be fed and housed bringing big benefits to the hotel and gastronomy industry . hotline for potential employers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo zwanziger -lrb- l -rrb- of the dfb and heirnich alt from the employment agency talk jobs and world cup in the face of germany 's gloomy economic perspective , particularly on the job market , the labor agency and business groups do n't want the world 's largest sporting event to be just a one-time thing .
so , under the title " an employment affair - the fastest way to the right employer , " the project aims for between 50,000 to 100,000 jobs to be created .
the labor agency has established a telephone hotline in frankfurt to take calls from employers who are looking for workers in the run-up to the tournament .
within 48 hours of an employer 's call to the ba , the agency is supposed to provide a list of possible job candidates . companies from world cup cities are already taking advantage of the hotline .
an event organizer in leipzig needs 400 workers .
in hamburg , a temporary job agency has announced positions for 20 cooks .
a security service in kaiserslautern is looking for 500 guards . long-term perspectives for a few what i hear from the chambers of industry and commerce in frankfurt , they predict 1,000 jobs with long-term perspectives , " said alt .
" if i take that and multiply if by 12 for each world cup city , that 's 12,000 new jobs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction of stadiums , here the allianz arena , has provided work for thousands in germany for those 12,000 , that 's a piece of good news .
and it wo n't only be lower paying jobs such as kitchen help , janitorial duties or security services .
also experts for it services or even translators will be sought after .
and if the work should not result in a full-time position , nearly everyone has been quick to mention the positive aspects of the short-term engagement . " even if many receive just temporary contracts , many will get their foot in the door of a company through the world cup , " said katja hartmann , a spokeswoman for manpower , one of the world 's largest private employment agencies . dfb president zwanziger said that the sport of soccer and its players must not close their eyes to the plight of those going through difficult times caused by unemployment .
because of the world cup , many will find work , if for just the short or middle term , but even that would be a success and give " a number of people a little more reason to hope .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.10.2005 airbus a380 deliveries run into rough weather großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 touched down in frankfurt amid thick fog the airbus a380 made a flawless test landing in germany saturday .
despite its success , the european aircraft maker wo n't be delivering the gigantic planes on time to its buyers .
experts say it wo n't dent airbus ' image . it was an event few aviation fans were willing to miss .
as a prototype of the gigantic a380 , the world 's largest passenger airliner , swooped down from the skies to make a perfect landing at the frankfurt airport on saturday morning amid thick fog , tens of thousands of spectators held their breath in awe . while some clambered on stools they had brought along to get a good look at the 290-ton heavy machine coming to a halt at terminal 2 of the rhein-main airport , others held their cameras and mobile phones above their heads to capture the image . it was the first test landing of the long-haul aircraft outside the testing facilities in france and the main aim is to check the handling and maintenance of the a380 at a civil airport .
the aircraft will fly back to toulouse in france on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 is the world 's largest passenger plane it 's exactly a year since the a380 , designed to carry up to 853 passengers , took to the skies for the first time .
since its maiden flight on april 27 , the aircraft has undergone 110 test flights , clocking 380 flying hours , said tore prang , a spokesman of airbus . " the test results are excellent .
the performance is much better than expected , " he said , adding that it also held true for the craft 's fuel-consumption - at 2.9 liters of kerosene for 100 kilometers per passenger . the low consumption - 12 percent lower than all other large aircraft according to airbus - is an important selling point given that fuel usage now accounts for around 16 to 20 percent of the overall costs of an airline . delivery marred by delays until now , 16 customers have placed orders for 159 a380s which cost 292 million euros -lrb- $ 353 million -rrb- apiece .
the gulf-based airline emirates is the biggest buyer with 41 orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 final assembly line near toulouse but , what 's annoyed many is the fact that the european aircraft manufacturer has delayed the delivery of the airplanes .
thus , singapore airlines , which wanted to get the first of its 10 ordered airplanes by march , now has to wait longer . " the a380 will fly for 30 years - it 's not just a big deal if the planes begin flying in the first or the second half of the year , " said prang .
the amount of compensation that airbus has to shell out for its waiting customers , remains under wraps . the delivery is now scheduled to begin in december 2006 provided there are no further hiccups . one of the biggest hurdles is reportedly evacuating passengers from the plane .
according to international regulations , in the case of an emergency , 873 passengers must be able to leave the aircraft in the dark within 90 seconds by using slides . airbus however insists there are no more hitches on that front . " i 'm confident that there wo n't be any problems there , " said tore prang .
but , airbus has delayed tests for far and an evacuation check is now slated for feb 2006 . " encouraging start " however , some say that teething problems are normal when it comes to mammoth projects . it 's not unusual that there are delays , according to ulrich horstmann , aviation analyst at the bayerische landesbank .
horstmann predicted that the a380 would have a shining future .
he added that the 159 orders were an encouraging start given that many airlines only develop new jets after they prove their value on the market . " airbus can rake in returns due to its monopoly because there are n't any other aircraft in that class and boeing ca n't give a befitting reply , " said horstmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german lufthansa boeing 747 takes off at the frankfurt airport the american rival is developing a larger version of the 1969-created jumbo jet in the form of its 747 advanced , which with 450 seats can carry 50 more passengers . " but the 747 is perceived as an old aircraft , " according to horstmann . the americans however have a different strategy .
instead of concentrating on a new giant aircraft , boeing is expending its energies on developing the 787 , a long-haul aircraft with 250 seats .
in future , flexible direct flights will play a greater role than has been the case until now , is the american thinking .
at the same time , the market for large aircraft is too small to make a new development - which cost 13 billion euros in the case of the a380 - profitable . airbus catches up however airbus spokesman prang does n't buy the argument . " all airports which have growth problems have welcomed the arrival of the a380 , " prang said .
london 's heathrow airport for instance could then reach 10 million extra passengers by 2016 thanks to the a380 without having to organize more take-offs and landings , he pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus believes air passenger numbers worldwide will treble and , in the coming years , the worldwide air passenger figures would rise threefold , having an effect on all class segments , prang added . " boeing only has one strategy , we have both , " he said , pointing towards the planned a340 long-haul aircraft for around 300 passengers .
airbus is currently developing the a350 , an aircraft in the same class as boeing 's 787 .
it 's expected to hit the market by 2010 . " airbus has got lots of things right , " said aviation expert horstmann .
" just 10 years ago , it was the small player , which boeing did n't take seriously enough .
but , in the meantime it has convincing offers in all segments of civil aviation . " when it came to aircrafts with a seating capacity of more than 100 , boeing and aircraft manufacturer mcdonnell-douglas which boeing took over had a market share of 70 percent until the mid-1990s .
but now with over 50 percent of the market share , airbus is leading the way . horstmann does n't believe that the balance will tip sharply . " a two-way share of the pie is closer to a monopoly than one thinks , " he said .

despite its success , the european aircraft maker wo n't be delivering the gigantic planes on time to its buyers .
experts say it wo n't dent airbus ' image . it was an event few aviation fans were willing to miss .
as a prototype of the gigantic a380 , the world 's largest passenger airliner , swooped down from the skies to make a perfect landing at the frankfurt airport on saturday morning amid thick fog , tens of thousands of spectators held their breath in awe . while some clambered on stools they had brought along to get a good look at the 290-ton heavy machine coming to a halt at terminal 2 of the rhein-main airport , others held their cameras and mobile phones above their heads to capture the image . it was the first test landing of the long-haul aircraft outside the testing facilities in france and the main aim is to check the handling and maintenance of the a380 at a civil airport .
the aircraft will fly back to toulouse in france on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 is the world 's largest passenger plane it 's exactly a year since the a380 , designed to carry up to 853 passengers , took to the skies for the first time .
since its maiden flight on april 27 , the aircraft has undergone 110 test flights , clocking 380 flying hours , said tore prang , a spokesman of airbus . " the test results are excellent .
the performance is much better than expected , " he said , adding that it also held true for the craft 's fuel-consumption - at 2.9 liters of kerosene for 100 kilometers per passenger . the low consumption - 12 percent lower than all other large aircraft according to airbus - is an important selling point given that fuel usage now accounts for around 16 to 20 percent of the overall costs of an airline . delivery marred by delays until now , 16 customers have placed orders for 159 a380s which cost 292 million euros -lrb- $ 353 million -rrb- apiece .
the gulf-based airline emirates is the biggest buyer with 41 orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 final assembly line near toulouse but , what 's annoyed many is the fact that the european aircraft manufacturer has delayed the delivery of the airplanes .
thus , singapore airlines , which wanted to get the first of its 10 ordered airplanes by march , now has to wait longer . " the a380 will fly for 30 years - it 's not just a big deal if the planes begin flying in the first or the second half of the year , " said prang .
the amount of compensation that airbus has to shell out for its waiting customers , remains under wraps . the delivery is now scheduled to begin in december 2006 provided there are no further hiccups . one of the biggest hurdles is reportedly evacuating passengers from the plane .
according to international regulations , in the case of an emergency , 873 passengers must be able to leave the aircraft in the dark within 90 seconds by using slides . airbus however insists there are no more hitches on that front . " i 'm confident that there wo n't be any problems there , " said tore prang .
but , airbus has delayed tests for far and an evacuation check is now slated for feb 2006 . " encouraging start " however , some say that teething problems are normal when it comes to mammoth projects . it 's not unusual that there are delays , according to ulrich horstmann , aviation analyst at the bayerische landesbank .
horstmann predicted that the a380 would have a shining future .
he added that the 159 orders were an encouraging start given that many airlines only develop new jets after they prove their value on the market . " airbus can rake in returns due to its monopoly because there are n't any other aircraft in that class and boeing ca n't give a befitting reply , " said horstmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german lufthansa boeing 747 takes off at the frankfurt airport the american rival is developing a larger version of the 1969-created jumbo jet in the form of its 747 advanced , which with 450 seats can carry 50 more passengers . " but the 747 is perceived as an old aircraft , " according to horstmann . the americans however have a different strategy .
instead of concentrating on a new giant aircraft , boeing is expending its energies on developing the 787 , a long-haul aircraft with 250 seats .
in future , flexible direct flights will play a greater role than has been the case until now , is the american thinking .
at the same time , the market for large aircraft is too small to make a new development - which cost 13 billion euros in the case of the a380 - profitable . airbus catches up however airbus spokesman prang does n't buy the argument . " all airports which have growth problems have welcomed the arrival of the a380 , " prang said .
london 's heathrow airport for instance could then reach 10 million extra passengers by 2016 thanks to the a380 without having to organize more take-offs and landings , he pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus believes air passenger numbers worldwide will treble and , in the coming years , the worldwide air passenger figures would rise threefold , having an effect on all class segments , prang added . " boeing only has one strategy , we have both , " he said , pointing towards the planned a340 long-haul aircraft for around 300 passengers .
airbus is currently developing the a350 , an aircraft in the same class as boeing 's 787 .
it 's expected to hit the market by 2010 . " airbus has got lots of things right , " said aviation expert horstmann .
" just 10 years ago , it was the small player , which boeing did n't take seriously enough .
but , in the meantime it has convincing offers in all segments of civil aviation . " when it came to aircrafts with a seating capacity of more than 100 , boeing and aircraft manufacturer mcdonnell-douglas which boeing took over had a market share of 70 percent until the mid-1990s .
but now with over 50 percent of the market share , airbus is leading the way . horstmann does n't believe that the balance will tip sharply . " a two-way share of the pie is closer to a monopoly than one thinks , " he said . " they -lrb- airbus and boeing -rrb- may lower prices in individual instances , but they wo n't be in a cut-throat competition .

from hate and evil a community of reconciliation can grow , which makes peace possible . " german president horst köhler acknowledged in his speech that many critics had suggested before the project began that the money would have been better spent on rebuilding the broken-down former east germany .
" did eastern germany not need roads , roofs and factories more than an expensive church ?
but a group of residents said dresden needed more .
and now we can see that those people were right , " köhler said .
the baroque church stood for decades as a decapitated , empty shell .
but that changed in 1990 when a group of people began gathering funds to rebuild it .
now , after a decade of reconstruction , the frauenkirche stands once again in its full splendor , with sunday 's consecration ceremony officially reopening the church to the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche in ruins in 1945 people from around the world are visiting dresden for the festivities . outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder and his designated successor , angela merkel are there . britain , which led the bombing raids , has contributed more than one million euros in donations towards the reconstruction and the duke of kent , who is patron of the fundraising dresden trust , is attending sunday 's ceremony to represent the british royal family . the tens of thousands of spectators at sunday 's consecration can marvel at a golden cross and orb donated by the english city of coventry , which itself was flattened by german bombing during world war ii . the " sto n e bell " retur n s dresdeners themselves are particularly elated that their frauenkirche is finally opening its doors for protestant services following its restoration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church was rebuilt according to original plans until 1945 , the " stone bell " atop the frauenkirche lent the dresden skyline its distinctive silhouette .
ilse walter remembers when the church was bombed by british and american forces during world war ii . " spring was almost in the air on feb .
13 , 1945 , " she said .
" i remember it vividly .
i was sitting in the living room with my family listening to the radio .
they were playing relatively happy , light music when suddenly , right in the middle of the song , we heard the air raid sirens . " what ki n d of memorial ? what followed was one of the most destructive of all allied attacks , with tens of thousands losing their lives .
the city , dubbed " florence on the elbe " for its baroque splendor , was practically wiped out .
from a military perspective , no one even knows why the city was targeted .
the end of the war was already in sight , dresden had no garrisons , and its industry was outside city borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche -lrb- left -rrb- is now part of dresden 's skyline again but destroyed it was and with it , dresden 's frauenkirche .
as the city was being rebuilt in the following decades , the church remained in shambles - a skeletal reference to an ugly past . many dresden citizens felt it should stay that way - a necessary reminder of war 's destruction .
but for others , the dilapidated frauenkirche was an eyesore .
it was time to move on , they believed .
not forget , but progress . a merger of past a n d prese n t in the end , those in favor of rebuilding the frauenkirche won .
yet the restored church 's architectural design reflects only part of the baroque style from the 1700s , when the original frauenkirche was built . " we had to delve into the baroque and middle ages and study how the stones were laid back then , " said eberhard burger , the reconstruction director .
" we have done that the same way now , but we 've used better materials .
so the reconstructed building is based on a mix of old and new techniques . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church 's new golden cross about a third of the new frauenkirche building is made from the old , dark-colored stones that were left in the ruins .
the rest are new , light colored sandstones .
together they create a kind of mosaic of past and present .
the golden cross atop the church 's dome was even created by the son of an english pilot who dropped bombs on dresden in 1945 .
and of course , there is a new organ . a global project the total cost of the project came to 180 million euros -lrb- $ 218 million -rrb- . german historian arnulf baring , who as a boy witnessed the bombing in dresden , said he believes the project was worth the enormous cost and said it showed that germans could find elements of their past of which they can be proud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recreated frescoes inside the church " the frauenkirche was more than a church , it was a symbol of the downfall of a city , " baring told der spiegel magazine .
" i think it is a good thing that germans , wherever possible , regain part of their old cities , so they know that we come from somewhere . " and ludwig güttler , the chairman of the society to promote the reconstruction of the frauenkirche , said many nations had played a part in helping to restore the church to its former glory .

" german president horst köhler acknowledged in his speech that many critics had suggested before the project began that the money would have been better spent on rebuilding the broken-down former east germany .
" did eastern germany not need roads , roofs and factories more than an expensive church ?
but a group of residents said dresden needed more .
and now we can see that those people were right , " köhler said .
the baroque church stood for decades as a decapitated , empty shell .
but that changed in 1990 when a group of people began gathering funds to rebuild it .
now , after a decade of reconstruction , the frauenkirche stands once again in its full splendor , with sunday 's consecration ceremony officially reopening the church to the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche in ruins in 1945 people from around the world are visiting dresden for the festivities . outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder and his designated successor , angela merkel are there . britain , which led the bombing raids , has contributed more than one million euros in donations towards the reconstruction and the duke of kent , who is patron of the fundraising dresden trust , is attending sunday 's ceremony to represent the british royal family . the tens of thousands of spectators at sunday 's consecration can marvel at a golden cross and orb donated by the english city of coventry , which itself was flattened by german bombing during world war ii . the " sto n e bell " retur n s dresdeners themselves are particularly elated that their frauenkirche is finally opening its doors for protestant services following its restoration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church was rebuilt according to original plans until 1945 , the " stone bell " atop the frauenkirche lent the dresden skyline its distinctive silhouette .

together with the german soccer federation , a new initiative has been kicked off to get the ball rolling . " we have five million jobless people in germany - the dfb -lrb- german soccer federation -rrb- must n't close its eyes to such a development , " said dfb managing director theo zwanziger when he , along with federal labor agency -lrb- ba -rrb- board member heinrich alt , kicked off a job initiative that is supposed to help up to 100,000 unemployed find work through next year 's world cup . it 's a mantra that has been reiterated time and again before any large sporting or cultural spectacle .
when a country or city competes for large international events such as the olympics , the soccer world cup , or the world 's fair , not only is the sole attraction of the happening a selling point .
frequently , politicians and big business promise huge bonuses for the location : tourists with money to spend , improved infrastructure - and jobs . next year 's world cup in germany is no different .
matches will be played in 12 cities and the grounds where they will take place must be top notch .
new stadiums have been built , older ones renovated .
the construction industry has capitalized and will continue to do so .
next june and july , some one million spectators must be fed and housed bringing big benefits to the hotel and gastronomy industry . hotline for potential employers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo zwanziger -lrb- l -rrb- of the dfb and heirnich alt from the employment agency talk jobs and world cup in the face of germany 's gloomy economic perspective , particularly on the job market , the labor agency and business groups do n't want the world 's largest sporting event to be just a one-time thing .
so , under the title " an employment affair - the fastest way to the right employer , " the project aims for between 50,000 to 100,000 jobs to be created .
the labor agency has established a telephone hotline in frankfurt to take calls from employers who are looking for workers in the run-up to the tournament .
within 48 hours of an employer 's call to the ba , the agency is supposed to provide a list of possible job candidates . companies from world cup cities are already taking advantage of the hotline .
an event organizer in leipzig needs 400 workers .
in hamburg , a temporary job agency has announced positions for 20 cooks .
a security service in kaiserslautern is looking for 500 guards . long-term perspectives for a few what i hear from the chambers of industry and commerce in frankfurt , they predict 1,000 jobs with long-term perspectives , " said alt .
" if i take that and multiply if by 12 for each world cup city , that 's 12,000 new jobs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction of stadiums , here the allianz arena , has provided work for thousands in germany for those 12,000 , that 's a piece of good news .
and it wo n't only be lower paying jobs such as kitchen help , janitorial duties or security services .
also experts for it services or even translators will be sought after .
and if the work should not result in a full-time position , nearly everyone has been quick to mention the positive aspects of the short-term engagement . " even if many receive just temporary contracts , many will get their foot in the door of a company through the world cup , " said katja hartmann , a spokeswoman for manpower , one of the world 's largest private employment agencies . dfb president zwanziger said that the sport of soccer and its players must not close their eyes to the plight of those going through difficult times caused by unemployment .
because of the world cup , many will find work , if for just the short or middle term , but even that would be a success and give " a number of people a little more reason to hope .

the " red devils " are floundering towards the bottom of the league but the german-born turk has big plans . kaiserslautern managed to advance another round this week in the german cup .
they did it with a hard-fought 4-2 away victory on tuesday against third division side erfurt .
yet the win did nothing to relieve the pressure on coach michael henke .
in the bundesliga , lautern are just a point away from the relegation zone .
dissension inside the team and from outside -lrb- the fans -rrb- is reaching a fevered pitch . after the cup match on tuesday , henke railed against the erfurt squad by calling them " scheiss-ossis , " or " crap easterners " for not kicking the ball out of bounds towards the end of the game when a lautern player lay injured on the ground . it was indicative of the heat that henke and the team have been feeling over the past few weeks as they counted one disappointing match after another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesliga goalkeepers have been at the mercy of kaiserslautern 's halil altintop -lrb- l -rrb- this season one lautern player , forward halil altintop , has been spared the misery - at least directly .
while his teammates in back , the defenders , resemble more a sieve than a solid wall by giving up 25 goals so far , altintop has alone tallied 10 strikes , sharing the top slot in the bundesliga with bremen 's miroslav klose . " whoever allows that many goals in ten games should have nothing to do with this league , " was altintop 's reaction after last week 's 4-1 shellacking by mönchengladbach . dangerous strikers desired everywhere the fans are resorting to anything and everything to express their frustration with the club that over the past few years has been making a steady , plunge to the bottom of the standings . the joy of the 1997-98 title with coach otto rehhagel at the helm is long just a dream .
two weeks ago , the hard-core supporters vented their frustration by entering the stadium five minutes after the starting whistle - and were promptly penalized when they entered the fritz walter stadium as dortmund went out on top in the seventh minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twin brother hamit altintop -lrb- r -rrb- has found a spot on the turkish national squad it would be the game , though , that manager 's heads in the league turned to the small city in the far west of germany .
altintop would equal dortmund 's ebi smolarek 's hat trick with one of his own to preserve at least one point for kaiserslautern . all of a sudden , halil altintop was a hot commodity .
one club in particular would be a natural for the 22-year-old turk who was born in gelsenkirchen - schalke .
his twin brother hamit already plays for the " royal blues , " so it would hardly be a surprise if halil returned to his hometown . " since i 've been with lautern , there has always been speculation about schalke , " he told sport-bild magazine .
one thing is certain , altintop , who plays on the turkish national squad and whose contract expires in june 2006 , will leave kaiserslautern at the end of the season .
lautern president rene c. jäggi understands altintop 's desire to depart the crisis-riddled club . " he definitely wants to play in international competition and he could make much more money with any top european club , " jäggi said . aspirations for turkey also while the speculation is still swirling around altintop , he not only is eyeing just whom he might play for in the bundesliga .
he wants to secure himself a spot with the turkish national team that is still fighting to qualify for the world cup in germany and believes that only when he is playing against the top clubs in europe will he have a chance of wearing turkish red on the pitch and not just on the bench . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the life of a striker is not easy as altintop -lrb- l -rrb- finds out against dortmund " a coach simply prefers a player who plays for a top club , " he said in sport-bild after seeing no action in the country 's world cup qualifiers in september despite an impressive start in the bundesliga .
" you have to play against teams like inter milan . " england 's wayne rooney found that out at everton and moved to manchester united .
that wo n't be possible for altintop if he stays at kaiserslautern .
just as the " red devils " announced that it left the red and entered the black by making a small profit in the 2004-05 business year , they will have to find a replacement for the striker who could give the club a going-away president by shooting enough goals to keep lautern in the top division . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chelsea 's robert huth singing the blues robert huth must be asking himself what happened .

from hate and evil a community of reconciliation can grow , which makes peace possible . " german president horst köhler acknowledged in his speech that many critics had suggested before the project began that the money would have been better spent on rebuilding the broken-down former east germany .
" did eastern germany not need roads , roofs and factories more than an expensive church ?
but a group of residents said dresden needed more .
and now we can see that those people were right , " köhler said .
the baroque church stood for decades as a decapitated , empty shell .
but that changed in 1990 when a group of people began gathering funds to rebuild it .
now , after a decade of reconstruction , the frauenkirche stands once again in its full splendor , with sunday 's consecration ceremony officially reopening the church to the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche in ruins in 1945 people from around the world are visiting dresden for the festivities . outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder and his designated successor , angela merkel are there . britain , which led the bombing raids , has contributed more than one million euros in donations towards the reconstruction and the duke of kent , who is patron of the fundraising dresden trust , is attending sunday 's ceremony to represent the british royal family . the tens of thousands of spectators at sunday 's consecration can marvel at a golden cross and orb donated by the english city of coventry , which itself was flattened by german bombing during world war ii . the " sto n e bell " retur n s dresdeners themselves are particularly elated that their frauenkirche is finally opening its doors for protestant services following its restoration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church was rebuilt according to original plans until 1945 , the " stone bell " atop the frauenkirche lent the dresden skyline its distinctive silhouette .
ilse walter remembers when the church was bombed by british and american forces during world war ii . " spring was almost in the air on feb .
13 , 1945 , " she said .
" i remember it vividly .
i was sitting in the living room with my family listening to the radio .
they were playing relatively happy , light music when suddenly , right in the middle of the song , we heard the air raid sirens . " what ki n d of memorial ? what followed was one of the most destructive of all allied attacks , with tens of thousands losing their lives .
the city , dubbed " florence on the elbe " for its baroque splendor , was practically wiped out .
from a military perspective , no one even knows why the city was targeted .
the end of the war was already in sight , dresden had no garrisons , and its industry was outside city borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche -lrb- left -rrb- is now part of dresden 's skyline again but destroyed it was and with it , dresden 's frauenkirche .
as the city was being rebuilt in the following decades , the church remained in shambles - a skeletal reference to an ugly past . many dresden citizens felt it should stay that way - a necessary reminder of war 's destruction .
but for others , the dilapidated frauenkirche was an eyesore .
it was time to move on , they believed .
not forget , but progress . a merger of past a n d prese n t in the end , those in favor of rebuilding the frauenkirche won .
yet the restored church 's architectural design reflects only part of the baroque style from the 1700s , when the original frauenkirche was built . " we had to delve into the baroque and middle ages and study how the stones were laid back then , " said eberhard burger , the reconstruction director .
" we have done that the same way now , but we 've used better materials .
so the reconstructed building is based on a mix of old and new techniques . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church 's new golden cross about a third of the new frauenkirche building is made from the old , dark-colored stones that were left in the ruins .
the rest are new , light colored sandstones .
together they create a kind of mosaic of past and present .
the golden cross atop the church 's dome was even created by the son of an english pilot who dropped bombs on dresden in 1945 .
and of course , there is a new organ . a global project the total cost of the project came to 180 million euros -lrb- $ 218 million -rrb- . german historian arnulf baring , who as a boy witnessed the bombing in dresden , said he believes the project was worth the enormous cost and said it showed that germans could find elements of their past of which they can be proud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recreated frescoes inside the church " the frauenkirche was more than a church , it was a symbol of the downfall of a city , " baring told der spiegel magazine .
" i think it is a good thing that germans , wherever possible , regain part of their old cities , so they know that we come from somewhere . " and ludwig güttler , the chairman of the society to promote the reconstruction of the frauenkirche , said many nations had played a part in helping to restore the church to its former glory . " i am enormously grateful , " he told afp news service .
" not just for the donations , which have just kept coming , but for the level of interest shown by other countries .
so many people can say that this project is theirs - whether they be britons , americans , danes , poles or whatever else .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.10.2005 airbus a380 deliveries run into rough weather großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 touched down in frankfurt amid thick fog the airbus a380 made a flawless test landing in germany saturday .
despite its success , the european aircraft maker wo n't be delivering the gigantic planes on time to its buyers .
experts say it wo n't dent airbus ' image . it was an event few aviation fans were willing to miss .
as a prototype of the gigantic a380 , the world 's largest passenger airliner , swooped down from the skies to make a perfect landing at the frankfurt airport on saturday morning amid thick fog , tens of thousands of spectators held their breath in awe . while some clambered on stools they had brought along to get a good look at the 290-ton heavy machine coming to a halt at terminal 2 of the rhein-main airport , others held their cameras and mobile phones above their heads to capture the image . it was the first test landing of the long-haul aircraft outside the testing facilities in france and the main aim is to check the handling and maintenance of the a380 at a civil airport .
the aircraft will fly back to toulouse in france on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 is the world 's largest passenger plane it 's exactly a year since the a380 , designed to carry up to 853 passengers , took to the skies for the first time .
since its maiden flight on april 27 , the aircraft has undergone 110 test flights , clocking 380 flying hours , said tore prang , a spokesman of airbus . " the test results are excellent .
the performance is much better than expected , " he said , adding that it also held true for the craft 's fuel-consumption - at 2.9 liters of kerosene for 100 kilometers per passenger . the low consumption - 12 percent lower than all other large aircraft according to airbus - is an important selling point given that fuel usage now accounts for around 16 to 20 percent of the overall costs of an airline . delivery marred by delays until now , 16 customers have placed orders for 159 a380s which cost 292 million euros -lrb- $ 353 million -rrb- apiece .
the gulf-based airline emirates is the biggest buyer with 41 orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 final assembly line near toulouse but , what 's annoyed many is the fact that the european aircraft manufacturer has delayed the delivery of the airplanes .
thus , singapore airlines , which wanted to get the first of its 10 ordered airplanes by march , now has to wait longer . " the a380 will fly for 30 years - it 's not just a big deal if the planes begin flying in the first or the second half of the year , " said prang .
the amount of compensation that airbus has to shell out for its waiting customers , remains under wraps . the delivery is now scheduled to begin in december 2006 provided there are no further hiccups . one of the biggest hurdles is reportedly evacuating passengers from the plane .
according to international regulations , in the case of an emergency , 873 passengers must be able to leave the aircraft in the dark within 90 seconds by using slides . airbus however insists there are no more hitches on that front . " i 'm confident that there wo n't be any problems there , " said tore prang .
but , airbus has delayed tests for far and an evacuation check is now slated for feb 2006 . " encouraging start " however , some say that teething problems are normal when it comes to mammoth projects . it 's not unusual that there are delays , according to ulrich horstmann , aviation analyst at the bayerische landesbank .
horstmann predicted that the a380 would have a shining future .
he added that the 159 orders were an encouraging start given that many airlines only develop new jets after they prove their value on the market . " airbus can rake in returns due to its monopoly because there are n't any other aircraft in that class and boeing ca n't give a befitting reply , " said horstmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german lufthansa boeing 747 takes off at the frankfurt airport the american rival is developing a larger version of the 1969-created jumbo jet in the form of its 747 advanced , which with 450 seats can carry 50 more passengers . " but the 747 is perceived as an old aircraft , " according to horstmann . the americans however have a different strategy .
instead of concentrating on a new giant aircraft , boeing is expending its energies on developing the 787 , a long-haul aircraft with 250 seats .
in future , flexible direct flights will play a greater role than has been the case until now , is the american thinking .
at the same time , the market for large aircraft is too small to make a new development - which cost 13 billion euros in the case of the a380 - profitable . airbus catches up however airbus spokesman prang does n't buy the argument . " all airports which have growth problems have welcomed the arrival of the a380 , " prang said .
london 's heathrow airport for instance could then reach 10 million extra passengers by 2016 thanks to the a380 without having to organize more take-offs and landings , he pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus believes air passenger numbers worldwide will treble and , in the coming years , the worldwide air passenger figures would rise threefold , having an effect on all class segments , prang added . " boeing only has one strategy , we have both , " he said , pointing towards the planned a340 long-haul aircraft for around 300 passengers .
airbus is currently developing the a350 , an aircraft in the same class as boeing 's 787 .
it 's expected to hit the market by 2010 . " airbus has got lots of things right , " said aviation expert horstmann .
" just 10 years ago , it was the small player , which boeing did n't take seriously enough .
but , in the meantime it has convincing offers in all segments of civil aviation . " when it came to aircrafts with a seating capacity of more than 100 , boeing and aircraft manufacturer mcdonnell-douglas which boeing took over had a market share of 70 percent until the mid-1990s .
but now with over 50 percent of the market share , airbus is leading the way . horstmann does n't believe that the balance will tip sharply . " a two-way share of the pie is closer to a monopoly than one thinks , " he said . " they -lrb- airbus and boeing -rrb- may lower prices in individual instances , but they wo n't be in a cut-throat competition .

the company said on friday that it already mentioned the case in one of its previous quarterly reports and that it rejected any further public comments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is one of the prime accused the siemens group is said to have paid about 1.6 million dollars in bribes to saddam in support of deals involving power plant turbines . siemens representatives says the company wouldn ’ t make any comment at this point in time and have called the report " premature and unjustified .

" we have documents supporting our allegations , " he said .
" they are available to everyone and clearly document all traces we ’ ve found .
i ’ m convinced our report provides enough evidence for legal proceedings against the firms to start immediately .

they should now be wondering , he argued , how the system could have been circumvented by individual staff members . he also urged german prosecutors to start a full investigation into the cases of bribery . " german laws against bribery are sufficient and appropriate , " he said .
" they just need to be fully applied .
it is now a question of resources in the justice system and enough public pressure to start a full legal proceedings .
i hope we ’ ll see that happening very soon . " smaller fish should n't go unpunished elzholtz also expressed the hope that prosecutors wouldn ’ t just focus on the two high-profile cases involving daimlerchrysler and siemens . the huge number of smaller companies that had given kickbacks to the saddam regime shouldn ’ t go unpunished , he said . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans accused of bribery in un corruption scandal siemens and daimlerchrysler are among the more than 2,000 companies from 66 countries that paid kickbacks to saddam hussein 's government , according to an independent report on the un 's oil-for-food program .

bremen and hamburg also win as the top trio in the league is beginning to pull away . a five-game winning streak has done much to dampen the spirits of cologne 's fans but it did n't stop 50,000 of them from streaming to the rhein energie stadium to see their side face bayern munich .
the crowd fired their club on to a strong first-half performance that was highlighted by matthias scherz ' third season goal and a 1-0 lead .
but they filed out of the grounds disappointed as bayern defender lucio and midfielder michael ballack scored second-half goals to give munich the victory . the loss heightens the crisis in cologne as coach uwe rapolder has to wonder what can be done to gather the club 's first victory since a 2-1 defeat of mönchengladbach on september 17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich coach felix magath waves his arms in disbelief but his side would win 2-1 in cologne it was not to be against a less than satisfactory performance from bayern in the eyes their coach felix magath .
that 's why it 's good to have international performers like lucio and ballack who can turn around even a bleak game . " we can be happy about a lucky victory , " commented magath dryly . it came about with some help from the referee whose decisions affected the game 's outcome .
ballack 's gamewinning head ball goal came in the 74th minute off a corner kick wrongly awarded to the league-leaders .
then in the waning moments , cologne were denied a penalty kick as lucio apparently used his hands to deflect the ball in the penalty box .
as magath said , it was a lucky victory . bremen overcome weak start to win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen 's miroslav klose clinches his fists in joy over his 11th strike of the season werder bremen remain two points behind munich in the standings after a clear 4-1 win over guests frankfurt .
the central germans came into bremen with a convincing 6-3 thrashing of cologne under their belts .
the excellent effort continued and coach friedhelm funkel 's team proved they could play with the best of them when ioannis amanatidis put them up 1-0 in the 19th minute . after that though , thomas schaaf 's bremen took control of the game .
international midfielder torsten frings knotted up the game with a head ball in the 29th minute and the score was 1-1 at half .
tim borowski scored twice and miroslav klose also found the net for his league-leading 11th goal although it was preceded by a hand ball . " after the go-ahead goal in the second half we could n't keep up with bremen .
it was a deserved victory for werder , " admitted funkel . third-place hamburg also kept pace with the best , and in the process handed schalke their first loss of the season .
defender mehdi mahdavikia scored the lone goal in the 19th minute in a roughly-played match in which referee fandel handed out five yellow cards and sent off schalke stopper christian poulsen for two bookings .
the " royal blues " now are a massive ten points behind bayern as this campaign is taking on the appearance of a three-horse race . gladbach series halted the biggest surprise in this young season has been borussia mönchengladbach .
they lost to their namesakes from dortmund 2-1 .
gladbach were never really in this match as the homeside borussia dortmund dictated play most of the game .
nevertheless , gladbach remain in fifth-place , even on points with schalke and berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a common sight : stuttgart 's goalkeeper dirk heinen watches the ball rolling over the goalline hertha berlin benefited from the schalke and gladbach losses in the most entertaining match on saturday , drawing 3-3 with stuttgart .
the guests from berlin led 1-0 after one half and then the fireworks began as the lead changed hand two times .
colorful berlin midfielder marchelinho has found his form again , having scored once and assisting on the other two goals .
stuttgart coach giovanni trapattoni 's side never surrendered though .

the crowd fired their club on to a strong first-half performance that was highlighted by matthias scherz ' third season goal and a 1-0 lead .

ballack 's gamewinning head ball goal came in the 74th minute off a corner kick wrongly awarded to the league-leaders .

international midfielder torsten frings knotted up the game with a head ball in the 29th minute and the score was 1-1 at half .
tim borowski scored twice and miroslav klose also found the net for his league-leading 11th goal although it was preceded by a hand ball . " after the go-ahead goal in the second half we could n't keep up with bremen .
it was a deserved victory for werder , " admitted funkel . third-place hamburg also kept pace with the best , and in the process handed schalke their first loss of the season .
defender mehdi mahdavikia scored the lone goal in the 19th minute in a roughly-played match in which referee fandel handed out five yellow cards and sent off schalke stopper christian poulsen for two bookings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.10.2005 airbus a380 deliveries run into rough weather großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 touched down in frankfurt amid thick fog the airbus a380 made a flawless test landing in germany saturday .
despite its success , the european aircraft maker wo n't be delivering the gigantic planes on time to its buyers .
experts say it wo n't dent airbus ' image . it was an event few aviation fans were willing to miss .
as a prototype of the gigantic a380 , the world 's largest passenger airliner , swooped down from the skies to make a perfect landing at the frankfurt airport on saturday morning amid thick fog , tens of thousands of spectators held their breath in awe . while some clambered on stools they had brought along to get a good look at the 290-ton heavy machine coming to a halt at terminal 2 of the rhein-main airport , others held their cameras and mobile phones above their heads to capture the image . it was the first test landing of the long-haul aircraft outside the testing facilities in france and the main aim is to check the handling and maintenance of the a380 at a civil airport .
the aircraft will fly back to toulouse in france on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 is the world 's largest passenger plane it 's exactly a year since the a380 , designed to carry up to 853 passengers , took to the skies for the first time .
since its maiden flight on april 27 , the aircraft has undergone 110 test flights , clocking 380 flying hours , said tore prang , a spokesman of airbus . " the test results are excellent .
the performance is much better than expected , " he said , adding that it also held true for the craft 's fuel-consumption - at 2.9 liters of kerosene for 100 kilometers per passenger . the low consumption - 12 percent lower than all other large aircraft according to airbus - is an important selling point given that fuel usage now accounts for around 16 to 20 percent of the overall costs of an airline . delivery marred by delays until now , 16 customers have placed orders for 159 a380s which cost 292 million euros -lrb- $ 353 million -rrb- apiece .
the gulf-based airline emirates is the biggest buyer with 41 orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 final assembly line near toulouse but , what 's annoyed many is the fact that the european aircraft manufacturer has delayed the delivery of the airplanes .
thus , singapore airlines , which wanted to get the first of its 10 ordered airplanes by march , now has to wait longer . " the a380 will fly for 30 years - it 's not just a big deal if the planes begin flying in the first or the second half of the year , " said prang .
the amount of compensation that airbus has to shell out for its waiting customers , remains under wraps . the delivery is now scheduled to begin in december 2006 provided there are no further hiccups . one of the biggest hurdles is reportedly evacuating passengers from the plane .
according to international regulations , in the case of an emergency , 873 passengers must be able to leave the aircraft in the dark within 90 seconds by using slides . airbus however insists there are no more hitches on that front . " i 'm confident that there wo n't be any problems there , " said tore prang .
but , airbus has delayed tests for far and an evacuation check is now slated for feb 2006 . " encouraging start " however , some say that teething problems are normal when it comes to mammoth projects . it 's not unusual that there are delays , according to ulrich horstmann , aviation analyst at the bayerische landesbank .
horstmann predicted that the a380 would have a shining future .
he added that the 159 orders were an encouraging start given that many airlines only develop new jets after they prove their value on the market . " airbus can rake in returns due to its monopoly because there are n't any other aircraft in that class and boeing ca n't give a befitting reply , " said horstmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german lufthansa boeing 747 takes off at the frankfurt airport the american rival is developing a larger version of the 1969-created jumbo jet in the form of its 747 advanced , which with 450 seats can carry 50 more passengers . " but the 747 is perceived as an old aircraft , " according to horstmann . the americans however have a different strategy .
instead of concentrating on a new giant aircraft , boeing is expending its energies on developing the 787 , a long-haul aircraft with 250 seats .
in future , flexible direct flights will play a greater role than has been the case until now , is the american thinking .
at the same time , the market for large aircraft is too small to make a new development - which cost 13 billion euros in the case of the a380 - profitable . airbus catches up however airbus spokesman prang does n't buy the argument . " all airports which have growth problems have welcomed the arrival of the a380 , " prang said .
london 's heathrow airport for instance could then reach 10 million extra passengers by 2016 thanks to the a380 without having to organize more take-offs and landings , he pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus believes air passenger numbers worldwide will treble and , in the coming years , the worldwide air passenger figures would rise threefold , having an effect on all class segments , prang added . " boeing only has one strategy , we have both , " he said , pointing towards the planned a340 long-haul aircraft for around 300 passengers .
airbus is currently developing the a350 , an aircraft in the same class as boeing 's 787 .
it 's expected to hit the market by 2010 . " airbus has got lots of things right , " said aviation expert horstmann .
" just 10 years ago , it was the small player , which boeing did n't take seriously enough .
but , in the meantime it has convincing offers in all segments of civil aviation . " when it came to aircrafts with a seating capacity of more than 100 , boeing and aircraft manufacturer mcdonnell-douglas which boeing took over had a market share of 70 percent until the mid-1990s .
but now with over 50 percent of the market share , airbus is leading the way . horstmann does n't believe that the balance will tip sharply . " a two-way share of the pie is closer to a monopoly than one thinks , " he said . " they -lrb- airbus and boeing -rrb- may lower prices in individual instances , but they wo n't be in a cut-throat competition .

despite its success , the european aircraft maker wo n't be delivering the gigantic planes on time to its buyers .
experts say it wo n't dent airbus ' image . it was an event few aviation fans were willing to miss .
as a prototype of the gigantic a380 , the world 's largest passenger airliner , swooped down from the skies to make a perfect landing at the frankfurt airport on saturday morning amid thick fog , tens of thousands of spectators held their breath in awe . while some clambered on stools they had brought along to get a good look at the 290-ton heavy machine coming to a halt at terminal 2 of the rhein-main airport , others held their cameras and mobile phones above their heads to capture the image . it was the first test landing of the long-haul aircraft outside the testing facilities in france and the main aim is to check the handling and maintenance of the a380 at a civil airport .
the aircraft will fly back to toulouse in france on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 is the world 's largest passenger plane it 's exactly a year since the a380 , designed to carry up to 853 passengers , took to the skies for the first time .
since its maiden flight on april 27 , the aircraft has undergone 110 test flights , clocking 380 flying hours , said tore prang , a spokesman of airbus . " the test results are excellent .
the performance is much better than expected , " he said , adding that it also held true for the craft 's fuel-consumption - at 2.9 liters of kerosene for 100 kilometers per passenger . the low consumption - 12 percent lower than all other large aircraft according to airbus - is an important selling point given that fuel usage now accounts for around 16 to 20 percent of the overall costs of an airline . delivery marred by delays until now , 16 customers have placed orders for 159 a380s which cost 292 million euros -lrb- $ 353 million -rrb- apiece .
the gulf-based airline emirates is the biggest buyer with 41 orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 final assembly line near toulouse but , what 's annoyed many is the fact that the european aircraft manufacturer has delayed the delivery of the airplanes .
thus , singapore airlines , which wanted to get the first of its 10 ordered airplanes by march , now has to wait longer . " the a380 will fly for 30 years - it 's not just a big deal if the planes begin flying in the first or the second half of the year , " said prang .
the amount of compensation that airbus has to shell out for its waiting customers , remains under wraps . the delivery is now scheduled to begin in december 2006 provided there are no further hiccups . one of the biggest hurdles is reportedly evacuating passengers from the plane .
according to international regulations , in the case of an emergency , 873 passengers must be able to leave the aircraft in the dark within 90 seconds by using slides . airbus however insists there are no more hitches on that front . " i 'm confident that there wo n't be any problems there , " said tore prang .
but , airbus has delayed tests for far and an evacuation check is now slated for feb 2006 . " encouraging start " however , some say that teething problems are normal when it comes to mammoth projects . it 's not unusual that there are delays , according to ulrich horstmann , aviation analyst at the bayerische landesbank .
horstmann predicted that the a380 would have a shining future .
he added that the 159 orders were an encouraging start given that many airlines only develop new jets after they prove their value on the market . " airbus can rake in returns due to its monopoly because there are n't any other aircraft in that class and boeing ca n't give a befitting reply , " said horstmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german lufthansa boeing 747 takes off at the frankfurt airport the american rival is developing a larger version of the 1969-created jumbo jet in the form of its 747 advanced , which with 450 seats can carry 50 more passengers . " but the 747 is perceived as an old aircraft , " according to horstmann . the americans however have a different strategy .
instead of concentrating on a new giant aircraft , boeing is expending its energies on developing the 787 , a long-haul aircraft with 250 seats .
in future , flexible direct flights will play a greater role than has been the case until now , is the american thinking .
at the same time , the market for large aircraft is too small to make a new development - which cost 13 billion euros in the case of the a380 - profitable . airbus catches up however airbus spokesman prang does n't buy the argument . " all airports which have growth problems have welcomed the arrival of the a380 , " prang said .
london 's heathrow airport for instance could then reach 10 million extra passengers by 2016 thanks to the a380 without having to organize more take-offs and landings , he pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus believes air passenger numbers worldwide will treble and , in the coming years , the worldwide air passenger figures would rise threefold , having an effect on all class segments , prang added . " boeing only has one strategy , we have both , " he said , pointing towards the planned a340 long-haul aircraft for around 300 passengers .
airbus is currently developing the a350 , an aircraft in the same class as boeing 's 787 .
it 's expected to hit the market by 2010 . " airbus has got lots of things right , " said aviation expert horstmann .
" just 10 years ago , it was the small player , which boeing did n't take seriously enough .
but , in the meantime it has convincing offers in all segments of civil aviation . " when it came to aircrafts with a seating capacity of more than 100 , boeing and aircraft manufacturer mcdonnell-douglas which boeing took over had a market share of 70 percent until the mid-1990s .
but now with over 50 percent of the market share , airbus is leading the way . horstmann does n't believe that the balance will tip sharply . " a two-way share of the pie is closer to a monopoly than one thinks , " he said . " they -lrb- airbus and boeing -rrb- may lower prices in individual instances , but they wo n't be in a cut-throat competition .

the company said on friday that it already mentioned the case in one of its previous quarterly reports and that it rejected any further public comments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is one of the prime accused the siemens group is said to have paid about 1.6 million dollars in bribes to saddam in support of deals involving power plant turbines . siemens representatives says the company wouldn ’ t make any comment at this point in time and have called the report " premature and unjustified . " fresh debate about business ethics but , mark pieth , an investigator on the volcker panel , argued that investigators found clear evidence into the wrongdoings of german companies . " we have documents supporting our allegations , " he said .
" they are available to everyone and clearly document all traces we ’ ve found .
i ’ m convinced our report provides enough evidence for legal proceedings against the firms to start immediately . " paul volcker ’ s findings have unleashed a fresh debate about business ethics in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : business corruption in germany has long been a cause of worry for transparency international hans jürgen elzholtz , from the corruption watchdog transparency international , said the two corporations had adopted anti-corruption strategies long ago .
they should now be wondering , he argued , how the system could have been circumvented by individual staff members . he also urged german prosecutors to start a full investigation into the cases of bribery . " german laws against bribery are sufficient and appropriate , " he said .
" they just need to be fully applied .
it is now a question of resources in the justice system and enough public pressure to start a full legal proceedings .

some 200 university students from more than 20 universities in 12 countries participated in the project under the esa 's initiative . the satellite is about the size of a standard washing machine and weighs about 62 kilograms . from the drawing board to the launch pad , the project took just 18 months with students relying on the internet as their principal means of exchanging data .
the esa provided the entire funding . " they -lrb- the satellites -rrb- are all in what we called a polar orbit , little below some 700 kilometers above our head so to speak and they have a number of technology experiments on board , " said heidi graff , a spokeswoman for esa .
" they are also testing a special new kind of solar cell , which is better in quality than the standard used to be , they will have a camera on board to try to take observation pictures and they have certain equipment on board with which they will communicate with radio amateurs all over the world , " graff added . hands-on training but even more than the technology , the uniqueness of the project lies in the fact that the entire undertaking was completed by the students themselves . the sseti , which provided the framework for the mission , was launched by esa ’ s education department in 2000 to get european students involved in real space missions , and well as give them practical hands-on experience and encourage them to take up careers in space technology and science . " it 's all done and built by the students themselves .
we more or less only financed the technical check out to make it qualify to go for launch .
it is the students who really have to get the credit , " said graff . one of the students , jürgen schlutz from the university of stuttgart who is one of 15 students studying aerospace engineering in the project propulsion team , said the hands-on training had been valuable . " we are all students of engineering but it 's a pretty much a theoretical approach , we did n't do much in the way of hardware -lrb- until now -rrb- , " schlutz said . " what we learned in the project was actually to build - what comes extra is all the involvement in the project itself , in project management , the work with student teams all over europe , the technical aspect and intercultural co-operation was something that was very valuable for team members , " he added . mark caldwell -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european aerospace aims for the moon leading german aerospace companies have urged the creation of an unmanned european space station on the moon , warning that europe could otherwise lose out to other nations in the race for space exploration and research .

the " red devils " are floundering towards the bottom of the league but the german-born turk has big plans . kaiserslautern managed to advance another round this week in the german cup .
they did it with a hard-fought 4-2 away victory on tuesday against third division side erfurt .
yet the win did nothing to relieve the pressure on coach michael henke .
in the bundesliga , lautern are just a point away from the relegation zone .
dissension inside the team and from outside -lrb- the fans -rrb- is reaching a fevered pitch . after the cup match on tuesday , henke railed against the erfurt squad by calling them " scheiss-ossis , " or " crap easterners " for not kicking the ball out of bounds towards the end of the game when a lautern player lay injured on the ground . it was indicative of the heat that henke and the team have been feeling over the past few weeks as they counted one disappointing match after another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesliga goalkeepers have been at the mercy of kaiserslautern 's halil altintop -lrb- l -rrb- this season one lautern player , forward halil altintop , has been spared the misery - at least directly .
while his teammates in back , the defenders , resemble more a sieve than a solid wall by giving up 25 goals so far , altintop has alone tallied 10 strikes , sharing the top slot in the bundesliga with bremen 's miroslav klose . " whoever allows that many goals in ten games should have nothing to do with this league , " was altintop 's reaction after last week 's 4-1 shellacking by mönchengladbach . dangerous strikers desired everywhere the fans are resorting to anything and everything to express their frustration with the club that over the past few years has been making a steady , plunge to the bottom of the standings . the joy of the 1997-98 title with coach otto rehhagel at the helm is long just a dream .
two weeks ago , the hard-core supporters vented their frustration by entering the stadium five minutes after the starting whistle - and were promptly penalized when they entered the fritz walter stadium as dortmund went out on top in the seventh minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twin brother hamit altintop -lrb- r -rrb- has found a spot on the turkish national squad it would be the game , though , that manager 's heads in the league turned to the small city in the far west of germany .
altintop would equal dortmund 's ebi smolarek 's hat trick with one of his own to preserve at least one point for kaiserslautern . all of a sudden , halil altintop was a hot commodity .
one club in particular would be a natural for the 22-year-old turk who was born in gelsenkirchen - schalke .
his twin brother hamit already plays for the " royal blues , " so it would hardly be a surprise if halil returned to his hometown . " since i 've been with lautern , there has always been speculation about schalke , " he told sport-bild magazine .
one thing is certain , altintop , who plays on the turkish national squad and whose contract expires in june 2006 , will leave kaiserslautern at the end of the season .
lautern president rene c. jäggi understands altintop 's desire to depart the crisis-riddled club . " he definitely wants to play in international competition and he could make much more money with any top european club , " jäggi said . aspirations for turkey also while the speculation is still swirling around altintop , he not only is eyeing just whom he might play for in the bundesliga .
he wants to secure himself a spot with the turkish national team that is still fighting to qualify for the world cup in germany and believes that only when he is playing against the top clubs in europe will he have a chance of wearing turkish red on the pitch and not just on the bench . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the life of a striker is not easy as altintop -lrb- l -rrb- finds out against dortmund " a coach simply prefers a player who plays for a top club , " he said in sport-bild after seeing no action in the country 's world cup qualifiers in september despite an impressive start in the bundesliga .
" you have to play against teams like inter milan . " england 's wayne rooney found that out at everton and moved to manchester united .
that wo n't be possible for altintop if he stays at kaiserslautern .
just as the " red devils " announced that it left the red and entered the black by making a small profit in the 2004-05 business year , they will have to find a replacement for the striker who could give the club a going-away president by shooting enough goals to keep lautern in the top division . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chelsea 's robert huth singing the blues robert huth must be asking himself what happened .
once seen as a key element in the reinvigoration of the national team , the fast-moving train has derailed .
his chances of playing for germany are sinking rapidly .

from hate and evil a community of reconciliation can grow , which makes peace possible . " german president horst köhler acknowledged in his speech that many critics had suggested before the project began that the money would have been better spent on rebuilding the broken-down former east germany .
" did eastern germany not need roads , roofs and factories more than an expensive church ?
but a group of residents said dresden needed more .
and now we can see that those people were right , " köhler said .
the baroque church stood for decades as a decapitated , empty shell .
but that changed in 1990 when a group of people began gathering funds to rebuild it .
now , after a decade of reconstruction , the frauenkirche stands once again in its full splendor , with sunday 's consecration ceremony officially reopening the church to the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche in ruins in 1945 people from around the world are visiting dresden for the festivities . outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder and his designated successor , angela merkel are there . britain , which led the bombing raids , has contributed more than one million euros in donations towards the reconstruction and the duke of kent , who is patron of the fundraising dresden trust , is attending sunday 's ceremony to represent the british royal family . the tens of thousands of spectators at sunday 's consecration can marvel at a golden cross and orb donated by the english city of coventry , which itself was flattened by german bombing during world war ii . the " sto n e bell " retur n s dresdeners themselves are particularly elated that their frauenkirche is finally opening its doors for protestant services following its restoration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church was rebuilt according to original plans until 1945 , the " stone bell " atop the frauenkirche lent the dresden skyline its distinctive silhouette .
ilse walter remembers when the church was bombed by british and american forces during world war ii . " spring was almost in the air on feb .
13 , 1945 , " she said .
" i remember it vividly .
i was sitting in the living room with my family listening to the radio .
they were playing relatively happy , light music when suddenly , right in the middle of the song , we heard the air raid sirens . " what ki n d of memorial ? what followed was one of the most destructive of all allied attacks , with tens of thousands losing their lives .
the city , dubbed " florence on the elbe " for its baroque splendor , was practically wiped out .
from a military perspective , no one even knows why the city was targeted .
the end of the war was already in sight , dresden had no garrisons , and its industry was outside city borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche -lrb- left -rrb- is now part of dresden 's skyline again but destroyed it was and with it , dresden 's frauenkirche .
as the city was being rebuilt in the following decades , the church remained in shambles - a skeletal reference to an ugly past . many dresden citizens felt it should stay that way - a necessary reminder of war 's destruction .
but for others , the dilapidated frauenkirche was an eyesore .
it was time to move on , they believed .
not forget , but progress . a merger of past a n d prese n t in the end , those in favor of rebuilding the frauenkirche won .
yet the restored church 's architectural design reflects only part of the baroque style from the 1700s , when the original frauenkirche was built . " we had to delve into the baroque and middle ages and study how the stones were laid back then , " said eberhard burger , the reconstruction director .
" we have done that the same way now , but we 've used better materials .
so the reconstructed building is based on a mix of old and new techniques . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church 's new golden cross about a third of the new frauenkirche building is made from the old , dark-colored stones that were left in the ruins .
the rest are new , light colored sandstones .

the golden cross atop the church 's dome was even created by the son of an english pilot who dropped bombs on dresden in 1945 .
and of course , there is a new organ . a global project the total cost of the project came to 180 million euros -lrb- $ 218 million -rrb- . german historian arnulf baring , who as a boy witnessed the bombing in dresden , said he believes the project was worth the enormous cost and said it showed that germans could find elements of their past of which they can be proud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recreated frescoes inside the church " the frauenkirche was more than a church , it was a symbol of the downfall of a city , " baring told der spiegel magazine .
" i think it is a good thing that germans , wherever possible , regain part of their old cities , so they know that we come from somewhere . " and ludwig güttler , the chairman of the society to promote the reconstruction of the frauenkirche , said many nations had played a part in helping to restore the church to its former glory . " i am enormously grateful , " he told afp news service .
" not just for the donations , which have just kept coming , but for the level of interest shown by other countries .
so many people can say that this project is theirs - whether they be britons , americans , danes , poles or whatever else .

bremen and hamburg also win as the top trio in the league is beginning to pull away . a five-game winning streak has done much to dampen the spirits of cologne 's fans but it did n't stop 50,000 of them from streaming to the rhein energie stadium to see their side face bayern munich .
the crowd fired their club on to a strong first-half performance that was highlighted by matthias scherz ' third season goal and a 1-0 lead .
but they filed out of the grounds disappointed as bayern defender lucio and midfielder michael ballack scored second-half goals to give munich the victory . the loss heightens the crisis in cologne as coach uwe rapolder has to wonder what can be done to gather the club 's first victory since a 2-1 defeat of mönchengladbach on september 17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich coach felix magath waves his arms in disbelief but his side would win 2-1 in cologne it was not to be against a less than satisfactory performance from bayern in the eyes their coach felix magath .
that 's why it 's good to have international performers like lucio and ballack who can turn around even a bleak game . " we can be happy about a lucky victory , " commented magath dryly . it came about with some help from the referee whose decisions affected the game 's outcome .
ballack 's gamewinning head ball goal came in the 74th minute off a corner kick wrongly awarded to the league-leaders .
then in the waning moments , cologne were denied a penalty kick as lucio apparently used his hands to deflect the ball in the penalty box .
as magath said , it was a lucky victory . bremen overcome weak start to win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen 's miroslav klose clinches his fists in joy over his 11th strike of the season werder bremen remain two points behind munich in the standings after a clear 4-1 win over guests frankfurt .
the central germans came into bremen with a convincing 6-3 thrashing of cologne under their belts .
the excellent effort continued and coach friedhelm funkel 's team proved they could play with the best of them when ioannis amanatidis put them up 1-0 in the 19th minute . after that though , thomas schaaf 's bremen took control of the game .
international midfielder torsten frings knotted up the game with a head ball in the 29th minute and the score was 1-1 at half .
tim borowski scored twice and miroslav klose also found the net for his league-leading 11th goal although it was preceded by a hand ball . " after the go-ahead goal in the second half we could n't keep up with bremen .
it was a deserved victory for werder , " admitted funkel . third-place hamburg also kept pace with the best , and in the process handed schalke their first loss of the season .
defender mehdi mahdavikia scored the lone goal in the 19th minute in a roughly-played match in which referee fandel handed out five yellow cards and sent off schalke stopper christian poulsen for two bookings .
the " royal blues " now are a massive ten points behind bayern as this campaign is taking on the appearance of a three-horse race . gladbach series halted the biggest surprise in this young season has been borussia mönchengladbach .
they lost to their namesakes from dortmund 2-1 .
gladbach were never really in this match as the homeside borussia dortmund dictated play most of the game .
nevertheless , gladbach remain in fifth-place , even on points with schalke and berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a common sight : stuttgart 's goalkeeper dirk heinen watches the ball rolling over the goalline hertha berlin benefited from the schalke and gladbach losses in the most entertaining match on saturday , drawing 3-3 with stuttgart .
the guests from berlin led 1-0 after one half and then the fireworks began as the lead changed hand two times .
colorful berlin midfielder marchelinho has found his form again , having scored once and assisting on the other two goals .
stuttgart coach giovanni trapattoni 's side never surrendered though .
mario gomez got the equalizer with seven minutes remaining to save the italian coach who has had to listen to loads of rumors about his release this past week for the next match against nuremberg . henke also given a reprieve just like in stuttgart , kaiserslautern 's coach michael henke has been suffering under his squad 's sub-par performance .
he made the right decision as his team was behind 2-1 in the 87th minute by bringing on rarely-used turkish striker berkant götkan .
the 25-year old scored just three minutes later for a 2-2 final . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there , there , everything 's just fine , " would seem to be lautern coach michael henke 's -lrb- l -rrb- reaction " i 'm very disappointed , " said leverkusen coach michael skibbe who has yet to win in three matches with the club .
" that so many of our players were pushing up front -lrb- at the end -rrb- was completely unnecessary . " wolfsburg had gone through a tough three weeks .
coach holger fach 's side had come away with four hard-earned points against bayern munich , hamburg and schalke .
the game against duisburg was a well-deserved break but they underestimated the " zebras " who scored their second victory of the season , and even escaped the relegation zone with a 2-0 win that was hardly threatened by the toothless wolves . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wanted : a better team for altintop kaiserslautern 's halil altintop together with bremen 's miroslav klose , tops the bundesliga in goalscoring .

despite its success , the european aircraft maker wo n't be delivering the gigantic planes on time to its buyers .
experts say it wo n't dent airbus ' image . it was an event few aviation fans were willing to miss .
as a prototype of the gigantic a380 , the world 's largest passenger airliner , swooped down from the skies to make a perfect landing at the frankfurt airport on saturday morning amid thick fog , tens of thousands of spectators held their breath in awe . while some clambered on stools they had brought along to get a good look at the 290-ton heavy machine coming to a halt at terminal 2 of the rhein-main airport , others held their cameras and mobile phones above their heads to capture the image . it was the first test landing of the long-haul aircraft outside the testing facilities in france and the main aim is to check the handling and maintenance of the a380 at a civil airport .
the aircraft will fly back to toulouse in france on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 is the world 's largest passenger plane it 's exactly a year since the a380 , designed to carry up to 853 passengers , took to the skies for the first time .
since its maiden flight on april 27 , the aircraft has undergone 110 test flights , clocking 380 flying hours , said tore prang , a spokesman of airbus . " the test results are excellent .
the performance is much better than expected , " he said , adding that it also held true for the craft 's fuel-consumption - at 2.9 liters of kerosene for 100 kilometers per passenger . the low consumption - 12 percent lower than all other large aircraft according to airbus - is an important selling point given that fuel usage now accounts for around 16 to 20 percent of the overall costs of an airline . delivery marred by delays until now , 16 customers have placed orders for 159 a380s which cost 292 million euros -lrb- $ 353 million -rrb- apiece .
the gulf-based airline emirates is the biggest buyer with 41 orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 final assembly line near toulouse but , what 's annoyed many is the fact that the european aircraft manufacturer has delayed the delivery of the airplanes .
thus , singapore airlines , which wanted to get the first of its 10 ordered airplanes by march , now has to wait longer . " the a380 will fly for 30 years - it 's not just a big deal if the planes begin flying in the first or the second half of the year , " said prang .
the amount of compensation that airbus has to shell out for its waiting customers , remains under wraps . the delivery is now scheduled to begin in december 2006 provided there are no further hiccups . one of the biggest hurdles is reportedly evacuating passengers from the plane .
according to international regulations , in the case of an emergency , 873 passengers must be able to leave the aircraft in the dark within 90 seconds by using slides . airbus however insists there are no more hitches on that front . " i 'm confident that there wo n't be any problems there , " said tore prang .
but , airbus has delayed tests for far and an evacuation check is now slated for feb 2006 . " encouraging start " however , some say that teething problems are normal when it comes to mammoth projects . it 's not unusual that there are delays , according to ulrich horstmann , aviation analyst at the bayerische landesbank .
horstmann predicted that the a380 would have a shining future .
he added that the 159 orders were an encouraging start given that many airlines only develop new jets after they prove their value on the market . " airbus can rake in returns due to its monopoly because there are n't any other aircraft in that class and boeing ca n't give a befitting reply , " said horstmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german lufthansa boeing 747 takes off at the frankfurt airport the american rival is developing a larger version of the 1969-created jumbo jet in the form of its 747 advanced , which with 450 seats can carry 50 more passengers . " but the 747 is perceived as an old aircraft , " according to horstmann . the americans however have a different strategy .
instead of concentrating on a new giant aircraft , boeing is expending its energies on developing the 787 , a long-haul aircraft with 250 seats .
in future , flexible direct flights will play a greater role than has been the case until now , is the american thinking .
at the same time , the market for large aircraft is too small to make a new development - which cost 13 billion euros in the case of the a380 - profitable . airbus catches up however airbus spokesman prang does n't buy the argument . " all airports which have growth problems have welcomed the arrival of the a380 , " prang said .
london 's heathrow airport for instance could then reach 10 million extra passengers by 2016 thanks to the a380 without having to organize more take-offs and landings , he pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus believes air passenger numbers worldwide will treble and , in the coming years , the worldwide air passenger figures would rise threefold , having an effect on all class segments , prang added . " boeing only has one strategy , we have both , " he said , pointing towards the planned a340 long-haul aircraft for around 300 passengers .
airbus is currently developing the a350 , an aircraft in the same class as boeing 's 787 .
it 's expected to hit the market by 2010 . " airbus has got lots of things right , " said aviation expert horstmann .
" just 10 years ago , it was the small player , which boeing did n't take seriously enough .
but , in the meantime it has convincing offers in all segments of civil aviation . " when it came to aircrafts with a seating capacity of more than 100 , boeing and aircraft manufacturer mcdonnell-douglas which boeing took over had a market share of 70 percent until the mid-1990s .
but now with over 50 percent of the market share , airbus is leading the way . horstmann does n't believe that the balance will tip sharply . " a two-way share of the pie is closer to a monopoly than one thinks , " he said . " they -lrb- airbus and boeing -rrb- may lower prices in individual instances , but they wo n't be in a cut-throat competition .

together with the german soccer federation , a new initiative has been kicked off to get the ball rolling . " we have five million jobless people in germany - the dfb -lrb- german soccer federation -rrb- must n't close its eyes to such a development , " said dfb managing director theo zwanziger when he , along with federal labor agency -lrb- ba -rrb- board member heinrich alt , kicked off a job initiative that is supposed to help up to 100,000 unemployed find work through next year 's world cup . it 's a mantra that has been reiterated time and again before any large sporting or cultural spectacle .
when a country or city competes for large international events such as the olympics , the soccer world cup , or the world 's fair , not only is the sole attraction of the happening a selling point .
frequently , politicians and big business promise huge bonuses for the location : tourists with money to spend , improved infrastructure - and jobs . next year 's world cup in germany is no different .
matches will be played in 12 cities and the grounds where they will take place must be top notch .
new stadiums have been built , older ones renovated .
the construction industry has capitalized and will continue to do so .
next june and july , some one million spectators must be fed and housed bringing big benefits to the hotel and gastronomy industry . hotline for potential employers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo zwanziger -lrb- l -rrb- of the dfb and heirnich alt from the employment agency talk jobs and world cup in the face of germany 's gloomy economic perspective , particularly on the job market , the labor agency and business groups do n't want the world 's largest sporting event to be just a one-time thing .
so , under the title " an employment affair - the fastest way to the right employer , " the project aims for between 50,000 to 100,000 jobs to be created .
the labor agency has established a telephone hotline in frankfurt to take calls from employers who are looking for workers in the run-up to the tournament .
within 48 hours of an employer 's call to the ba , the agency is supposed to provide a list of possible job candidates . companies from world cup cities are already taking advantage of the hotline .
an event organizer in leipzig needs 400 workers .
in hamburg , a temporary job agency has announced positions for 20 cooks .
a security service in kaiserslautern is looking for 500 guards . long-term perspectives for a few what i hear from the chambers of industry and commerce in frankfurt , they predict 1,000 jobs with long-term perspectives , " said alt .
" if i take that and multiply if by 12 for each world cup city , that 's 12,000 new jobs . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the construction of stadiums , here the allianz arena , has provided work for thousands in germany for those 12,000 , that 's a piece of good news .
and it wo n't only be lower paying jobs such as kitchen help , janitorial duties or security services .
also experts for it services or even translators will be sought after .
and if the work should not result in a full-time position , nearly everyone has been quick to mention the positive aspects of the short-term engagement . " even if many receive just temporary contracts , many will get their foot in the door of a company through the world cup , " said katja hartmann , a spokeswoman for manpower , one of the world 's largest private employment agencies . dfb president zwanziger said that the sport of soccer and its players must not close their eyes to the plight of those going through difficult times caused by unemployment .
because of the world cup , many will find work , if for just the short or middle term , but even that would be a success and give " a number of people a little more reason to hope .

the " red devils " are floundering towards the bottom of the league but the german-born turk has big plans . kaiserslautern managed to advance another round this week in the german cup .
they did it with a hard-fought 4-2 away victory on tuesday against third division side erfurt .
yet the win did nothing to relieve the pressure on coach michael henke .
in the bundesliga , lautern are just a point away from the relegation zone .
dissension inside the team and from outside -lrb- the fans -rrb- is reaching a fevered pitch . after the cup match on tuesday , henke railed against the erfurt squad by calling them " scheiss-ossis , " or " crap easterners " for not kicking the ball out of bounds towards the end of the game when a lautern player lay injured on the ground . it was indicative of the heat that henke and the team have been feeling over the past few weeks as they counted one disappointing match after another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesliga goalkeepers have been at the mercy of kaiserslautern 's halil altintop -lrb- l -rrb- this season one lautern player , forward halil altintop , has been spared the misery - at least directly .
while his teammates in back , the defenders , resemble more a sieve than a solid wall by giving up 25 goals so far , altintop has alone tallied 10 strikes , sharing the top slot in the bundesliga with bremen 's miroslav klose . " whoever allows that many goals in ten games should have nothing to do with this league , " was altintop 's reaction after last week 's 4-1 shellacking by mönchengladbach . dangerous strikers desired everywhere the fans are resorting to anything and everything to express their frustration with the club that over the past few years has been making a steady , plunge to the bottom of the standings . the joy of the 1997-98 title with coach otto rehhagel at the helm is long just a dream .
two weeks ago , the hard-core supporters vented their frustration by entering the stadium five minutes after the starting whistle - and were promptly penalized when they entered the fritz walter stadium as dortmund went out on top in the seventh minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twin brother hamit altintop -lrb- r -rrb- has found a spot on the turkish national squad it would be the game , though , that manager 's heads in the league turned to the small city in the far west of germany .
altintop would equal dortmund 's ebi smolarek 's hat trick with one of his own to preserve at least one point for kaiserslautern . all of a sudden , halil altintop was a hot commodity .
one club in particular would be a natural for the 22-year-old turk who was born in gelsenkirchen - schalke .
his twin brother hamit already plays for the " royal blues , " so it would hardly be a surprise if halil returned to his hometown . " since i 've been with lautern , there has always been speculation about schalke , " he told sport-bild magazine .
one thing is certain , altintop , who plays on the turkish national squad and whose contract expires in june 2006 , will leave kaiserslautern at the end of the season .
lautern president rene c. jäggi understands altintop 's desire to depart the crisis-riddled club . " he definitely wants to play in international competition and he could make much more money with any top european club , " jäggi said . aspirations for turkey also while the speculation is still swirling around altintop , he not only is eyeing just whom he might play for in the bundesliga .
he wants to secure himself a spot with the turkish national team that is still fighting to qualify for the world cup in germany and believes that only when he is playing against the top clubs in europe will he have a chance of wearing turkish red on the pitch and not just on the bench . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the life of a striker is not easy as altintop -lrb- l -rrb- finds out against dortmund " a coach simply prefers a player who plays for a top club , " he said in sport-bild after seeing no action in the country 's world cup qualifiers in september despite an impressive start in the bundesliga .
" you have to play against teams like inter milan . " england 's wayne rooney found that out at everton and moved to manchester united .
that wo n't be possible for altintop if he stays at kaiserslautern .
just as the " red devils " announced that it left the red and entered the black by making a small profit in the 2004-05 business year , they will have to find a replacement for the striker who could give the club a going-away president by shooting enough goals to keep lautern in the top division . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chelsea 's robert huth singing the blues robert huth must be asking himself what happened .

in the bundesliga , lautern are just a point away from the relegation zone .
dissension inside the team and from outside -lrb- the fans -rrb- is reaching a fevered pitch . after the cup match on tuesday , henke railed against the erfurt squad by calling them " scheiss-ossis , " or " crap easterners " for not kicking the ball out of bounds towards the end of the game when a lautern player lay injured on the ground . it was indicative of the heat that henke and the team have been feeling over the past few weeks as they counted one disappointing match after another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesliga goalkeepers have been at the mercy of kaiserslautern 's halil altintop -lrb- l -rrb- this season one lautern player , forward halil altintop , has been spared the misery - at least directly .
while his teammates in back , the defenders , resemble more a sieve than a solid wall by giving up 25 goals so far , altintop has alone tallied 10 strikes , sharing the top slot in the bundesliga with bremen 's miroslav klose . " whoever allows that many goals in ten games should have nothing to do with this league , " was altintop 's reaction after last week 's 4-1 shellacking by mönchengladbach . dangerous strikers desired everywhere the fans are resorting to anything and everything to express their frustration with the club that over the past few years has been making a steady , plunge to the bottom of the standings . the joy of the 1997-98 title with coach otto rehhagel at the helm is long just a dream .
two weeks ago , the hard-core supporters vented their frustration by entering the stadium five minutes after the starting whistle - and were promptly penalized when they entered the fritz walter stadium as dortmund went out on top in the seventh minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twin brother hamit altintop -lrb- r -rrb- has found a spot on the turkish national squad it would be the game , though , that manager 's heads in the league turned to the small city in the far west of germany .
altintop would equal dortmund 's ebi smolarek 's hat trick with one of his own to preserve at least one point for kaiserslautern . all of a sudden , halil altintop was a hot commodity .
one club in particular would be a natural for the 22-year-old turk who was born in gelsenkirchen - schalke .
his twin brother hamit already plays for the " royal blues , " so it would hardly be a surprise if halil returned to his hometown . " since i 've been with lautern , there has always been speculation about schalke , " he told sport-bild magazine .
one thing is certain , altintop , who plays on the turkish national squad and whose contract expires in june 2006 , will leave kaiserslautern at the end of the season .
lautern president rene c. jäggi understands altintop 's desire to depart the crisis-riddled club . " he definitely wants to play in international competition and he could make much more money with any top european club , " jäggi said . aspirations for turkey also while the speculation is still swirling around altintop , he not only is eyeing just whom he might play for in the bundesliga .
he wants to secure himself a spot with the turkish national team that is still fighting to qualify for the world cup in germany and believes that only when he is playing against the top clubs in europe will he have a chance of wearing turkish red on the pitch and not just on the bench . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the life of a striker is not easy as altintop -lrb- l -rrb- finds out against dortmund " a coach simply prefers a player who plays for a top club , " he said in sport-bild after seeing no action in the country 's world cup qualifiers in september despite an impressive start in the bundesliga .
" you have to play against teams like inter milan . " england 's wayne rooney found that out at everton and moved to manchester united .
that wo n't be possible for altintop if he stays at kaiserslautern .
just as the " red devils " announced that it left the red and entered the black by making a small profit in the 2004-05 business year , they will have to find a replacement for the striker who could give the club a going-away president by shooting enough goals to keep lautern in the top division . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chelsea 's robert huth singing the blues robert huth must be asking himself what happened .

the " red devils " are floundering towards the bottom of the league but the german-born turk has big plans . kaiserslautern managed to advance another round this week in the german cup .
they did it with a hard-fought 4-2 away victory on tuesday against third division side erfurt .
yet the win did nothing to relieve the pressure on coach michael henke .
in the bundesliga , lautern are just a point away from the relegation zone .
dissension inside the team and from outside -lrb- the fans -rrb- is reaching a fevered pitch . after the cup match on tuesday , henke railed against the erfurt squad by calling them " scheiss-ossis , " or " crap easterners " for not kicking the ball out of bounds towards the end of the game when a lautern player lay injured on the ground . it was indicative of the heat that henke and the team have been feeling over the past few weeks as they counted one disappointing match after another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesliga goalkeepers have been at the mercy of kaiserslautern 's halil altintop -lrb- l -rrb- this season one lautern player , forward halil altintop , has been spared the misery - at least directly .
while his teammates in back , the defenders , resemble more a sieve than a solid wall by giving up 25 goals so far , altintop has alone tallied 10 strikes , sharing the top slot in the bundesliga with bremen 's miroslav klose . " whoever allows that many goals in ten games should have nothing to do with this league , " was altintop 's reaction after last week 's 4-1 shellacking by mönchengladbach . dangerous strikers desired everywhere the fans are resorting to anything and everything to express their frustration with the club that over the past few years has been making a steady , plunge to the bottom of the standings . the joy of the 1997-98 title with coach otto rehhagel at the helm is long just a dream .
two weeks ago , the hard-core supporters vented their frustration by entering the stadium five minutes after the starting whistle - and were promptly penalized when they entered the fritz walter stadium as dortmund went out on top in the seventh minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twin brother hamit altintop -lrb- r -rrb- has found a spot on the turkish national squad it would be the game , though , that manager 's heads in the league turned to the small city in the far west of germany .
altintop would equal dortmund 's ebi smolarek 's hat trick with one of his own to preserve at least one point for kaiserslautern . all of a sudden , halil altintop was a hot commodity .
one club in particular would be a natural for the 22-year-old turk who was born in gelsenkirchen - schalke .
his twin brother hamit already plays for the " royal blues , " so it would hardly be a surprise if halil returned to his hometown . " since i 've been with lautern , there has always been speculation about schalke , " he told sport-bild magazine .
one thing is certain , altintop , who plays on the turkish national squad and whose contract expires in june 2006 , will leave kaiserslautern at the end of the season .
lautern president rene c. jäggi understands altintop 's desire to depart the crisis-riddled club . " he definitely wants to play in international competition and he could make much more money with any top european club , " jäggi said . aspirations for turkey also while the speculation is still swirling around altintop , he not only is eyeing just whom he might play for in the bundesliga .
he wants to secure himself a spot with the turkish national team that is still fighting to qualify for the world cup in germany and believes that only when he is playing against the top clubs in europe will he have a chance of wearing turkish red on the pitch and not just on the bench . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the life of a striker is not easy as altintop -lrb- l -rrb- finds out against dortmund " a coach simply prefers a player who plays for a top club , " he said in sport-bild after seeing no action in the country 's world cup qualifiers in september despite an impressive start in the bundesliga .
" you have to play against teams like inter milan . " england 's wayne rooney found that out at everton and moved to manchester united .
that wo n't be possible for altintop if he stays at kaiserslautern .
just as the " red devils " announced that it left the red and entered the black by making a small profit in the 2004-05 business year , they will have to find a replacement for the striker who could give the club a going-away president by shooting enough goals to keep lautern in the top division . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chelsea 's robert huth singing the blues robert huth must be asking himself what happened .

some 200 university students from more than 20 universities in 12 countries participated in the project under the esa 's initiative . the satellite is about the size of a standard washing machine and weighs about 62 kilograms . from the drawing board to the launch pad , the project took just 18 months with students relying on the internet as their principal means of exchanging data .
the esa provided the entire funding . " they -lrb- the satellites -rrb- are all in what we called a polar orbit , little below some 700 kilometers above our head so to speak and they have a number of technology experiments on board , " said heidi graff , a spokeswoman for esa .
" they are also testing a special new kind of solar cell , which is better in quality than the standard used to be , they will have a camera on board to try to take observation pictures and they have certain equipment on board with which they will communicate with radio amateurs all over the world , " graff added . hands-on training but even more than the technology , the uniqueness of the project lies in the fact that the entire undertaking was completed by the students themselves . the sseti , which provided the framework for the mission , was launched by esa ’ s education department in 2000 to get european students involved in real space missions , and well as give them practical hands-on experience and encourage them to take up careers in space technology and science . " it 's all done and built by the students themselves .
we more or less only financed the technical check out to make it qualify to go for launch .
it is the students who really have to get the credit , " said graff . one of the students , jürgen schlutz from the university of stuttgart who is one of 15 students studying aerospace engineering in the project propulsion team , said the hands-on training had been valuable . " we are all students of engineering but it 's a pretty much a theoretical approach , we did n't do much in the way of hardware -lrb- until now -rrb- , " schlutz said . " what we learned in the project was actually to build - what comes extra is all the involvement in the project itself , in project management , the work with student teams all over europe , the technical aspect and intercultural co-operation was something that was very valuable for team members , " he added . mark caldwell -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european aerospace aims for the moon leading german aerospace companies have urged the creation of an unmanned european space station on the moon , warning that europe could otherwise lose out to other nations in the race for space exploration and research .

the " red devils " are floundering towards the bottom of the league but the german-born turk has big plans . kaiserslautern managed to advance another round this week in the german cup .
they did it with a hard-fought 4-2 away victory on tuesday against third division side erfurt .
yet the win did nothing to relieve the pressure on coach michael henke .
in the bundesliga , lautern are just a point away from the relegation zone .
dissension inside the team and from outside -lrb- the fans -rrb- is reaching a fevered pitch . after the cup match on tuesday , henke railed against the erfurt squad by calling them " scheiss-ossis , " or " crap easterners " for not kicking the ball out of bounds towards the end of the game when a lautern player lay injured on the ground . it was indicative of the heat that henke and the team have been feeling over the past few weeks as they counted one disappointing match after another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesliga goalkeepers have been at the mercy of kaiserslautern 's halil altintop -lrb- l -rrb- this season one lautern player , forward halil altintop , has been spared the misery - at least directly .
while his teammates in back , the defenders , resemble more a sieve than a solid wall by giving up 25 goals so far , altintop has alone tallied 10 strikes , sharing the top slot in the bundesliga with bremen 's miroslav klose . " whoever allows that many goals in ten games should have nothing to do with this league , " was altintop 's reaction after last week 's 4-1 shellacking by mönchengladbach . dangerous strikers desired everywhere the fans are resorting to anything and everything to express their frustration with the club that over the past few years has been making a steady , plunge to the bottom of the standings . the joy of the 1997-98 title with coach otto rehhagel at the helm is long just a dream .
two weeks ago , the hard-core supporters vented their frustration by entering the stadium five minutes after the starting whistle - and were promptly penalized when they entered the fritz walter stadium as dortmund went out on top in the seventh minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twin brother hamit altintop -lrb- r -rrb- has found a spot on the turkish national squad it would be the game , though , that manager 's heads in the league turned to the small city in the far west of germany .
altintop would equal dortmund 's ebi smolarek 's hat trick with one of his own to preserve at least one point for kaiserslautern . all of a sudden , halil altintop was a hot commodity .
one club in particular would be a natural for the 22-year-old turk who was born in gelsenkirchen - schalke .
his twin brother hamit already plays for the " royal blues , " so it would hardly be a surprise if halil returned to his hometown . " since i 've been with lautern , there has always been speculation about schalke , " he told sport-bild magazine .
one thing is certain , altintop , who plays on the turkish national squad and whose contract expires in june 2006 , will leave kaiserslautern at the end of the season .
lautern president rene c. jäggi understands altintop 's desire to depart the crisis-riddled club . " he definitely wants to play in international competition and he could make much more money with any top european club , " jäggi said . aspirations for turkey also while the speculation is still swirling around altintop , he not only is eyeing just whom he might play for in the bundesliga .
he wants to secure himself a spot with the turkish national team that is still fighting to qualify for the world cup in germany and believes that only when he is playing against the top clubs in europe will he have a chance of wearing turkish red on the pitch and not just on the bench . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the life of a striker is not easy as altintop -lrb- l -rrb- finds out against dortmund " a coach simply prefers a player who plays for a top club , " he said in sport-bild after seeing no action in the country 's world cup qualifiers in september despite an impressive start in the bundesliga .
" you have to play against teams like inter milan . " england 's wayne rooney found that out at everton and moved to manchester united .
that wo n't be possible for altintop if he stays at kaiserslautern .
just as the " red devils " announced that it left the red and entered the black by making a small profit in the 2004-05 business year , they will have to find a replacement for the striker who could give the club a going-away president by shooting enough goals to keep lautern in the top division . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chelsea 's robert huth singing the blues robert huth must be asking himself what happened .

despite its success , the european aircraft maker wo n't be delivering the gigantic planes on time to its buyers .
experts say it wo n't dent airbus ' image . it was an event few aviation fans were willing to miss .
as a prototype of the gigantic a380 , the world 's largest passenger airliner , swooped down from the skies to make a perfect landing at the frankfurt airport on saturday morning amid thick fog , tens of thousands of spectators held their breath in awe . while some clambered on stools they had brought along to get a good look at the 290-ton heavy machine coming to a halt at terminal 2 of the rhein-main airport , others held their cameras and mobile phones above their heads to capture the image . it was the first test landing of the long-haul aircraft outside the testing facilities in france and the main aim is to check the handling and maintenance of the a380 at a civil airport .
the aircraft will fly back to toulouse in france on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 is the world 's largest passenger plane it 's exactly a year since the a380 , designed to carry up to 853 passengers , took to the skies for the first time .
since its maiden flight on april 27 , the aircraft has undergone 110 test flights , clocking 380 flying hours , said tore prang , a spokesman of airbus . " the test results are excellent .
the performance is much better than expected , " he said , adding that it also held true for the craft 's fuel-consumption - at 2.9 liters of kerosene for 100 kilometers per passenger . the low consumption - 12 percent lower than all other large aircraft according to airbus - is an important selling point given that fuel usage now accounts for around 16 to 20 percent of the overall costs of an airline . delivery marred by delays until now , 16 customers have placed orders for 159 a380s which cost 292 million euros -lrb- $ 353 million -rrb- apiece .
the gulf-based airline emirates is the biggest buyer with 41 orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 final assembly line near toulouse but , what 's annoyed many is the fact that the european aircraft manufacturer has delayed the delivery of the airplanes .
thus , singapore airlines , which wanted to get the first of its 10 ordered airplanes by march , now has to wait longer . " the a380 will fly for 30 years - it 's not just a big deal if the planes begin flying in the first or the second half of the year , " said prang .
the amount of compensation that airbus has to shell out for its waiting customers , remains under wraps . the delivery is now scheduled to begin in december 2006 provided there are no further hiccups . one of the biggest hurdles is reportedly evacuating passengers from the plane .
according to international regulations , in the case of an emergency , 873 passengers must be able to leave the aircraft in the dark within 90 seconds by using slides . airbus however insists there are no more hitches on that front . " i 'm confident that there wo n't be any problems there , " said tore prang .
but , airbus has delayed tests for far and an evacuation check is now slated for feb 2006 . " encouraging start " however , some say that teething problems are normal when it comes to mammoth projects . it 's not unusual that there are delays , according to ulrich horstmann , aviation analyst at the bayerische landesbank .
horstmann predicted that the a380 would have a shining future .
he added that the 159 orders were an encouraging start given that many airlines only develop new jets after they prove their value on the market . " airbus can rake in returns due to its monopoly because there are n't any other aircraft in that class and boeing ca n't give a befitting reply , " said horstmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german lufthansa boeing 747 takes off at the frankfurt airport the american rival is developing a larger version of the 1969-created jumbo jet in the form of its 747 advanced , which with 450 seats can carry 50 more passengers . " but the 747 is perceived as an old aircraft , " according to horstmann . the americans however have a different strategy .
instead of concentrating on a new giant aircraft , boeing is expending its energies on developing the 787 , a long-haul aircraft with 250 seats .
in future , flexible direct flights will play a greater role than has been the case until now , is the american thinking .
at the same time , the market for large aircraft is too small to make a new development - which cost 13 billion euros in the case of the a380 - profitable . airbus catches up however airbus spokesman prang does n't buy the argument . " all airports which have growth problems have welcomed the arrival of the a380 , " prang said .
london 's heathrow airport for instance could then reach 10 million extra passengers by 2016 thanks to the a380 without having to organize more take-offs and landings , he pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus believes air passenger numbers worldwide will treble and , in the coming years , the worldwide air passenger figures would rise threefold , having an effect on all class segments , prang added . " boeing only has one strategy , we have both , " he said , pointing towards the planned a340 long-haul aircraft for around 300 passengers .
airbus is currently developing the a350 , an aircraft in the same class as boeing 's 787 .
it 's expected to hit the market by 2010 . " airbus has got lots of things right , " said aviation expert horstmann .
" just 10 years ago , it was the small player , which boeing did n't take seriously enough .
but , in the meantime it has convincing offers in all segments of civil aviation . " when it came to aircrafts with a seating capacity of more than 100 , boeing and aircraft manufacturer mcdonnell-douglas which boeing took over had a market share of 70 percent until the mid-1990s .
but now with over 50 percent of the market share , airbus is leading the way . horstmann does n't believe that the balance will tip sharply . " a two-way share of the pie is closer to a monopoly than one thinks , " he said . " they -lrb- airbus and boeing -rrb- may lower prices in individual instances , but they wo n't be in a cut-throat competition .

despite its success , the european aircraft maker wo n't be delivering the gigantic planes on time to its buyers .
experts say it wo n't dent airbus ' image . it was an event few aviation fans were willing to miss .
as a prototype of the gigantic a380 , the world 's largest passenger airliner , swooped down from the skies to make a perfect landing at the frankfurt airport on saturday morning amid thick fog , tens of thousands of spectators held their breath in awe . while some clambered on stools they had brought along to get a good look at the 290-ton heavy machine coming to a halt at terminal 2 of the rhein-main airport , others held their cameras and mobile phones above their heads to capture the image . it was the first test landing of the long-haul aircraft outside the testing facilities in france and the main aim is to check the handling and maintenance of the a380 at a civil airport .
the aircraft will fly back to toulouse in france on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 is the world 's largest passenger plane it 's exactly a year since the a380 , designed to carry up to 853 passengers , took to the skies for the first time .
since its maiden flight on april 27 , the aircraft has undergone 110 test flights , clocking 380 flying hours , said tore prang , a spokesman of airbus . " the test results are excellent .
the performance is much better than expected , " he said , adding that it also held true for the craft 's fuel-consumption - at 2.9 liters of kerosene for 100 kilometers per passenger . the low consumption - 12 percent lower than all other large aircraft according to airbus - is an important selling point given that fuel usage now accounts for around 16 to 20 percent of the overall costs of an airline . delivery marred by delays until now , 16 customers have placed orders for 159 a380s which cost 292 million euros -lrb- $ 353 million -rrb- apiece .
the gulf-based airline emirates is the biggest buyer with 41 orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 final assembly line near toulouse but , what 's annoyed many is the fact that the european aircraft manufacturer has delayed the delivery of the airplanes .
thus , singapore airlines , which wanted to get the first of its 10 ordered airplanes by march , now has to wait longer . " the a380 will fly for 30 years - it 's not just a big deal if the planes begin flying in the first or the second half of the year , " said prang .
the amount of compensation that airbus has to shell out for its waiting customers , remains under wraps . the delivery is now scheduled to begin in december 2006 provided there are no further hiccups . one of the biggest hurdles is reportedly evacuating passengers from the plane .
according to international regulations , in the case of an emergency , 873 passengers must be able to leave the aircraft in the dark within 90 seconds by using slides . airbus however insists there are no more hitches on that front . " i 'm confident that there wo n't be any problems there , " said tore prang .
but , airbus has delayed tests for far and an evacuation check is now slated for feb 2006 . " encouraging start " however , some say that teething problems are normal when it comes to mammoth projects . it 's not unusual that there are delays , according to ulrich horstmann , aviation analyst at the bayerische landesbank .
horstmann predicted that the a380 would have a shining future .
he added that the 159 orders were an encouraging start given that many airlines only develop new jets after they prove their value on the market . " airbus can rake in returns due to its monopoly because there are n't any other aircraft in that class and boeing ca n't give a befitting reply , " said horstmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german lufthansa boeing 747 takes off at the frankfurt airport the american rival is developing a larger version of the 1969-created jumbo jet in the form of its 747 advanced , which with 450 seats can carry 50 more passengers . " but the 747 is perceived as an old aircraft , " according to horstmann . the americans however have a different strategy .
instead of concentrating on a new giant aircraft , boeing is expending its energies on developing the 787 , a long-haul aircraft with 250 seats .
in future , flexible direct flights will play a greater role than has been the case until now , is the american thinking .
at the same time , the market for large aircraft is too small to make a new development - which cost 13 billion euros in the case of the a380 - profitable . airbus catches up however airbus spokesman prang does n't buy the argument . " all airports which have growth problems have welcomed the arrival of the a380 , " prang said .
london 's heathrow airport for instance could then reach 10 million extra passengers by 2016 thanks to the a380 without having to organize more take-offs and landings , he pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus believes air passenger numbers worldwide will treble and , in the coming years , the worldwide air passenger figures would rise threefold , having an effect on all class segments , prang added . " boeing only has one strategy , we have both , " he said , pointing towards the planned a340 long-haul aircraft for around 300 passengers .
airbus is currently developing the a350 , an aircraft in the same class as boeing 's 787 .
it 's expected to hit the market by 2010 . " airbus has got lots of things right , " said aviation expert horstmann .
" just 10 years ago , it was the small player , which boeing did n't take seriously enough .
but , in the meantime it has convincing offers in all segments of civil aviation . " when it came to aircrafts with a seating capacity of more than 100 , boeing and aircraft manufacturer mcdonnell-douglas which boeing took over had a market share of 70 percent until the mid-1990s .
but now with over 50 percent of the market share , airbus is leading the way . horstmann does n't believe that the balance will tip sharply . " a two-way share of the pie is closer to a monopoly than one thinks , " he said . " they -lrb- airbus and boeing -rrb- may lower prices in individual instances , but they wo n't be in a cut-throat competition .

from hate and evil a community of reconciliation can grow , which makes peace possible . " german president horst köhler acknowledged in his speech that many critics had suggested before the project began that the money would have been better spent on rebuilding the broken-down former east germany .
" did eastern germany not need roads , roofs and factories more than an expensive church ?
but a group of residents said dresden needed more .
and now we can see that those people were right , " köhler said .
the baroque church stood for decades as a decapitated , empty shell .
but that changed in 1990 when a group of people began gathering funds to rebuild it .
now , after a decade of reconstruction , the frauenkirche stands once again in its full splendor , with sunday 's consecration ceremony officially reopening the church to the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche in ruins in 1945 people from around the world are visiting dresden for the festivities . outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder and his designated successor , angela merkel are there . britain , which led the bombing raids , has contributed more than one million euros in donations towards the reconstruction and the duke of kent , who is patron of the fundraising dresden trust , is attending sunday 's ceremony to represent the british royal family . the tens of thousands of spectators at sunday 's consecration can marvel at a golden cross and orb donated by the english city of coventry , which itself was flattened by german bombing during world war ii . the " sto n e bell " retur n s dresdeners themselves are particularly elated that their frauenkirche is finally opening its doors for protestant services following its restoration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church was rebuilt according to original plans until 1945 , the " stone bell " atop the frauenkirche lent the dresden skyline its distinctive silhouette .
ilse walter remembers when the church was bombed by british and american forces during world war ii . " spring was almost in the air on feb .
13 , 1945 , " she said .
" i remember it vividly .
i was sitting in the living room with my family listening to the radio .
they were playing relatively happy , light music when suddenly , right in the middle of the song , we heard the air raid sirens . " what ki n d of memorial ? what followed was one of the most destructive of all allied attacks , with tens of thousands losing their lives .
the city , dubbed " florence on the elbe " for its baroque splendor , was practically wiped out .
from a military perspective , no one even knows why the city was targeted .
the end of the war was already in sight , dresden had no garrisons , and its industry was outside city borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche -lrb- left -rrb- is now part of dresden 's skyline again but destroyed it was and with it , dresden 's frauenkirche .
as the city was being rebuilt in the following decades , the church remained in shambles - a skeletal reference to an ugly past . many dresden citizens felt it should stay that way - a necessary reminder of war 's destruction .
but for others , the dilapidated frauenkirche was an eyesore .
it was time to move on , they believed .
not forget , but progress . a merger of past a n d prese n t in the end , those in favor of rebuilding the frauenkirche won .
yet the restored church 's architectural design reflects only part of the baroque style from the 1700s , when the original frauenkirche was built . " we had to delve into the baroque and middle ages and study how the stones were laid back then , " said eberhard burger , the reconstruction director .
" we have done that the same way now , but we 've used better materials .
so the reconstructed building is based on a mix of old and new techniques . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church 's new golden cross about a third of the new frauenkirche building is made from the old , dark-colored stones that were left in the ruins .
the rest are new , light colored sandstones .
together they create a kind of mosaic of past and present .
the golden cross atop the church 's dome was even created by the son of an english pilot who dropped bombs on dresden in 1945 .
and of course , there is a new organ . a global project the total cost of the project came to 180 million euros -lrb- $ 218 million -rrb- . german historian arnulf baring , who as a boy witnessed the bombing in dresden , said he believes the project was worth the enormous cost and said it showed that germans could find elements of their past of which they can be proud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recreated frescoes inside the church " the frauenkirche was more than a church , it was a symbol of the downfall of a city , " baring told der spiegel magazine .
" i think it is a good thing that germans , wherever possible , regain part of their old cities , so they know that we come from somewhere . " and ludwig güttler , the chairman of the society to promote the reconstruction of the frauenkirche , said many nations had played a part in helping to restore the church to its former glory . " i am enormously grateful , " he told afp news service .
" not just for the donations , which have just kept coming , but for the level of interest shown by other countries .
so many people can say that this project is theirs - whether they be britons , americans , danes , poles or whatever else .

despite its success , the european aircraft maker wo n't be delivering the gigantic planes on time to its buyers .
experts say it wo n't dent airbus ' image . it was an event few aviation fans were willing to miss .
as a prototype of the gigantic a380 , the world 's largest passenger airliner , swooped down from the skies to make a perfect landing at the frankfurt airport on saturday morning amid thick fog , tens of thousands of spectators held their breath in awe . while some clambered on stools they had brought along to get a good look at the 290-ton heavy machine coming to a halt at terminal 2 of the rhein-main airport , others held their cameras and mobile phones above their heads to capture the image . it was the first test landing of the long-haul aircraft outside the testing facilities in france and the main aim is to check the handling and maintenance of the a380 at a civil airport .
the aircraft will fly back to toulouse in france on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 is the world 's largest passenger plane it 's exactly a year since the a380 , designed to carry up to 853 passengers , took to the skies for the first time .
since its maiden flight on april 27 , the aircraft has undergone 110 test flights , clocking 380 flying hours , said tore prang , a spokesman of airbus . " the test results are excellent .
the performance is much better than expected , " he said , adding that it also held true for the craft 's fuel-consumption - at 2.9 liters of kerosene for 100 kilometers per passenger . the low consumption - 12 percent lower than all other large aircraft according to airbus - is an important selling point given that fuel usage now accounts for around 16 to 20 percent of the overall costs of an airline . delivery marred by delays until now , 16 customers have placed orders for 159 a380s which cost 292 million euros -lrb- $ 353 million -rrb- apiece .
the gulf-based airline emirates is the biggest buyer with 41 orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 final assembly line near toulouse but , what 's annoyed many is the fact that the european aircraft manufacturer has delayed the delivery of the airplanes .
thus , singapore airlines , which wanted to get the first of its 10 ordered airplanes by march , now has to wait longer . " the a380 will fly for 30 years - it 's not just a big deal if the planes begin flying in the first or the second half of the year , " said prang .
the amount of compensation that airbus has to shell out for its waiting customers , remains under wraps . the delivery is now scheduled to begin in december 2006 provided there are no further hiccups . one of the biggest hurdles is reportedly evacuating passengers from the plane .
according to international regulations , in the case of an emergency , 873 passengers must be able to leave the aircraft in the dark within 90 seconds by using slides . airbus however insists there are no more hitches on that front . " i 'm confident that there wo n't be any problems there , " said tore prang .
but , airbus has delayed tests for far and an evacuation check is now slated for feb 2006 . " encouraging start " however , some say that teething problems are normal when it comes to mammoth projects . it 's not unusual that there are delays , according to ulrich horstmann , aviation analyst at the bayerische landesbank .
horstmann predicted that the a380 would have a shining future .
he added that the 159 orders were an encouraging start given that many airlines only develop new jets after they prove their value on the market . " airbus can rake in returns due to its monopoly because there are n't any other aircraft in that class and boeing ca n't give a befitting reply , " said horstmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german lufthansa boeing 747 takes off at the frankfurt airport the american rival is developing a larger version of the 1969-created jumbo jet in the form of its 747 advanced , which with 450 seats can carry 50 more passengers . " but the 747 is perceived as an old aircraft , " according to horstmann . the americans however have a different strategy .
instead of concentrating on a new giant aircraft , boeing is expending its energies on developing the 787 , a long-haul aircraft with 250 seats .
in future , flexible direct flights will play a greater role than has been the case until now , is the american thinking .
at the same time , the market for large aircraft is too small to make a new development - which cost 13 billion euros in the case of the a380 - profitable . airbus catches up however airbus spokesman prang does n't buy the argument . " all airports which have growth problems have welcomed the arrival of the a380 , " prang said .
london 's heathrow airport for instance could then reach 10 million extra passengers by 2016 thanks to the a380 without having to organize more take-offs and landings , he pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus believes air passenger numbers worldwide will treble and , in the coming years , the worldwide air passenger figures would rise threefold , having an effect on all class segments , prang added . " boeing only has one strategy , we have both , " he said , pointing towards the planned a340 long-haul aircraft for around 300 passengers .
airbus is currently developing the a350 , an aircraft in the same class as boeing 's 787 .
it 's expected to hit the market by 2010 . " airbus has got lots of things right , " said aviation expert horstmann .
" just 10 years ago , it was the small player , which boeing did n't take seriously enough .
but , in the meantime it has convincing offers in all segments of civil aviation . " when it came to aircrafts with a seating capacity of more than 100 , boeing and aircraft manufacturer mcdonnell-douglas which boeing took over had a market share of 70 percent until the mid-1990s .
but now with over 50 percent of the market share , airbus is leading the way . horstmann does n't believe that the balance will tip sharply . " a two-way share of the pie is closer to a monopoly than one thinks , " he said . " they -lrb- airbus and boeing -rrb- may lower prices in individual instances , but they wo n't be in a cut-throat competition .

from hate and evil a community of reconciliation can grow , which makes peace possible . " german president horst köhler acknowledged in his speech that many critics had suggested before the project began that the money would have been better spent on rebuilding the broken-down former east germany .
" did eastern germany not need roads , roofs and factories more than an expensive church ?
but a group of residents said dresden needed more .
and now we can see that those people were right , " köhler said .
the baroque church stood for decades as a decapitated , empty shell .
but that changed in 1990 when a group of people began gathering funds to rebuild it .
now , after a decade of reconstruction , the frauenkirche stands once again in its full splendor , with sunday 's consecration ceremony officially reopening the church to the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche in ruins in 1945 people from around the world are visiting dresden for the festivities . outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder and his designated successor , angela merkel are there . britain , which led the bombing raids , has contributed more than one million euros in donations towards the reconstruction and the duke of kent , who is patron of the fundraising dresden trust , is attending sunday 's ceremony to represent the british royal family . the tens of thousands of spectators at sunday 's consecration can marvel at a golden cross and orb donated by the english city of coventry , which itself was flattened by german bombing during world war ii . the " sto n e bell " retur n s dresdeners themselves are particularly elated that their frauenkirche is finally opening its doors for protestant services following its restoration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church was rebuilt according to original plans until 1945 , the " stone bell " atop the frauenkirche lent the dresden skyline its distinctive silhouette .

despite its success , the european aircraft maker wo n't be delivering the gigantic planes on time to its buyers .
experts say it wo n't dent airbus ' image . it was an event few aviation fans were willing to miss .
as a prototype of the gigantic a380 , the world 's largest passenger airliner , swooped down from the skies to make a perfect landing at the frankfurt airport on saturday morning amid thick fog , tens of thousands of spectators held their breath in awe . while some clambered on stools they had brought along to get a good look at the 290-ton heavy machine coming to a halt at terminal 2 of the rhein-main airport , others held their cameras and mobile phones above their heads to capture the image . it was the first test landing of the long-haul aircraft outside the testing facilities in france and the main aim is to check the handling and maintenance of the a380 at a civil airport .
the aircraft will fly back to toulouse in france on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 is the world 's largest passenger plane it 's exactly a year since the a380 , designed to carry up to 853 passengers , took to the skies for the first time .
since its maiden flight on april 27 , the aircraft has undergone 110 test flights , clocking 380 flying hours , said tore prang , a spokesman of airbus . " the test results are excellent .
the performance is much better than expected , " he said , adding that it also held true for the craft 's fuel-consumption - at 2.9 liters of kerosene for 100 kilometers per passenger . the low consumption - 12 percent lower than all other large aircraft according to airbus - is an important selling point given that fuel usage now accounts for around 16 to 20 percent of the overall costs of an airline . delivery marred by delays until now , 16 customers have placed orders for 159 a380s which cost 292 million euros -lrb- $ 353 million -rrb- apiece .
the gulf-based airline emirates is the biggest buyer with 41 orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 final assembly line near toulouse but , what 's annoyed many is the fact that the european aircraft manufacturer has delayed the delivery of the airplanes .
thus , singapore airlines , which wanted to get the first of its 10 ordered airplanes by march , now has to wait longer . " the a380 will fly for 30 years - it 's not just a big deal if the planes begin flying in the first or the second half of the year , " said prang .
the amount of compensation that airbus has to shell out for its waiting customers , remains under wraps . the delivery is now scheduled to begin in december 2006 provided there are no further hiccups . one of the biggest hurdles is reportedly evacuating passengers from the plane .
according to international regulations , in the case of an emergency , 873 passengers must be able to leave the aircraft in the dark within 90 seconds by using slides . airbus however insists there are no more hitches on that front . " i 'm confident that there wo n't be any problems there , " said tore prang .
but , airbus has delayed tests for far and an evacuation check is now slated for feb 2006 . " encouraging start " however , some say that teething problems are normal when it comes to mammoth projects . it 's not unusual that there are delays , according to ulrich horstmann , aviation analyst at the bayerische landesbank .
horstmann predicted that the a380 would have a shining future .
he added that the 159 orders were an encouraging start given that many airlines only develop new jets after they prove their value on the market . " airbus can rake in returns due to its monopoly because there are n't any other aircraft in that class and boeing ca n't give a befitting reply , " said horstmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german lufthansa boeing 747 takes off at the frankfurt airport the american rival is developing a larger version of the 1969-created jumbo jet in the form of its 747 advanced , which with 450 seats can carry 50 more passengers . " but the 747 is perceived as an old aircraft , " according to horstmann . the americans however have a different strategy .
instead of concentrating on a new giant aircraft , boeing is expending its energies on developing the 787 , a long-haul aircraft with 250 seats .
in future , flexible direct flights will play a greater role than has been the case until now , is the american thinking .
at the same time , the market for large aircraft is too small to make a new development - which cost 13 billion euros in the case of the a380 - profitable . airbus catches up however airbus spokesman prang does n't buy the argument . " all airports which have growth problems have welcomed the arrival of the a380 , " prang said .
london 's heathrow airport for instance could then reach 10 million extra passengers by 2016 thanks to the a380 without having to organize more take-offs and landings , he pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus believes air passenger numbers worldwide will treble and , in the coming years , the worldwide air passenger figures would rise threefold , having an effect on all class segments , prang added . " boeing only has one strategy , we have both , " he said , pointing towards the planned a340 long-haul aircraft for around 300 passengers .
airbus is currently developing the a350 , an aircraft in the same class as boeing 's 787 .
it 's expected to hit the market by 2010 . " airbus has got lots of things right , " said aviation expert horstmann .
" just 10 years ago , it was the small player , which boeing did n't take seriously enough .
but , in the meantime it has convincing offers in all segments of civil aviation . " when it came to aircrafts with a seating capacity of more than 100 , boeing and aircraft manufacturer mcdonnell-douglas which boeing took over had a market share of 70 percent until the mid-1990s .
but now with over 50 percent of the market share , airbus is leading the way . horstmann does n't believe that the balance will tip sharply . " a two-way share of the pie is closer to a monopoly than one thinks , " he said .

the company said on friday that it already mentioned the case in one of its previous quarterly reports and that it rejected any further public comments . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens is one of the prime accused the siemens group is said to have paid about 1.6 million dollars in bribes to saddam in support of deals involving power plant turbines . siemens representatives says the company wouldn ’ t make any comment at this point in time and have called the report " premature and unjustified .

they should now be wondering , he argued , how the system could have been circumvented by individual staff members . he also urged german prosecutors to start a full investigation into the cases of bribery . " german laws against bribery are sufficient and appropriate , " he said .
" they just need to be fully applied .
it is now a question of resources in the justice system and enough public pressure to start a full legal proceedings .
i hope we ’ ll see that happening very soon . " smaller fish should n't go unpunished elzholtz also expressed the hope that prosecutors wouldn ’ t just focus on the two high-profile cases involving daimlerchrysler and siemens . the huge number of smaller companies that had given kickbacks to the saddam regime shouldn ’ t go unpunished , he said . uwe hessler -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans accused of bribery in un corruption scandal siemens and daimlerchrysler are among the more than 2,000 companies from 66 countries that paid kickbacks to saddam hussein 's government , according to an independent report on the un 's oil-for-food program .

some 200 university students from more than 20 universities in 12 countries participated in the project under the esa 's initiative . the satellite is about the size of a standard washing machine and weighs about 62 kilograms . from the drawing board to the launch pad , the project took just 18 months with students relying on the internet as their principal means of exchanging data .
the esa provided the entire funding . " they -lrb- the satellites -rrb- are all in what we called a polar orbit , little below some 700 kilometers above our head so to speak and they have a number of technology experiments on board , " said heidi graff , a spokeswoman for esa .
" they are also testing a special new kind of solar cell , which is better in quality than the standard used to be , they will have a camera on board to try to take observation pictures and they have certain equipment on board with which they will communicate with radio amateurs all over the world , " graff added . hands-on training but even more than the technology , the uniqueness of the project lies in the fact that the entire undertaking was completed by the students themselves . the sseti , which provided the framework for the mission , was launched by esa ’ s education department in 2000 to get european students involved in real space missions , and well as give them practical hands-on experience and encourage them to take up careers in space technology and science . " it 's all done and built by the students themselves .
we more or less only financed the technical check out to make it qualify to go for launch .
it is the students who really have to get the credit , " said graff . one of the students , jürgen schlutz from the university of stuttgart who is one of 15 students studying aerospace engineering in the project propulsion team , said the hands-on training had been valuable . " we are all students of engineering but it 's a pretty much a theoretical approach , we did n't do much in the way of hardware -lrb- until now -rrb- , " schlutz said . " what we learned in the project was actually to build - what comes extra is all the involvement in the project itself , in project management , the work with student teams all over europe , the technical aspect and intercultural co-operation was something that was very valuable for team members , " he added . mark caldwell -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european aerospace aims for the moon leading german aerospace companies have urged the creation of an unmanned european space station on the moon , warning that europe could otherwise lose out to other nations in the race for space exploration and research .

bremen and hamburg also win as the top trio in the league is beginning to pull away . a five-game winning streak has done much to dampen the spirits of cologne 's fans but it did n't stop 50,000 of them from streaming to the rhein energie stadium to see their side face bayern munich .
the crowd fired their club on to a strong first-half performance that was highlighted by matthias scherz ' third season goal and a 1-0 lead .
but they filed out of the grounds disappointed as bayern defender lucio and midfielder michael ballack scored second-half goals to give munich the victory . the loss heightens the crisis in cologne as coach uwe rapolder has to wonder what can be done to gather the club 's first victory since a 2-1 defeat of mönchengladbach on september 17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich coach felix magath waves his arms in disbelief but his side would win 2-1 in cologne it was not to be against a less than satisfactory performance from bayern in the eyes their coach felix magath .
that 's why it 's good to have international performers like lucio and ballack who can turn around even a bleak game . " we can be happy about a lucky victory , " commented magath dryly . it came about with some help from the referee whose decisions affected the game 's outcome .
ballack 's gamewinning head ball goal came in the 74th minute off a corner kick wrongly awarded to the league-leaders .
then in the waning moments , cologne were denied a penalty kick as lucio apparently used his hands to deflect the ball in the penalty box .
as magath said , it was a lucky victory . bremen overcome weak start to win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen 's miroslav klose clinches his fists in joy over his 11th strike of the season werder bremen remain two points behind munich in the standings after a clear 4-1 win over guests frankfurt .
the central germans came into bremen with a convincing 6-3 thrashing of cologne under their belts .
the excellent effort continued and coach friedhelm funkel 's team proved they could play with the best of them when ioannis amanatidis put them up 1-0 in the 19th minute . after that though , thomas schaaf 's bremen took control of the game .
international midfielder torsten frings knotted up the game with a head ball in the 29th minute and the score was 1-1 at half .
tim borowski scored twice and miroslav klose also found the net for his league-leading 11th goal although it was preceded by a hand ball . " after the go-ahead goal in the second half we could n't keep up with bremen .
it was a deserved victory for werder , " admitted funkel . third-place hamburg also kept pace with the best , and in the process handed schalke their first loss of the season .
defender mehdi mahdavikia scored the lone goal in the 19th minute in a roughly-played match in which referee fandel handed out five yellow cards and sent off schalke stopper christian poulsen for two bookings .
the " royal blues " now are a massive ten points behind bayern as this campaign is taking on the appearance of a three-horse race . gladbach series halted the biggest surprise in this young season has been borussia mönchengladbach .
they lost to their namesakes from dortmund 2-1 .
gladbach were never really in this match as the homeside borussia dortmund dictated play most of the game .
nevertheless , gladbach remain in fifth-place , even on points with schalke and berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a common sight : stuttgart 's goalkeeper dirk heinen watches the ball rolling over the goalline hertha berlin benefited from the schalke and gladbach losses in the most entertaining match on saturday , drawing 3-3 with stuttgart .
the guests from berlin led 1-0 after one half and then the fireworks began as the lead changed hand two times .
colorful berlin midfielder marchelinho has found his form again , having scored once and assisting on the other two goals .
stuttgart coach giovanni trapattoni 's side never surrendered though .
mario gomez got the equalizer with seven minutes remaining to save the italian coach who has had to listen to loads of rumors about his release this past week for the next match against nuremberg . henke also given a reprieve just like in stuttgart , kaiserslautern 's coach michael henke has been suffering under his squad 's sub-par performance .
he made the right decision as his team was behind 2-1 in the 87th minute by bringing on rarely-used turkish striker berkant götkan .
the 25-year old scored just three minutes later for a 2-2 final . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there , there , everything 's just fine , " would seem to be lautern coach michael henke 's -lrb- l -rrb- reaction " i 'm very disappointed , " said leverkusen coach michael skibbe who has yet to win in three matches with the club .
" that so many of our players were pushing up front -lrb- at the end -rrb- was completely unnecessary . " wolfsburg had gone through a tough three weeks .
coach holger fach 's side had come away with four hard-earned points against bayern munich , hamburg and schalke .
the game against duisburg was a well-deserved break but they underestimated the " zebras " who scored their second victory of the season , and even escaped the relegation zone with a 2-0 win that was hardly threatened by the toothless wolves . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wanted : a better team for altintop kaiserslautern 's halil altintop together with bremen 's miroslav klose , tops the bundesliga in goalscoring .

from hate and evil a community of reconciliation can grow , which makes peace possible . " german president horst köhler acknowledged in his speech that many critics had suggested before the project began that the money would have been better spent on rebuilding the broken-down former east germany .
" did eastern germany not need roads , roofs and factories more than an expensive church ?
but a group of residents said dresden needed more .
and now we can see that those people were right , " köhler said .
the baroque church stood for decades as a decapitated , empty shell .
but that changed in 1990 when a group of people began gathering funds to rebuild it .
now , after a decade of reconstruction , the frauenkirche stands once again in its full splendor , with sunday 's consecration ceremony officially reopening the church to the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche in ruins in 1945 people from around the world are visiting dresden for the festivities . outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder and his designated successor , angela merkel are there . britain , which led the bombing raids , has contributed more than one million euros in donations towards the reconstruction and the duke of kent , who is patron of the fundraising dresden trust , is attending sunday 's ceremony to represent the british royal family . the tens of thousands of spectators at sunday 's consecration can marvel at a golden cross and orb donated by the english city of coventry , which itself was flattened by german bombing during world war ii . the " sto n e bell " retur n s dresdeners themselves are particularly elated that their frauenkirche is finally opening its doors for protestant services following its restoration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church was rebuilt according to original plans until 1945 , the " stone bell " atop the frauenkirche lent the dresden skyline its distinctive silhouette .

the city , dubbed " florence on the elbe " for its baroque splendor , was practically wiped out .

some 200 university students from more than 20 universities in 12 countries participated in the project under the esa 's initiative . the satellite is about the size of a standard washing machine and weighs about 62 kilograms . from the drawing board to the launch pad , the project took just 18 months with students relying on the internet as their principal means of exchanging data .
the esa provided the entire funding . " they -lrb- the satellites -rrb- are all in what we called a polar orbit , little below some 700 kilometers above our head so to speak and they have a number of technology experiments on board , " said heidi graff , a spokeswoman for esa .
" they are also testing a special new kind of solar cell , which is better in quality than the standard used to be , they will have a camera on board to try to take observation pictures and they have certain equipment on board with which they will communicate with radio amateurs all over the world , " graff added . hands-on training but even more than the technology , the uniqueness of the project lies in the fact that the entire undertaking was completed by the students themselves . the sseti , which provided the framework for the mission , was launched by esa ’ s education department in 2000 to get european students involved in real space missions , and well as give them practical hands-on experience and encourage them to take up careers in space technology and science . " it 's all done and built by the students themselves .
we more or less only financed the technical check out to make it qualify to go for launch .
it is the students who really have to get the credit , " said graff . one of the students , jürgen schlutz from the university of stuttgart who is one of 15 students studying aerospace engineering in the project propulsion team , said the hands-on training had been valuable . " we are all students of engineering but it 's a pretty much a theoretical approach , we did n't do much in the way of hardware -lrb- until now -rrb- , " schlutz said . " what we learned in the project was actually to build - what comes extra is all the involvement in the project itself , in project management , the work with student teams all over europe , the technical aspect and intercultural co-operation was something that was very valuable for team members , " he added . mark caldwell -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european aerospace aims for the moon leading german aerospace companies have urged the creation of an unmanned european space station on the moon , warning that europe could otherwise lose out to other nations in the race for space exploration and research .

from hate and evil a community of reconciliation can grow , which makes peace possible . " german president horst köhler acknowledged in his speech that many critics had suggested before the project began that the money would have been better spent on rebuilding the broken-down former east germany .
" did eastern germany not need roads , roofs and factories more than an expensive church ?
but a group of residents said dresden needed more .
and now we can see that those people were right , " köhler said .
the baroque church stood for decades as a decapitated , empty shell .
but that changed in 1990 when a group of people began gathering funds to rebuild it .
now , after a decade of reconstruction , the frauenkirche stands once again in its full splendor , with sunday 's consecration ceremony officially reopening the church to the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche in ruins in 1945 people from around the world are visiting dresden for the festivities . outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder and his designated successor , angela merkel are there . britain , which led the bombing raids , has contributed more than one million euros in donations towards the reconstruction and the duke of kent , who is patron of the fundraising dresden trust , is attending sunday 's ceremony to represent the british royal family . the tens of thousands of spectators at sunday 's consecration can marvel at a golden cross and orb donated by the english city of coventry , which itself was flattened by german bombing during world war ii . the " sto n e bell " retur n s dresdeners themselves are particularly elated that their frauenkirche is finally opening its doors for protestant services following its restoration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church was rebuilt according to original plans until 1945 , the " stone bell " atop the frauenkirche lent the dresden skyline its distinctive silhouette .
ilse walter remembers when the church was bombed by british and american forces during world war ii . " spring was almost in the air on feb .
13 , 1945 , " she said .
" i remember it vividly .
i was sitting in the living room with my family listening to the radio .
they were playing relatively happy , light music when suddenly , right in the middle of the song , we heard the air raid sirens . " what ki n d of memorial ? what followed was one of the most destructive of all allied attacks , with tens of thousands losing their lives .
the city , dubbed " florence on the elbe " for its baroque splendor , was practically wiped out .
from a military perspective , no one even knows why the city was targeted .
the end of the war was already in sight , dresden had no garrisons , and its industry was outside city borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche -lrb- left -rrb- is now part of dresden 's skyline again but destroyed it was and with it , dresden 's frauenkirche .
as the city was being rebuilt in the following decades , the church remained in shambles - a skeletal reference to an ugly past . many dresden citizens felt it should stay that way - a necessary reminder of war 's destruction .
but for others , the dilapidated frauenkirche was an eyesore .
it was time to move on , they believed .
not forget , but progress . a merger of past a n d prese n t in the end , those in favor of rebuilding the frauenkirche won .
yet the restored church 's architectural design reflects only part of the baroque style from the 1700s , when the original frauenkirche was built . " we had to delve into the baroque and middle ages and study how the stones were laid back then , " said eberhard burger , the reconstruction director .
" we have done that the same way now , but we 've used better materials .
so the reconstructed building is based on a mix of old and new techniques . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church 's new golden cross about a third of the new frauenkirche building is made from the old , dark-colored stones that were left in the ruins .
the rest are new , light colored sandstones .
together they create a kind of mosaic of past and present .
the golden cross atop the church 's dome was even created by the son of an english pilot who dropped bombs on dresden in 1945 .
and of course , there is a new organ . a global project the total cost of the project came to 180 million euros -lrb- $ 218 million -rrb- . german historian arnulf baring , who as a boy witnessed the bombing in dresden , said he believes the project was worth the enormous cost and said it showed that germans could find elements of their past of which they can be proud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recreated frescoes inside the church " the frauenkirche was more than a church , it was a symbol of the downfall of a city , " baring told der spiegel magazine .
" i think it is a good thing that germans , wherever possible , regain part of their old cities , so they know that we come from somewhere . " and ludwig güttler , the chairman of the society to promote the reconstruction of the frauenkirche , said many nations had played a part in helping to restore the church to its former glory . " i am enormously grateful , " he told afp news service .
" not just for the donations , which have just kept coming , but for the level of interest shown by other countries .
so many people can say that this project is theirs - whether they be britons , americans , danes , poles or whatever else . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blowing a trumpet for the frauenkirche ludwig güttler is one of the world 's most successful trumpet virtuosos .
from the former east germany , he also played a key role in the campaign to reconstruct dresden 's landmark frauenkirche , or church of our lady .

from hate and evil a community of reconciliation can grow , which makes peace possible . " german president horst köhler acknowledged in his speech that many critics had suggested before the project began that the money would have been better spent on rebuilding the broken-down former east germany .
" did eastern germany not need roads , roofs and factories more than an expensive church ?
but a group of residents said dresden needed more .
and now we can see that those people were right , " köhler said .
the baroque church stood for decades as a decapitated , empty shell .
but that changed in 1990 when a group of people began gathering funds to rebuild it .
now , after a decade of reconstruction , the frauenkirche stands once again in its full splendor , with sunday 's consecration ceremony officially reopening the church to the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche in ruins in 1945 people from around the world are visiting dresden for the festivities . outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder and his designated successor , angela merkel are there . britain , which led the bombing raids , has contributed more than one million euros in donations towards the reconstruction and the duke of kent , who is patron of the fundraising dresden trust , is attending sunday 's ceremony to represent the british royal family . the tens of thousands of spectators at sunday 's consecration can marvel at a golden cross and orb donated by the english city of coventry , which itself was flattened by german bombing during world war ii . the " sto n e bell " retur n s dresdeners themselves are particularly elated that their frauenkirche is finally opening its doors for protestant services following its restoration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church was rebuilt according to original plans until 1945 , the " stone bell " atop the frauenkirche lent the dresden skyline its distinctive silhouette .
ilse walter remembers when the church was bombed by british and american forces during world war ii . " spring was almost in the air on feb .
13 , 1945 , " she said .
" i remember it vividly .
i was sitting in the living room with my family listening to the radio .
they were playing relatively happy , light music when suddenly , right in the middle of the song , we heard the air raid sirens . " what ki n d of memorial ? what followed was one of the most destructive of all allied attacks , with tens of thousands losing their lives .
the city , dubbed " florence on the elbe " for its baroque splendor , was practically wiped out .
from a military perspective , no one even knows why the city was targeted .
the end of the war was already in sight , dresden had no garrisons , and its industry was outside city borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche -lrb- left -rrb- is now part of dresden 's skyline again but destroyed it was and with it , dresden 's frauenkirche .
as the city was being rebuilt in the following decades , the church remained in shambles - a skeletal reference to an ugly past . many dresden citizens felt it should stay that way - a necessary reminder of war 's destruction .
but for others , the dilapidated frauenkirche was an eyesore .
it was time to move on , they believed .
not forget , but progress . a merger of past a n d prese n t in the end , those in favor of rebuilding the frauenkirche won .
yet the restored church 's architectural design reflects only part of the baroque style from the 1700s , when the original frauenkirche was built . " we had to delve into the baroque and middle ages and study how the stones were laid back then , " said eberhard burger , the reconstruction director .
" we have done that the same way now , but we 've used better materials .
so the reconstructed building is based on a mix of old and new techniques . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church 's new golden cross about a third of the new frauenkirche building is made from the old , dark-colored stones that were left in the ruins .
the rest are new , light colored sandstones .
together they create a kind of mosaic of past and present .
the golden cross atop the church 's dome was even created by the son of an english pilot who dropped bombs on dresden in 1945 .
and of course , there is a new organ . a global project the total cost of the project came to 180 million euros -lrb- $ 218 million -rrb- . german historian arnulf baring , who as a boy witnessed the bombing in dresden , said he believes the project was worth the enormous cost and said it showed that germans could find elements of their past of which they can be proud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recreated frescoes inside the church " the frauenkirche was more than a church , it was a symbol of the downfall of a city , " baring told der spiegel magazine .
" i think it is a good thing that germans , wherever possible , regain part of their old cities , so they know that we come from somewhere . " and ludwig güttler , the chairman of the society to promote the reconstruction of the frauenkirche , said many nations had played a part in helping to restore the church to its former glory . " i am enormously grateful , " he told afp news service .
" not just for the donations , which have just kept coming , but for the level of interest shown by other countries .
so many people can say that this project is theirs - whether they be britons , americans , danes , poles or whatever else .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.10.2005 airbus a380 deliveries run into rough weather großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 touched down in frankfurt amid thick fog the airbus a380 made a flawless test landing in germany saturday .
despite its success , the european aircraft maker wo n't be delivering the gigantic planes on time to its buyers .
experts say it wo n't dent airbus ' image . it was an event few aviation fans were willing to miss .
as a prototype of the gigantic a380 , the world 's largest passenger airliner , swooped down from the skies to make a perfect landing at the frankfurt airport on saturday morning amid thick fog , tens of thousands of spectators held their breath in awe . while some clambered on stools they had brought along to get a good look at the 290-ton heavy machine coming to a halt at terminal 2 of the rhein-main airport , others held their cameras and mobile phones above their heads to capture the image . it was the first test landing of the long-haul aircraft outside the testing facilities in france and the main aim is to check the handling and maintenance of the a380 at a civil airport .
the aircraft will fly back to toulouse in france on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 is the world 's largest passenger plane it 's exactly a year since the a380 , designed to carry up to 853 passengers , took to the skies for the first time .
since its maiden flight on april 27 , the aircraft has undergone 110 test flights , clocking 380 flying hours , said tore prang , a spokesman of airbus . " the test results are excellent .
the performance is much better than expected , " he said , adding that it also held true for the craft 's fuel-consumption - at 2.9 liters of kerosene for 100 kilometers per passenger . the low consumption - 12 percent lower than all other large aircraft according to airbus - is an important selling point given that fuel usage now accounts for around 16 to 20 percent of the overall costs of an airline . delivery marred by delays until now , 16 customers have placed orders for 159 a380s which cost 292 million euros -lrb- $ 353 million -rrb- apiece .
the gulf-based airline emirates is the biggest buyer with 41 orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 final assembly line near toulouse but , what 's annoyed many is the fact that the european aircraft manufacturer has delayed the delivery of the airplanes .
thus , singapore airlines , which wanted to get the first of its 10 ordered airplanes by march , now has to wait longer . " the a380 will fly for 30 years - it 's not just a big deal if the planes begin flying in the first or the second half of the year , " said prang .
the amount of compensation that airbus has to shell out for its waiting customers , remains under wraps . the delivery is now scheduled to begin in december 2006 provided there are no further hiccups . one of the biggest hurdles is reportedly evacuating passengers from the plane .
according to international regulations , in the case of an emergency , 873 passengers must be able to leave the aircraft in the dark within 90 seconds by using slides . airbus however insists there are no more hitches on that front . " i 'm confident that there wo n't be any problems there , " said tore prang .
but , airbus has delayed tests for far and an evacuation check is now slated for feb 2006 . " encouraging start " however , some say that teething problems are normal when it comes to mammoth projects . it 's not unusual that there are delays , according to ulrich horstmann , aviation analyst at the bayerische landesbank .
horstmann predicted that the a380 would have a shining future .
he added that the 159 orders were an encouraging start given that many airlines only develop new jets after they prove their value on the market . " airbus can rake in returns due to its monopoly because there are n't any other aircraft in that class and boeing ca n't give a befitting reply , " said horstmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german lufthansa boeing 747 takes off at the frankfurt airport the american rival is developing a larger version of the 1969-created jumbo jet in the form of its 747 advanced , which with 450 seats can carry 50 more passengers . " but the 747 is perceived as an old aircraft , " according to horstmann . the americans however have a different strategy .
instead of concentrating on a new giant aircraft , boeing is expending its energies on developing the 787 , a long-haul aircraft with 250 seats .
in future , flexible direct flights will play a greater role than has been the case until now , is the american thinking .
at the same time , the market for large aircraft is too small to make a new development - which cost 13 billion euros in the case of the a380 - profitable . airbus catches up however airbus spokesman prang does n't buy the argument . " all airports which have growth problems have welcomed the arrival of the a380 , " prang said .
london 's heathrow airport for instance could then reach 10 million extra passengers by 2016 thanks to the a380 without having to organize more take-offs and landings , he pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus believes air passenger numbers worldwide will treble and , in the coming years , the worldwide air passenger figures would rise threefold , having an effect on all class segments , prang added . " boeing only has one strategy , we have both , " he said , pointing towards the planned a340 long-haul aircraft for around 300 passengers .
airbus is currently developing the a350 , an aircraft in the same class as boeing 's 787 .
it 's expected to hit the market by 2010 . " airbus has got lots of things right , " said aviation expert horstmann .
" just 10 years ago , it was the small player , which boeing did n't take seriously enough .
but , in the meantime it has convincing offers in all segments of civil aviation . " when it came to aircrafts with a seating capacity of more than 100 , boeing and aircraft manufacturer mcdonnell-douglas which boeing took over had a market share of 70 percent until the mid-1990s .
but now with over 50 percent of the market share , airbus is leading the way . horstmann does n't believe that the balance will tip sharply . " a two-way share of the pie is closer to a monopoly than one thinks , " he said . " they -lrb- airbus and boeing -rrb- may lower prices in individual instances , but they wo n't be in a cut-throat competition .

some 200 university students from more than 20 universities in 12 countries participated in the project under the esa 's initiative . the satellite is about the size of a standard washing machine and weighs about 62 kilograms . from the drawing board to the launch pad , the project took just 18 months with students relying on the internet as their principal means of exchanging data .
the esa provided the entire funding . " they -lrb- the satellites -rrb- are all in what we called a polar orbit , little below some 700 kilometers above our head so to speak and they have a number of technology experiments on board , " said heidi graff , a spokeswoman for esa .
" they are also testing a special new kind of solar cell , which is better in quality than the standard used to be , they will have a camera on board to try to take observation pictures and they have certain equipment on board with which they will communicate with radio amateurs all over the world , " graff added . hands-on training but even more than the technology , the uniqueness of the project lies in the fact that the entire undertaking was completed by the students themselves . the sseti , which provided the framework for the mission , was launched by esa ’ s education department in 2000 to get european students involved in real space missions , and well as give them practical hands-on experience and encourage them to take up careers in space technology and science . " it 's all done and built by the students themselves .
we more or less only financed the technical check out to make it qualify to go for launch .
it is the students who really have to get the credit , " said graff . one of the students , jürgen schlutz from the university of stuttgart who is one of 15 students studying aerospace engineering in the project propulsion team , said the hands-on training had been valuable . " we are all students of engineering but it 's a pretty much a theoretical approach , we did n't do much in the way of hardware -lrb- until now -rrb- , " schlutz said . " what we learned in the project was actually to build - what comes extra is all the involvement in the project itself , in project management , the work with student teams all over europe , the technical aspect and intercultural co-operation was something that was very valuable for team members , " he added . mark caldwell -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european aerospace aims for the moon leading german aerospace companies have urged the creation of an unmanned european space station on the moon , warning that europe could otherwise lose out to other nations in the race for space exploration and research .

the " red devils " are floundering towards the bottom of the league but the german-born turk has big plans . kaiserslautern managed to advance another round this week in the german cup .
they did it with a hard-fought 4-2 away victory on tuesday against third division side erfurt .
yet the win did nothing to relieve the pressure on coach michael henke .
in the bundesliga , lautern are just a point away from the relegation zone .
dissension inside the team and from outside -lrb- the fans -rrb- is reaching a fevered pitch . after the cup match on tuesday , henke railed against the erfurt squad by calling them " scheiss-ossis , " or " crap easterners " for not kicking the ball out of bounds towards the end of the game when a lautern player lay injured on the ground . it was indicative of the heat that henke and the team have been feeling over the past few weeks as they counted one disappointing match after another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesliga goalkeepers have been at the mercy of kaiserslautern 's halil altintop -lrb- l -rrb- this season one lautern player , forward halil altintop , has been spared the misery - at least directly .
while his teammates in back , the defenders , resemble more a sieve than a solid wall by giving up 25 goals so far , altintop has alone tallied 10 strikes , sharing the top slot in the bundesliga with bremen 's miroslav klose . " whoever allows that many goals in ten games should have nothing to do with this league , " was altintop 's reaction after last week 's 4-1 shellacking by mönchengladbach . dangerous strikers desired everywhere the fans are resorting to anything and everything to express their frustration with the club that over the past few years has been making a steady , plunge to the bottom of the standings . the joy of the 1997-98 title with coach otto rehhagel at the helm is long just a dream .
two weeks ago , the hard-core supporters vented their frustration by entering the stadium five minutes after the starting whistle - and were promptly penalized when they entered the fritz walter stadium as dortmund went out on top in the seventh minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twin brother hamit altintop -lrb- r -rrb- has found a spot on the turkish national squad it would be the game , though , that manager 's heads in the league turned to the small city in the far west of germany .
altintop would equal dortmund 's ebi smolarek 's hat trick with one of his own to preserve at least one point for kaiserslautern . all of a sudden , halil altintop was a hot commodity .
one club in particular would be a natural for the 22-year-old turk who was born in gelsenkirchen - schalke .
his twin brother hamit already plays for the " royal blues , " so it would hardly be a surprise if halil returned to his hometown . " since i 've been with lautern , there has always been speculation about schalke , " he told sport-bild magazine .
one thing is certain , altintop , who plays on the turkish national squad and whose contract expires in june 2006 , will leave kaiserslautern at the end of the season .
lautern president rene c. jäggi understands altintop 's desire to depart the crisis-riddled club . " he definitely wants to play in international competition and he could make much more money with any top european club , " jäggi said . aspirations for turkey also while the speculation is still swirling around altintop , he not only is eyeing just whom he might play for in the bundesliga .
he wants to secure himself a spot with the turkish national team that is still fighting to qualify for the world cup in germany and believes that only when he is playing against the top clubs in europe will he have a chance of wearing turkish red on the pitch and not just on the bench . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the life of a striker is not easy as altintop -lrb- l -rrb- finds out against dortmund " a coach simply prefers a player who plays for a top club , " he said in sport-bild after seeing no action in the country 's world cup qualifiers in september despite an impressive start in the bundesliga .
" you have to play against teams like inter milan . " england 's wayne rooney found that out at everton and moved to manchester united .
that wo n't be possible for altintop if he stays at kaiserslautern .
just as the " red devils " announced that it left the red and entered the black by making a small profit in the 2004-05 business year , they will have to find a replacement for the striker who could give the club a going-away president by shooting enough goals to keep lautern in the top division . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chelsea 's robert huth singing the blues robert huth must be asking himself what happened .
once seen as a key element in the reinvigoration of the national team , the fast-moving train has derailed .
his chances of playing for germany are sinking rapidly .

the " red devils " are floundering towards the bottom of the league but the german-born turk has big plans . kaiserslautern managed to advance another round this week in the german cup .
they did it with a hard-fought 4-2 away victory on tuesday against third division side erfurt .
yet the win did nothing to relieve the pressure on coach michael henke .
in the bundesliga , lautern are just a point away from the relegation zone .
dissension inside the team and from outside -lrb- the fans -rrb- is reaching a fevered pitch . after the cup match on tuesday , henke railed against the erfurt squad by calling them " scheiss-ossis , " or " crap easterners " for not kicking the ball out of bounds towards the end of the game when a lautern player lay injured on the ground . it was indicative of the heat that henke and the team have been feeling over the past few weeks as they counted one disappointing match after another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesliga goalkeepers have been at the mercy of kaiserslautern 's halil altintop -lrb- l -rrb- this season one lautern player , forward halil altintop , has been spared the misery - at least directly .
while his teammates in back , the defenders , resemble more a sieve than a solid wall by giving up 25 goals so far , altintop has alone tallied 10 strikes , sharing the top slot in the bundesliga with bremen 's miroslav klose . " whoever allows that many goals in ten games should have nothing to do with this league , " was altintop 's reaction after last week 's 4-1 shellacking by mönchengladbach . dangerous strikers desired everywhere the fans are resorting to anything and everything to express their frustration with the club that over the past few years has been making a steady , plunge to the bottom of the standings . the joy of the 1997-98 title with coach otto rehhagel at the helm is long just a dream .
two weeks ago , the hard-core supporters vented their frustration by entering the stadium five minutes after the starting whistle - and were promptly penalized when they entered the fritz walter stadium as dortmund went out on top in the seventh minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twin brother hamit altintop -lrb- r -rrb- has found a spot on the turkish national squad it would be the game , though , that manager 's heads in the league turned to the small city in the far west of germany .
altintop would equal dortmund 's ebi smolarek 's hat trick with one of his own to preserve at least one point for kaiserslautern . all of a sudden , halil altintop was a hot commodity .
one club in particular would be a natural for the 22-year-old turk who was born in gelsenkirchen - schalke .
his twin brother hamit already plays for the " royal blues , " so it would hardly be a surprise if halil returned to his hometown . " since i 've been with lautern , there has always been speculation about schalke , " he told sport-bild magazine .
one thing is certain , altintop , who plays on the turkish national squad and whose contract expires in june 2006 , will leave kaiserslautern at the end of the season .
lautern president rene c. jäggi understands altintop 's desire to depart the crisis-riddled club . " he definitely wants to play in international competition and he could make much more money with any top european club , " jäggi said . aspirations for turkey also while the speculation is still swirling around altintop , he not only is eyeing just whom he might play for in the bundesliga .
he wants to secure himself a spot with the turkish national team that is still fighting to qualify for the world cup in germany and believes that only when he is playing against the top clubs in europe will he have a chance of wearing turkish red on the pitch and not just on the bench . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the life of a striker is not easy as altintop -lrb- l -rrb- finds out against dortmund " a coach simply prefers a player who plays for a top club , " he said in sport-bild after seeing no action in the country 's world cup qualifiers in september despite an impressive start in the bundesliga .
" you have to play against teams like inter milan . " england 's wayne rooney found that out at everton and moved to manchester united .
that wo n't be possible for altintop if he stays at kaiserslautern .
just as the " red devils " announced that it left the red and entered the black by making a small profit in the 2004-05 business year , they will have to find a replacement for the striker who could give the club a going-away president by shooting enough goals to keep lautern in the top division . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chelsea 's robert huth singing the blues robert huth must be asking himself what happened .

the " red devils " are floundering towards the bottom of the league but the german-born turk has big plans . kaiserslautern managed to advance another round this week in the german cup .
they did it with a hard-fought 4-2 away victory on tuesday against third division side erfurt .
yet the win did nothing to relieve the pressure on coach michael henke .
in the bundesliga , lautern are just a point away from the relegation zone .
dissension inside the team and from outside -lrb- the fans -rrb- is reaching a fevered pitch . after the cup match on tuesday , henke railed against the erfurt squad by calling them " scheiss-ossis , " or " crap easterners " for not kicking the ball out of bounds towards the end of the game when a lautern player lay injured on the ground . it was indicative of the heat that henke and the team have been feeling over the past few weeks as they counted one disappointing match after another . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundesliga goalkeepers have been at the mercy of kaiserslautern 's halil altintop -lrb- l -rrb- this season one lautern player , forward halil altintop , has been spared the misery - at least directly .
while his teammates in back , the defenders , resemble more a sieve than a solid wall by giving up 25 goals so far , altintop has alone tallied 10 strikes , sharing the top slot in the bundesliga with bremen 's miroslav klose . " whoever allows that many goals in ten games should have nothing to do with this league , " was altintop 's reaction after last week 's 4-1 shellacking by mönchengladbach . dangerous strikers desired everywhere the fans are resorting to anything and everything to express their frustration with the club that over the past few years has been making a steady , plunge to the bottom of the standings . the joy of the 1997-98 title with coach otto rehhagel at the helm is long just a dream .
two weeks ago , the hard-core supporters vented their frustration by entering the stadium five minutes after the starting whistle - and were promptly penalized when they entered the fritz walter stadium as dortmund went out on top in the seventh minute . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : twin brother hamit altintop -lrb- r -rrb- has found a spot on the turkish national squad it would be the game , though , that manager 's heads in the league turned to the small city in the far west of germany .
altintop would equal dortmund 's ebi smolarek 's hat trick with one of his own to preserve at least one point for kaiserslautern . all of a sudden , halil altintop was a hot commodity .
one club in particular would be a natural for the 22-year-old turk who was born in gelsenkirchen - schalke .
his twin brother hamit already plays for the " royal blues , " so it would hardly be a surprise if halil returned to his hometown . " since i 've been with lautern , there has always been speculation about schalke , " he told sport-bild magazine .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.10.2005 airbus a380 deliveries run into rough weather großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the a380 touched down in frankfurt amid thick fog the airbus a380 made a flawless test landing in germany saturday .
despite its success , the european aircraft maker wo n't be delivering the gigantic planes on time to its buyers .
experts say it wo n't dent airbus ' image . it was an event few aviation fans were willing to miss .
as a prototype of the gigantic a380 , the world 's largest passenger airliner , swooped down from the skies to make a perfect landing at the frankfurt airport on saturday morning amid thick fog , tens of thousands of spectators held their breath in awe . while some clambered on stools they had brought along to get a good look at the 290-ton heavy machine coming to a halt at terminal 2 of the rhein-main airport , others held their cameras and mobile phones above their heads to capture the image . it was the first test landing of the long-haul aircraft outside the testing facilities in france and the main aim is to check the handling and maintenance of the a380 at a civil airport .
the aircraft will fly back to toulouse in france on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 is the world 's largest passenger plane it 's exactly a year since the a380 , designed to carry up to 853 passengers , took to the skies for the first time .
since its maiden flight on april 27 , the aircraft has undergone 110 test flights , clocking 380 flying hours , said tore prang , a spokesman of airbus . " the test results are excellent .
the performance is much better than expected , " he said , adding that it also held true for the craft 's fuel-consumption - at 2.9 liters of kerosene for 100 kilometers per passenger . the low consumption - 12 percent lower than all other large aircraft according to airbus - is an important selling point given that fuel usage now accounts for around 16 to 20 percent of the overall costs of an airline . delivery marred by delays until now , 16 customers have placed orders for 159 a380s which cost 292 million euros -lrb- $ 353 million -rrb- apiece .
the gulf-based airline emirates is the biggest buyer with 41 orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 final assembly line near toulouse but , what 's annoyed many is the fact that the european aircraft manufacturer has delayed the delivery of the airplanes .
thus , singapore airlines , which wanted to get the first of its 10 ordered airplanes by march , now has to wait longer . " the a380 will fly for 30 years - it 's not just a big deal if the planes begin flying in the first or the second half of the year , " said prang .
the amount of compensation that airbus has to shell out for its waiting customers , remains under wraps . the delivery is now scheduled to begin in december 2006 provided there are no further hiccups . one of the biggest hurdles is reportedly evacuating passengers from the plane .
according to international regulations , in the case of an emergency , 873 passengers must be able to leave the aircraft in the dark within 90 seconds by using slides . airbus however insists there are no more hitches on that front . " i 'm confident that there wo n't be any problems there , " said tore prang .
but , airbus has delayed tests for far and an evacuation check is now slated for feb 2006 . " encouraging start " however , some say that teething problems are normal when it comes to mammoth projects . it 's not unusual that there are delays , according to ulrich horstmann , aviation analyst at the bayerische landesbank .
horstmann predicted that the a380 would have a shining future .
he added that the 159 orders were an encouraging start given that many airlines only develop new jets after they prove their value on the market . " airbus can rake in returns due to its monopoly because there are n't any other aircraft in that class and boeing ca n't give a befitting reply , " said horstmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german lufthansa boeing 747 takes off at the frankfurt airport the american rival is developing a larger version of the 1969-created jumbo jet in the form of its 747 advanced , which with 450 seats can carry 50 more passengers . " but the 747 is perceived as an old aircraft , " according to horstmann . the americans however have a different strategy .
instead of concentrating on a new giant aircraft , boeing is expending its energies on developing the 787 , a long-haul aircraft with 250 seats .
in future , flexible direct flights will play a greater role than has been the case until now , is the american thinking .
at the same time , the market for large aircraft is too small to make a new development - which cost 13 billion euros in the case of the a380 - profitable . airbus catches up however airbus spokesman prang does n't buy the argument . " all airports which have growth problems have welcomed the arrival of the a380 , " prang said .
london 's heathrow airport for instance could then reach 10 million extra passengers by 2016 thanks to the a380 without having to organize more take-offs and landings , he pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus believes air passenger numbers worldwide will treble and , in the coming years , the worldwide air passenger figures would rise threefold , having an effect on all class segments , prang added . " boeing only has one strategy , we have both , " he said , pointing towards the planned a340 long-haul aircraft for around 300 passengers .
airbus is currently developing the a350 , an aircraft in the same class as boeing 's 787 .
it 's expected to hit the market by 2010 . " airbus has got lots of things right , " said aviation expert horstmann .
" just 10 years ago , it was the small player , which boeing did n't take seriously enough .
but , in the meantime it has convincing offers in all segments of civil aviation . " when it came to aircrafts with a seating capacity of more than 100 , boeing and aircraft manufacturer mcdonnell-douglas which boeing took over had a market share of 70 percent until the mid-1990s .
but now with over 50 percent of the market share , airbus is leading the way . horstmann does n't believe that the balance will tip sharply . " a two-way share of the pie is closer to a monopoly than one thinks , " he said . " they -lrb- airbus and boeing -rrb- may lower prices in individual instances , but they wo n't be in a cut-throat competition .

despite its success , the european aircraft maker wo n't be delivering the gigantic planes on time to its buyers .
experts say it wo n't dent airbus ' image . it was an event few aviation fans were willing to miss .
as a prototype of the gigantic a380 , the world 's largest passenger airliner , swooped down from the skies to make a perfect landing at the frankfurt airport on saturday morning amid thick fog , tens of thousands of spectators held their breath in awe . while some clambered on stools they had brought along to get a good look at the 290-ton heavy machine coming to a halt at terminal 2 of the rhein-main airport , others held their cameras and mobile phones above their heads to capture the image . it was the first test landing of the long-haul aircraft outside the testing facilities in france and the main aim is to check the handling and maintenance of the a380 at a civil airport .
the aircraft will fly back to toulouse in france on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 is the world 's largest passenger plane it 's exactly a year since the a380 , designed to carry up to 853 passengers , took to the skies for the first time .
since its maiden flight on april 27 , the aircraft has undergone 110 test flights , clocking 380 flying hours , said tore prang , a spokesman of airbus . " the test results are excellent .
the performance is much better than expected , " he said , adding that it also held true for the craft 's fuel-consumption - at 2.9 liters of kerosene for 100 kilometers per passenger . the low consumption - 12 percent lower than all other large aircraft according to airbus - is an important selling point given that fuel usage now accounts for around 16 to 20 percent of the overall costs of an airline . delivery marred by delays until now , 16 customers have placed orders for 159 a380s which cost 292 million euros -lrb- $ 353 million -rrb- apiece .
the gulf-based airline emirates is the biggest buyer with 41 orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 final assembly line near toulouse but , what 's annoyed many is the fact that the european aircraft manufacturer has delayed the delivery of the airplanes .
thus , singapore airlines , which wanted to get the first of its 10 ordered airplanes by march , now has to wait longer . " the a380 will fly for 30 years - it 's not just a big deal if the planes begin flying in the first or the second half of the year , " said prang .
the amount of compensation that airbus has to shell out for its waiting customers , remains under wraps . the delivery is now scheduled to begin in december 2006 provided there are no further hiccups . one of the biggest hurdles is reportedly evacuating passengers from the plane .
according to international regulations , in the case of an emergency , 873 passengers must be able to leave the aircraft in the dark within 90 seconds by using slides . airbus however insists there are no more hitches on that front . " i 'm confident that there wo n't be any problems there , " said tore prang .
but , airbus has delayed tests for far and an evacuation check is now slated for feb 2006 . " encouraging start " however , some say that teething problems are normal when it comes to mammoth projects . it 's not unusual that there are delays , according to ulrich horstmann , aviation analyst at the bayerische landesbank .
horstmann predicted that the a380 would have a shining future .
he added that the 159 orders were an encouraging start given that many airlines only develop new jets after they prove their value on the market . " airbus can rake in returns due to its monopoly because there are n't any other aircraft in that class and boeing ca n't give a befitting reply , " said horstmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german lufthansa boeing 747 takes off at the frankfurt airport the american rival is developing a larger version of the 1969-created jumbo jet in the form of its 747 advanced , which with 450 seats can carry 50 more passengers . " but the 747 is perceived as an old aircraft , " according to horstmann . the americans however have a different strategy .
instead of concentrating on a new giant aircraft , boeing is expending its energies on developing the 787 , a long-haul aircraft with 250 seats .
in future , flexible direct flights will play a greater role than has been the case until now , is the american thinking .
at the same time , the market for large aircraft is too small to make a new development - which cost 13 billion euros in the case of the a380 - profitable . airbus catches up however airbus spokesman prang does n't buy the argument . " all airports which have growth problems have welcomed the arrival of the a380 , " prang said .
london 's heathrow airport for instance could then reach 10 million extra passengers by 2016 thanks to the a380 without having to organize more take-offs and landings , he pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus believes air passenger numbers worldwide will treble and , in the coming years , the worldwide air passenger figures would rise threefold , having an effect on all class segments , prang added . " boeing only has one strategy , we have both , " he said , pointing towards the planned a340 long-haul aircraft for around 300 passengers .
airbus is currently developing the a350 , an aircraft in the same class as boeing 's 787 .
it 's expected to hit the market by 2010 . " airbus has got lots of things right , " said aviation expert horstmann .
" just 10 years ago , it was the small player , which boeing did n't take seriously enough .
but , in the meantime it has convincing offers in all segments of civil aviation . " when it came to aircrafts with a seating capacity of more than 100 , boeing and aircraft manufacturer mcdonnell-douglas which boeing took over had a market share of 70 percent until the mid-1990s .
but now with over 50 percent of the market share , airbus is leading the way . horstmann does n't believe that the balance will tip sharply . " a two-way share of the pie is closer to a monopoly than one thinks , " he said . " they -lrb- airbus and boeing -rrb- may lower prices in individual instances , but they wo n't be in a cut-throat competition .

bremen and hamburg also win as the top trio in the league is beginning to pull away . a five-game winning streak has done much to dampen the spirits of cologne 's fans but it did n't stop 50,000 of them from streaming to the rhein energie stadium to see their side face bayern munich .
the crowd fired their club on to a strong first-half performance that was highlighted by matthias scherz ' third season goal and a 1-0 lead .
but they filed out of the grounds disappointed as bayern defender lucio and midfielder michael ballack scored second-half goals to give munich the victory . the loss heightens the crisis in cologne as coach uwe rapolder has to wonder what can be done to gather the club 's first victory since a 2-1 defeat of mönchengladbach on september 17 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich coach felix magath waves his arms in disbelief but his side would win 2-1 in cologne it was not to be against a less than satisfactory performance from bayern in the eyes their coach felix magath .
that 's why it 's good to have international performers like lucio and ballack who can turn around even a bleak game . " we can be happy about a lucky victory , " commented magath dryly . it came about with some help from the referee whose decisions affected the game 's outcome .
ballack 's gamewinning head ball goal came in the 74th minute off a corner kick wrongly awarded to the league-leaders .
then in the waning moments , cologne were denied a penalty kick as lucio apparently used his hands to deflect the ball in the penalty box .
as magath said , it was a lucky victory . bremen overcome weak start to win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen 's miroslav klose clinches his fists in joy over his 11th strike of the season werder bremen remain two points behind munich in the standings after a clear 4-1 win over guests frankfurt .
the central germans came into bremen with a convincing 6-3 thrashing of cologne under their belts .
the excellent effort continued and coach friedhelm funkel 's team proved they could play with the best of them when ioannis amanatidis put them up 1-0 in the 19th minute . after that though , thomas schaaf 's bremen took control of the game .
international midfielder torsten frings knotted up the game with a head ball in the 29th minute and the score was 1-1 at half .
tim borowski scored twice and miroslav klose also found the net for his league-leading 11th goal although it was preceded by a hand ball . " after the go-ahead goal in the second half we could n't keep up with bremen .
it was a deserved victory for werder , " admitted funkel . third-place hamburg also kept pace with the best , and in the process handed schalke their first loss of the season .
defender mehdi mahdavikia scored the lone goal in the 19th minute in a roughly-played match in which referee fandel handed out five yellow cards and sent off schalke stopper christian poulsen for two bookings .
the " royal blues " now are a massive ten points behind bayern as this campaign is taking on the appearance of a three-horse race . gladbach series halted the biggest surprise in this young season has been borussia mönchengladbach .
they lost to their namesakes from dortmund 2-1 .
gladbach were never really in this match as the homeside borussia dortmund dictated play most of the game .
nevertheless , gladbach remain in fifth-place , even on points with schalke and berlin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a common sight : stuttgart 's goalkeeper dirk heinen watches the ball rolling over the goalline hertha berlin benefited from the schalke and gladbach losses in the most entertaining match on saturday , drawing 3-3 with stuttgart .
the guests from berlin led 1-0 after one half and then the fireworks began as the lead changed hand two times .
colorful berlin midfielder marchelinho has found his form again , having scored once and assisting on the other two goals .
stuttgart coach giovanni trapattoni 's side never surrendered though .
mario gomez got the equalizer with seven minutes remaining to save the italian coach who has had to listen to loads of rumors about his release this past week for the next match against nuremberg . henke also given a reprieve just like in stuttgart , kaiserslautern 's coach michael henke has been suffering under his squad 's sub-par performance .
he made the right decision as his team was behind 2-1 in the 87th minute by bringing on rarely-used turkish striker berkant götkan .
the 25-year old scored just three minutes later for a 2-2 final . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there , there , everything 's just fine , " would seem to be lautern coach michael henke 's -lrb- l -rrb- reaction " i 'm very disappointed , " said leverkusen coach michael skibbe who has yet to win in three matches with the club .
" that so many of our players were pushing up front -lrb- at the end -rrb- was completely unnecessary . " wolfsburg had gone through a tough three weeks .
coach holger fach 's side had come away with four hard-earned points against bayern munich , hamburg and schalke .
the game against duisburg was a well-deserved break but they underestimated the " zebras " who scored their second victory of the season , and even escaped the relegation zone with a 2-0 win that was hardly threatened by the toothless wolves . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wanted : a better team for altintop kaiserslautern 's halil altintop together with bremen 's miroslav klose , tops the bundesliga in goalscoring .

some 200 university students from more than 20 universities in 12 countries participated in the project under the esa 's initiative . the satellite is about the size of a standard washing machine and weighs about 62 kilograms . from the drawing board to the launch pad , the project took just 18 months with students relying on the internet as their principal means of exchanging data .
the esa provided the entire funding . " they -lrb- the satellites -rrb- are all in what we called a polar orbit , little below some 700 kilometers above our head so to speak and they have a number of technology experiments on board , " said heidi graff , a spokeswoman for esa .
" they are also testing a special new kind of solar cell , which is better in quality than the standard used to be , they will have a camera on board to try to take observation pictures and they have certain equipment on board with which they will communicate with radio amateurs all over the world , " graff added . hands-on training but even more than the technology , the uniqueness of the project lies in the fact that the entire undertaking was completed by the students themselves . the sseti , which provided the framework for the mission , was launched by esa ’ s education department in 2000 to get european students involved in real space missions , and well as give them practical hands-on experience and encourage them to take up careers in space technology and science . " it 's all done and built by the students themselves .
we more or less only financed the technical check out to make it qualify to go for launch .
it is the students who really have to get the credit , " said graff . one of the students , jürgen schlutz from the university of stuttgart who is one of 15 students studying aerospace engineering in the project propulsion team , said the hands-on training had been valuable . " we are all students of engineering but it 's a pretty much a theoretical approach , we did n't do much in the way of hardware -lrb- until now -rrb- , " schlutz said . " what we learned in the project was actually to build - what comes extra is all the involvement in the project itself , in project management , the work with student teams all over europe , the technical aspect and intercultural co-operation was something that was very valuable for team members , " he added . mark caldwell -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european aerospace aims for the moon leading german aerospace companies have urged the creation of an unmanned european space station on the moon , warning that europe could otherwise lose out to other nations in the race for space exploration and research .

despite its success , the european aircraft maker wo n't be delivering the gigantic planes on time to its buyers .
experts say it wo n't dent airbus ' image . it was an event few aviation fans were willing to miss .
as a prototype of the gigantic a380 , the world 's largest passenger airliner , swooped down from the skies to make a perfect landing at the frankfurt airport on saturday morning amid thick fog , tens of thousands of spectators held their breath in awe . while some clambered on stools they had brought along to get a good look at the 290-ton heavy machine coming to a halt at terminal 2 of the rhein-main airport , others held their cameras and mobile phones above their heads to capture the image . it was the first test landing of the long-haul aircraft outside the testing facilities in france and the main aim is to check the handling and maintenance of the a380 at a civil airport .
the aircraft will fly back to toulouse in france on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 is the world 's largest passenger plane it 's exactly a year since the a380 , designed to carry up to 853 passengers , took to the skies for the first time .
since its maiden flight on april 27 , the aircraft has undergone 110 test flights , clocking 380 flying hours , said tore prang , a spokesman of airbus . " the test results are excellent .
the performance is much better than expected , " he said , adding that it also held true for the craft 's fuel-consumption - at 2.9 liters of kerosene for 100 kilometers per passenger . the low consumption - 12 percent lower than all other large aircraft according to airbus - is an important selling point given that fuel usage now accounts for around 16 to 20 percent of the overall costs of an airline . delivery marred by delays until now , 16 customers have placed orders for 159 a380s which cost 292 million euros -lrb- $ 353 million -rrb- apiece .
the gulf-based airline emirates is the biggest buyer with 41 orders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the airbus a380 final assembly line near toulouse but , what 's annoyed many is the fact that the european aircraft manufacturer has delayed the delivery of the airplanes .
thus , singapore airlines , which wanted to get the first of its 10 ordered airplanes by march , now has to wait longer . " the a380 will fly for 30 years - it 's not just a big deal if the planes begin flying in the first or the second half of the year , " said prang .
the amount of compensation that airbus has to shell out for its waiting customers , remains under wraps . the delivery is now scheduled to begin in december 2006 provided there are no further hiccups . one of the biggest hurdles is reportedly evacuating passengers from the plane .
according to international regulations , in the case of an emergency , 873 passengers must be able to leave the aircraft in the dark within 90 seconds by using slides . airbus however insists there are no more hitches on that front . " i 'm confident that there wo n't be any problems there , " said tore prang .
but , airbus has delayed tests for far and an evacuation check is now slated for feb 2006 . " encouraging start " however , some say that teething problems are normal when it comes to mammoth projects . it 's not unusual that there are delays , according to ulrich horstmann , aviation analyst at the bayerische landesbank .
horstmann predicted that the a380 would have a shining future .
he added that the 159 orders were an encouraging start given that many airlines only develop new jets after they prove their value on the market . " airbus can rake in returns due to its monopoly because there are n't any other aircraft in that class and boeing ca n't give a befitting reply , " said horstmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german lufthansa boeing 747 takes off at the frankfurt airport the american rival is developing a larger version of the 1969-created jumbo jet in the form of its 747 advanced , which with 450 seats can carry 50 more passengers . " but the 747 is perceived as an old aircraft , " according to horstmann . the americans however have a different strategy .
instead of concentrating on a new giant aircraft , boeing is expending its energies on developing the 787 , a long-haul aircraft with 250 seats .
in future , flexible direct flights will play a greater role than has been the case until now , is the american thinking .
at the same time , the market for large aircraft is too small to make a new development - which cost 13 billion euros in the case of the a380 - profitable . airbus catches up however airbus spokesman prang does n't buy the argument . " all airports which have growth problems have welcomed the arrival of the a380 , " prang said .
london 's heathrow airport for instance could then reach 10 million extra passengers by 2016 thanks to the a380 without having to organize more take-offs and landings , he pointed out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus believes air passenger numbers worldwide will treble and , in the coming years , the worldwide air passenger figures would rise threefold , having an effect on all class segments , prang added . " boeing only has one strategy , we have both , " he said , pointing towards the planned a340 long-haul aircraft for around 300 passengers .
airbus is currently developing the a350 , an aircraft in the same class as boeing 's 787 .
it 's expected to hit the market by 2010 . " airbus has got lots of things right , " said aviation expert horstmann .
" just 10 years ago , it was the small player , which boeing did n't take seriously enough .
but , in the meantime it has convincing offers in all segments of civil aviation . " when it came to aircrafts with a seating capacity of more than 100 , boeing and aircraft manufacturer mcdonnell-douglas which boeing took over had a market share of 70 percent until the mid-1990s .
but now with over 50 percent of the market share , airbus is leading the way . horstmann does n't believe that the balance will tip sharply . " a two-way share of the pie is closer to a monopoly than one thinks , " he said .

from hate and evil a community of reconciliation can grow , which makes peace possible . " german president horst köhler acknowledged in his speech that many critics had suggested before the project began that the money would have been better spent on rebuilding the broken-down former east germany .
" did eastern germany not need roads , roofs and factories more than an expensive church ?
but a group of residents said dresden needed more .
and now we can see that those people were right , " köhler said .
the baroque church stood for decades as a decapitated , empty shell .
but that changed in 1990 when a group of people began gathering funds to rebuild it .
now , after a decade of reconstruction , the frauenkirche stands once again in its full splendor , with sunday 's consecration ceremony officially reopening the church to the public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche in ruins in 1945 people from around the world are visiting dresden for the festivities . outgoing chancellor gerhard schröder and his designated successor , angela merkel are there . britain , which led the bombing raids , has contributed more than one million euros in donations towards the reconstruction and the duke of kent , who is patron of the fundraising dresden trust , is attending sunday 's ceremony to represent the british royal family . the tens of thousands of spectators at sunday 's consecration can marvel at a golden cross and orb donated by the english city of coventry , which itself was flattened by german bombing during world war ii . the " sto n e bell " retur n s dresdeners themselves are particularly elated that their frauenkirche is finally opening its doors for protestant services following its restoration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church was rebuilt according to original plans until 1945 , the " stone bell " atop the frauenkirche lent the dresden skyline its distinctive silhouette .
ilse walter remembers when the church was bombed by british and american forces during world war ii . " spring was almost in the air on feb .
13 , 1945 , " she said .
" i remember it vividly .
i was sitting in the living room with my family listening to the radio .
they were playing relatively happy , light music when suddenly , right in the middle of the song , we heard the air raid sirens . " what ki n d of memorial ? what followed was one of the most destructive of all allied attacks , with tens of thousands losing their lives .
the city , dubbed " florence on the elbe " for its baroque splendor , was practically wiped out .
from a military perspective , no one even knows why the city was targeted .
the end of the war was already in sight , dresden had no garrisons , and its industry was outside city borders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche -lrb- left -rrb- is now part of dresden 's skyline again but destroyed it was and with it , dresden 's frauenkirche .
as the city was being rebuilt in the following decades , the church remained in shambles - a skeletal reference to an ugly past . many dresden citizens felt it should stay that way - a necessary reminder of war 's destruction .
but for others , the dilapidated frauenkirche was an eyesore .
it was time to move on , they believed .
not forget , but progress . a merger of past a n d prese n t in the end , those in favor of rebuilding the frauenkirche won .
yet the restored church 's architectural design reflects only part of the baroque style from the 1700s , when the original frauenkirche was built . " we had to delve into the baroque and middle ages and study how the stones were laid back then , " said eberhard burger , the reconstruction director .
" we have done that the same way now , but we 've used better materials .
so the reconstructed building is based on a mix of old and new techniques . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the church 's new golden cross about a third of the new frauenkirche building is made from the old , dark-colored stones that were left in the ruins .
the rest are new , light colored sandstones .
together they create a kind of mosaic of past and present .
the golden cross atop the church 's dome was even created by the son of an english pilot who dropped bombs on dresden in 1945 .
and of course , there is a new organ . a global project the total cost of the project came to 180 million euros -lrb- $ 218 million -rrb- . german historian arnulf baring , who as a boy witnessed the bombing in dresden , said he believes the project was worth the enormous cost and said it showed that germans could find elements of their past of which they can be proud . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the recreated frescoes inside the church " the frauenkirche was more than a church , it was a symbol of the downfall of a city , " baring told der spiegel magazine .
" i think it is a good thing that germans , wherever possible , regain part of their old cities , so they know that we come from somewhere . " and ludwig güttler , the chairman of the society to promote the reconstruction of the frauenkirche , said many nations had played a part in helping to restore the church to its former glory . " i am enormously grateful , " he told afp news service .
" not just for the donations , which have just kept coming , but for the level of interest shown by other countries .
so many people can say that this project is theirs - whether they be britons , americans , danes , poles or whatever else .

it is a first overseas engagement with his new wife , the duchess of cornwall .
before leaving on the eight-day trip , the prince will host the national hedgelaying championship at his gloucestershire farm .
' being relevant ' in the interview for 60 minutes , to be aired in the us on sunday night , he told the channel 's steve kroft that his charity , the prince 's trust , which gives job training to young people , would not have been possible without his efforts . "
it is n't easy , as you can imagine , because if you say anything people will say , ' it 's all right for you to say that " ' prince charles " i try -lrb- to make a difference -rrb- , " he said .

state-owned indian railways carries more than 11 million people daily over more than 100,000km of track .
the overwhelming majority of passengers travel in lower class carriages that are overcrowded and in many cases out of date .
much of the rail network still depends on an outdated signalling system that is manually operated .
it is no surprise , critics say , that accidents happen with depressing frequency .
the government is under increasing pressure to invest heavily in improving and modernising safety measures .
officials acknowledge that routine inspection and maintenance work has been hampered because of a lack of funds .
but they say investment in safety-related work has been stepped up .
' fewer accidents ' critics say the railways ministry has not implemented the findings of an inquiry commission into a train crash in 1998 , at khanna in punjab state , in which 200 people were killed .
the railway minister 's policies have left many less than happy following the crash , a committee set up by the railways ministry called for the immediate replacement of " over-aged safety-related assets " .
a special fund of $ 3bn was announced by the authorities to help renew track , rebuild bridges and enhance safety systems .
but many of the report 's measures have still to be introduced .
the government rejects claims it is foot dragging , however , and says the railway authorities have never compromised on safety .
railways spokesman my siddiqui told the bbc safety levels were improving - and there had been fewer accidents as a result .
he dismissed as a " freak incident " a train crash in maharashtra state in june 2004 .
other officials argue that with 14,000 trains running every day , the number of accidents can not be described as high .
flawed inquiries statistically the number of fatalities in train accidents remains low when compared to the number of people killed on indian roads .
the matsyagandha express crashed near bombay in june 2004 yet there have been a series of major rail accidents in recent years , with collisions the main cause of rail accident deaths .
many of them have been due to signalling faults .
india 's worst rail disaster was in 1981 when a cyclone blew a train off the tracks into a river in bihar , killing over 800 people .
every accident is followed by an official inquiry .
but lack of investment in infrastructure means action is seldom taken to enhance passenger safety even though most inquiries raise serious questions about railway management .
over the years different probes have concluded that accidents are due to signal failures - both mechanical and human - as well as derailments , collapsing bridges , poor safety procedures at level crossings and even bomb explosions .
officials say many accidents could be prevented by adopting modern technology and reducing human involvement , particularly in signalling and switching of tracks .
steps have been taken to develop optical fibre-based and digital communication signals at selected routes .
steam locomotives have been phased out and replaced with diesel and electric engines .
but observers point out that a full conversion of mechanical systems into state-of-the-art technology needs money and will take time .

state-owned indian railways carries more than 11 million people daily over more than 100,000km of track .
the overwhelming majority of passengers travel in lower class carriages that are overcrowded and in many cases out of date .
much of the rail network still depends on an outdated signalling system that is manually operated .
it is no surprise , critics say , that accidents happen with depressing frequency .
the government is under increasing pressure to invest heavily in improving and modernising safety measures .
officials acknowledge that routine inspection and maintenance work has been hampered because of a lack of funds .
but they say investment in safety-related work has been stepped up .
' fewer accidents ' critics say the railways ministry has not implemented the findings of an inquiry commission into a train crash in 1998 , at khanna in punjab state , in which 200 people were killed .
the railway minister 's policies have left many less than happy following the crash , a committee set up by the railways ministry called for the immediate replacement of " over-aged safety-related assets " .
a special fund of $ 3bn was announced by the authorities to help renew track , rebuild bridges and enhance safety systems .
but many of the report 's measures have still to be introduced .
the government rejects claims it is foot dragging , however , and says the railway authorities have never compromised on safety .
railways spokesman my siddiqui told the bbc safety levels were improving - and there had been fewer accidents as a result .
he dismissed as a " freak incident " a train crash in maharashtra state in june 2004 .

the national union of teachers -lrb- nut -rrb- claims many teachers face a " permanent pay cut " under a review of staffing .
teachers ' pay and conditions remain under uk government control , even though education in wales is devolved .
the department for education and skills said the changes would make schools more flexible , and reward teachers taking on important extra duties .
the responsibilities are still there .
the work that teachers need to do there is still there gethin lewis , nut cymru schools in england and wales were told last summer to overhaul their staffing structures , which in some cases will mean teachers lose money as " management allowances " are scrapped .
instead extra payments will focus on teaching roles , but staff may have to compete with colleagues for these - and they are not guaranteed to get the money .
the management allowances range from £ 1,638 to £ 10,572 , but a study found little consistency in how these were paid .
extra term sometimes the money was used to recruit or retain teachers , and it was often paid for administrative rather than management responsibilities .
the allowances will be replaced by teaching and learning responsibility -lrb- tlr -rrb- payments .
they will be payable at two levels - from £ 2,250 to £ 5,500 and from £ 6,500 to £ 11,000 .
the secondary heads ' association has welcomed the change as an opportunity to overhaul staffing structures and to focus extra payments on teaching .
but nut cymru secretary gethin lewis said the new system was " fraught with dangers " , and many teachers would lose money .
" the responsibilities are still there .
the work that teachers need to do there is still there , " said mr lewis .
the pay changes mean that heads and governors have the flexibility they need to structure their schools as they see fit department for education " but there wo n't be enough of the funding .
so we are afraid that teachers will lose their management allowances but they wo n't get the new tlrs and that 's where the union is saying we will have strike ballots if our members are losing pay . "
however , the union has welcomed the extra term that schools in wales will have to carry out the review .
the deadline in wales is the end of march 2006 , compared with december 2005 in england .
a department for education spokesperson said : " the pay changes mean that heads and governors have the flexibility they need to structure their schools as they see fit , to make best use of teachers ' expertise and reward those taking on significant additional responsibilities , in an open and fair way - which has often not been the case in the past .
" we have ensured that existing allowances will be safeguarded for up to three years - this was agreed with five unions and the employers ' association . "
the welsh assembly government said : " teachers ' pay and conditions of service are not devolved to the national assembly for wales and decisions for both wales and england are the responsibility of the department for education and skills . "

judge vincent gaughan rejected defence arguments in the chicago court that prosecutors were too vague about when the alleged crime took place .
judge gaughan 's decision takes mr kelly closer to trial in the three-year case .
his next court date is on 9 december .
the singer , 38 , has pleaded not guilty to 14 counts of child pornography .
prosecutors originally said the videotape in question was made during a nearly three-year span between january 1998 and october 2000 .
other charges dropped but they modified their timeframe , making it 18 months shorter , after a judge agreed in june it was too broad .
mr kelly 's defence lawyer ed genson was unavailable for comment .
in march 2004 , prosecutors in florida dropped all 12 child pornography charges against the singer .
a judge had ruled that photographs seized from the singer 's home allegedly showing him with an underage girl were seized illegally .
despite legal worries hanging over the performer for more than three years his career has not suffered .
he took top honours at 2004 's billboard 's annual r 'n'b / hip-hop awards , winning seven out of the eight categories he was nominated for .
the double-grammy winner , famed for his song i believe i can fly , has sold more than 23 million albums .
he has worked with the likes of michael and janet jackson , mary j blige , whitney houston and celine dion as well as a host of rap stars .
