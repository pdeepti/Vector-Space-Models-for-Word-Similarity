dw 's felix steiner looks back at her first few days in office . a new head of state 's first trip abroad is generally just a matter of protocol , leaving observers at pains to read any great significance into the choice of destination and host . but seven years ago , the freshly-minted chancellor gerhard schröder broke with time-honored tradition when he made for london rather than paris , where german chancellors have always gone first after their election . those were the heady days of the much-touted " third way " - the political vision shared by schröder and tony blair which started out so well and ended so badly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not the beginning of a beautiful friendship by the time schröder left government , europe 's political landscape had seen a major sea-change .
as he and french president jacques chirac became increasingly close allies in the wake of the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , relations between schröder and blair became increasingly hostile .
the cosy anglo-german chats that were a staple of former chancellor helmut kohl 's government became a distant memory . less european , more trans-atlantic against this backdrop , angela merkel 's decision to revert to form and make paris her first official outing abroad was a shrewd one . much to the chagrin of the rest of europe , france and germany have enjoyed a special relationship ever since they signed the elysee treaty in 1963 - but with chirac , merkel went out of her way to stress that their relationship should n't mean they cold-shouldered other member states who 've made no secret in recent years of the fact they feel excluded . her point made , she turned on her heels and headed for her next port of call , brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and jaap de hoop scheffer in brussels her timetable in brussels had its own symbolism .
first , merkel met with nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer , where she spelt out that improving ties between the us and germany was top of her list of priorities .
then she moved on to a meeting with eu commission president jose barroso , reaffirming her new coalition government 's intention to revive the much maligned eu constitution , which has been on hold in recent months . scuppering the critics in london a day later , she and tony blair discussed the eu budget row , a question blair is eager to resolve before britain hands over the eu 's rotating presidency at the end of december . germany 's position on the issue is a crucial one , and blair is well aware of how much he needs merkel to play a conciliatory role in its settlement .
but the chancellor was n't going to be drawn on the issue , simply making it clear that she had no intention of tolerating an outcome that would leave germany shouldering the eu 's financial burden - as has so often happened in the last few decades . it was a message she conveyed at every stop-over this week .
but even so , in paris , brussels and london , merkel came across like a leader who would rather avoid going her own way and making overly hasty decisions .
she might be a novice , but she demonstrated respectable diplomatic finesse and all in all , made a decent debut appearance on the international stage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the best yet to come ?
her first three days in office have gone some way to scuppering her critics ' claims she is n't up to the job . in fact , merkel has already demonstrated that she has what it takes to be a formidable new force in european politics . felix steiner -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair , merkel emphasize eu cooperation german chancellor angela merkel and tony blair talked of increasing cooperation across the eu ahead of sticky budget talks .

while the issue over secret cia prisons in europe continues to simmer , new allegations over undisclosed cia flights transporting suspected terrorists is pushing european officials to demand answers from washington . the cia continues to use an american military base in germany to transport terrorism suspects without informing the german government , business daily handelsblatt reported thursday .
quoting a high-ranking cia official in washington , the newspaper reported that such flights carrying prisoners were still stopping off at the us base at ramstein . " the cia planes have made stop-overs in several european countries , including germany , " the cia official told handelsblatt .
" nothing has changed that . " meanwhile , the berliner zeitung reported friday there was documentation of 85 takeoffs and landings by planes with a " high probability " of being operated by the cia , at ramstein , the rhine-main airbase and others .
the newspaper cited experts and " plane-spotters " who observed the planes as responsible for the tally . handelsblatt had written that the cia transports its prisoners through multiple european airports either to guantanamo bay or to the alleged secret prisons , so-called " black sites " in eastern europe . german politicians , who have remained quiet for the most part over the issue of black sites in europe , are beginning to call for answers from washington . a green party member of the german parliament 's committee overseeing the intelligence services , hans-christian ströbele , called for an explanation from the german government .
he said it had to be established whether people crossing german soil had been taken into circumstances not in line with human rights . ströbele added that foreign secret services should not be allowed to operate in germany . eu wants a response the council of europe , an independent body , appointed swiss official dick marty to investigate the existence of secret cia detention centers .
marty said satellite images might be used to help determine if the prisons exist .
eu officials , initially reluctant to comment on the matter , have begun to publicly call for a response from washington .
justice commissioner franco frattini said thursday the bloc would seek answers from washington after eu states sent a joint letter to washington on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alleged secret prisons might also use torture the washington post reported earlier this month that the cia used facilities in eastern europe and in asia to hold suspected terrorists .
us-based ngo human rights watch said afterwards that it believes such prisons exist in romania and poland .
both countries have denied the allegations . however , the role of cia flights in the extra-judicial capture of suspected terrorists involves numerous european countries , including iceland , norway , spain and sweden .
most of the flights were alleged to have occurred in 2002 and 2003 , but the newspaper reported that such a plane landed at amsterdam 's airport only last week , and that the intelligence agency uses a number of firms to disguise the flights . painful for washington the issue could have serious consequences for both washington and european countries .
if such prisons are found in eu territory , they would likely violate european conventions on human rights .
if they exist in countries such as romania , they could threaten its application to the eu . the matter could also call into question european participation in the war on terror .
for example , dutch foreign minister bernard bot recently told his country 's parliament that the existence of such prisons in europe would have " consequences " for dutch military operations in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania and poland deny the prisons the cia source told handelsblatt that the discovery of cia practices was " very painful " for employees .
another us government official said that the us plans to answer european concerns soon .
and a top us official on wednesday acknowledged mounting eu pressure for washington to come clean about reports of secret cia prisons in eastern europe while stressing his country 's right to protect itself against terrorists . assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs dan fried said he had discussed the matter with various european officials during talks in berlin , vienna , madrid and brussels last week , but he refused to elaborate . " i do n't want to attempt to characterize our discussions with allies on this , " he told afp .
" the issue came up in a number of ways , in a number of places . " he underlined , however , the us right to wage a battle against terrorism . " we have a duty to protect our people and to do our best to protect others from terrorists , " he said .
" we are conducting this struggle in a manner consistent with our values and our international obligations and will continue to do that .

" europe remains a major market for stimulant drugs and indicators suggest that the trend in amphetamine , ecstasy and cocaine use continues to be upwards , " revealed the 2005 annual report compiled by the lisbon-based european monitoring center for drug addiction -lrb- emccd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine has a glamourous reputation around 9 million people in the eu , 3 percent of all adults , have tried cocaine .
but when it comes to the drug of choice , cannabis continues to be on top .
more than 62 million europeans have tried it , while 9.5 million are categorized as regular users , according to the report published on thursday .
germans are especially fond of the drug , with 15 percent between 15-34 having smoked or ingested cannabis last year , the fifth highest figure in europe and just above the european average . but the report also revealed that eu drug decriminalization measures and better treatment programs are showing results .
experts said the shift in eu strategy to prevention , not punishment , has proven to be more effective . punishing trafficker , not user bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : treatment for addicts has improved " the eu has been making some progress with its anti-drugs strategies , " said klaus hurrelmann , a drugs expert at bielefeld university .
the increased tendency to look at the roots rather than the symptoms of the problem has been one of the most positive developments in recent years , he said . " there 's been a shift away from penalizing consumers towards getting tough on traffickers , " he said . the emphasis on decriminalization coupled with a push for better education and treatment has led to positive developments in the fight against heroin .
the total number of clients in substitution treatment has passed the half million mark in the european union , according to the report . heroin boom does n't materialize following a seven-fold increase over the last decade , says the emccd , at least 530,000 clients now receive substitution treatment across 28 countries whether through specialist treatment centers or general practitioners .
and it is estimated that somewhere between one-quarter and a half of those with opiate problems in europe may now be receiving treatment of this kind .

" but demand is simply no longer there , " said simon .
" there 's actually been a stabilization of the opiate scene , with far fewer new users and far better treatment programs . " eastern europe increasing drug use the news is n't good for all of europe .
improving economies in eastern europe have led to more users - especially of cannabis - in the new eu countries , said simon . " opiates used to arrive in europe via the balkan route , including bulgaria and the former yugoslavia , and once these countries themselves became financially attractive to drug traffickers , a large percentage of the opiates would remain there , " he explained .
" the same is now happening with drugs passing through supply channels in eastern europe such as the czech republic , where there 's more money circulating than there used to be .

while the issue over secret cia prisons in europe continues to simmer , new allegations over undisclosed cia flights transporting suspected terrorists is pushing european officials to demand answers from washington . the cia continues to use an american military base in germany to transport terrorism suspects without informing the german government , business daily handelsblatt reported thursday .
quoting a high-ranking cia official in washington , the newspaper reported that such flights carrying prisoners were still stopping off at the us base at ramstein . " the cia planes have made stop-overs in several european countries , including germany , " the cia official told handelsblatt .
" nothing has changed that . " meanwhile , the berliner zeitung reported friday there was documentation of 85 takeoffs and landings by planes with a " high probability " of being operated by the cia , at ramstein , the rhine-main airbase and others .
the newspaper cited experts and " plane-spotters " who observed the planes as responsible for the tally . handelsblatt had written that the cia transports its prisoners through multiple european airports either to guantanamo bay or to the alleged secret prisons , so-called " black sites " in eastern europe . german politicians , who have remained quiet for the most part over the issue of black sites in europe , are beginning to call for answers from washington . a green party member of the german parliament 's committee overseeing the intelligence services , hans-christian ströbele , called for an explanation from the german government .
he said it had to be established whether people crossing german soil had been taken into circumstances not in line with human rights . ströbele added that foreign secret services should not be allowed to operate in germany . eu wants a response the council of europe , an independent body , appointed swiss official dick marty to investigate the existence of secret cia detention centers .
marty said satellite images might be used to help determine if the prisons exist .
eu officials , initially reluctant to comment on the matter , have begun to publicly call for a response from washington .
justice commissioner franco frattini said thursday the bloc would seek answers from washington after eu states sent a joint letter to washington on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alleged secret prisons might also use torture the washington post reported earlier this month that the cia used facilities in eastern europe and in asia to hold suspected terrorists .
us-based ngo human rights watch said afterwards that it believes such prisons exist in romania and poland .
both countries have denied the allegations . however , the role of cia flights in the extra-judicial capture of suspected terrorists involves numerous european countries , including iceland , norway , spain and sweden .
most of the flights were alleged to have occurred in 2002 and 2003 , but the newspaper reported that such a plane landed at amsterdam 's airport only last week , and that the intelligence agency uses a number of firms to disguise the flights . painful for washington the issue could have serious consequences for both washington and european countries .
if such prisons are found in eu territory , they would likely violate european conventions on human rights .
if they exist in countries such as romania , they could threaten its application to the eu . the matter could also call into question european participation in the war on terror .
for example , dutch foreign minister bernard bot recently told his country 's parliament that the existence of such prisons in europe would have " consequences " for dutch military operations in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania and poland deny the prisons the cia source told handelsblatt that the discovery of cia practices was " very painful " for employees .
another us government official said that the us plans to answer european concerns soon .
and a top us official on wednesday acknowledged mounting eu pressure for washington to come clean about reports of secret cia prisons in eastern europe while stressing his country 's right to protect itself against terrorists . assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs dan fried said he had discussed the matter with various european officials during talks in berlin , vienna , madrid and brussels last week , but he refused to elaborate . " i do n't want to attempt to characterize our discussions with allies on this , " he told afp .
" the issue came up in a number of ways , in a number of places . " he underlined , however , the us right to wage a battle against terrorism . " we have a duty to protect our people and to do our best to protect others from terrorists , " he said .
" we are conducting this struggle in a manner consistent with our values and our international obligations and will continue to do that .

he said it had to be established whether people crossing german soil had been taken into circumstances not in line with human rights . ströbele added that foreign secret services should not be allowed to operate in germany . eu wants a response the council of europe , an independent body , appointed swiss official dick marty to investigate the existence of secret cia detention centers .
marty said satellite images might be used to help determine if the prisons exist .
eu officials , initially reluctant to comment on the matter , have begun to publicly call for a response from washington .
justice commissioner franco frattini said thursday the bloc would seek answers from washington after eu states sent a joint letter to washington on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alleged secret prisons might also use torture the washington post reported earlier this month that the cia used facilities in eastern europe and in asia to hold suspected terrorists .
us-based ngo human rights watch said afterwards that it believes such prisons exist in romania and poland .
both countries have denied the allegations . however , the role of cia flights in the extra-judicial capture of suspected terrorists involves numerous european countries , including iceland , norway , spain and sweden .
most of the flights were alleged to have occurred in 2002 and 2003 , but the newspaper reported that such a plane landed at amsterdam 's airport only last week , and that the intelligence agency uses a number of firms to disguise the flights . painful for washington the issue could have serious consequences for both washington and european countries .
if such prisons are found in eu territory , they would likely violate european conventions on human rights .
if they exist in countries such as romania , they could threaten its application to the eu . the matter could also call into question european participation in the war on terror .
for example , dutch foreign minister bernard bot recently told his country 's parliament that the existence of such prisons in europe would have " consequences " for dutch military operations in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania and poland deny the prisons the cia source told handelsblatt that the discovery of cia practices was " very painful " for employees .
another us government official said that the us plans to answer european concerns soon .
and a top us official on wednesday acknowledged mounting eu pressure for washington to come clean about reports of secret cia prisons in eastern europe while stressing his country 's right to protect itself against terrorists . assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs dan fried said he had discussed the matter with various european officials during talks in berlin , vienna , madrid and brussels last week , but he refused to elaborate . " i do n't want to attempt to characterize our discussions with allies on this , " he told afp .
" the issue came up in a number of ways , in a number of places . " he underlined , however , the us right to wage a battle against terrorism . " we have a duty to protect our people and to do our best to protect others from terrorists , " he said .
" we are conducting this struggle in a manner consistent with our values and our international obligations and will continue to do that .

" europe remains a major market for stimulant drugs and indicators suggest that the trend in amphetamine , ecstasy and cocaine use continues to be upwards , " revealed the 2005 annual report compiled by the lisbon-based european monitoring center for drug addiction -lrb- emccd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine has a glamourous reputation around 9 million people in the eu , 3 percent of all adults , have tried cocaine .
but when it comes to the drug of choice , cannabis continues to be on top .
more than 62 million europeans have tried it , while 9.5 million are categorized as regular users , according to the report published on thursday .
germans are especially fond of the drug , with 15 percent between 15-34 having smoked or ingested cannabis last year , the fifth highest figure in europe and just above the european average . but the report also revealed that eu drug decriminalization measures and better treatment programs are showing results .
experts said the shift in eu strategy to prevention , not punishment , has proven to be more effective . punishing trafficker , not user bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : treatment for addicts has improved " the eu has been making some progress with its anti-drugs strategies , " said klaus hurrelmann , a drugs expert at bielefeld university .
the increased tendency to look at the roots rather than the symptoms of the problem has been one of the most positive developments in recent years , he said . " there 's been a shift away from penalizing consumers towards getting tough on traffickers , " he said . the emphasis on decriminalization coupled with a push for better education and treatment has led to positive developments in the fight against heroin .
the total number of clients in substitution treatment has passed the half million mark in the european union , according to the report . heroin boom does n't materialize following a seven-fold increase over the last decade , says the emccd , at least 530,000 clients now receive substitution treatment across 28 countries whether through specialist treatment centers or general practitioners .
and it is estimated that somewhere between one-quarter and a half of those with opiate problems in europe may now be receiving treatment of this kind .

" but demand is simply no longer there , " said simon .
" there 's actually been a stabilization of the opiate scene , with far fewer new users and far better treatment programs . " eastern europe increasing drug use the news is n't good for all of europe .

" opiates used to arrive in europe via the balkan route , including bulgaria and the former yugoslavia , and once these countries themselves became financially attractive to drug traffickers , a large percentage of the opiates would remain there , " he explained .

" europe remains a major market for stimulant drugs and indicators suggest that the trend in amphetamine , ecstasy and cocaine use continues to be upwards , " revealed the 2005 annual report compiled by the lisbon-based european monitoring center for drug addiction -lrb- emccd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine has a glamourous reputation around 9 million people in the eu , 3 percent of all adults , have tried cocaine .
but when it comes to the drug of choice , cannabis continues to be on top .
more than 62 million europeans have tried it , while 9.5 million are categorized as regular users , according to the report published on thursday .
germans are especially fond of the drug , with 15 percent between 15-34 having smoked or ingested cannabis last year , the fifth highest figure in europe and just above the european average . but the report also revealed that eu drug decriminalization measures and better treatment programs are showing results .
experts said the shift in eu strategy to prevention , not punishment , has proven to be more effective . punishing trafficker , not user bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : treatment for addicts has improved " the eu has been making some progress with its anti-drugs strategies , " said klaus hurrelmann , a drugs expert at bielefeld university .
the increased tendency to look at the roots rather than the symptoms of the problem has been one of the most positive developments in recent years , he said . " there 's been a shift away from penalizing consumers towards getting tough on traffickers , " he said . the emphasis on decriminalization coupled with a push for better education and treatment has led to positive developments in the fight against heroin .
the total number of clients in substitution treatment has passed the half million mark in the european union , according to the report . heroin boom does n't materialize following a seven-fold increase over the last decade , says the emccd , at least 530,000 clients now receive substitution treatment across 28 countries whether through specialist treatment centers or general practitioners .
and it is estimated that somewhere between one-quarter and a half of those with opiate problems in europe may now be receiving treatment of this kind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black markets weaken economies roland simon , of the german watchdog for drugs and drug addiction , the dbdd , points out another positive side-effect of the eu 's education and treatment agenda . " many expected to see an increase in heroin trafficking post 9/11 , " he pointed out , referring to the fact that although the former taliban government banned poppy production , harvests have risen to record levels since the us-led invasion of afghanistan . " but demand is simply no longer there , " said simon .
" there 's actually been a stabilization of the opiate scene , with far fewer new users and far better treatment programs . " eastern europe increasing drug use the news is n't good for all of europe .
improving economies in eastern europe have led to more users - especially of cannabis - in the new eu countries , said simon . " opiates used to arrive in europe via the balkan route , including bulgaria and the former yugoslavia , and once these countries themselves became financially attractive to drug traffickers , a large percentage of the opiates would remain there , " he explained .
" the same is now happening with drugs passing through supply channels in eastern europe such as the czech republic , where there 's more money circulating than there used to be . " the report also warns of the increase in violations of drug law , and says the eu is still a long way from getting a grip on trafficking , a point with which hurrelmann agrees . a call for strategic legalization # b # " the eu has failed either to reduce the consumption of illegal drugs or to tackle the ever-growing black market , " said hurrelmann .
" as the consumption of cannabis and the so-called party drugs increases , the black market continues to grow exponentially .
in this respect , eu drug policy has been simply inefficient . " " there needs to be a european-wide discussion about a strategic legalization that would allow for product control , " he proposed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.11.2005 opinion : merkel debuts abroad with aplomb großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it started with a kiss angela merkel was sworn in as germany 's first female chancellor on tuesday , and wasted no time setting off on a whistle-stop tour of europe .
dw 's felix steiner looks back at her first few days in office . a new head of state 's first trip abroad is generally just a matter of protocol , leaving observers at pains to read any great significance into the choice of destination and host . but seven years ago , the freshly-minted chancellor gerhard schröder broke with time-honored tradition when he made for london rather than paris , where german chancellors have always gone first after their election . those were the heady days of the much-touted " third way " - the political vision shared by schröder and tony blair which started out so well and ended so badly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not the beginning of a beautiful friendship by the time schröder left government , europe 's political landscape had seen a major sea-change .
as he and french president jacques chirac became increasingly close allies in the wake of the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , relations between schröder and blair became increasingly hostile .
the cosy anglo-german chats that were a staple of former chancellor helmut kohl 's government became a distant memory . less european , more trans-atlantic against this backdrop , angela merkel 's decision to revert to form and make paris her first official outing abroad was a shrewd one . much to the chagrin of the rest of europe , france and germany have enjoyed a special relationship ever since they signed the elysee treaty in 1963 - but with chirac , merkel went out of her way to stress that their relationship should n't mean they cold-shouldered other member states who 've made no secret in recent years of the fact they feel excluded . her point made , she turned on her heels and headed for her next port of call , brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and jaap de hoop scheffer in brussels her timetable in brussels had its own symbolism .
first , merkel met with nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer , where she spelt out that improving ties between the us and germany was top of her list of priorities .
then she moved on to a meeting with eu commission president jose barroso , reaffirming her new coalition government 's intention to revive the much maligned eu constitution , which has been on hold in recent months . scuppering the critics in london a day later , she and tony blair discussed the eu budget row , a question blair is eager to resolve before britain hands over the eu 's rotating presidency at the end of december . germany 's position on the issue is a crucial one , and blair is well aware of how much he needs merkel to play a conciliatory role in its settlement .
but the chancellor was n't going to be drawn on the issue , simply making it clear that she had no intention of tolerating an outcome that would leave germany shouldering the eu 's financial burden - as has so often happened in the last few decades . it was a message she conveyed at every stop-over this week .
but even so , in paris , brussels and london , merkel came across like a leader who would rather avoid going her own way and making overly hasty decisions .
she might be a novice , but she demonstrated respectable diplomatic finesse and all in all , made a decent debut appearance on the international stage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the best yet to come ?
her first three days in office have gone some way to scuppering her critics ' claims she is n't up to the job . in fact , merkel has already demonstrated that she has what it takes to be a formidable new force in european politics . felix steiner -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair , merkel emphasize eu cooperation german chancellor angela merkel and tony blair talked of increasing cooperation across the eu ahead of sticky budget talks .
but both ducked questions on key issues following their first meeting .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black markets weaken economies roland simon , of the german watchdog for drugs and drug addiction , the dbdd , points out another positive side-effect of the eu 's education and treatment agenda . " many expected to see an increase in heroin trafficking post 9/11 , " he pointed out , referring to the fact that although the former taliban government banned poppy production , harvests have risen to record levels since the us-led invasion of afghanistan . " but demand is simply no longer there , " said simon .
" there 's actually been a stabilization of the opiate scene , with far fewer new users and far better treatment programs . " eastern europe increasing drug use the news is n't good for all of europe .
improving economies in eastern europe have led to more users - especially of cannabis - in the new eu countries , said simon . " opiates used to arrive in europe via the balkan route , including bulgaria and the former yugoslavia , and once these countries themselves became financially attractive to drug traffickers , a large percentage of the opiates would remain there , " he explained .
" the same is now happening with drugs passing through supply channels in eastern europe such as the czech republic , where there 's more money circulating than there used to be . " the report also warns of the increase in violations of drug law , and says the eu is still a long way from getting a grip on trafficking , a point with which hurrelmann agrees . a call for strategic legalization # b # " the eu has failed either to reduce the consumption of illegal drugs or to tackle the ever-growing black market , " said hurrelmann .
" as the consumption of cannabis and the so-called party drugs increases , the black market continues to grow exponentially .
in this respect , eu drug policy has been simply inefficient . " " there needs to be a european-wide discussion about a strategic legalization that would allow for product control , " he proposed .
" for the time being , what we have are black markets undermining the economies of the production countries as well as our own .
but any talk of strategic legalization is still a highly taboo political subject .

while the issue over secret cia prisons in europe continues to simmer , new allegations over undisclosed cia flights transporting suspected terrorists is pushing european officials to demand answers from washington . the cia continues to use an american military base in germany to transport terrorism suspects without informing the german government , business daily handelsblatt reported thursday .
quoting a high-ranking cia official in washington , the newspaper reported that such flights carrying prisoners were still stopping off at the us base at ramstein . " the cia planes have made stop-overs in several european countries , including germany , " the cia official told handelsblatt .
" nothing has changed that . " meanwhile , the berliner zeitung reported friday there was documentation of 85 takeoffs and landings by planes with a " high probability " of being operated by the cia , at ramstein , the rhine-main airbase and others .
the newspaper cited experts and " plane-spotters " who observed the planes as responsible for the tally . handelsblatt had written that the cia transports its prisoners through multiple european airports either to guantanamo bay or to the alleged secret prisons , so-called " black sites " in eastern europe . german politicians , who have remained quiet for the most part over the issue of black sites in europe , are beginning to call for answers from washington . a green party member of the german parliament 's committee overseeing the intelligence services , hans-christian ströbele , called for an explanation from the german government .
he said it had to be established whether people crossing german soil had been taken into circumstances not in line with human rights . ströbele added that foreign secret services should not be allowed to operate in germany . eu wants a response the council of europe , an independent body , appointed swiss official dick marty to investigate the existence of secret cia detention centers .
marty said satellite images might be used to help determine if the prisons exist .
eu officials , initially reluctant to comment on the matter , have begun to publicly call for a response from washington .
justice commissioner franco frattini said thursday the bloc would seek answers from washington after eu states sent a joint letter to washington on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alleged secret prisons might also use torture the washington post reported earlier this month that the cia used facilities in eastern europe and in asia to hold suspected terrorists .
us-based ngo human rights watch said afterwards that it believes such prisons exist in romania and poland .
both countries have denied the allegations . however , the role of cia flights in the extra-judicial capture of suspected terrorists involves numerous european countries , including iceland , norway , spain and sweden .
most of the flights were alleged to have occurred in 2002 and 2003 , but the newspaper reported that such a plane landed at amsterdam 's airport only last week , and that the intelligence agency uses a number of firms to disguise the flights . painful for washington the issue could have serious consequences for both washington and european countries .
if such prisons are found in eu territory , they would likely violate european conventions on human rights .
if they exist in countries such as romania , they could threaten its application to the eu . the matter could also call into question european participation in the war on terror .
for example , dutch foreign minister bernard bot recently told his country 's parliament that the existence of such prisons in europe would have " consequences " for dutch military operations in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania and poland deny the prisons the cia source told handelsblatt that the discovery of cia practices was " very painful " for employees .

while the issue over secret cia prisons in europe continues to simmer , new allegations over undisclosed cia flights transporting suspected terrorists is pushing european officials to demand answers from washington . the cia continues to use an american military base in germany to transport terrorism suspects without informing the german government , business daily handelsblatt reported thursday .
quoting a high-ranking cia official in washington , the newspaper reported that such flights carrying prisoners were still stopping off at the us base at ramstein . " the cia planes have made stop-overs in several european countries , including germany , " the cia official told handelsblatt .
" nothing has changed that . " meanwhile , the berliner zeitung reported friday there was documentation of 85 takeoffs and landings by planes with a " high probability " of being operated by the cia , at ramstein , the rhine-main airbase and others .
the newspaper cited experts and " plane-spotters " who observed the planes as responsible for the tally . handelsblatt had written that the cia transports its prisoners through multiple european airports either to guantanamo bay or to the alleged secret prisons , so-called " black sites " in eastern europe . german politicians , who have remained quiet for the most part over the issue of black sites in europe , are beginning to call for answers from washington . a green party member of the german parliament 's committee overseeing the intelligence services , hans-christian ströbele , called for an explanation from the german government .
he said it had to be established whether people crossing german soil had been taken into circumstances not in line with human rights . ströbele added that foreign secret services should not be allowed to operate in germany . eu wants a response the council of europe , an independent body , appointed swiss official dick marty to investigate the existence of secret cia detention centers .
marty said satellite images might be used to help determine if the prisons exist .
eu officials , initially reluctant to comment on the matter , have begun to publicly call for a response from washington .
justice commissioner franco frattini said thursday the bloc would seek answers from washington after eu states sent a joint letter to washington on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alleged secret prisons might also use torture the washington post reported earlier this month that the cia used facilities in eastern europe and in asia to hold suspected terrorists .
us-based ngo human rights watch said afterwards that it believes such prisons exist in romania and poland .
both countries have denied the allegations . however , the role of cia flights in the extra-judicial capture of suspected terrorists involves numerous european countries , including iceland , norway , spain and sweden .
most of the flights were alleged to have occurred in 2002 and 2003 , but the newspaper reported that such a plane landed at amsterdam 's airport only last week , and that the intelligence agency uses a number of firms to disguise the flights . painful for washington the issue could have serious consequences for both washington and european countries .
if such prisons are found in eu territory , they would likely violate european conventions on human rights .
if they exist in countries such as romania , they could threaten its application to the eu . the matter could also call into question european participation in the war on terror .
for example , dutch foreign minister bernard bot recently told his country 's parliament that the existence of such prisons in europe would have " consequences " for dutch military operations in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania and poland deny the prisons the cia source told handelsblatt that the discovery of cia practices was " very painful " for employees .
another us government official said that the us plans to answer european concerns soon .
and a top us official on wednesday acknowledged mounting eu pressure for washington to come clean about reports of secret cia prisons in eastern europe while stressing his country 's right to protect itself against terrorists . assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs dan fried said he had discussed the matter with various european officials during talks in berlin , vienna , madrid and brussels last week , but he refused to elaborate . " i do n't want to attempt to characterize our discussions with allies on this , " he told afp .
" the issue came up in a number of ways , in a number of places . " he underlined , however , the us right to wage a battle against terrorism . " we have a duty to protect our people and to do our best to protect others from terrorists , " he said .
" we are conducting this struggle in a manner consistent with our values and our international obligations and will continue to do that .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.11.2005 europe fails to tame drug problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lifestyle choice the eu 's annual report on the state of the narcotics problem in europe reveals that cannabis is still the drug of choice of europe 's population - and demand is increasing . " europe remains a major market for stimulant drugs and indicators suggest that the trend in amphetamine , ecstasy and cocaine use continues to be upwards , " revealed the 2005 annual report compiled by the lisbon-based european monitoring center for drug addiction -lrb- emccd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine has a glamourous reputation around 9 million people in the eu , 3 percent of all adults , have tried cocaine .
but when it comes to the drug of choice , cannabis continues to be on top .
more than 62 million europeans have tried it , while 9.5 million are categorized as regular users , according to the report published on thursday .
germans are especially fond of the drug , with 15 percent between 15-34 having smoked or ingested cannabis last year , the fifth highest figure in europe and just above the european average . but the report also revealed that eu drug decriminalization measures and better treatment programs are showing results .
experts said the shift in eu strategy to prevention , not punishment , has proven to be more effective . punishing trafficker , not user bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : treatment for addicts has improved " the eu has been making some progress with its anti-drugs strategies , " said klaus hurrelmann , a drugs expert at bielefeld university .
the increased tendency to look at the roots rather than the symptoms of the problem has been one of the most positive developments in recent years , he said . " there 's been a shift away from penalizing consumers towards getting tough on traffickers , " he said . the emphasis on decriminalization coupled with a push for better education and treatment has led to positive developments in the fight against heroin .
the total number of clients in substitution treatment has passed the half million mark in the european union , according to the report . heroin boom does n't materialize following a seven-fold increase over the last decade , says the emccd , at least 530,000 clients now receive substitution treatment across 28 countries whether through specialist treatment centers or general practitioners .
and it is estimated that somewhere between one-quarter and a half of those with opiate problems in europe may now be receiving treatment of this kind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black markets weaken economies roland simon , of the german watchdog for drugs and drug addiction , the dbdd , points out another positive side-effect of the eu 's education and treatment agenda . " many expected to see an increase in heroin trafficking post 9/11 , " he pointed out , referring to the fact that although the former taliban government banned poppy production , harvests have risen to record levels since the us-led invasion of afghanistan . " but demand is simply no longer there , " said simon .
" there 's actually been a stabilization of the opiate scene , with far fewer new users and far better treatment programs . " eastern europe increasing drug use the news is n't good for all of europe .
improving economies in eastern europe have led to more users - especially of cannabis - in the new eu countries , said simon . " opiates used to arrive in europe via the balkan route , including bulgaria and the former yugoslavia , and once these countries themselves became financially attractive to drug traffickers , a large percentage of the opiates would remain there , " he explained .
" the same is now happening with drugs passing through supply channels in eastern europe such as the czech republic , where there 's more money circulating than there used to be . " the report also warns of the increase in violations of drug law , and says the eu is still a long way from getting a grip on trafficking , a point with which hurrelmann agrees . a call for strategic legalization # b # " the eu has failed either to reduce the consumption of illegal drugs or to tackle the ever-growing black market , " said hurrelmann .
" as the consumption of cannabis and the so-called party drugs increases , the black market continues to grow exponentially .
in this respect , eu drug policy has been simply inefficient . " " there needs to be a european-wide discussion about a strategic legalization that would allow for product control , " he proposed .
" for the time being , what we have are black markets undermining the economies of the production countries as well as our own .
but any talk of strategic legalization is still a highly taboo political subject .

dw 's felix steiner looks back at her first few days in office . a new head of state 's first trip abroad is generally just a matter of protocol , leaving observers at pains to read any great significance into the choice of destination and host . but seven years ago , the freshly-minted chancellor gerhard schröder broke with time-honored tradition when he made for london rather than paris , where german chancellors have always gone first after their election . those were the heady days of the much-touted " third way " - the political vision shared by schröder and tony blair which started out so well and ended so badly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not the beginning of a beautiful friendship by the time schröder left government , europe 's political landscape had seen a major sea-change .
as he and french president jacques chirac became increasingly close allies in the wake of the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , relations between schröder and blair became increasingly hostile .
the cosy anglo-german chats that were a staple of former chancellor helmut kohl 's government became a distant memory . less european , more trans-atlantic against this backdrop , angela merkel 's decision to revert to form and make paris her first official outing abroad was a shrewd one . much to the chagrin of the rest of europe , france and germany have enjoyed a special relationship ever since they signed the elysee treaty in 1963 - but with chirac , merkel went out of her way to stress that their relationship should n't mean they cold-shouldered other member states who 've made no secret in recent years of the fact they feel excluded . her point made , she turned on her heels and headed for her next port of call , brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and jaap de hoop scheffer in brussels her timetable in brussels had its own symbolism .
first , merkel met with nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer , where she spelt out that improving ties between the us and germany was top of her list of priorities .
then she moved on to a meeting with eu commission president jose barroso , reaffirming her new coalition government 's intention to revive the much maligned eu constitution , which has been on hold in recent months . scuppering the critics in london a day later , she and tony blair discussed the eu budget row , a question blair is eager to resolve before britain hands over the eu 's rotating presidency at the end of december . germany 's position on the issue is a crucial one , and blair is well aware of how much he needs merkel to play a conciliatory role in its settlement .
but the chancellor was n't going to be drawn on the issue , simply making it clear that she had no intention of tolerating an outcome that would leave germany shouldering the eu 's financial burden - as has so often happened in the last few decades . it was a message she conveyed at every stop-over this week .
but even so , in paris , brussels and london , merkel came across like a leader who would rather avoid going her own way and making overly hasty decisions .
she might be a novice , but she demonstrated respectable diplomatic finesse and all in all , made a decent debut appearance on the international stage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the best yet to come ?
her first three days in office have gone some way to scuppering her critics ' claims she is n't up to the job . in fact , merkel has already demonstrated that she has what it takes to be a formidable new force in european politics . felix steiner -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair , merkel emphasize eu cooperation german chancellor angela merkel and tony blair talked of increasing cooperation across the eu ahead of sticky budget talks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.11.2005 opinion : merkel debuts abroad with aplomb großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it started with a kiss angela merkel was sworn in as germany 's first female chancellor on tuesday , and wasted no time setting off on a whistle-stop tour of europe .
dw 's felix steiner looks back at her first few days in office . a new head of state 's first trip abroad is generally just a matter of protocol , leaving observers at pains to read any great significance into the choice of destination and host . but seven years ago , the freshly-minted chancellor gerhard schröder broke with time-honored tradition when he made for london rather than paris , where german chancellors have always gone first after their election . those were the heady days of the much-touted " third way " - the political vision shared by schröder and tony blair which started out so well and ended so badly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not the beginning of a beautiful friendship by the time schröder left government , europe 's political landscape had seen a major sea-change .
as he and french president jacques chirac became increasingly close allies in the wake of the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , relations between schröder and blair became increasingly hostile .
the cosy anglo-german chats that were a staple of former chancellor helmut kohl 's government became a distant memory . less european , more trans-atlantic against this backdrop , angela merkel 's decision to revert to form and make paris her first official outing abroad was a shrewd one . much to the chagrin of the rest of europe , france and germany have enjoyed a special relationship ever since they signed the elysee treaty in 1963 - but with chirac , merkel went out of her way to stress that their relationship should n't mean they cold-shouldered other member states who 've made no secret in recent years of the fact they feel excluded . her point made , she turned on her heels and headed for her next port of call , brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and jaap de hoop scheffer in brussels her timetable in brussels had its own symbolism .
first , merkel met with nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer , where she spelt out that improving ties between the us and germany was top of her list of priorities .
then she moved on to a meeting with eu commission president jose barroso , reaffirming her new coalition government 's intention to revive the much maligned eu constitution , which has been on hold in recent months . scuppering the critics in london a day later , she and tony blair discussed the eu budget row , a question blair is eager to resolve before britain hands over the eu 's rotating presidency at the end of december . germany 's position on the issue is a crucial one , and blair is well aware of how much he needs merkel to play a conciliatory role in its settlement .
but the chancellor was n't going to be drawn on the issue , simply making it clear that she had no intention of tolerating an outcome that would leave germany shouldering the eu 's financial burden - as has so often happened in the last few decades . it was a message she conveyed at every stop-over this week .
but even so , in paris , brussels and london , merkel came across like a leader who would rather avoid going her own way and making overly hasty decisions .
she might be a novice , but she demonstrated respectable diplomatic finesse and all in all , made a decent debut appearance on the international stage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the best yet to come ?
her first three days in office have gone some way to scuppering her critics ' claims she is n't up to the job . in fact , merkel has already demonstrated that she has what it takes to be a formidable new force in european politics . felix steiner -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair , merkel emphasize eu cooperation german chancellor angela merkel and tony blair talked of increasing cooperation across the eu ahead of sticky budget talks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.11.2005 europe fails to tame drug problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lifestyle choice the eu 's annual report on the state of the narcotics problem in europe reveals that cannabis is still the drug of choice of europe 's population - and demand is increasing . " europe remains a major market for stimulant drugs and indicators suggest that the trend in amphetamine , ecstasy and cocaine use continues to be upwards , " revealed the 2005 annual report compiled by the lisbon-based european monitoring center for drug addiction -lrb- emccd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine has a glamourous reputation around 9 million people in the eu , 3 percent of all adults , have tried cocaine .
but when it comes to the drug of choice , cannabis continues to be on top .
more than 62 million europeans have tried it , while 9.5 million are categorized as regular users , according to the report published on thursday .
germans are especially fond of the drug , with 15 percent between 15-34 having smoked or ingested cannabis last year , the fifth highest figure in europe and just above the european average . but the report also revealed that eu drug decriminalization measures and better treatment programs are showing results .
experts said the shift in eu strategy to prevention , not punishment , has proven to be more effective . punishing trafficker , not user bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : treatment for addicts has improved " the eu has been making some progress with its anti-drugs strategies , " said klaus hurrelmann , a drugs expert at bielefeld university .
the increased tendency to look at the roots rather than the symptoms of the problem has been one of the most positive developments in recent years , he said . " there 's been a shift away from penalizing consumers towards getting tough on traffickers , " he said . the emphasis on decriminalization coupled with a push for better education and treatment has led to positive developments in the fight against heroin .
the total number of clients in substitution treatment has passed the half million mark in the european union , according to the report . heroin boom does n't materialize following a seven-fold increase over the last decade , says the emccd , at least 530,000 clients now receive substitution treatment across 28 countries whether through specialist treatment centers or general practitioners .
and it is estimated that somewhere between one-quarter and a half of those with opiate problems in europe may now be receiving treatment of this kind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black markets weaken economies roland simon , of the german watchdog for drugs and drug addiction , the dbdd , points out another positive side-effect of the eu 's education and treatment agenda . " many expected to see an increase in heroin trafficking post 9/11 , " he pointed out , referring to the fact that although the former taliban government banned poppy production , harvests have risen to record levels since the us-led invasion of afghanistan . " but demand is simply no longer there , " said simon .
" there 's actually been a stabilization of the opiate scene , with far fewer new users and far better treatment programs . " eastern europe increasing drug use the news is n't good for all of europe .
improving economies in eastern europe have led to more users - especially of cannabis - in the new eu countries , said simon . " opiates used to arrive in europe via the balkan route , including bulgaria and the former yugoslavia , and once these countries themselves became financially attractive to drug traffickers , a large percentage of the opiates would remain there , " he explained .
" the same is now happening with drugs passing through supply channels in eastern europe such as the czech republic , where there 's more money circulating than there used to be . " the report also warns of the increase in violations of drug law , and says the eu is still a long way from getting a grip on trafficking , a point with which hurrelmann agrees . a call for strategic legalization # b # " the eu has failed either to reduce the consumption of illegal drugs or to tackle the ever-growing black market , " said hurrelmann .
" as the consumption of cannabis and the so-called party drugs increases , the black market continues to grow exponentially .
in this respect , eu drug policy has been simply inefficient . " " there needs to be a european-wide discussion about a strategic legalization that would allow for product control , " he proposed .
" for the time being , what we have are black markets undermining the economies of the production countries as well as our own .
but any talk of strategic legalization is still a highly taboo political subject . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de addicted to medication that germany is home to high levels of alcoholism and tobacco addiction is a well-established , if unhappy fact .
what is less known is the fact that abuse of prescribed medication is also widespread .

while the issue over secret cia prisons in europe continues to simmer , new allegations over undisclosed cia flights transporting suspected terrorists is pushing european officials to demand answers from washington . the cia continues to use an american military base in germany to transport terrorism suspects without informing the german government , business daily handelsblatt reported thursday .
quoting a high-ranking cia official in washington , the newspaper reported that such flights carrying prisoners were still stopping off at the us base at ramstein . " the cia planes have made stop-overs in several european countries , including germany , " the cia official told handelsblatt .
" nothing has changed that . " meanwhile , the berliner zeitung reported friday there was documentation of 85 takeoffs and landings by planes with a " high probability " of being operated by the cia , at ramstein , the rhine-main airbase and others .
the newspaper cited experts and " plane-spotters " who observed the planes as responsible for the tally . handelsblatt had written that the cia transports its prisoners through multiple european airports either to guantanamo bay or to the alleged secret prisons , so-called " black sites " in eastern europe . german politicians , who have remained quiet for the most part over the issue of black sites in europe , are beginning to call for answers from washington . a green party member of the german parliament 's committee overseeing the intelligence services , hans-christian ströbele , called for an explanation from the german government .
he said it had to be established whether people crossing german soil had been taken into circumstances not in line with human rights . ströbele added that foreign secret services should not be allowed to operate in germany . eu wants a response the council of europe , an independent body , appointed swiss official dick marty to investigate the existence of secret cia detention centers .
marty said satellite images might be used to help determine if the prisons exist .
eu officials , initially reluctant to comment on the matter , have begun to publicly call for a response from washington .
justice commissioner franco frattini said thursday the bloc would seek answers from washington after eu states sent a joint letter to washington on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alleged secret prisons might also use torture the washington post reported earlier this month that the cia used facilities in eastern europe and in asia to hold suspected terrorists .
us-based ngo human rights watch said afterwards that it believes such prisons exist in romania and poland .
both countries have denied the allegations . however , the role of cia flights in the extra-judicial capture of suspected terrorists involves numerous european countries , including iceland , norway , spain and sweden .
most of the flights were alleged to have occurred in 2002 and 2003 , but the newspaper reported that such a plane landed at amsterdam 's airport only last week , and that the intelligence agency uses a number of firms to disguise the flights . painful for washington the issue could have serious consequences for both washington and european countries .
if such prisons are found in eu territory , they would likely violate european conventions on human rights .
if they exist in countries such as romania , they could threaten its application to the eu . the matter could also call into question european participation in the war on terror .
for example , dutch foreign minister bernard bot recently told his country 's parliament that the existence of such prisons in europe would have " consequences " for dutch military operations in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania and poland deny the prisons the cia source told handelsblatt that the discovery of cia practices was " very painful " for employees .
another us government official said that the us plans to answer european concerns soon .
and a top us official on wednesday acknowledged mounting eu pressure for washington to come clean about reports of secret cia prisons in eastern europe while stressing his country 's right to protect itself against terrorists . assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs dan fried said he had discussed the matter with various european officials during talks in berlin , vienna , madrid and brussels last week , but he refused to elaborate . " i do n't want to attempt to characterize our discussions with allies on this , " he told afp .
" the issue came up in a number of ways , in a number of places . " he underlined , however , the us right to wage a battle against terrorism . " we have a duty to protect our people and to do our best to protect others from terrorists , " he said .

dw 's felix steiner looks back at her first few days in office . a new head of state 's first trip abroad is generally just a matter of protocol , leaving observers at pains to read any great significance into the choice of destination and host . but seven years ago , the freshly-minted chancellor gerhard schröder broke with time-honored tradition when he made for london rather than paris , where german chancellors have always gone first after their election . those were the heady days of the much-touted " third way " - the political vision shared by schröder and tony blair which started out so well and ended so badly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not the beginning of a beautiful friendship by the time schröder left government , europe 's political landscape had seen a major sea-change .
as he and french president jacques chirac became increasingly close allies in the wake of the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , relations between schröder and blair became increasingly hostile .
the cosy anglo-german chats that were a staple of former chancellor helmut kohl 's government became a distant memory . less european , more trans-atlantic against this backdrop , angela merkel 's decision to revert to form and make paris her first official outing abroad was a shrewd one . much to the chagrin of the rest of europe , france and germany have enjoyed a special relationship ever since they signed the elysee treaty in 1963 - but with chirac , merkel went out of her way to stress that their relationship should n't mean they cold-shouldered other member states who 've made no secret in recent years of the fact they feel excluded . her point made , she turned on her heels and headed for her next port of call , brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and jaap de hoop scheffer in brussels her timetable in brussels had its own symbolism .
first , merkel met with nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer , where she spelt out that improving ties between the us and germany was top of her list of priorities .
then she moved on to a meeting with eu commission president jose barroso , reaffirming her new coalition government 's intention to revive the much maligned eu constitution , which has been on hold in recent months . scuppering the critics in london a day later , she and tony blair discussed the eu budget row , a question blair is eager to resolve before britain hands over the eu 's rotating presidency at the end of december . germany 's position on the issue is a crucial one , and blair is well aware of how much he needs merkel to play a conciliatory role in its settlement .
but the chancellor was n't going to be drawn on the issue , simply making it clear that she had no intention of tolerating an outcome that would leave germany shouldering the eu 's financial burden - as has so often happened in the last few decades . it was a message she conveyed at every stop-over this week .
but even so , in paris , brussels and london , merkel came across like a leader who would rather avoid going her own way and making overly hasty decisions .
she might be a novice , but she demonstrated respectable diplomatic finesse and all in all , made a decent debut appearance on the international stage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the best yet to come ?
her first three days in office have gone some way to scuppering her critics ' claims she is n't up to the job . in fact , merkel has already demonstrated that she has what it takes to be a formidable new force in european politics . felix steiner -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair , merkel emphasize eu cooperation german chancellor angela merkel and tony blair talked of increasing cooperation across the eu ahead of sticky budget talks .

while the issue over secret cia prisons in europe continues to simmer , new allegations over undisclosed cia flights transporting suspected terrorists is pushing european officials to demand answers from washington . the cia continues to use an american military base in germany to transport terrorism suspects without informing the german government , business daily handelsblatt reported thursday .
quoting a high-ranking cia official in washington , the newspaper reported that such flights carrying prisoners were still stopping off at the us base at ramstein . " the cia planes have made stop-overs in several european countries , including germany , " the cia official told handelsblatt .
" nothing has changed that . " meanwhile , the berliner zeitung reported friday there was documentation of 85 takeoffs and landings by planes with a " high probability " of being operated by the cia , at ramstein , the rhine-main airbase and others .
the newspaper cited experts and " plane-spotters " who observed the planes as responsible for the tally . handelsblatt had written that the cia transports its prisoners through multiple european airports either to guantanamo bay or to the alleged secret prisons , so-called " black sites " in eastern europe . german politicians , who have remained quiet for the most part over the issue of black sites in europe , are beginning to call for answers from washington . a green party member of the german parliament 's committee overseeing the intelligence services , hans-christian ströbele , called for an explanation from the german government .
he said it had to be established whether people crossing german soil had been taken into circumstances not in line with human rights . ströbele added that foreign secret services should not be allowed to operate in germany . eu wants a response the council of europe , an independent body , appointed swiss official dick marty to investigate the existence of secret cia detention centers .
marty said satellite images might be used to help determine if the prisons exist .
eu officials , initially reluctant to comment on the matter , have begun to publicly call for a response from washington .
justice commissioner franco frattini said thursday the bloc would seek answers from washington after eu states sent a joint letter to washington on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alleged secret prisons might also use torture the washington post reported earlier this month that the cia used facilities in eastern europe and in asia to hold suspected terrorists .
us-based ngo human rights watch said afterwards that it believes such prisons exist in romania and poland .
both countries have denied the allegations . however , the role of cia flights in the extra-judicial capture of suspected terrorists involves numerous european countries , including iceland , norway , spain and sweden .
most of the flights were alleged to have occurred in 2002 and 2003 , but the newspaper reported that such a plane landed at amsterdam 's airport only last week , and that the intelligence agency uses a number of firms to disguise the flights . painful for washington the issue could have serious consequences for both washington and european countries .
if such prisons are found in eu territory , they would likely violate european conventions on human rights .
if they exist in countries such as romania , they could threaten its application to the eu . the matter could also call into question european participation in the war on terror .
for example , dutch foreign minister bernard bot recently told his country 's parliament that the existence of such prisons in europe would have " consequences " for dutch military operations in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania and poland deny the prisons the cia source told handelsblatt that the discovery of cia practices was " very painful " for employees .
another us government official said that the us plans to answer european concerns soon .
and a top us official on wednesday acknowledged mounting eu pressure for washington to come clean about reports of secret cia prisons in eastern europe while stressing his country 's right to protect itself against terrorists . assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs dan fried said he had discussed the matter with various european officials during talks in berlin , vienna , madrid and brussels last week , but he refused to elaborate . " i do n't want to attempt to characterize our discussions with allies on this , " he told afp .
" the issue came up in a number of ways , in a number of places . " he underlined , however , the us right to wage a battle against terrorism . " we have a duty to protect our people and to do our best to protect others from terrorists , " he said .
" we are conducting this struggle in a manner consistent with our values and our international obligations and will continue to do that .

while the issue over secret cia prisons in europe continues to simmer , new allegations over undisclosed cia flights transporting suspected terrorists is pushing european officials to demand answers from washington . the cia continues to use an american military base in germany to transport terrorism suspects without informing the german government , business daily handelsblatt reported thursday .
quoting a high-ranking cia official in washington , the newspaper reported that such flights carrying prisoners were still stopping off at the us base at ramstein . " the cia planes have made stop-overs in several european countries , including germany , " the cia official told handelsblatt .
" nothing has changed that . " meanwhile , the berliner zeitung reported friday there was documentation of 85 takeoffs and landings by planes with a " high probability " of being operated by the cia , at ramstein , the rhine-main airbase and others .
the newspaper cited experts and " plane-spotters " who observed the planes as responsible for the tally . handelsblatt had written that the cia transports its prisoners through multiple european airports either to guantanamo bay or to the alleged secret prisons , so-called " black sites " in eastern europe . german politicians , who have remained quiet for the most part over the issue of black sites in europe , are beginning to call for answers from washington . a green party member of the german parliament 's committee overseeing the intelligence services , hans-christian ströbele , called for an explanation from the german government .
he said it had to be established whether people crossing german soil had been taken into circumstances not in line with human rights . ströbele added that foreign secret services should not be allowed to operate in germany . eu wants a response the council of europe , an independent body , appointed swiss official dick marty to investigate the existence of secret cia detention centers .
marty said satellite images might be used to help determine if the prisons exist .
eu officials , initially reluctant to comment on the matter , have begun to publicly call for a response from washington .
justice commissioner franco frattini said thursday the bloc would seek answers from washington after eu states sent a joint letter to washington on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alleged secret prisons might also use torture the washington post reported earlier this month that the cia used facilities in eastern europe and in asia to hold suspected terrorists .
us-based ngo human rights watch said afterwards that it believes such prisons exist in romania and poland .
both countries have denied the allegations . however , the role of cia flights in the extra-judicial capture of suspected terrorists involves numerous european countries , including iceland , norway , spain and sweden .
most of the flights were alleged to have occurred in 2002 and 2003 , but the newspaper reported that such a plane landed at amsterdam 's airport only last week , and that the intelligence agency uses a number of firms to disguise the flights . painful for washington the issue could have serious consequences for both washington and european countries .
if such prisons are found in eu territory , they would likely violate european conventions on human rights .
if they exist in countries such as romania , they could threaten its application to the eu . the matter could also call into question european participation in the war on terror .
for example , dutch foreign minister bernard bot recently told his country 's parliament that the existence of such prisons in europe would have " consequences " for dutch military operations in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania and poland deny the prisons the cia source told handelsblatt that the discovery of cia practices was " very painful " for employees .
another us government official said that the us plans to answer european concerns soon .
and a top us official on wednesday acknowledged mounting eu pressure for washington to come clean about reports of secret cia prisons in eastern europe while stressing his country 's right to protect itself against terrorists . assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs dan fried said he had discussed the matter with various european officials during talks in berlin , vienna , madrid and brussels last week , but he refused to elaborate . " i do n't want to attempt to characterize our discussions with allies on this , " he told afp .
" the issue came up in a number of ways , in a number of places . " he underlined , however , the us right to wage a battle against terrorism . " we have a duty to protect our people and to do our best to protect others from terrorists , " he said .
" we are conducting this struggle in a manner consistent with our values and our international obligations and will continue to do that .

" europe remains a major market for stimulant drugs and indicators suggest that the trend in amphetamine , ecstasy and cocaine use continues to be upwards , " revealed the 2005 annual report compiled by the lisbon-based european monitoring center for drug addiction -lrb- emccd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine has a glamourous reputation around 9 million people in the eu , 3 percent of all adults , have tried cocaine .
but when it comes to the drug of choice , cannabis continues to be on top .
more than 62 million europeans have tried it , while 9.5 million are categorized as regular users , according to the report published on thursday .
germans are especially fond of the drug , with 15 percent between 15-34 having smoked or ingested cannabis last year , the fifth highest figure in europe and just above the european average . but the report also revealed that eu drug decriminalization measures and better treatment programs are showing results .
experts said the shift in eu strategy to prevention , not punishment , has proven to be more effective . punishing trafficker , not user bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : treatment for addicts has improved " the eu has been making some progress with its anti-drugs strategies , " said klaus hurrelmann , a drugs expert at bielefeld university .
the increased tendency to look at the roots rather than the symptoms of the problem has been one of the most positive developments in recent years , he said . " there 's been a shift away from penalizing consumers towards getting tough on traffickers , " he said . the emphasis on decriminalization coupled with a push for better education and treatment has led to positive developments in the fight against heroin .
the total number of clients in substitution treatment has passed the half million mark in the european union , according to the report . heroin boom does n't materialize following a seven-fold increase over the last decade , says the emccd , at least 530,000 clients now receive substitution treatment across 28 countries whether through specialist treatment centers or general practitioners .
and it is estimated that somewhere between one-quarter and a half of those with opiate problems in europe may now be receiving treatment of this kind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black markets weaken economies roland simon , of the german watchdog for drugs and drug addiction , the dbdd , points out another positive side-effect of the eu 's education and treatment agenda . " many expected to see an increase in heroin trafficking post 9/11 , " he pointed out , referring to the fact that although the former taliban government banned poppy production , harvests have risen to record levels since the us-led invasion of afghanistan . " but demand is simply no longer there , " said simon .
" there 's actually been a stabilization of the opiate scene , with far fewer new users and far better treatment programs . " eastern europe increasing drug use the news is n't good for all of europe .
improving economies in eastern europe have led to more users - especially of cannabis - in the new eu countries , said simon . " opiates used to arrive in europe via the balkan route , including bulgaria and the former yugoslavia , and once these countries themselves became financially attractive to drug traffickers , a large percentage of the opiates would remain there , " he explained .
" the same is now happening with drugs passing through supply channels in eastern europe such as the czech republic , where there 's more money circulating than there used to be . " the report also warns of the increase in violations of drug law , and says the eu is still a long way from getting a grip on trafficking , a point with which hurrelmann agrees . a call for strategic legalization # b # " the eu has failed either to reduce the consumption of illegal drugs or to tackle the ever-growing black market , " said hurrelmann .
" as the consumption of cannabis and the so-called party drugs increases , the black market continues to grow exponentially .
in this respect , eu drug policy has been simply inefficient . " " there needs to be a european-wide discussion about a strategic legalization that would allow for product control , " he proposed .
" for the time being , what we have are black markets undermining the economies of the production countries as well as our own .
but any talk of strategic legalization is still a highly taboo political subject .

germans are especially fond of the drug , with 15 percent between 15-34 having smoked or ingested cannabis last year , the fifth highest figure in europe and just above the european average . but the report also revealed that eu drug decriminalization measures and better treatment programs are showing results .

she eventually died by choking on her own vomit .
at the time of her death , jessica , who was seven , weighed only 9.6 kilograms -lrb- 21 pounds -rrb- - what a normal three-year-old child would weigh . " the accused cared for jessica so inadequately that her basic physical and psychological development was not appropriate to her age , " said the lead judge as the sentence was read .
" this gross neglect was a slow process .
the accused recognized this and simply accepted it . " the circumstances of jessica 's death shocked the nation and had many critically questioning how neither neighbors nor child-protection authorities apparently noticed anything amiss in the household . not an isolated case in may , the city of hamburg put together a special committee to study the instances of neglected children and to come up with new strategies to discover cases and intervene before they become serious or even fatal for children . recently , more cases have surfaced in hamburg , including one in which a four-year-old girl and her two-year-old brother were found living among piles of trash and excrement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.11.2005 opinion : merkel debuts abroad with aplomb großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it started with a kiss angela merkel was sworn in as germany 's first female chancellor on tuesday , and wasted no time setting off on a whistle-stop tour of europe .
dw 's felix steiner looks back at her first few days in office . a new head of state 's first trip abroad is generally just a matter of protocol , leaving observers at pains to read any great significance into the choice of destination and host . but seven years ago , the freshly-minted chancellor gerhard schröder broke with time-honored tradition when he made for london rather than paris , where german chancellors have always gone first after their election . those were the heady days of the much-touted " third way " - the political vision shared by schröder and tony blair which started out so well and ended so badly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not the beginning of a beautiful friendship by the time schröder left government , europe 's political landscape had seen a major sea-change .
as he and french president jacques chirac became increasingly close allies in the wake of the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , relations between schröder and blair became increasingly hostile .
the cosy anglo-german chats that were a staple of former chancellor helmut kohl 's government became a distant memory . less european , more trans-atlantic against this backdrop , angela merkel 's decision to revert to form and make paris her first official outing abroad was a shrewd one . much to the chagrin of the rest of europe , france and germany have enjoyed a special relationship ever since they signed the elysee treaty in 1963 - but with chirac , merkel went out of her way to stress that their relationship should n't mean they cold-shouldered other member states who 've made no secret in recent years of the fact they feel excluded . her point made , she turned on her heels and headed for her next port of call , brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and jaap de hoop scheffer in brussels her timetable in brussels had its own symbolism .
first , merkel met with nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer , where she spelt out that improving ties between the us and germany was top of her list of priorities .
then she moved on to a meeting with eu commission president jose barroso , reaffirming her new coalition government 's intention to revive the much maligned eu constitution , which has been on hold in recent months . scuppering the critics in london a day later , she and tony blair discussed the eu budget row , a question blair is eager to resolve before britain hands over the eu 's rotating presidency at the end of december . germany 's position on the issue is a crucial one , and blair is well aware of how much he needs merkel to play a conciliatory role in its settlement .

dw 's felix steiner looks back at her first few days in office . a new head of state 's first trip abroad is generally just a matter of protocol , leaving observers at pains to read any great significance into the choice of destination and host . but seven years ago , the freshly-minted chancellor gerhard schröder broke with time-honored tradition when he made for london rather than paris , where german chancellors have always gone first after their election . those were the heady days of the much-touted " third way " - the political vision shared by schröder and tony blair which started out so well and ended so badly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not the beginning of a beautiful friendship by the time schröder left government , europe 's political landscape had seen a major sea-change .
as he and french president jacques chirac became increasingly close allies in the wake of the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , relations between schröder and blair became increasingly hostile .
the cosy anglo-german chats that were a staple of former chancellor helmut kohl 's government became a distant memory . less european , more trans-atlantic against this backdrop , angela merkel 's decision to revert to form and make paris her first official outing abroad was a shrewd one . much to the chagrin of the rest of europe , france and germany have enjoyed a special relationship ever since they signed the elysee treaty in 1963 - but with chirac , merkel went out of her way to stress that their relationship should n't mean they cold-shouldered other member states who 've made no secret in recent years of the fact they feel excluded . her point made , she turned on her heels and headed for her next port of call , brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and jaap de hoop scheffer in brussels her timetable in brussels had its own symbolism .
first , merkel met with nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer , where she spelt out that improving ties between the us and germany was top of her list of priorities .
then she moved on to a meeting with eu commission president jose barroso , reaffirming her new coalition government 's intention to revive the much maligned eu constitution , which has been on hold in recent months . scuppering the critics in london a day later , she and tony blair discussed the eu budget row , a question blair is eager to resolve before britain hands over the eu 's rotating presidency at the end of december . germany 's position on the issue is a crucial one , and blair is well aware of how much he needs merkel to play a conciliatory role in its settlement .

the cosy anglo-german chats that were a staple of former chancellor helmut kohl 's government became a distant memory . less european , more trans-atlantic against this backdrop , angela merkel 's decision to revert to form and make paris her first official outing abroad was a shrewd one . much to the chagrin of the rest of europe , france and germany have enjoyed a special relationship ever since they signed the elysee treaty in 1963 - but with chirac , merkel went out of her way to stress that their relationship should n't mean they cold-shouldered other member states who 've made no secret in recent years of the fact they feel excluded . her point made , she turned on her heels and headed for her next port of call , brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and jaap de hoop scheffer in brussels her timetable in brussels had its own symbolism .
first , merkel met with nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer , where she spelt out that improving ties between the us and germany was top of her list of priorities .
then she moved on to a meeting with eu commission president jose barroso , reaffirming her new coalition government 's intention to revive the much maligned eu constitution , which has been on hold in recent months . scuppering the critics in london a day later , she and tony blair discussed the eu budget row , a question blair is eager to resolve before britain hands over the eu 's rotating presidency at the end of december . germany 's position on the issue is a crucial one , and blair is well aware of how much he needs merkel to play a conciliatory role in its settlement .
but the chancellor was n't going to be drawn on the issue , simply making it clear that she had no intention of tolerating an outcome that would leave germany shouldering the eu 's financial burden - as has so often happened in the last few decades . it was a message she conveyed at every stop-over this week .
but even so , in paris , brussels and london , merkel came across like a leader who would rather avoid going her own way and making overly hasty decisions .
she might be a novice , but she demonstrated respectable diplomatic finesse and all in all , made a decent debut appearance on the international stage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the best yet to come ?
her first three days in office have gone some way to scuppering her critics ' claims she is n't up to the job . in fact , merkel has already demonstrated that she has what it takes to be a formidable new force in european politics . felix steiner -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair , merkel emphasize eu cooperation german chancellor angela merkel and tony blair talked of increasing cooperation across the eu ahead of sticky budget talks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.11.2005 europe fails to tame drug problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lifestyle choice the eu 's annual report on the state of the narcotics problem in europe reveals that cannabis is still the drug of choice of europe 's population - and demand is increasing . " europe remains a major market for stimulant drugs and indicators suggest that the trend in amphetamine , ecstasy and cocaine use continues to be upwards , " revealed the 2005 annual report compiled by the lisbon-based european monitoring center for drug addiction -lrb- emccd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine has a glamourous reputation around 9 million people in the eu , 3 percent of all adults , have tried cocaine .
but when it comes to the drug of choice , cannabis continues to be on top .
more than 62 million europeans have tried it , while 9.5 million are categorized as regular users , according to the report published on thursday .
germans are especially fond of the drug , with 15 percent between 15-34 having smoked or ingested cannabis last year , the fifth highest figure in europe and just above the european average . but the report also revealed that eu drug decriminalization measures and better treatment programs are showing results .
experts said the shift in eu strategy to prevention , not punishment , has proven to be more effective . punishing trafficker , not user bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : treatment for addicts has improved " the eu has been making some progress with its anti-drugs strategies , " said klaus hurrelmann , a drugs expert at bielefeld university .
the increased tendency to look at the roots rather than the symptoms of the problem has been one of the most positive developments in recent years , he said . " there 's been a shift away from penalizing consumers towards getting tough on traffickers , " he said . the emphasis on decriminalization coupled with a push for better education and treatment has led to positive developments in the fight against heroin .
the total number of clients in substitution treatment has passed the half million mark in the european union , according to the report . heroin boom does n't materialize following a seven-fold increase over the last decade , says the emccd , at least 530,000 clients now receive substitution treatment across 28 countries whether through specialist treatment centers or general practitioners .
and it is estimated that somewhere between one-quarter and a half of those with opiate problems in europe may now be receiving treatment of this kind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black markets weaken economies roland simon , of the german watchdog for drugs and drug addiction , the dbdd , points out another positive side-effect of the eu 's education and treatment agenda . " many expected to see an increase in heroin trafficking post 9/11 , " he pointed out , referring to the fact that although the former taliban government banned poppy production , harvests have risen to record levels since the us-led invasion of afghanistan . " but demand is simply no longer there , " said simon .
" there 's actually been a stabilization of the opiate scene , with far fewer new users and far better treatment programs . " eastern europe increasing drug use the news is n't good for all of europe .
improving economies in eastern europe have led to more users - especially of cannabis - in the new eu countries , said simon . " opiates used to arrive in europe via the balkan route , including bulgaria and the former yugoslavia , and once these countries themselves became financially attractive to drug traffickers , a large percentage of the opiates would remain there , " he explained .
" the same is now happening with drugs passing through supply channels in eastern europe such as the czech republic , where there 's more money circulating than there used to be . " the report also warns of the increase in violations of drug law , and says the eu is still a long way from getting a grip on trafficking , a point with which hurrelmann agrees . a call for strategic legalization # b # " the eu has failed either to reduce the consumption of illegal drugs or to tackle the ever-growing black market , " said hurrelmann .
" as the consumption of cannabis and the so-called party drugs increases , the black market continues to grow exponentially .
in this respect , eu drug policy has been simply inefficient . " " there needs to be a european-wide discussion about a strategic legalization that would allow for product control , " he proposed .
" for the time being , what we have are black markets undermining the economies of the production countries as well as our own .
but any talk of strategic legalization is still a highly taboo political subject . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de addicted to medication that germany is home to high levels of alcoholism and tobacco addiction is a well-established , if unhappy fact .
what is less known is the fact that abuse of prescribed medication is also widespread .

" europe remains a major market for stimulant drugs and indicators suggest that the trend in amphetamine , ecstasy and cocaine use continues to be upwards , " revealed the 2005 annual report compiled by the lisbon-based european monitoring center for drug addiction -lrb- emccd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine has a glamourous reputation around 9 million people in the eu , 3 percent of all adults , have tried cocaine .
but when it comes to the drug of choice , cannabis continues to be on top .
more than 62 million europeans have tried it , while 9.5 million are categorized as regular users , according to the report published on thursday .
germans are especially fond of the drug , with 15 percent between 15-34 having smoked or ingested cannabis last year , the fifth highest figure in europe and just above the european average . but the report also revealed that eu drug decriminalization measures and better treatment programs are showing results .
experts said the shift in eu strategy to prevention , not punishment , has proven to be more effective . punishing trafficker , not user bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : treatment for addicts has improved " the eu has been making some progress with its anti-drugs strategies , " said klaus hurrelmann , a drugs expert at bielefeld university .
the increased tendency to look at the roots rather than the symptoms of the problem has been one of the most positive developments in recent years , he said . " there 's been a shift away from penalizing consumers towards getting tough on traffickers , " he said . the emphasis on decriminalization coupled with a push for better education and treatment has led to positive developments in the fight against heroin .
the total number of clients in substitution treatment has passed the half million mark in the european union , according to the report . heroin boom does n't materialize following a seven-fold increase over the last decade , says the emccd , at least 530,000 clients now receive substitution treatment across 28 countries whether through specialist treatment centers or general practitioners .
and it is estimated that somewhere between one-quarter and a half of those with opiate problems in europe may now be receiving treatment of this kind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black markets weaken economies roland simon , of the german watchdog for drugs and drug addiction , the dbdd , points out another positive side-effect of the eu 's education and treatment agenda . " many expected to see an increase in heroin trafficking post 9/11 , " he pointed out , referring to the fact that although the former taliban government banned poppy production , harvests have risen to record levels since the us-led invasion of afghanistan . " but demand is simply no longer there , " said simon .
" there 's actually been a stabilization of the opiate scene , with far fewer new users and far better treatment programs . " eastern europe increasing drug use the news is n't good for all of europe .
improving economies in eastern europe have led to more users - especially of cannabis - in the new eu countries , said simon . " opiates used to arrive in europe via the balkan route , including bulgaria and the former yugoslavia , and once these countries themselves became financially attractive to drug traffickers , a large percentage of the opiates would remain there , " he explained .
" the same is now happening with drugs passing through supply channels in eastern europe such as the czech republic , where there 's more money circulating than there used to be . " the report also warns of the increase in violations of drug law , and says the eu is still a long way from getting a grip on trafficking , a point with which hurrelmann agrees . a call for strategic legalization # b # " the eu has failed either to reduce the consumption of illegal drugs or to tackle the ever-growing black market , " said hurrelmann .
" as the consumption of cannabis and the so-called party drugs increases , the black market continues to grow exponentially .
in this respect , eu drug policy has been simply inefficient . " " there needs to be a european-wide discussion about a strategic legalization that would allow for product control , " he proposed .
" for the time being , what we have are black markets undermining the economies of the production countries as well as our own .
but any talk of strategic legalization is still a highly taboo political subject .

the total number of clients in substitution treatment has passed the half million mark in the european union , according to the report . heroin boom does n't materialize following a seven-fold increase over the last decade , says the emccd , at least 530,000 clients now receive substitution treatment across 28 countries whether through specialist treatment centers or general practitioners .
and it is estimated that somewhere between one-quarter and a half of those with opiate problems in europe may now be receiving treatment of this kind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black markets weaken economies roland simon , of the german watchdog for drugs and drug addiction , the dbdd , points out another positive side-effect of the eu 's education and treatment agenda . " many expected to see an increase in heroin trafficking post 9/11 , " he pointed out , referring to the fact that although the former taliban government banned poppy production , harvests have risen to record levels since the us-led invasion of afghanistan . " but demand is simply no longer there , " said simon .
" there 's actually been a stabilization of the opiate scene , with far fewer new users and far better treatment programs . " eastern europe increasing drug use the news is n't good for all of europe .
improving economies in eastern europe have led to more users - especially of cannabis - in the new eu countries , said simon . " opiates used to arrive in europe via the balkan route , including bulgaria and the former yugoslavia , and once these countries themselves became financially attractive to drug traffickers , a large percentage of the opiates would remain there , " he explained .
" the same is now happening with drugs passing through supply channels in eastern europe such as the czech republic , where there 's more money circulating than there used to be . " the report also warns of the increase in violations of drug law , and says the eu is still a long way from getting a grip on trafficking , a point with which hurrelmann agrees . a call for strategic legalization # b # " the eu has failed either to reduce the consumption of illegal drugs or to tackle the ever-growing black market , " said hurrelmann .
" as the consumption of cannabis and the so-called party drugs increases , the black market continues to grow exponentially .
in this respect , eu drug policy has been simply inefficient . " " there needs to be a european-wide discussion about a strategic legalization that would allow for product control , " he proposed .
" for the time being , what we have are black markets undermining the economies of the production countries as well as our own .
but any talk of strategic legalization is still a highly taboo political subject .

while the issue over secret cia prisons in europe continues to simmer , new allegations over undisclosed cia flights transporting suspected terrorists is pushing european officials to demand answers from washington . the cia continues to use an american military base in germany to transport terrorism suspects without informing the german government , business daily handelsblatt reported thursday .
quoting a high-ranking cia official in washington , the newspaper reported that such flights carrying prisoners were still stopping off at the us base at ramstein . " the cia planes have made stop-overs in several european countries , including germany , " the cia official told handelsblatt .
" nothing has changed that . " meanwhile , the berliner zeitung reported friday there was documentation of 85 takeoffs and landings by planes with a " high probability " of being operated by the cia , at ramstein , the rhine-main airbase and others .
the newspaper cited experts and " plane-spotters " who observed the planes as responsible for the tally . handelsblatt had written that the cia transports its prisoners through multiple european airports either to guantanamo bay or to the alleged secret prisons , so-called " black sites " in eastern europe . german politicians , who have remained quiet for the most part over the issue of black sites in europe , are beginning to call for answers from washington . a green party member of the german parliament 's committee overseeing the intelligence services , hans-christian ströbele , called for an explanation from the german government .
he said it had to be established whether people crossing german soil had been taken into circumstances not in line with human rights . ströbele added that foreign secret services should not be allowed to operate in germany . eu wants a response the council of europe , an independent body , appointed swiss official dick marty to investigate the existence of secret cia detention centers .
marty said satellite images might be used to help determine if the prisons exist .
eu officials , initially reluctant to comment on the matter , have begun to publicly call for a response from washington .
justice commissioner franco frattini said thursday the bloc would seek answers from washington after eu states sent a joint letter to washington on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alleged secret prisons might also use torture the washington post reported earlier this month that the cia used facilities in eastern europe and in asia to hold suspected terrorists .
us-based ngo human rights watch said afterwards that it believes such prisons exist in romania and poland .
both countries have denied the allegations . however , the role of cia flights in the extra-judicial capture of suspected terrorists involves numerous european countries , including iceland , norway , spain and sweden .
most of the flights were alleged to have occurred in 2002 and 2003 , but the newspaper reported that such a plane landed at amsterdam 's airport only last week , and that the intelligence agency uses a number of firms to disguise the flights . painful for washington the issue could have serious consequences for both washington and european countries .
if such prisons are found in eu territory , they would likely violate european conventions on human rights .
if they exist in countries such as romania , they could threaten its application to the eu . the matter could also call into question european participation in the war on terror .
for example , dutch foreign minister bernard bot recently told his country 's parliament that the existence of such prisons in europe would have " consequences " for dutch military operations in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania and poland deny the prisons the cia source told handelsblatt that the discovery of cia practices was " very painful " for employees .
another us government official said that the us plans to answer european concerns soon .
and a top us official on wednesday acknowledged mounting eu pressure for washington to come clean about reports of secret cia prisons in eastern europe while stressing his country 's right to protect itself against terrorists . assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs dan fried said he had discussed the matter with various european officials during talks in berlin , vienna , madrid and brussels last week , but he refused to elaborate . " i do n't want to attempt to characterize our discussions with allies on this , " he told afp .
" the issue came up in a number of ways , in a number of places . " he underlined , however , the us right to wage a battle against terrorism . " we have a duty to protect our people and to do our best to protect others from terrorists , " he said .
" we are conducting this struggle in a manner consistent with our values and our international obligations and will continue to do that .

while the issue over secret cia prisons in europe continues to simmer , new allegations over undisclosed cia flights transporting suspected terrorists is pushing european officials to demand answers from washington . the cia continues to use an american military base in germany to transport terrorism suspects without informing the german government , business daily handelsblatt reported thursday .
quoting a high-ranking cia official in washington , the newspaper reported that such flights carrying prisoners were still stopping off at the us base at ramstein . " the cia planes have made stop-overs in several european countries , including germany , " the cia official told handelsblatt .
" nothing has changed that . " meanwhile , the berliner zeitung reported friday there was documentation of 85 takeoffs and landings by planes with a " high probability " of being operated by the cia , at ramstein , the rhine-main airbase and others .
the newspaper cited experts and " plane-spotters " who observed the planes as responsible for the tally . handelsblatt had written that the cia transports its prisoners through multiple european airports either to guantanamo bay or to the alleged secret prisons , so-called " black sites " in eastern europe . german politicians , who have remained quiet for the most part over the issue of black sites in europe , are beginning to call for answers from washington . a green party member of the german parliament 's committee overseeing the intelligence services , hans-christian ströbele , called for an explanation from the german government .
he said it had to be established whether people crossing german soil had been taken into circumstances not in line with human rights . ströbele added that foreign secret services should not be allowed to operate in germany . eu wants a response the council of europe , an independent body , appointed swiss official dick marty to investigate the existence of secret cia detention centers .
marty said satellite images might be used to help determine if the prisons exist .
eu officials , initially reluctant to comment on the matter , have begun to publicly call for a response from washington .
justice commissioner franco frattini said thursday the bloc would seek answers from washington after eu states sent a joint letter to washington on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alleged secret prisons might also use torture the washington post reported earlier this month that the cia used facilities in eastern europe and in asia to hold suspected terrorists .
us-based ngo human rights watch said afterwards that it believes such prisons exist in romania and poland .
both countries have denied the allegations . however , the role of cia flights in the extra-judicial capture of suspected terrorists involves numerous european countries , including iceland , norway , spain and sweden .
most of the flights were alleged to have occurred in 2002 and 2003 , but the newspaper reported that such a plane landed at amsterdam 's airport only last week , and that the intelligence agency uses a number of firms to disguise the flights . painful for washington the issue could have serious consequences for both washington and european countries .
if such prisons are found in eu territory , they would likely violate european conventions on human rights .
if they exist in countries such as romania , they could threaten its application to the eu . the matter could also call into question european participation in the war on terror .
for example , dutch foreign minister bernard bot recently told his country 's parliament that the existence of such prisons in europe would have " consequences " for dutch military operations in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania and poland deny the prisons the cia source told handelsblatt that the discovery of cia practices was " very painful " for employees .
another us government official said that the us plans to answer european concerns soon .
and a top us official on wednesday acknowledged mounting eu pressure for washington to come clean about reports of secret cia prisons in eastern europe while stressing his country 's right to protect itself against terrorists . assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs dan fried said he had discussed the matter with various european officials during talks in berlin , vienna , madrid and brussels last week , but he refused to elaborate . " i do n't want to attempt to characterize our discussions with allies on this , " he told afp .
" the issue came up in a number of ways , in a number of places . " he underlined , however , the us right to wage a battle against terrorism . " we have a duty to protect our people and to do our best to protect others from terrorists , " he said .
" we are conducting this struggle in a manner consistent with our values and our international obligations and will continue to do that .

while the issue over secret cia prisons in europe continues to simmer , new allegations over undisclosed cia flights transporting suspected terrorists is pushing european officials to demand answers from washington . the cia continues to use an american military base in germany to transport terrorism suspects without informing the german government , business daily handelsblatt reported thursday .
quoting a high-ranking cia official in washington , the newspaper reported that such flights carrying prisoners were still stopping off at the us base at ramstein . " the cia planes have made stop-overs in several european countries , including germany , " the cia official told handelsblatt .
" nothing has changed that . " meanwhile , the berliner zeitung reported friday there was documentation of 85 takeoffs and landings by planes with a " high probability " of being operated by the cia , at ramstein , the rhine-main airbase and others .
the newspaper cited experts and " plane-spotters " who observed the planes as responsible for the tally . handelsblatt had written that the cia transports its prisoners through multiple european airports either to guantanamo bay or to the alleged secret prisons , so-called " black sites " in eastern europe . german politicians , who have remained quiet for the most part over the issue of black sites in europe , are beginning to call for answers from washington . a green party member of the german parliament 's committee overseeing the intelligence services , hans-christian ströbele , called for an explanation from the german government .
he said it had to be established whether people crossing german soil had been taken into circumstances not in line with human rights . ströbele added that foreign secret services should not be allowed to operate in germany . eu wants a response the council of europe , an independent body , appointed swiss official dick marty to investigate the existence of secret cia detention centers .
marty said satellite images might be used to help determine if the prisons exist .
eu officials , initially reluctant to comment on the matter , have begun to publicly call for a response from washington .
justice commissioner franco frattini said thursday the bloc would seek answers from washington after eu states sent a joint letter to washington on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alleged secret prisons might also use torture the washington post reported earlier this month that the cia used facilities in eastern europe and in asia to hold suspected terrorists .
us-based ngo human rights watch said afterwards that it believes such prisons exist in romania and poland .
both countries have denied the allegations . however , the role of cia flights in the extra-judicial capture of suspected terrorists involves numerous european countries , including iceland , norway , spain and sweden .
most of the flights were alleged to have occurred in 2002 and 2003 , but the newspaper reported that such a plane landed at amsterdam 's airport only last week , and that the intelligence agency uses a number of firms to disguise the flights . painful for washington the issue could have serious consequences for both washington and european countries .
if such prisons are found in eu territory , they would likely violate european conventions on human rights .
if they exist in countries such as romania , they could threaten its application to the eu . the matter could also call into question european participation in the war on terror .
for example , dutch foreign minister bernard bot recently told his country 's parliament that the existence of such prisons in europe would have " consequences " for dutch military operations in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania and poland deny the prisons the cia source told handelsblatt that the discovery of cia practices was " very painful " for employees .
another us government official said that the us plans to answer european concerns soon .
and a top us official on wednesday acknowledged mounting eu pressure for washington to come clean about reports of secret cia prisons in eastern europe while stressing his country 's right to protect itself against terrorists . assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs dan fried said he had discussed the matter with various european officials during talks in berlin , vienna , madrid and brussels last week , but he refused to elaborate . " i do n't want to attempt to characterize our discussions with allies on this , " he told afp .
" the issue came up in a number of ways , in a number of places . " he underlined , however , the us right to wage a battle against terrorism . " we have a duty to protect our people and to do our best to protect others from terrorists , " he said .
" we are conducting this struggle in a manner consistent with our values and our international obligations and will continue to do that . " dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de come clean on secret cia prisons , eu tells us eu officials want the americans to respond to reports of secret cia detention centers on european soil .

while the issue over secret cia prisons in europe continues to simmer , new allegations over undisclosed cia flights transporting suspected terrorists is pushing european officials to demand answers from washington . the cia continues to use an american military base in germany to transport terrorism suspects without informing the german government , business daily handelsblatt reported thursday .
quoting a high-ranking cia official in washington , the newspaper reported that such flights carrying prisoners were still stopping off at the us base at ramstein . " the cia planes have made stop-overs in several european countries , including germany , " the cia official told handelsblatt .
" nothing has changed that . " meanwhile , the berliner zeitung reported friday there was documentation of 85 takeoffs and landings by planes with a " high probability " of being operated by the cia , at ramstein , the rhine-main airbase and others .
the newspaper cited experts and " plane-spotters " who observed the planes as responsible for the tally . handelsblatt had written that the cia transports its prisoners through multiple european airports either to guantanamo bay or to the alleged secret prisons , so-called " black sites " in eastern europe . german politicians , who have remained quiet for the most part over the issue of black sites in europe , are beginning to call for answers from washington . a green party member of the german parliament 's committee overseeing the intelligence services , hans-christian ströbele , called for an explanation from the german government .
he said it had to be established whether people crossing german soil had been taken into circumstances not in line with human rights . ströbele added that foreign secret services should not be allowed to operate in germany . eu wants a response the council of europe , an independent body , appointed swiss official dick marty to investigate the existence of secret cia detention centers .
marty said satellite images might be used to help determine if the prisons exist .
eu officials , initially reluctant to comment on the matter , have begun to publicly call for a response from washington .
justice commissioner franco frattini said thursday the bloc would seek answers from washington after eu states sent a joint letter to washington on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alleged secret prisons might also use torture the washington post reported earlier this month that the cia used facilities in eastern europe and in asia to hold suspected terrorists .
us-based ngo human rights watch said afterwards that it believes such prisons exist in romania and poland .
both countries have denied the allegations . however , the role of cia flights in the extra-judicial capture of suspected terrorists involves numerous european countries , including iceland , norway , spain and sweden .
most of the flights were alleged to have occurred in 2002 and 2003 , but the newspaper reported that such a plane landed at amsterdam 's airport only last week , and that the intelligence agency uses a number of firms to disguise the flights . painful for washington the issue could have serious consequences for both washington and european countries .
if such prisons are found in eu territory , they would likely violate european conventions on human rights .
if they exist in countries such as romania , they could threaten its application to the eu . the matter could also call into question european participation in the war on terror .
for example , dutch foreign minister bernard bot recently told his country 's parliament that the existence of such prisons in europe would have " consequences " for dutch military operations in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania and poland deny the prisons the cia source told handelsblatt that the discovery of cia practices was " very painful " for employees .
another us government official said that the us plans to answer european concerns soon .
and a top us official on wednesday acknowledged mounting eu pressure for washington to come clean about reports of secret cia prisons in eastern europe while stressing his country 's right to protect itself against terrorists . assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs dan fried said he had discussed the matter with various european officials during talks in berlin , vienna , madrid and brussels last week , but he refused to elaborate . " i do n't want to attempt to characterize our discussions with allies on this , " he told afp .
" the issue came up in a number of ways , in a number of places . " he underlined , however , the us right to wage a battle against terrorism . " we have a duty to protect our people and to do our best to protect others from terrorists , " he said .
" we are conducting this struggle in a manner consistent with our values and our international obligations and will continue to do that .

" europe remains a major market for stimulant drugs and indicators suggest that the trend in amphetamine , ecstasy and cocaine use continues to be upwards , " revealed the 2005 annual report compiled by the lisbon-based european monitoring center for drug addiction -lrb- emccd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine has a glamourous reputation around 9 million people in the eu , 3 percent of all adults , have tried cocaine .
but when it comes to the drug of choice , cannabis continues to be on top .
more than 62 million europeans have tried it , while 9.5 million are categorized as regular users , according to the report published on thursday .
germans are especially fond of the drug , with 15 percent between 15-34 having smoked or ingested cannabis last year , the fifth highest figure in europe and just above the european average . but the report also revealed that eu drug decriminalization measures and better treatment programs are showing results .
experts said the shift in eu strategy to prevention , not punishment , has proven to be more effective . punishing trafficker , not user bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : treatment for addicts has improved " the eu has been making some progress with its anti-drugs strategies , " said klaus hurrelmann , a drugs expert at bielefeld university .
the increased tendency to look at the roots rather than the symptoms of the problem has been one of the most positive developments in recent years , he said . " there 's been a shift away from penalizing consumers towards getting tough on traffickers , " he said . the emphasis on decriminalization coupled with a push for better education and treatment has led to positive developments in the fight against heroin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.11.2005 europe fails to tame drug problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lifestyle choice the eu 's annual report on the state of the narcotics problem in europe reveals that cannabis is still the drug of choice of europe 's population - and demand is increasing . " europe remains a major market for stimulant drugs and indicators suggest that the trend in amphetamine , ecstasy and cocaine use continues to be upwards , " revealed the 2005 annual report compiled by the lisbon-based european monitoring center for drug addiction -lrb- emccd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine has a glamourous reputation around 9 million people in the eu , 3 percent of all adults , have tried cocaine .
but when it comes to the drug of choice , cannabis continues to be on top .
more than 62 million europeans have tried it , while 9.5 million are categorized as regular users , according to the report published on thursday .
germans are especially fond of the drug , with 15 percent between 15-34 having smoked or ingested cannabis last year , the fifth highest figure in europe and just above the european average . but the report also revealed that eu drug decriminalization measures and better treatment programs are showing results .
experts said the shift in eu strategy to prevention , not punishment , has proven to be more effective . punishing trafficker , not user bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : treatment for addicts has improved " the eu has been making some progress with its anti-drugs strategies , " said klaus hurrelmann , a drugs expert at bielefeld university .
the increased tendency to look at the roots rather than the symptoms of the problem has been one of the most positive developments in recent years , he said . " there 's been a shift away from penalizing consumers towards getting tough on traffickers , " he said . the emphasis on decriminalization coupled with a push for better education and treatment has led to positive developments in the fight against heroin .
the total number of clients in substitution treatment has passed the half million mark in the european union , according to the report . heroin boom does n't materialize following a seven-fold increase over the last decade , says the emccd , at least 530,000 clients now receive substitution treatment across 28 countries whether through specialist treatment centers or general practitioners .
and it is estimated that somewhere between one-quarter and a half of those with opiate problems in europe may now be receiving treatment of this kind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black markets weaken economies roland simon , of the german watchdog for drugs and drug addiction , the dbdd , points out another positive side-effect of the eu 's education and treatment agenda . " many expected to see an increase in heroin trafficking post 9/11 , " he pointed out , referring to the fact that although the former taliban government banned poppy production , harvests have risen to record levels since the us-led invasion of afghanistan . " but demand is simply no longer there , " said simon .
" there 's actually been a stabilization of the opiate scene , with far fewer new users and far better treatment programs . " eastern europe increasing drug use the news is n't good for all of europe .
improving economies in eastern europe have led to more users - especially of cannabis - in the new eu countries , said simon . " opiates used to arrive in europe via the balkan route , including bulgaria and the former yugoslavia , and once these countries themselves became financially attractive to drug traffickers , a large percentage of the opiates would remain there , " he explained .
" the same is now happening with drugs passing through supply channels in eastern europe such as the czech republic , where there 's more money circulating than there used to be . " the report also warns of the increase in violations of drug law , and says the eu is still a long way from getting a grip on trafficking , a point with which hurrelmann agrees . a call for strategic legalization # b # " the eu has failed either to reduce the consumption of illegal drugs or to tackle the ever-growing black market , " said hurrelmann .
" as the consumption of cannabis and the so-called party drugs increases , the black market continues to grow exponentially .
in this respect , eu drug policy has been simply inefficient . " " there needs to be a european-wide discussion about a strategic legalization that would allow for product control , " he proposed .
" for the time being , what we have are black markets undermining the economies of the production countries as well as our own .
but any talk of strategic legalization is still a highly taboo political subject . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de addicted to medication that germany is home to high levels of alcoholism and tobacco addiction is a well-established , if unhappy fact .
what is less known is the fact that abuse of prescribed medication is also widespread .

while the issue over secret cia prisons in europe continues to simmer , new allegations over undisclosed cia flights transporting suspected terrorists is pushing european officials to demand answers from washington . the cia continues to use an american military base in germany to transport terrorism suspects without informing the german government , business daily handelsblatt reported thursday .
quoting a high-ranking cia official in washington , the newspaper reported that such flights carrying prisoners were still stopping off at the us base at ramstein . " the cia planes have made stop-overs in several european countries , including germany , " the cia official told handelsblatt .
" nothing has changed that . " meanwhile , the berliner zeitung reported friday there was documentation of 85 takeoffs and landings by planes with a " high probability " of being operated by the cia , at ramstein , the rhine-main airbase and others .
the newspaper cited experts and " plane-spotters " who observed the planes as responsible for the tally . handelsblatt had written that the cia transports its prisoners through multiple european airports either to guantanamo bay or to the alleged secret prisons , so-called " black sites " in eastern europe . german politicians , who have remained quiet for the most part over the issue of black sites in europe , are beginning to call for answers from washington . a green party member of the german parliament 's committee overseeing the intelligence services , hans-christian ströbele , called for an explanation from the german government .
he said it had to be established whether people crossing german soil had been taken into circumstances not in line with human rights . ströbele added that foreign secret services should not be allowed to operate in germany . eu wants a response the council of europe , an independent body , appointed swiss official dick marty to investigate the existence of secret cia detention centers .
marty said satellite images might be used to help determine if the prisons exist .
eu officials , initially reluctant to comment on the matter , have begun to publicly call for a response from washington .
justice commissioner franco frattini said thursday the bloc would seek answers from washington after eu states sent a joint letter to washington on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alleged secret prisons might also use torture the washington post reported earlier this month that the cia used facilities in eastern europe and in asia to hold suspected terrorists .
us-based ngo human rights watch said afterwards that it believes such prisons exist in romania and poland .
both countries have denied the allegations . however , the role of cia flights in the extra-judicial capture of suspected terrorists involves numerous european countries , including iceland , norway , spain and sweden .
most of the flights were alleged to have occurred in 2002 and 2003 , but the newspaper reported that such a plane landed at amsterdam 's airport only last week , and that the intelligence agency uses a number of firms to disguise the flights . painful for washington the issue could have serious consequences for both washington and european countries .
if such prisons are found in eu territory , they would likely violate european conventions on human rights .
if they exist in countries such as romania , they could threaten its application to the eu . the matter could also call into question european participation in the war on terror .
for example , dutch foreign minister bernard bot recently told his country 's parliament that the existence of such prisons in europe would have " consequences " for dutch military operations in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania and poland deny the prisons the cia source told handelsblatt that the discovery of cia practices was " very painful " for employees .
another us government official said that the us plans to answer european concerns soon .
and a top us official on wednesday acknowledged mounting eu pressure for washington to come clean about reports of secret cia prisons in eastern europe while stressing his country 's right to protect itself against terrorists . assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs dan fried said he had discussed the matter with various european officials during talks in berlin , vienna , madrid and brussels last week , but he refused to elaborate . " i do n't want to attempt to characterize our discussions with allies on this , " he told afp .
" the issue came up in a number of ways , in a number of places . " he underlined , however , the us right to wage a battle against terrorism . " we have a duty to protect our people and to do our best to protect others from terrorists , " he said .
" we are conducting this struggle in a manner consistent with our values and our international obligations and will continue to do that . " dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de come clean on secret cia prisons , eu tells us eu officials want the americans to respond to reports of secret cia detention centers on european soil .

she eventually died by choking on her own vomit .
at the time of her death , jessica , who was seven , weighed only 9.6 kilograms -lrb- 21 pounds -rrb- - what a normal three-year-old child would weigh . " the accused cared for jessica so inadequately that her basic physical and psychological development was not appropriate to her age , " said the lead judge as the sentence was read .
" this gross neglect was a slow process .
the accused recognized this and simply accepted it . " the circumstances of jessica 's death shocked the nation and had many critically questioning how neither neighbors nor child-protection authorities apparently noticed anything amiss in the household . not an isolated case in may , the city of hamburg put together a special committee to study the instances of neglected children and to come up with new strategies to discover cases and intervene before they become serious or even fatal for children . recently , more cases have surfaced in hamburg , including one in which a four-year-old girl and her two-year-old brother were found living among piles of trash and excrement .
another case involves the parents of two-and-a-half-year-old michelle , who died of a brain edema after her parents failed to seek medical care . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de trial of parents in child neglect case begins the trial of two parents suspected of letting their 7-year-old daughter starve to death by locking her in a room of their hamburg apartment face began on wednesday .

dw 's felix steiner looks back at her first few days in office . a new head of state 's first trip abroad is generally just a matter of protocol , leaving observers at pains to read any great significance into the choice of destination and host . but seven years ago , the freshly-minted chancellor gerhard schröder broke with time-honored tradition when he made for london rather than paris , where german chancellors have always gone first after their election . those were the heady days of the much-touted " third way " - the political vision shared by schröder and tony blair which started out so well and ended so badly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not the beginning of a beautiful friendship by the time schröder left government , europe 's political landscape had seen a major sea-change .
as he and french president jacques chirac became increasingly close allies in the wake of the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , relations between schröder and blair became increasingly hostile .
the cosy anglo-german chats that were a staple of former chancellor helmut kohl 's government became a distant memory . less european , more trans-atlantic against this backdrop , angela merkel 's decision to revert to form and make paris her first official outing abroad was a shrewd one . much to the chagrin of the rest of europe , france and germany have enjoyed a special relationship ever since they signed the elysee treaty in 1963 - but with chirac , merkel went out of her way to stress that their relationship should n't mean they cold-shouldered other member states who 've made no secret in recent years of the fact they feel excluded . her point made , she turned on her heels and headed for her next port of call , brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and jaap de hoop scheffer in brussels her timetable in brussels had its own symbolism .
first , merkel met with nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer , where she spelt out that improving ties between the us and germany was top of her list of priorities .
then she moved on to a meeting with eu commission president jose barroso , reaffirming her new coalition government 's intention to revive the much maligned eu constitution , which has been on hold in recent months . scuppering the critics in london a day later , she and tony blair discussed the eu budget row , a question blair is eager to resolve before britain hands over the eu 's rotating presidency at the end of december . germany 's position on the issue is a crucial one , and blair is well aware of how much he needs merkel to play a conciliatory role in its settlement .
but the chancellor was n't going to be drawn on the issue , simply making it clear that she had no intention of tolerating an outcome that would leave germany shouldering the eu 's financial burden - as has so often happened in the last few decades . it was a message she conveyed at every stop-over this week .
but even so , in paris , brussels and london , merkel came across like a leader who would rather avoid going her own way and making overly hasty decisions .
she might be a novice , but she demonstrated respectable diplomatic finesse and all in all , made a decent debut appearance on the international stage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the best yet to come ?
her first three days in office have gone some way to scuppering her critics ' claims she is n't up to the job . in fact , merkel has already demonstrated that she has what it takes to be a formidable new force in european politics . felix steiner -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair , merkel emphasize eu cooperation german chancellor angela merkel and tony blair talked of increasing cooperation across the eu ahead of sticky budget talks .

dw 's felix steiner looks back at her first few days in office . a new head of state 's first trip abroad is generally just a matter of protocol , leaving observers at pains to read any great significance into the choice of destination and host . but seven years ago , the freshly-minted chancellor gerhard schröder broke with time-honored tradition when he made for london rather than paris , where german chancellors have always gone first after their election . those were the heady days of the much-touted " third way " - the political vision shared by schröder and tony blair which started out so well and ended so badly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not the beginning of a beautiful friendship by the time schröder left government , europe 's political landscape had seen a major sea-change .
as he and french president jacques chirac became increasingly close allies in the wake of the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , relations between schröder and blair became increasingly hostile .
the cosy anglo-german chats that were a staple of former chancellor helmut kohl 's government became a distant memory . less european , more trans-atlantic against this backdrop , angela merkel 's decision to revert to form and make paris her first official outing abroad was a shrewd one . much to the chagrin of the rest of europe , france and germany have enjoyed a special relationship ever since they signed the elysee treaty in 1963 - but with chirac , merkel went out of her way to stress that their relationship should n't mean they cold-shouldered other member states who 've made no secret in recent years of the fact they feel excluded . her point made , she turned on her heels and headed for her next port of call , brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and jaap de hoop scheffer in brussels her timetable in brussels had its own symbolism .
first , merkel met with nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer , where she spelt out that improving ties between the us and germany was top of her list of priorities .
then she moved on to a meeting with eu commission president jose barroso , reaffirming her new coalition government 's intention to revive the much maligned eu constitution , which has been on hold in recent months . scuppering the critics in london a day later , she and tony blair discussed the eu budget row , a question blair is eager to resolve before britain hands over the eu 's rotating presidency at the end of december . germany 's position on the issue is a crucial one , and blair is well aware of how much he needs merkel to play a conciliatory role in its settlement .
but the chancellor was n't going to be drawn on the issue , simply making it clear that she had no intention of tolerating an outcome that would leave germany shouldering the eu 's financial burden - as has so often happened in the last few decades . it was a message she conveyed at every stop-over this week .
but even so , in paris , brussels and london , merkel came across like a leader who would rather avoid going her own way and making overly hasty decisions .
she might be a novice , but she demonstrated respectable diplomatic finesse and all in all , made a decent debut appearance on the international stage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the best yet to come ?
her first three days in office have gone some way to scuppering her critics ' claims she is n't up to the job . in fact , merkel has already demonstrated that she has what it takes to be a formidable new force in european politics . felix steiner -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair , merkel emphasize eu cooperation german chancellor angela merkel and tony blair talked of increasing cooperation across the eu ahead of sticky budget talks .

while the issue over secret cia prisons in europe continues to simmer , new allegations over undisclosed cia flights transporting suspected terrorists is pushing european officials to demand answers from washington . the cia continues to use an american military base in germany to transport terrorism suspects without informing the german government , business daily handelsblatt reported thursday .
quoting a high-ranking cia official in washington , the newspaper reported that such flights carrying prisoners were still stopping off at the us base at ramstein . " the cia planes have made stop-overs in several european countries , including germany , " the cia official told handelsblatt .
" nothing has changed that . " meanwhile , the berliner zeitung reported friday there was documentation of 85 takeoffs and landings by planes with a " high probability " of being operated by the cia , at ramstein , the rhine-main airbase and others .
the newspaper cited experts and " plane-spotters " who observed the planes as responsible for the tally . handelsblatt had written that the cia transports its prisoners through multiple european airports either to guantanamo bay or to the alleged secret prisons , so-called " black sites " in eastern europe . german politicians , who have remained quiet for the most part over the issue of black sites in europe , are beginning to call for answers from washington . a green party member of the german parliament 's committee overseeing the intelligence services , hans-christian ströbele , called for an explanation from the german government .
he said it had to be established whether people crossing german soil had been taken into circumstances not in line with human rights . ströbele added that foreign secret services should not be allowed to operate in germany . eu wants a response the council of europe , an independent body , appointed swiss official dick marty to investigate the existence of secret cia detention centers .
marty said satellite images might be used to help determine if the prisons exist .
eu officials , initially reluctant to comment on the matter , have begun to publicly call for a response from washington .
justice commissioner franco frattini said thursday the bloc would seek answers from washington after eu states sent a joint letter to washington on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alleged secret prisons might also use torture the washington post reported earlier this month that the cia used facilities in eastern europe and in asia to hold suspected terrorists .
us-based ngo human rights watch said afterwards that it believes such prisons exist in romania and poland .
both countries have denied the allegations . however , the role of cia flights in the extra-judicial capture of suspected terrorists involves numerous european countries , including iceland , norway , spain and sweden .
most of the flights were alleged to have occurred in 2002 and 2003 , but the newspaper reported that such a plane landed at amsterdam 's airport only last week , and that the intelligence agency uses a number of firms to disguise the flights . painful for washington the issue could have serious consequences for both washington and european countries .
if such prisons are found in eu territory , they would likely violate european conventions on human rights .
if they exist in countries such as romania , they could threaten its application to the eu . the matter could also call into question european participation in the war on terror .
for example , dutch foreign minister bernard bot recently told his country 's parliament that the existence of such prisons in europe would have " consequences " for dutch military operations in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania and poland deny the prisons the cia source told handelsblatt that the discovery of cia practices was " very painful " for employees .
another us government official said that the us plans to answer european concerns soon .
and a top us official on wednesday acknowledged mounting eu pressure for washington to come clean about reports of secret cia prisons in eastern europe while stressing his country 's right to protect itself against terrorists . assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs dan fried said he had discussed the matter with various european officials during talks in berlin , vienna , madrid and brussels last week , but he refused to elaborate . " i do n't want to attempt to characterize our discussions with allies on this , " he told afp .
" the issue came up in a number of ways , in a number of places . " he underlined , however , the us right to wage a battle against terrorism . " we have a duty to protect our people and to do our best to protect others from terrorists , " he said .
" we are conducting this struggle in a manner consistent with our values and our international obligations and will continue to do that .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.11.2005 europe fails to tame drug problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lifestyle choice the eu 's annual report on the state of the narcotics problem in europe reveals that cannabis is still the drug of choice of europe 's population - and demand is increasing . " europe remains a major market for stimulant drugs and indicators suggest that the trend in amphetamine , ecstasy and cocaine use continues to be upwards , " revealed the 2005 annual report compiled by the lisbon-based european monitoring center for drug addiction -lrb- emccd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine has a glamourous reputation around 9 million people in the eu , 3 percent of all adults , have tried cocaine .
but when it comes to the drug of choice , cannabis continues to be on top .
more than 62 million europeans have tried it , while 9.5 million are categorized as regular users , according to the report published on thursday .
germans are especially fond of the drug , with 15 percent between 15-34 having smoked or ingested cannabis last year , the fifth highest figure in europe and just above the european average . but the report also revealed that eu drug decriminalization measures and better treatment programs are showing results .
experts said the shift in eu strategy to prevention , not punishment , has proven to be more effective . punishing trafficker , not user bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : treatment for addicts has improved " the eu has been making some progress with its anti-drugs strategies , " said klaus hurrelmann , a drugs expert at bielefeld university .
the increased tendency to look at the roots rather than the symptoms of the problem has been one of the most positive developments in recent years , he said . " there 's been a shift away from penalizing consumers towards getting tough on traffickers , " he said . the emphasis on decriminalization coupled with a push for better education and treatment has led to positive developments in the fight against heroin .
the total number of clients in substitution treatment has passed the half million mark in the european union , according to the report . heroin boom does n't materialize following a seven-fold increase over the last decade , says the emccd , at least 530,000 clients now receive substitution treatment across 28 countries whether through specialist treatment centers or general practitioners .
and it is estimated that somewhere between one-quarter and a half of those with opiate problems in europe may now be receiving treatment of this kind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black markets weaken economies roland simon , of the german watchdog for drugs and drug addiction , the dbdd , points out another positive side-effect of the eu 's education and treatment agenda . " many expected to see an increase in heroin trafficking post 9/11 , " he pointed out , referring to the fact that although the former taliban government banned poppy production , harvests have risen to record levels since the us-led invasion of afghanistan . " but demand is simply no longer there , " said simon .
" there 's actually been a stabilization of the opiate scene , with far fewer new users and far better treatment programs . " eastern europe increasing drug use the news is n't good for all of europe .
improving economies in eastern europe have led to more users - especially of cannabis - in the new eu countries , said simon . " opiates used to arrive in europe via the balkan route , including bulgaria and the former yugoslavia , and once these countries themselves became financially attractive to drug traffickers , a large percentage of the opiates would remain there , " he explained .
" the same is now happening with drugs passing through supply channels in eastern europe such as the czech republic , where there 's more money circulating than there used to be . " the report also warns of the increase in violations of drug law , and says the eu is still a long way from getting a grip on trafficking , a point with which hurrelmann agrees . a call for strategic legalization # b # " the eu has failed either to reduce the consumption of illegal drugs or to tackle the ever-growing black market , " said hurrelmann .
" as the consumption of cannabis and the so-called party drugs increases , the black market continues to grow exponentially .
in this respect , eu drug policy has been simply inefficient . " " there needs to be a european-wide discussion about a strategic legalization that would allow for product control , " he proposed .
" for the time being , what we have are black markets undermining the economies of the production countries as well as our own .
but any talk of strategic legalization is still a highly taboo political subject . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de addicted to medication that germany is home to high levels of alcoholism and tobacco addiction is a well-established , if unhappy fact .

" europe remains a major market for stimulant drugs and indicators suggest that the trend in amphetamine , ecstasy and cocaine use continues to be upwards , " revealed the 2005 annual report compiled by the lisbon-based european monitoring center for drug addiction -lrb- emccd -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cocaine has a glamourous reputation around 9 million people in the eu , 3 percent of all adults , have tried cocaine .
but when it comes to the drug of choice , cannabis continues to be on top .
more than 62 million europeans have tried it , while 9.5 million are categorized as regular users , according to the report published on thursday .
germans are especially fond of the drug , with 15 percent between 15-34 having smoked or ingested cannabis last year , the fifth highest figure in europe and just above the european average . but the report also revealed that eu drug decriminalization measures and better treatment programs are showing results .
experts said the shift in eu strategy to prevention , not punishment , has proven to be more effective . punishing trafficker , not user bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : treatment for addicts has improved " the eu has been making some progress with its anti-drugs strategies , " said klaus hurrelmann , a drugs expert at bielefeld university .
the increased tendency to look at the roots rather than the symptoms of the problem has been one of the most positive developments in recent years , he said . " there 's been a shift away from penalizing consumers towards getting tough on traffickers , " he said . the emphasis on decriminalization coupled with a push for better education and treatment has led to positive developments in the fight against heroin .
the total number of clients in substitution treatment has passed the half million mark in the european union , according to the report . heroin boom does n't materialize following a seven-fold increase over the last decade , says the emccd , at least 530,000 clients now receive substitution treatment across 28 countries whether through specialist treatment centers or general practitioners .
and it is estimated that somewhere between one-quarter and a half of those with opiate problems in europe may now be receiving treatment of this kind .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : black markets weaken economies roland simon , of the german watchdog for drugs and drug addiction , the dbdd , points out another positive side-effect of the eu 's education and treatment agenda . " many expected to see an increase in heroin trafficking post 9/11 , " he pointed out , referring to the fact that although the former taliban government banned poppy production , harvests have risen to record levels since the us-led invasion of afghanistan . " but demand is simply no longer there , " said simon .
" there 's actually been a stabilization of the opiate scene , with far fewer new users and far better treatment programs . " eastern europe increasing drug use the news is n't good for all of europe .
improving economies in eastern europe have led to more users - especially of cannabis - in the new eu countries , said simon . " opiates used to arrive in europe via the balkan route , including bulgaria and the former yugoslavia , and once these countries themselves became financially attractive to drug traffickers , a large percentage of the opiates would remain there , " he explained .
" the same is now happening with drugs passing through supply channels in eastern europe such as the czech republic , where there 's more money circulating than there used to be . " the report also warns of the increase in violations of drug law , and says the eu is still a long way from getting a grip on trafficking , a point with which hurrelmann agrees . a call for strategic legalization # b # " the eu has failed either to reduce the consumption of illegal drugs or to tackle the ever-growing black market , " said hurrelmann .
" as the consumption of cannabis and the so-called party drugs increases , the black market continues to grow exponentially .
in this respect , eu drug policy has been simply inefficient . " " there needs to be a european-wide discussion about a strategic legalization that would allow for product control , " he proposed .
" for the time being , what we have are black markets undermining the economies of the production countries as well as our own .
but any talk of strategic legalization is still a highly taboo political subject . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de addicted to medication that germany is home to high levels of alcoholism and tobacco addiction is a well-established , if unhappy fact .

more than 62 million europeans have tried it , while 9.5 million are categorized as regular users , according to the report published on thursday .
germans are especially fond of the drug , with 15 percent between 15-34 having smoked or ingested cannabis last year , the fifth highest figure in europe and just above the european average . but the report also revealed that eu drug decriminalization measures and better treatment programs are showing results .

while the issue over secret cia prisons in europe continues to simmer , new allegations over undisclosed cia flights transporting suspected terrorists is pushing european officials to demand answers from washington . the cia continues to use an american military base in germany to transport terrorism suspects without informing the german government , business daily handelsblatt reported thursday .
quoting a high-ranking cia official in washington , the newspaper reported that such flights carrying prisoners were still stopping off at the us base at ramstein . " the cia planes have made stop-overs in several european countries , including germany , " the cia official told handelsblatt .
" nothing has changed that . " meanwhile , the berliner zeitung reported friday there was documentation of 85 takeoffs and landings by planes with a " high probability " of being operated by the cia , at ramstein , the rhine-main airbase and others .
the newspaper cited experts and " plane-spotters " who observed the planes as responsible for the tally . handelsblatt had written that the cia transports its prisoners through multiple european airports either to guantanamo bay or to the alleged secret prisons , so-called " black sites " in eastern europe . german politicians , who have remained quiet for the most part over the issue of black sites in europe , are beginning to call for answers from washington . a green party member of the german parliament 's committee overseeing the intelligence services , hans-christian ströbele , called for an explanation from the german government .
he said it had to be established whether people crossing german soil had been taken into circumstances not in line with human rights . ströbele added that foreign secret services should not be allowed to operate in germany . eu wants a response the council of europe , an independent body , appointed swiss official dick marty to investigate the existence of secret cia detention centers .
marty said satellite images might be used to help determine if the prisons exist .
eu officials , initially reluctant to comment on the matter , have begun to publicly call for a response from washington .
justice commissioner franco frattini said thursday the bloc would seek answers from washington after eu states sent a joint letter to washington on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alleged secret prisons might also use torture the washington post reported earlier this month that the cia used facilities in eastern europe and in asia to hold suspected terrorists .
us-based ngo human rights watch said afterwards that it believes such prisons exist in romania and poland .
both countries have denied the allegations . however , the role of cia flights in the extra-judicial capture of suspected terrorists involves numerous european countries , including iceland , norway , spain and sweden .
most of the flights were alleged to have occurred in 2002 and 2003 , but the newspaper reported that such a plane landed at amsterdam 's airport only last week , and that the intelligence agency uses a number of firms to disguise the flights . painful for washington the issue could have serious consequences for both washington and european countries .
if such prisons are found in eu territory , they would likely violate european conventions on human rights .
if they exist in countries such as romania , they could threaten its application to the eu . the matter could also call into question european participation in the war on terror .
for example , dutch foreign minister bernard bot recently told his country 's parliament that the existence of such prisons in europe would have " consequences " for dutch military operations in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania and poland deny the prisons the cia source told handelsblatt that the discovery of cia practices was " very painful " for employees .
another us government official said that the us plans to answer european concerns soon .
and a top us official on wednesday acknowledged mounting eu pressure for washington to come clean about reports of secret cia prisons in eastern europe while stressing his country 's right to protect itself against terrorists . assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs dan fried said he had discussed the matter with various european officials during talks in berlin , vienna , madrid and brussels last week , but he refused to elaborate . " i do n't want to attempt to characterize our discussions with allies on this , " he told afp .
" the issue came up in a number of ways , in a number of places . " he underlined , however , the us right to wage a battle against terrorism . " we have a duty to protect our people and to do our best to protect others from terrorists , " he said .
" we are conducting this struggle in a manner consistent with our values and our international obligations and will continue to do that . " dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de come clean on secret cia prisons , eu tells us eu officials want the americans to respond to reports of secret cia detention centers on european soil .

while the issue over secret cia prisons in europe continues to simmer , new allegations over undisclosed cia flights transporting suspected terrorists is pushing european officials to demand answers from washington . the cia continues to use an american military base in germany to transport terrorism suspects without informing the german government , business daily handelsblatt reported thursday .
quoting a high-ranking cia official in washington , the newspaper reported that such flights carrying prisoners were still stopping off at the us base at ramstein . " the cia planes have made stop-overs in several european countries , including germany , " the cia official told handelsblatt .
" nothing has changed that . " meanwhile , the berliner zeitung reported friday there was documentation of 85 takeoffs and landings by planes with a " high probability " of being operated by the cia , at ramstein , the rhine-main airbase and others .
the newspaper cited experts and " plane-spotters " who observed the planes as responsible for the tally . handelsblatt had written that the cia transports its prisoners through multiple european airports either to guantanamo bay or to the alleged secret prisons , so-called " black sites " in eastern europe . german politicians , who have remained quiet for the most part over the issue of black sites in europe , are beginning to call for answers from washington . a green party member of the german parliament 's committee overseeing the intelligence services , hans-christian ströbele , called for an explanation from the german government .
he said it had to be established whether people crossing german soil had been taken into circumstances not in line with human rights . ströbele added that foreign secret services should not be allowed to operate in germany . eu wants a response the council of europe , an independent body , appointed swiss official dick marty to investigate the existence of secret cia detention centers .
marty said satellite images might be used to help determine if the prisons exist .
eu officials , initially reluctant to comment on the matter , have begun to publicly call for a response from washington .
justice commissioner franco frattini said thursday the bloc would seek answers from washington after eu states sent a joint letter to washington on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alleged secret prisons might also use torture the washington post reported earlier this month that the cia used facilities in eastern europe and in asia to hold suspected terrorists .
us-based ngo human rights watch said afterwards that it believes such prisons exist in romania and poland .
both countries have denied the allegations . however , the role of cia flights in the extra-judicial capture of suspected terrorists involves numerous european countries , including iceland , norway , spain and sweden .
most of the flights were alleged to have occurred in 2002 and 2003 , but the newspaper reported that such a plane landed at amsterdam 's airport only last week , and that the intelligence agency uses a number of firms to disguise the flights . painful for washington the issue could have serious consequences for both washington and european countries .
if such prisons are found in eu territory , they would likely violate european conventions on human rights .
if they exist in countries such as romania , they could threaten its application to the eu . the matter could also call into question european participation in the war on terror .
for example , dutch foreign minister bernard bot recently told his country 's parliament that the existence of such prisons in europe would have " consequences " for dutch military operations in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania and poland deny the prisons the cia source told handelsblatt that the discovery of cia practices was " very painful " for employees .
another us government official said that the us plans to answer european concerns soon .
and a top us official on wednesday acknowledged mounting eu pressure for washington to come clean about reports of secret cia prisons in eastern europe while stressing his country 's right to protect itself against terrorists . assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs dan fried said he had discussed the matter with various european officials during talks in berlin , vienna , madrid and brussels last week , but he refused to elaborate . " i do n't want to attempt to characterize our discussions with allies on this , " he told afp .
" the issue came up in a number of ways , in a number of places . " he underlined , however , the us right to wage a battle against terrorism . " we have a duty to protect our people and to do our best to protect others from terrorists , " he said .
" we are conducting this struggle in a manner consistent with our values and our international obligations and will continue to do that .

while the issue over secret cia prisons in europe continues to simmer , new allegations over undisclosed cia flights transporting suspected terrorists is pushing european officials to demand answers from washington . the cia continues to use an american military base in germany to transport terrorism suspects without informing the german government , business daily handelsblatt reported thursday .
quoting a high-ranking cia official in washington , the newspaper reported that such flights carrying prisoners were still stopping off at the us base at ramstein . " the cia planes have made stop-overs in several european countries , including germany , " the cia official told handelsblatt .
" nothing has changed that . " meanwhile , the berliner zeitung reported friday there was documentation of 85 takeoffs and landings by planes with a " high probability " of being operated by the cia , at ramstein , the rhine-main airbase and others .
the newspaper cited experts and " plane-spotters " who observed the planes as responsible for the tally . handelsblatt had written that the cia transports its prisoners through multiple european airports either to guantanamo bay or to the alleged secret prisons , so-called " black sites " in eastern europe . german politicians , who have remained quiet for the most part over the issue of black sites in europe , are beginning to call for answers from washington . a green party member of the german parliament 's committee overseeing the intelligence services , hans-christian ströbele , called for an explanation from the german government .
he said it had to be established whether people crossing german soil had been taken into circumstances not in line with human rights . ströbele added that foreign secret services should not be allowed to operate in germany . eu wants a response the council of europe , an independent body , appointed swiss official dick marty to investigate the existence of secret cia detention centers .
marty said satellite images might be used to help determine if the prisons exist .
eu officials , initially reluctant to comment on the matter , have begun to publicly call for a response from washington .
justice commissioner franco frattini said thursday the bloc would seek answers from washington after eu states sent a joint letter to washington on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alleged secret prisons might also use torture the washington post reported earlier this month that the cia used facilities in eastern europe and in asia to hold suspected terrorists .
us-based ngo human rights watch said afterwards that it believes such prisons exist in romania and poland .
both countries have denied the allegations . however , the role of cia flights in the extra-judicial capture of suspected terrorists involves numerous european countries , including iceland , norway , spain and sweden .
most of the flights were alleged to have occurred in 2002 and 2003 , but the newspaper reported that such a plane landed at amsterdam 's airport only last week , and that the intelligence agency uses a number of firms to disguise the flights . painful for washington the issue could have serious consequences for both washington and european countries .
if such prisons are found in eu territory , they would likely violate european conventions on human rights .
if they exist in countries such as romania , they could threaten its application to the eu . the matter could also call into question european participation in the war on terror .
for example , dutch foreign minister bernard bot recently told his country 's parliament that the existence of such prisons in europe would have " consequences " for dutch military operations in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania and poland deny the prisons the cia source told handelsblatt that the discovery of cia practices was " very painful " for employees .
another us government official said that the us plans to answer european concerns soon .
and a top us official on wednesday acknowledged mounting eu pressure for washington to come clean about reports of secret cia prisons in eastern europe while stressing his country 's right to protect itself against terrorists . assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs dan fried said he had discussed the matter with various european officials during talks in berlin , vienna , madrid and brussels last week , but he refused to elaborate . " i do n't want to attempt to characterize our discussions with allies on this , " he told afp .
" the issue came up in a number of ways , in a number of places . " he underlined , however , the us right to wage a battle against terrorism . " we have a duty to protect our people and to do our best to protect others from terrorists , " he said .
" we are conducting this struggle in a manner consistent with our values and our international obligations and will continue to do that .

at the second game in istanbul , turkish fans returned the favor , jeering during the swiss national song . " that was so disrespectful and a slur on a nation 's pride , " he said .
" it makes me wonder if it makes any sense continuing to play national anthems . " at the end of the match in istanbul , a fight broke out between the two sides in the tunnel leading to the dressing rooms .

while the issue over secret cia prisons in europe continues to simmer , new allegations over undisclosed cia flights transporting suspected terrorists is pushing european officials to demand answers from washington . the cia continues to use an american military base in germany to transport terrorism suspects without informing the german government , business daily handelsblatt reported thursday .
quoting a high-ranking cia official in washington , the newspaper reported that such flights carrying prisoners were still stopping off at the us base at ramstein . " the cia planes have made stop-overs in several european countries , including germany , " the cia official told handelsblatt .
" nothing has changed that . " meanwhile , the berliner zeitung reported friday there was documentation of 85 takeoffs and landings by planes with a " high probability " of being operated by the cia , at ramstein , the rhine-main airbase and others .
the newspaper cited experts and " plane-spotters " who observed the planes as responsible for the tally . handelsblatt had written that the cia transports its prisoners through multiple european airports either to guantanamo bay or to the alleged secret prisons , so-called " black sites " in eastern europe . german politicians , who have remained quiet for the most part over the issue of black sites in europe , are beginning to call for answers from washington . a green party member of the german parliament 's committee overseeing the intelligence services , hans-christian ströbele , called for an explanation from the german government .
he said it had to be established whether people crossing german soil had been taken into circumstances not in line with human rights . ströbele added that foreign secret services should not be allowed to operate in germany . eu wants a response the council of europe , an independent body , appointed swiss official dick marty to investigate the existence of secret cia detention centers .
marty said satellite images might be used to help determine if the prisons exist .
eu officials , initially reluctant to comment on the matter , have begun to publicly call for a response from washington .
justice commissioner franco frattini said thursday the bloc would seek answers from washington after eu states sent a joint letter to washington on the issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alleged secret prisons might also use torture the washington post reported earlier this month that the cia used facilities in eastern europe and in asia to hold suspected terrorists .
us-based ngo human rights watch said afterwards that it believes such prisons exist in romania and poland .
both countries have denied the allegations . however , the role of cia flights in the extra-judicial capture of suspected terrorists involves numerous european countries , including iceland , norway , spain and sweden .
most of the flights were alleged to have occurred in 2002 and 2003 , but the newspaper reported that such a plane landed at amsterdam 's airport only last week , and that the intelligence agency uses a number of firms to disguise the flights . painful for washington the issue could have serious consequences for both washington and european countries .
if such prisons are found in eu territory , they would likely violate european conventions on human rights .
if they exist in countries such as romania , they could threaten its application to the eu . the matter could also call into question european participation in the war on terror .
for example , dutch foreign minister bernard bot recently told his country 's parliament that the existence of such prisons in europe would have " consequences " for dutch military operations in afghanistan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania and poland deny the prisons the cia source told handelsblatt that the discovery of cia practices was " very painful " for employees .
another us government official said that the us plans to answer european concerns soon .
and a top us official on wednesday acknowledged mounting eu pressure for washington to come clean about reports of secret cia prisons in eastern europe while stressing his country 's right to protect itself against terrorists . assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs dan fried said he had discussed the matter with various european officials during talks in berlin , vienna , madrid and brussels last week , but he refused to elaborate . " i do n't want to attempt to characterize our discussions with allies on this , " he told afp .
" the issue came up in a number of ways , in a number of places . " he underlined , however , the us right to wage a battle against terrorism . " we have a duty to protect our people and to do our best to protect others from terrorists , " he said .
" we are conducting this struggle in a manner consistent with our values and our international obligations and will continue to do that .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.11.2005 opinion : merkel debuts abroad with aplomb großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it started with a kiss angela merkel was sworn in as germany 's first female chancellor on tuesday , and wasted no time setting off on a whistle-stop tour of europe .
dw 's felix steiner looks back at her first few days in office . a new head of state 's first trip abroad is generally just a matter of protocol , leaving observers at pains to read any great significance into the choice of destination and host . but seven years ago , the freshly-minted chancellor gerhard schröder broke with time-honored tradition when he made for london rather than paris , where german chancellors have always gone first after their election . those were the heady days of the much-touted " third way " - the political vision shared by schröder and tony blair which started out so well and ended so badly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not the beginning of a beautiful friendship by the time schröder left government , europe 's political landscape had seen a major sea-change .
as he and french president jacques chirac became increasingly close allies in the wake of the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , relations between schröder and blair became increasingly hostile .
the cosy anglo-german chats that were a staple of former chancellor helmut kohl 's government became a distant memory . less european , more trans-atlantic against this backdrop , angela merkel 's decision to revert to form and make paris her first official outing abroad was a shrewd one . much to the chagrin of the rest of europe , france and germany have enjoyed a special relationship ever since they signed the elysee treaty in 1963 - but with chirac , merkel went out of her way to stress that their relationship should n't mean they cold-shouldered other member states who 've made no secret in recent years of the fact they feel excluded . her point made , she turned on her heels and headed for her next port of call , brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and jaap de hoop scheffer in brussels her timetable in brussels had its own symbolism .
first , merkel met with nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer , where she spelt out that improving ties between the us and germany was top of her list of priorities .
then she moved on to a meeting with eu commission president jose barroso , reaffirming her new coalition government 's intention to revive the much maligned eu constitution , which has been on hold in recent months . scuppering the critics in london a day later , she and tony blair discussed the eu budget row , a question blair is eager to resolve before britain hands over the eu 's rotating presidency at the end of december . germany 's position on the issue is a crucial one , and blair is well aware of how much he needs merkel to play a conciliatory role in its settlement .
but the chancellor was n't going to be drawn on the issue , simply making it clear that she had no intention of tolerating an outcome that would leave germany shouldering the eu 's financial burden - as has so often happened in the last few decades . it was a message she conveyed at every stop-over this week .
but even so , in paris , brussels and london , merkel came across like a leader who would rather avoid going her own way and making overly hasty decisions .
she might be a novice , but she demonstrated respectable diplomatic finesse and all in all , made a decent debut appearance on the international stage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the best yet to come ?
her first three days in office have gone some way to scuppering her critics ' claims she is n't up to the job . in fact , merkel has already demonstrated that she has what it takes to be a formidable new force in european politics . felix steiner -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair , merkel emphasize eu cooperation german chancellor angela merkel and tony blair talked of increasing cooperation across the eu ahead of sticky budget talks .
but both ducked questions on key issues following their first meeting .

dw 's felix steiner looks back at her first few days in office . a new head of state 's first trip abroad is generally just a matter of protocol , leaving observers at pains to read any great significance into the choice of destination and host . but seven years ago , the freshly-minted chancellor gerhard schröder broke with time-honored tradition when he made for london rather than paris , where german chancellors have always gone first after their election . those were the heady days of the much-touted " third way " - the political vision shared by schröder and tony blair which started out so well and ended so badly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not the beginning of a beautiful friendship by the time schröder left government , europe 's political landscape had seen a major sea-change .
as he and french president jacques chirac became increasingly close allies in the wake of the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , relations between schröder and blair became increasingly hostile .
the cosy anglo-german chats that were a staple of former chancellor helmut kohl 's government became a distant memory . less european , more trans-atlantic against this backdrop , angela merkel 's decision to revert to form and make paris her first official outing abroad was a shrewd one . much to the chagrin of the rest of europe , france and germany have enjoyed a special relationship ever since they signed the elysee treaty in 1963 - but with chirac , merkel went out of her way to stress that their relationship should n't mean they cold-shouldered other member states who 've made no secret in recent years of the fact they feel excluded . her point made , she turned on her heels and headed for her next port of call , brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and jaap de hoop scheffer in brussels her timetable in brussels had its own symbolism .
first , merkel met with nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer , where she spelt out that improving ties between the us and germany was top of her list of priorities .
then she moved on to a meeting with eu commission president jose barroso , reaffirming her new coalition government 's intention to revive the much maligned eu constitution , which has been on hold in recent months . scuppering the critics in london a day later , she and tony blair discussed the eu budget row , a question blair is eager to resolve before britain hands over the eu 's rotating presidency at the end of december . germany 's position on the issue is a crucial one , and blair is well aware of how much he needs merkel to play a conciliatory role in its settlement .
but the chancellor was n't going to be drawn on the issue , simply making it clear that she had no intention of tolerating an outcome that would leave germany shouldering the eu 's financial burden - as has so often happened in the last few decades . it was a message she conveyed at every stop-over this week .
but even so , in paris , brussels and london , merkel came across like a leader who would rather avoid going her own way and making overly hasty decisions .
she might be a novice , but she demonstrated respectable diplomatic finesse and all in all , made a decent debut appearance on the international stage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the best yet to come ?
her first three days in office have gone some way to scuppering her critics ' claims she is n't up to the job . in fact , merkel has already demonstrated that she has what it takes to be a formidable new force in european politics . felix steiner -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair , merkel emphasize eu cooperation german chancellor angela merkel and tony blair talked of increasing cooperation across the eu ahead of sticky budget talks .

dw 's felix steiner looks back at her first few days in office . a new head of state 's first trip abroad is generally just a matter of protocol , leaving observers at pains to read any great significance into the choice of destination and host . but seven years ago , the freshly-minted chancellor gerhard schröder broke with time-honored tradition when he made for london rather than paris , where german chancellors have always gone first after their election . those were the heady days of the much-touted " third way " - the political vision shared by schröder and tony blair which started out so well and ended so badly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not the beginning of a beautiful friendship by the time schröder left government , europe 's political landscape had seen a major sea-change .
as he and french president jacques chirac became increasingly close allies in the wake of the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , relations between schröder and blair became increasingly hostile .
the cosy anglo-german chats that were a staple of former chancellor helmut kohl 's government became a distant memory . less european , more trans-atlantic against this backdrop , angela merkel 's decision to revert to form and make paris her first official outing abroad was a shrewd one . much to the chagrin of the rest of europe , france and germany have enjoyed a special relationship ever since they signed the elysee treaty in 1963 - but with chirac , merkel went out of her way to stress that their relationship should n't mean they cold-shouldered other member states who 've made no secret in recent years of the fact they feel excluded . her point made , she turned on her heels and headed for her next port of call , brussels . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and jaap de hoop scheffer in brussels her timetable in brussels had its own symbolism .
first , merkel met with nato chief jaap de hoop scheffer , where she spelt out that improving ties between the us and germany was top of her list of priorities .
then she moved on to a meeting with eu commission president jose barroso , reaffirming her new coalition government 's intention to revive the much maligned eu constitution , which has been on hold in recent months . scuppering the critics in london a day later , she and tony blair discussed the eu budget row , a question blair is eager to resolve before britain hands over the eu 's rotating presidency at the end of december . germany 's position on the issue is a crucial one , and blair is well aware of how much he needs merkel to play a conciliatory role in its settlement .
but the chancellor was n't going to be drawn on the issue , simply making it clear that she had no intention of tolerating an outcome that would leave germany shouldering the eu 's financial burden - as has so often happened in the last few decades . it was a message she conveyed at every stop-over this week .
but even so , in paris , brussels and london , merkel came across like a leader who would rather avoid going her own way and making overly hasty decisions .
she might be a novice , but she demonstrated respectable diplomatic finesse and all in all , made a decent debut appearance on the international stage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the best yet to come ?
her first three days in office have gone some way to scuppering her critics ' claims she is n't up to the job . in fact , merkel has already demonstrated that she has what it takes to be a formidable new force in european politics . felix steiner -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair , merkel emphasize eu cooperation german chancellor angela merkel and tony blair talked of increasing cooperation across the eu ahead of sticky budget talks .

famous for landmarks such as the liver buildings and the anglican cathedral , one of liverpool 's proudest boasts is that the distinctive cityscape was many travellers ' first - or last - view of britain .
but now this scene , with its giant reminders of past prosperity , is changing fast .
in liverpool 2005 , towering cranes appear everywhere , helping to forge a bold new vista that will alter the face of the city for good .
a vast building site has opened up between the albert dock , another of the city 's blasts from the past , and paradise street .
aerial view of the paradise project enlarge image but look beyond the dust , the digging and the disruption , and you 'll see the renaissance of a city .
at the heart of this revival is the paradise project , an ambitious £ 920m plan to draw visitors back down the m62 to live , work , socialise and shop .
the project centres on a 42-acre site which will modernise the city centre , pulling together the different areas of the city on the former site of chevasse park .
project leaders grosvenor are creating new look streets , squares and public spaces , working with the protected historic buildings and existing shopping districts to make a new-look liverpool .
the plan is to put liverpool in the top five uk shopping cities one year after work on the project began , grosvenor say they are working to schedule , opening the new paradise street bus interchange last week .
paradise project director rod holmes wants to put liverpool back in the top five retail destinations in the uk .
at the end of this regeneration , he says , people wo n't be heading out of town to do their shopping anymore .
currently , despite the presence of independent stores , such as footballers ' wives ' favourite cricket , all too often the city 's fashion addicts have to trek 40 miles to manchester for the most exclusive brand names .
retailers already signed up to the development include cornerstone department stores debenhams , who are currently without a liverpool base , and john lewis , who are moving from their basnett street home to a bigger , shinier store .
as far as keeping shoppers in the city , lovers of designer labels may feel they still need to travel to manchester or leeds , where selfridges and harvey nichols dominate the upper class end of the market .
we want to open up the docklands area rod holmes but mr holmes insisted part of the paradise project would be aimed at the well-heeled shopper .
he said the " boutique " area would be housed in a narrow arcade , designed by the architects behind the london 's royal opera house , jeremy dixon and edward jones with bdp .
one of the unique aspects of this project is grosvenor 's commitment to retaining the city 's historical victorian buildings .
rather than house the city 's shops in one undercover metropolis , the paradise project wants to keep the character of liverpool intact , with plenty of green space in the city centre .
" the development has a part-covered two-level shopping street , to shelter shoppers from the worst of the weather , " he said .
" the paved area in between will look out to the park and down to the docks .
we want to open up the docklands area and encourage people to go down to the waterfront . "
the project includes an information centre telling people about the city 's history and role as the number one european slave port in the 18th century .
part of the old dock wall has been excavated and preserved , and will form a central part of the information centre .
the project may be moving the city forward , but it 's certainly not forgetting its past .

the project includes an information centre telling people about the city 's history and role as the number one european slave port in the 18th century .
part of the old dock wall has been excavated and preserved , and will form a central part of the information centre .

at the heart of this revival is the paradise project , an ambitious £ 920m plan to draw visitors back down the m62 to live , work , socialise and shop .
the project centres on a 42-acre site which will modernise the city centre , pulling together the different areas of the city on the former site of chevasse park .
project leaders grosvenor are creating new look streets , squares and public spaces , working with the protected historic buildings and existing shopping districts to make a new-look liverpool .
the plan is to put liverpool in the top five uk shopping cities one year after work on the project began , grosvenor say they are working to schedule , opening the new paradise street bus interchange last week .
paradise project director rod holmes wants to put liverpool back in the top five retail destinations in the uk .
at the end of this regeneration , he says , people wo n't be heading out of town to do their shopping anymore .
currently , despite the presence of independent stores , such as footballers ' wives ' favourite cricket , all too often the city 's fashion addicts have to trek 40 miles to manchester for the most exclusive brand names .
retailers already signed up to the development include cornerstone department stores debenhams , who are currently without a liverpool base , and john lewis , who are moving from their basnett street home to a bigger , shinier store .
as far as keeping shoppers in the city , lovers of designer labels may feel they still need to travel to manchester or leeds , where selfridges and harvey nichols dominate the upper class end of the market .
we want to open up the docklands area rod holmes but mr holmes insisted part of the paradise project would be aimed at the well-heeled shopper .
he said the " boutique " area would be housed in a narrow arcade , designed by the architects behind the london 's royal opera house , jeremy dixon and edward jones with bdp .
one of the unique aspects of this project is grosvenor 's commitment to retaining the city 's historical victorian buildings .
rather than house the city 's shops in one undercover metropolis , the paradise project wants to keep the character of liverpool intact , with plenty of green space in the city centre .
" the development has a part-covered two-level shopping street , to shelter shoppers from the worst of the weather , " he said .
" the paved area in between will look out to the park and down to the docks .
we want to open up the docklands area and encourage people to go down to the waterfront . "
the project includes an information centre telling people about the city 's history and role as the number one european slave port in the 18th century .
part of the old dock wall has been excavated and preserved , and will form a central part of the information centre .
the project may be moving the city forward , but it 's certainly not forgetting its past .

when she arrived at the world archery championships in america in 2003 , she was ranked second nationally at the sport and was one of the competition favourites .
yet soon after the tournament began , the 23-year-old from taverham , norfolk , was no longer involved in a battle to win a medal - she was fighting for her life .
she explains : " one moment i was firing arrows really well ... then within about 20 minutes i was unconscious . "
doctors feared she only had 24 hours to live as she lay connected to a life support machine , unable to breathe by herself .
mel , who had prided herself on her physical and mental fitness , was now close to death .
and the trigger for this catastrophic turn of events ?
a bite from a tick .
doctors believe the tiny insect had infected mel with lyme disease , a potentially fatal bug which can also lead to arthritis , heart and nerve problems .
the disease is caused by a bacterium which is transmitted to humans by ticks that live on some animals .
but , with a show of determination and bravery honed in top-level competition , mel has overcome the odds - and won a gold medal in the world disabled archery championships in italy this year .
in 2003 , she had travelled to poland , france and turkey for archery championships .
but while on tour in new york that july , mel said she quickly went from firing arrows to losing consciousness .
lyme disease the disease was named after an america town where a cluster of cases occurred in 1975 ticks that live on animals such as mice and deer may carry the bacteria the disease can be transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected tick early indicators of an infection may include prolonged flu-like symptoms the infection can be treated with antibiotics mel recalls : " i suddenly got a pain in my chest and my right side , my heart started beating quickly .
" my coach pulled me out of the sun because it was really hot and that 's all i can remember until i woke up in hospital a couple of weeks later . "
mel was unconscious in hospital for about two weeks .
she awoke to find she could not do anything for herself .
" i was shocked that i was there ...
i was on a ventilator , i could n't breathe for myself and i was being tube fed .
" it was so unexpected ...
i was well beforehand .
" they -lrb- doctors -rrb- said i 'd never fire another arrow , i was really gutted because i 'd gone out there shooting really really well . "
but mel , who took up archery when she was 16 , vowed that she would find a way to fight back .
when it was time for mel to return home , she was told by doctors that she had lyme disease .
and while she won her fight to survive , the infection has exacted a terrible price .
the disease has left mel paralysed from the waist down and blind in one eye .
the disabilities come on top of an earlier arthritic condition called reflex sympathetic dystrophy , which has meant mel used a wheelchair and crutches since she was 11 .
training for beijing when mel felt well enough , she set herself a new challenge , to compete in the world disabled archery championships in 2005 .
but the terrifying memory of that fateful day in 2003 when she was taken ill at her last world championship still haunted her .
in september , she flew the flag for the british team and won a gold medal .
" it 's been a two-year battle but i think it 's made me stronger .
of course there are days when nothing seems to go right , but everyone has those do n't they ? " she said .
mel holds 10 national able-bodied records and six international paralympic world records .
she is now training for the beijing paralympics in 2008 .

lyme disease the disease was named after an america town where a cluster of cases occurred in 1975 ticks that live on animals such as mice and deer may carry the bacteria the disease can be transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected tick early indicators of an infection may include prolonged flu-like symptoms the infection can be treated with antibiotics mel recalls : " i suddenly got a pain in my chest and my right side , my heart started beating quickly .
" my coach pulled me out of the sun because it was really hot and that 's all i can remember until i woke up in hospital a couple of weeks later . "
mel was unconscious in hospital for about two weeks .
she awoke to find she could not do anything for herself .
" i was shocked that i was there ...
i was on a ventilator , i could n't breathe for myself and i was being tube fed .
" it was so unexpected ...
i was well beforehand .
" they -lrb- doctors -rrb- said i 'd never fire another arrow , i was really gutted because i 'd gone out there shooting really really well . "
mel said lyme disease has made her stronger but mel , who took up archery when she was 16 , vowed that she would find a way to fight back .
when it was time for mel to return home , she was told by doctors that she had lyme disease .
and while she won her fight to survive , the infection has exacted a terrible price .
the disease has left mel paralysed from the waist down and blind in one eye .
the disabilities come on top of an earlier arthritic condition called reflex sympathetic dystrophy , which has meant mel used a wheelchair and crutches since she was 11 .
training for beijing when mel felt well enough , she set herself a new challenge , to compete in the world disabled archery championships in 2005 .
but the terrifying memory of that fateful day in 2003 when she was taken ill at her last world championship still haunted her .
in september , she flew the flag for the british team and won a gold medal .
" it 's been a two-year battle but i think it 's made me stronger .
of course there are days when nothing seems to go right , but everyone has those do n't they ? " she said .
mel holds 10 national able-bodied records and six international paralympic world records .
she is now training for the beijing paralympics in 2008 .

when she arrived at the world archery championships in america in 2003 , she was ranked second nationally at the sport and was one of the competition favourites .
yet soon after the tournament began , the 23-year-old from taverham , norfolk , was no longer involved in a battle to win a medal - she was fighting for her life .
she explains : " one moment i was firing arrows really well ... then within about 20 minutes i was unconscious . "
doctors feared she only had 24 hours to live as she lay connected to a life support machine , unable to breathe by herself .
mel , who had prided herself on her physical and mental fitness , was now close to death .
and the trigger for this catastrophic turn of events ?
a bite from a tick .
doctors said mel would not survive the night doctors believe the tiny insect had infected mel with lyme disease , a potentially fatal bug which can also lead to arthritis , heart and nerve problems .
the disease is caused by a bacterium which is transmitted to humans by ticks that live on some animals .
but , with a show of determination and bravery honed in top-level competition , mel has overcome the odds - and won a gold medal in the world disabled archery championships in italy this year .
in 2003 , she had travelled to poland , france and turkey for archery championships .
but while on tour in new york that july , mel said she quickly went from firing arrows to losing consciousness .
lyme disease the disease was named after an america town where a cluster of cases occurred in 1975 ticks that live on animals such as mice and deer may carry the bacteria the disease can be transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected tick early indicators of an infection may include prolonged flu-like symptoms the infection can be treated with antibiotics mel recalls : " i suddenly got a pain in my chest and my right side , my heart started beating quickly .
" my coach pulled me out of the sun because it was really hot and that 's all i can remember until i woke up in hospital a couple of weeks later . "
mel was unconscious in hospital for about two weeks .
she awoke to find she could not do anything for herself .
" i was shocked that i was there ...
i was on a ventilator , i could n't breathe for myself and i was being tube fed .
" it was so unexpected ...
i was well beforehand .
" they -lrb- doctors -rrb- said i 'd never fire another arrow , i was really gutted because i 'd gone out there shooting really really well . "
mel said lyme disease has made her stronger but mel , who took up archery when she was 16 , vowed that she would find a way to fight back .
when it was time for mel to return home , she was told by doctors that she had lyme disease .
and while she won her fight to survive , the infection has exacted a terrible price .
the disease has left mel paralysed from the waist down and blind in one eye .
the disabilities come on top of an earlier arthritic condition called reflex sympathetic dystrophy , which has meant mel used a wheelchair and crutches since she was 11 .
training for beijing when mel felt well enough , she set herself a new challenge , to compete in the world disabled archery championships in 2005 .
but the terrifying memory of that fateful day in 2003 when she was taken ill at her last world championship still haunted her .
in september , she flew the flag for the british team and won a gold medal .
" it 's been a two-year battle but i think it 's made me stronger .
of course there are days when nothing seems to go right , but everyone has those do n't they ? " she said .
mel holds 10 national able-bodied records and six international paralympic world records .
she is now training for the beijing paralympics in 2008 .

senior officers say the weekend will be the real test of the new laws ' effect on behaviour , but the police federation predicted arrests would increase .
ministers say the law gives police more powers to tackle alcohol-related crime .
some 40 % of the 190,000 licensed premises varied their licences , with 1,008 able to serve alcohol all day .

" we will see the country drink more - we could probably close our a & e units at 9pm if it was n't for alcohol , " he told gmtv .

however , policymakers warned that it was too early to say for certain that prices would now start to rise .
the government has been urging the bank of japan not to change its zero-interest rate policy for fear of snuffing out an economic rebound .
it said the central bank needs to work with the government to end deflation .
steady hand the world 's second-largest economy is slowly emerging from recession and deflation that has eroded wages , corporate earnings and consumer confidence .
" before we make various policies , including the budget , based on this , we must determine whether this will continue , " said economy and banking minister kaoru yosano .
while the core inflation figure was unchanged , prices overall - including fresh foods , which are omitted from the headline calculation - fell 0.7 % in october , the ministry of internal affairs and communications said .
the bank of japan has had a policy of low interest rates for almost five years in an effort to breathe life into the economy .
however , recently it has hinted that it would move to raise rates should price growth pick up .
good six months ?
analysts said that they expect the bank to hike borrowing costs in the second quarter - which runs from april to june - of next year .
" at this rate , we could see six months of flat or positive core consumer price figures by march , " said seiji adachi , an analyst at deutsche securities .
government figures showed that japan 's economy expanded at a faster-than-expected 0.4 % in the third quarter , boosted by strong domestic demand .
that brought japan 's growth rate for the year to an annualised 1.7 % , well above forecasts which predicted a figure of 1 % .
speaking earlier this month , bank of japan governor toshihiko fukui said that " rises in prices may not accelerate , but it 's unlikely that they will fall back into negative territory once they start rising " .

dr hwang has been feted as a national hero since last year when his research team successfully cloned a human embryo , and produced stem cells that could one day provide cures for a range of disease from diabetes to alzheimer .
but he looked chastened and remorseful when he finally appeared before the press on thursday to answer allegations of questionable ethical practices in his laboratory .

he said he had not been truthful about the source of some of the eggs and had been too focussed on results .
he said he was resigning from his official posts to show his contrition - but would continue as a researcher on the stem cell project .
" the world gasped in awe when i first showed the results of my research .
i felt a national pride and tasted the confidence that we koreans could achieve things too , " he told a packed news conference .
" i was blinded by work and my drive for achievement . "
overwhelming support the admission came as a shock to koreans who have taken great pride in the pioneering work of the stem cell researchers at seoul national university .
the government has given generous financial support to the team , which aims to make south korea the hub of a promising future technology .
but snap opinion polls on internet sites show dr hwang still had overwhelming support from the public .
dozens more donors have come forward to offer their ova -lrb- eggs -rrb- so dr hwang can continue his work .
among them are kim yi-hun and her two daughters , aged 19 and 22 .
" i think that dr hwang is the brightest star of korea in the 21st century and an innovative figure who could save the human race .
his research is already well advanced and must continue whatever the cost , " said mrs kim .
she said they were happy to offer eggs cells even though it 's an extremely intrusive procedure with potentially damaging side effects .
with patriotic sentiment running so high , it has been hard for sceptics to be get their voices heard .
' pressure ' on researchers dr koo young-mo , a professor of medical ethics , was accused of disloyalty when he first tried to question dr hwang about his practices .
" koreans are normally very stingy about organ donations , there 's no tradition of it here , so i was very curious how the researchers had access to so many egg cells , " he said .
he was struck by a report last year that a junior researcher in the laboratory offered her own egg at a time when supplies were running short .
" i was concerned that a junior member of the team could come under pressure - in a hierarchical society like our own , junior researchers could not even imagine resisting the wishes of her senior , " he said .
dr hwang denied the allegation .
confidence shaken but the charge resurfaced when a key american collaborator , dr gerald schatten of pittsburgh university , abruptly resigned from the team indicating he had been deceived .
dr hwang now says two researchers did donate their eggs but they did it secretly against his wishes .
when he found out he kept it secret to protect their wish for confidentiality .
he also admitted that other eggs had been bought from women , despite earlier claims that they had all been donated by volunteers .
the government says it will continue to support the team at seoul national university .
its pioneering work on stem cells will continue - no longer hampered by a shortage of eggs from healthy young donors .
but the confidence of international scientists , who looked to dr hwang as a leader in the field , has been shaken .

" koreans are normally very stingy about organ donations , there 's no tradition of it here , so i was very curious how the researchers had access to so many egg cells , " he said .

confidence shaken but the charge resurfaced when a key american collaborator , dr gerald schatten of pittsburgh university , abruptly resigned from the team indicating he had been deceived .
dr hwang now says two researchers did donate their eggs but they did it secretly against his wishes .

he also admitted that other eggs had been bought from women , despite earlier claims that they had all been donated by volunteers .
the government says it will continue to support the team at seoul national university .
its pioneering work on stem cells will continue - no longer hampered by a shortage of eggs from healthy young donors .
but the confidence of international scientists , who looked to dr hwang as a leader in the field , has been shaken .
south korea 's ambition to be the hub for stem cell research has suffered its first setback as the scientists at seoul national university struggle to regain their credibility .

by martin small bbc money programme every year , 30,000 women are sacked or forced out of their jobs because of pregnancy and 200,000 more face discrimination , according to the equal opportunities commission .
all this is 30 years after the introduction of laws which made such practices illegal , and which were supposed to safeguard pregnant women in the workplace .
it happens to women in all kinds of jobs , from the lowest paid to the highest .
take chanine boulton , who earned £ 129,000 a year as one of canon uk 's top photocopier salespeople .
when she had her daughter layla in 2003 , everything seemed fine .
but while she was away on maternity leave , canon reorganised its sales force - without telling chanine .
her best accounts , which generated most of her income , were given to a male colleague .
she felt she had no choice but to quit .
" i had n't done anything wrong , " ms boulton says .
" they had no reason to treat me like this .
they had obviously written me off . "
not just a job at the other end of the income scale is sarah taylor , who earned £ 14,000 a year as a supervisor for cablepoint , a small engineering firm in hull .
in 2002 , she suffered a miscarriage late in her pregnancy , but then quickly became pregnant again .
first she had to endure insensitive remarks about her bereavement by her manager .
then , after she gave birth to her daughter georgia , her employers refused her request to work part time .
she resigned , feeling that she had been pushed out of a job she loved .
" it was everything i 'd worked for and everything i 'd wanted to do " ms taylor says .
" to other people it was just a factory job .
but to me it was my life . "
forced to move this kind of discrimination can affect not just women , but their whole families .
sarah holland was a software developer for a small firm in london , information initiatives , where she earned £ 29,000 a year .
but immediately after she discovered she was pregnant with her son luke , she was made redundant .
with their income down by two-thirds , she and her husband dave could no longer afford to stay in their house , and had to move .
" there was no central heating , no double glazing , no hot water system " says ms holland .
" my son was very ill because we moved in there coming up to winter , so it was extremely cold and he got chest infections .
" and having to move your child into that environment , you feel like a failure as a mother . "
legal complexities all three women took their cases to employment tribunals and were found to have suffered unfair dismissal and sex discrimination .
but few follow a similar path .
of the 30,000 women who lose their jobs each year due to pregnancy , only 1000 go to a tribunal . "
not only may getting pregnant lose you your job immediately ; leaving work to have one or more babies costs - and costs a lot " send us your comments " these are women who are pregnant or who have just had a baby .
really their first focus is not standing up in court and doing a perry mason , " says victoria von wachter , a leading employment barrister .
and even if women can afford expensive lawyers , or have the backing of a union , going to tribunal can be daunting .
" the complexities of the legal points that are now being argued are breathtaking compared with 30 years ago " says ms von wachter .
the complexities of the laws concerning maternity in the workplace may help explain some of the apparent discrimination , according to some businessmen .
steve noble , a partner in a bristol-based public relations firm , publicity matters , says that smaller companies have to cope with too much red tape .
" most small businesses spend their time trying to evade regulation rather than actually working with it , " mr noble says .
" in the end it 's tempting just to dump the lot and just muddle through . "
wasted education but when employers ignore the law and get rid of staff simply because they want to have a child , the consequences can be devastating .
ms holland believes that having been out of work for over 2 years now she has lost more than just a job .
" i think effectively my career is over , " she says .
" to have it all taken away so abruptly is hard , and you wonder ... if all the education you went through was worthwhile . "

you 're fired !
by martin small bbc money programme every year , 30,000 women are sacked or forced out of their jobs because of pregnancy and 200,000 more face discrimination , according to the equal opportunities commission .
ms boulton lost her job and her £ 129,000 salary all this is 30 years after the introduction of laws which made such practices illegal , and which were supposed to safeguard pregnant women in the workplace .
it happens to women in all kinds of jobs , from the lowest paid to the highest .
take chanine boulton , who earned £ 129,000 a year as one of canon uk 's top photocopier salespeople .
when she had her daughter layla in 2003 , everything seemed fine .
but while she was away on maternity leave , canon reorganised its sales force - without telling chanine .
her best accounts , which generated most of her income , were given to a male colleague .
she felt she had no choice but to quit .
" i had n't done anything wrong , " ms boulton says .
" they had no reason to treat me like this .
they had obviously written me off . "
not just a job at the other end of the income scale is sarah taylor , who earned £ 14,000 a year as a supervisor for cablepoint , a small engineering firm in hull .
ms holland wonders whether her education has been wasted in 2002 , she suffered a miscarriage late in her pregnancy , but then quickly became pregnant again .
first she had to endure insensitive remarks about her bereavement by her manager .
then , after she gave birth to her daughter georgia , her employers refused her request to work part time .
she resigned , feeling that she had been pushed out of a job she loved .
" it was everything i 'd worked for and everything i 'd wanted to do " ms taylor says .
" to other people it was just a factory job .
but to me it was my life . "
forced to move this kind of discrimination can affect not just women , but their whole families .
sarah holland was a software developer for a small firm in london , information initiatives , where she earned £ 29,000 a year .
but immediately after she discovered she was pregnant with her son luke , she was made redundant .
with their income down by two-thirds , she and her husband dave could no longer afford to stay in their house , and had to move .
" there was no central heating , no double glazing , no hot water system " says ms holland .
" my son was very ill because we moved in there coming up to winter , so it was extremely cold and he got chest infections .
" and having to move your child into that environment , you feel like a failure as a mother . "
legal complexities all three women took their cases to employment tribunals and were found to have suffered unfair dismissal and sex discrimination .
but few follow a similar path .
of the 30,000 women who lose their jobs each year due to pregnancy , only 1000 go to a tribunal .
not only may getting pregnant lose you your job immediately ; leaving work to have one or more babies costs - and costs a lot open university business briefs : penalised for caring send us your comments " these are women who are pregnant or who have just had a baby .
really their first focus is not standing up in court and doing a perry mason , " says victoria von wachter , a leading employment barrister .
and even if women can afford expensive lawyers , or have the backing of a union , going to tribunal can be daunting .
" the complexities of the legal points that are now being argued are breathtaking compared with 30 years ago " says ms von wachter .
the complexities of the laws concerning maternity in the workplace may help explain some of the apparent discrimination , according to some businessmen .
steve noble , a partner in a bristol-based public relations firm , publicity matters , says that smaller companies have to cope with too much red tape .
" most small businesses spend their time trying to evade regulation rather than actually working with it , " mr noble says .
" in the end it 's tempting just to dump the lot and just muddle through . "
wasted education but when employers ignore the law and get rid of staff simply because they want to have a child , the consequences can be devastating .
ms holland believes that having been out of work for over 2 years now she has lost more than just a job .
" i think effectively my career is over , " she says .
" to have it all taken away so abruptly is hard , and you wonder ... if all the education you went through was worthwhile . "

in an article for bbc scotland 's news website , the minister pledges to continue her efforts to highlight the " dreadful truth of violence against women " . "
looking back it seems as if i have always been political and even during my inner-city childhood in glasgow i was aware that we lived in an unjust world - a world where some had more than others and where some were destined to live in poverty and need .
this inequality was evident in my city and it was evident across the world .
it was as i got older that i began to understand that inequality and injustice went far beyond an inequality of income .
i realised too that in eradicating inequality we needed to look far beyond people 's individual financial circumstances .
that developing understanding came from being confronted by inequality experienced by women simply because they were women .
no matter how clever , no matter how talented , no matter how focused , women did not run the country or have control over those institutions that could drive change . "
i remember the women trapped in a violent home whose tragedy was brushed off as ' a domestic " ' edinburgh conference on abuse for me , more than anything , what captured that growing understanding of inequality , was recognising the dreadful truth of violence against women .
as a young adult , i remember the early work of women 's aid , the shock of reading for the first time erin pizzey 's ' scream quietly or the neighbours might hear ' .
there were the ' reclaim the night ' marches where we sought to challenge the prevailing view that a woman raped or attacked caused her own pain , for she had been in the wrong place or dressed the wrong way or ' asking for it ' .
international action i remember the women trapped in a violent home whose tragedy was brushed off as ' a domestic ' .
the period between 25 november , international day for the elimination of violence against women and 10 december , international human rights day , sees 16 days of international action to highlight the issue of violence against women .
we have come a long way over the years , but i hope we never forget the brutal fact of violence against women or ignore that it continues .
there is the terror of hearing a key in the lock and knowing you can not be safe even in your own home , the fear of a child who can not settle in school because of what is happening to his or her mother .
there is the recognition that across the world violence against women is used to traffic women , to prostitute them , to suppress them and to violate them in pursuit of the aims of war .
all of these should be a spur for us to act .
we know the police are better at assisting women survivors of violence , that the justice system is beginning to understand that women need to be supported and not to be re-victimised .
we also know that our schools are more able to help young people who live with domestic abuse and our government is committed to highlight the horror of violence against women , keeping the issue on the agenda here in scotland .
sixteen days is an important part of highlighting the global experience of violence against women and re-energising our determination to eradicate it .
it makes us visit afresh the horror and appalling crime of violence against women , acknowledging that violence against women is still taking place and challenging why .
every campaign of action hopes to change attitudes and true success is marked by there no longer being a need for the campaign to exist .
these 16 days of action serve as a powerful reminder that we still have far to go .
my hope is that the campaign goes from strength to strength to achieve its ultimate goal of no more violence . "
