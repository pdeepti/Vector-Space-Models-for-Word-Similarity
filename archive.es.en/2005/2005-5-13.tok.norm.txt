one german copycat got into trouble with authorities and has taken his case to the courts . it all started as a joke .
training to become a photographer in 1991 , alexander mechtold needed a passport photo for his student id .
friends had given him a goody bag that 's traditionally given to german children on their first day of school . mechtold decided to be a bit childish himself and poked out his tongue for the picture .
he liked the result so much that he 's stuck to the procedure ever since , showing a bit of flesh in all official photographs . nobody seemed to mind for years and local authorities in his hometown mühlheim an der ruhr in western germany issued him driver 's licenses , id cards and passports without a problem . defaming the authorities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : einstein 's version became famous but the last time mechtold , who now works as a cameraman and travels frequently , applied for a passport , his tongue-showing photo suddenly was n't acceptable any more .
officials had apparently contacted germany 's interior ministry to enquire about the legality of the unusual portrait and received a negative response . " unnatural facial expressions and gestures make it impossible to clearly identify someone , " a ministry spokesperson told berlin 's die tageszeitung newspaper , adding that mechtold 's tongue could be seen as a " defamation of a civil servant , " which is illegal in germany . but what about heino ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heino never takes of his sunglasses in public mechtold countered that he 's never had problems during his trips abroad .
people find his tongue funny , he said , adding that german folk music singer heino is also allowed to wear sunglasses in photos for official documents . that 's a completely different situation , ministry officials said . " the sunglasses are necessary to identify heino , " the spokesperson told the daily , adding that the man would n't be recognizable without them . mechtold 's been asked to return the offensive documents to the authorities and faces up to 500 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- in penalties per document he fails to hand over .
the 31-year-old 's appealing the decision and has taken his case to the courts in return . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hood vs. helmet german law requires bikers to wear helmets , but a few elderly women belonging to germany 's sorbian ethnic minority are refusing to comply , saying that the safety precaution interferes with their national costume .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 13.05.2005 cash-strapped clubs sell stadium rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : out with the old olympic stadium , in with the new allianz arena -lrb- back -rrb- in the us , it is common for teams to sell the rights for their stadium names .
now the craze has hit germany .
generic terms like " olympic stadium " are passé .
first and foremost , clubs are looking for cash . this saturday 's game will be the last bayern munich ever play at the olympic stadium .
in the space of 30 years , germany 's most famous soccer club has made the transition from a run-of-the-mill provincial team to a money-making , championship winning squad contesting the big prizes year in and year out .
it all happened in one of the world 's most unusual but striking sports venues .
" the olympic stadium gave the club a financial cushion , " goalkeeping legend sepp maier commented .
" the stadium rewrote the history books . "
history has been good to bayern since the stadium was built .
they will celebrate their 19th bundesliga title one last time in the stadium that looks more like a circus tent than a top-notch soccer stadium when league official 's hand over the championship trophy to them again after saturday 's match .
as of the end of may , bayern 's new home will be the allianz arena , named after the german insurance giant based in munich .
revenue generator the -lrb- re -rrb- naming of sporting venues is not just a matter of pride for the company whose name decorates the stadium or arena .
there is big money involved . there are few soccer stadiums in germany without a sponsor name .
starting in the north with hamburg 's aol arena , moving south to the volkswagen arena in wolfsburg , the bayarena for bayer leverkusen , fans will be hard pushed these days to find a stadium sporting the name of a club legend or a reference to local history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke general manager rudi assauer -lrb- right -rrb- was the man who built the stadium formerly known as the arena aufschalke .
as of july 1 , it will be called veltins arena the arena aufschalke , the ground of schalke 04 in gelsenkirchen , financed on its own the building of the high-tech stadium that opened in 2001 .
it was a project that the management , under the cigar-chomping gaze of general manager rudi assauer , were proud of .
yet grand ambitions to compete with the likes of real madrid , manchester united and ac milan have forced the team to swallow its pride and sell the name .
the brewery veltins won the auction and as of july 1 , the arena aufschalke will be called the veltins arena after 110 million euros -lrb- $ 138.9 million -rrb- changed hands .
" veltins is the ideal partner for us .
one with whom we have had a good partnership , " said assauer .
for veltins , the close relationship with schalke is natural .
" the arena is the world 's largest and most beautiful bar , " said veltins business manager michael huber .
fans have a different opinion and what do schalke fans think of the corporate deal ?
they view the matter with a bit of scepticism .
on fc schalke 04 supporterclub e.v. , a fan web site , they clearly understand the rationale behind such moves .
" the money is more or less a present that we have to accept , " one contributor wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : because it is not an official dfb or fifa sponsor , the tourism group ltu had to cover the name on the ltu arena in düsseldorf for a german friendly in february but the supporters are cynical .
reacting to comments from assauer , who also does commercials for the brewery , that veltins is a part of the soul of schalke 04 , the site 's authors make clear that this is by no means true .
" no rudi , for you and how you look at schalke 04 , veltins may be a part of the club 's soul .
for us , veltins is - as good as it tastes - certainly not a part of schalke 's soul . "
yet as much as schalke fans rue the fact that corporate sponsorship is taking a part of the team 's identity , it 's an unavoidable phenomenon that has swept the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rights to name dortmund 's westfalen stadium will be on the auctioning block in the future schalke 's rival , bvb dortmund , who also once had great thoughts of being a top european club , desperately need money .
the club is heavily in debt .
anything and everything that can bring in badly needed capital , is being sold .
just this week , dortmund 's general manager hans-jürgen watzke announced that with the right offer , bvb 's traditional westfalen stadium would be renamed .
that 's a promise that the club made to creditors , he said .
bayern munich 's shrewd management is not acting out of desperation though .
they will be receiving additional revenue from the new stadium and continue to add on to an almost unsurpassable advantage over its underfinanced competition .
so when the final whistle blows on saturday and the last fan has filed out of the olympic stadium in munich , another icon of german soccer will be lost .
in the future when people talk about germany 's olympic stadium , then they will mean the one in berlin .
one of the last without a corporate sponsor . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de life after soccer ?

these are substantial divergences in growth , these are divergences in the elements making up growth , these are divergences affecting competitiveness of the national economies of the euro zone , " added juncker , who hosted the meeting . germany on the mend , italy looking broke his comments came a day after the release of official data showing the german economy , which until recently was one of the euro zone 's weakest , now enjoying rude health while the italian economy slumped into recession . the german data showed that europe 's largest economy clocked its fastest growth for four years in the first three months of 2005 owing to robust exports . that contrasted sharply with figures released in italy , revealing that the italian economy entered a recession in the first quarter with the worst quarterly performance in six years . the data were included in an initial estimate from the eu statistics agency eurostat that the 12-state euro zone economy grew 0.5 percent in the first quarter from the last three months of 2004 , which was slightly better than expected . ups and downs across the euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the divergence in growth rates appears not to be limited only to germany and italy .
the eu figures showed belgian growth stalled and the dutch economy shrinking slightly in the first quarter while eu economics commissioner joaquin almunia said he expected " pretty positive " growth from france when it releases first-quarter statistics . the figures have left policymakers dazed and confused .
" the bottom line would have to be described as mixed feelings , " almunia told a news conference .
" some of this data gives us reason to feel optimistic , but that has to be tempered by a rather less optimistic view . " juncker said that the eu 's executive commission was going to look more closely into the divergent trends within the euro zone although he insisted that what was really needed was structural reforms . although the divergent growth trends were in part due to technical and calendar-related factors , recent studies by the european commission 's economic directorate suggest that there are deeper , structural changes causing the differing growth rates . business driving or stalling the economies one study released earlier this week said that italy 's export-oriented economy was suffering from weak growth because it had failed to build up internationally competitive , value-added industries .
" italy 's product specialisation , unlike that of countries such as germany or france , has not significantly changed over past decades in reaction to global economic developments , " the study found . meanwhile , another recent study from the commission found that germany 's export industries are becoming increasingly competitive . more painful reforms needed throughout europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysing the recent euro zone growth data , goldman sachs economist javier perez de azpillaga economist drew similar conclusions and said that painful reforms were the answer politicians needed to give . " the german export performance highlights italy 's competitive shortcomings against countries both in the euro area and outside it .
unfortunately , it seems that rising unemployment and rising social discontent may be needed to prompt political and social leaders to implement the necessary reforms , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin cuts growth forecast , slams ecb the german government scaled back its 2005 growth forecasts on friday , saying its earlier prognosis had been too optimistic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 13.05.2005 east germany 's star quality in question 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are western clubs the only ones worthy of championship stars ?
bfc dynamo berlin were once the top soccer team in east germany .
now they want to be honored appropriately for its success .
yet the club 's demands raise a few questions about fairness - both on and off the field . bfc dynamo berlin felt they had waited long enough .
the fourth-division german side had made their application for recognition in the summer of 2004 but had received no reply .
so on the easter weekend this year , they took matters into their own hands . the squad trotted onto the field in hohenschönhausen , a quarter in eastern berlin , with three stars decorating the dynamo jerseys .
the three stars symbolized the ten top division titles the club won in the 1970 's and 80 's .
while the top side in the east at the time , their success was not the only reason they were disliked .
it was rumored at the time that the championships that led to these three stars appearing had much to do with east german stasi head , erich mielke - the club 's mentor - and his blatant yet tolerated manipulation of games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich mielke 's own stars however , while the berlin side took great pleasure in sporting their stars , it was a move that sparked a greater controversy than even mielke - a firm fan of stars - could have engineered . the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- introduced the star system to honor the most successful clubs in bundesliga history - one star for three titles , two stars for five , and three stars for ten .
yet the bundesliga has only been in existence since 1963 .
and was naturally a product of west germany . dynamo berlin is a club from the former east germany and under the dfl 's rules , they do not meet the criteria for earning the stars .
the dfl has proclaimed that teams under its jurisdiction , namely in the professional first and second leagues , would only receive credit for championships won since the league ’ s start .
it also does not recognize gdr champions . the dfl decision doesn ’ t sit well with other german soccer officials . " the star system isn ’ t right , ” said german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- vice-president hans-georg moldenhauer , who is from magdeburg in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
for him , no champion , be it the title holders from before 1963 , or those from the former east german top division , should be excluded .
the dfb , however , is not directly responsible for professional soccer in germany . dynamo officials and fans have been more vocal , venting the collective spleen at the dfl and speaking of arrogance on behalf of the " wessis , ” the not-so-loving term for germans from the west by east germans . " for the people of the former gdr , this is without question a further symbol of a matter that merits discussion , namely the very real triumphant attitude -lsb- of west germany -rsb- that cuts down traditions and achievements without any consideration , " said the club 's press spokesman yiannis hd .

trotz ungeklärter sachlage läuft der bfc erstmals mit den drei sternen über dem vereinsemblem auf .
nach der derzeit noch gültigen regel werden ein stern für drei meistertitel , zwei sterne ab fünf und drei sterne ab zehn meisterschafts-gewinnen ausschließlich für die zeit der bundesliga vergeben .
der bfc dynamo gewann zwischen 1979 und 1988 zehn meistertitel der ehemaligen ddr in folge .
marco kohlmeyer wall still exists in people ’ s heads the “ know-it-alls ” from the western part of germany don ’ t have a good reputation in the east .
now and then , the debate is rekindled in the media or in politics about how after the political reunification in 1990 , the people can be reunified . prof. hans joachim teichler , director of the sports history section at the university of potsdam , thinks the “ star ” question and some of the reactions are indicative of the mental divide in germany . “ in the various collective mentalities , the wall in some people ’ s heads seems to be growing higher , ” said teichler . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the last day of the stasi fifteen years ago to the day on saturday , thousands of east german demonstrators stormed the headquarters of the communist country 's hated stasi secret police .

bfc dynamo berlin were once the top soccer team in east germany .
now they want to be honored appropriately for its success .
yet the club 's demands raise a few questions about fairness - both on and off the field . bfc dynamo berlin felt they had waited long enough .
the fourth-division german side had made their application for recognition in the summer of 2004 but had received no reply .
so on the easter weekend this year , they took matters into their own hands . the squad trotted onto the field in hohenschönhausen , a quarter in eastern berlin , with three stars decorating the dynamo jerseys .
the three stars symbolized the ten top division titles the club won in the 1970 's and 80 's .
while the top side in the east at the time , their success was not the only reason they were disliked .
it was rumored at the time that the championships that led to these three stars appearing had much to do with east german stasi head , erich mielke - the club 's mentor - and his blatant yet tolerated manipulation of games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich mielke 's own stars however , while the berlin side took great pleasure in sporting their stars , it was a move that sparked a greater controversy than even mielke - a firm fan of stars - could have engineered . the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- introduced the star system to honor the most successful clubs in bundesliga history - one star for three titles , two stars for five , and three stars for ten .
yet the bundesliga has only been in existence since 1963 .
and was naturally a product of west germany . dynamo berlin is a club from the former east germany and under the dfl 's rules , they do not meet the criteria for earning the stars .
the dfl has proclaimed that teams under its jurisdiction , namely in the professional first and second leagues , would only receive credit for championships won since the league ’ s start .
it also does not recognize gdr champions . the dfl decision doesn ’ t sit well with other german soccer officials . " the star system isn ’ t right , ” said german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- vice-president hans-georg moldenhauer , who is from magdeburg in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
for him , no champion , be it the title holders from before 1963 , or those from the former east german top division , should be excluded .
the dfb , however , is not directly responsible for professional soccer in germany . dynamo officials and fans have been more vocal , venting the collective spleen at the dfl and speaking of arrogance on behalf of the " wessis , ” the not-so-loving term for germans from the west by east germans . " for the people of the former gdr , this is without question a further symbol of a matter that merits discussion , namely the very real triumphant attitude -lsb- of west germany -rsb- that cuts down traditions and achievements without any consideration , " said the club 's press spokesman yiannis hd .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 13.05.2005 cash-strapped clubs sell stadium rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : out with the old olympic stadium , in with the new allianz arena -lrb- back -rrb- in the us , it is common for teams to sell the rights for their stadium names .
now the craze has hit germany .
generic terms like " olympic stadium " are passé .
first and foremost , clubs are looking for cash . this saturday 's game will be the last bayern munich ever play at the olympic stadium .
in the space of 30 years , germany 's most famous soccer club has made the transition from a run-of-the-mill provincial team to a money-making , championship winning squad contesting the big prizes year in and year out .
it all happened in one of the world 's most unusual but striking sports venues .
" the olympic stadium gave the club a financial cushion , " goalkeeping legend sepp maier commented .
" the stadium rewrote the history books . "
history has been good to bayern since the stadium was built .
they will celebrate their 19th bundesliga title one last time in the stadium that looks more like a circus tent than a top-notch soccer stadium when league official 's hand over the championship trophy to them again after saturday 's match .
as of the end of may , bayern 's new home will be the allianz arena , named after the german insurance giant based in munich .
revenue generator the -lrb- re -rrb- naming of sporting venues is not just a matter of pride for the company whose name decorates the stadium or arena .
there is big money involved . there are few soccer stadiums in germany without a sponsor name .
starting in the north with hamburg 's aol arena , moving south to the volkswagen arena in wolfsburg , the bayarena for bayer leverkusen , fans will be hard pushed these days to find a stadium sporting the name of a club legend or a reference to local history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke general manager rudi assauer -lrb- right -rrb- was the man who built the stadium formerly known as the arena aufschalke .
as of july 1 , it will be called veltins arena the arena aufschalke , the ground of schalke 04 in gelsenkirchen , financed on its own the building of the high-tech stadium that opened in 2001 .
it was a project that the management , under the cigar-chomping gaze of general manager rudi assauer , were proud of .
yet grand ambitions to compete with the likes of real madrid , manchester united and ac milan have forced the team to swallow its pride and sell the name .
the brewery veltins won the auction and as of july 1 , the arena aufschalke will be called the veltins arena after 110 million euros -lrb- $ 138.9 million -rrb- changed hands .
" veltins is the ideal partner for us .
one with whom we have had a good partnership , " said assauer .
for veltins , the close relationship with schalke is natural .
" the arena is the world 's largest and most beautiful bar , " said veltins business manager michael huber .
fans have a different opinion and what do schalke fans think of the corporate deal ?
they view the matter with a bit of scepticism .
on fc schalke 04 supporterclub e.v. , a fan web site , they clearly understand the rationale behind such moves .
" the money is more or less a present that we have to accept , " one contributor wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : because it is not an official dfb or fifa sponsor , the tourism group ltu had to cover the name on the ltu arena in düsseldorf for a german friendly in february but the supporters are cynical .
reacting to comments from assauer , who also does commercials for the brewery , that veltins is a part of the soul of schalke 04 , the site 's authors make clear that this is by no means true .
" no rudi , for you and how you look at schalke 04 , veltins may be a part of the club 's soul .
for us , veltins is - as good as it tastes - certainly not a part of schalke 's soul . "
yet as much as schalke fans rue the fact that corporate sponsorship is taking a part of the team 's identity , it 's an unavoidable phenomenon that has swept the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rights to name dortmund 's westfalen stadium will be on the auctioning block in the future schalke 's rival , bvb dortmund , who also once had great thoughts of being a top european club , desperately need money .
the club is heavily in debt .
anything and everything that can bring in badly needed capital , is being sold .
just this week , dortmund 's general manager hans-jürgen watzke announced that with the right offer , bvb 's traditional westfalen stadium would be renamed .
that 's a promise that the club made to creditors , he said .
bayern munich 's shrewd management is not acting out of desperation though .
they will be receiving additional revenue from the new stadium and continue to add on to an almost unsurpassable advantage over its underfinanced competition .
so when the final whistle blows on saturday and the last fan has filed out of the olympic stadium in munich , another icon of german soccer will be lost .
in the future when people talk about germany 's olympic stadium , then they will mean the one in berlin .
one of the last without a corporate sponsor . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de life after soccer ?
not in dortmund fans of the dortmund soccer club bvb borrusia are distraught .
the storied team with one of the most loyal followings in the world is on the edge of a financial collapse that threatens its existence .

19 , 2005 -rrb- munich 's soccer stadium in spotlight the president of german soccer club 1860 munich is being held on charges of accepting bribes in connection with the building of the city 's new stadium , which will host the opening match of the 2006 world cup .

getting the two to understand each other has been no easy undertaking . the sports and olympic museum in cologne , which opened in 1999 , is an example of the unwitting failure to find the proper mix .
it is true that the successes of both west and east germany are equally represented on the sports timeline .
yet in the memorabilia section , a locker room of sorts with uniforms and sporting equipment , not just from famous athletes , but also from amateurs , referees or sports officials , not one east german article appears in the 30 to 40 lockers . the idea for the museum came up in 1972 , so we of course could only collect west german items , ” explained collection director jörg weck .
he also said that being in cologne , there are naturally more connections with athletes from the west of germany .
many from the region decided to donate items upon hearing of the museum .
weck did , however , admit that the acquistion of gdr items was a matter that should be considered . politics in dynamo affair ? although dynamo berlin officials have tried to play the discrimination card against the dfl , they don ’ t find much sympathy or solidarity from soccer fans of other eastern clubs .
the memory of fixed games sits deep .
expletives for dynamo are common in web site forums of these clubs .
one 1 .
fc union berlin fan though is divided . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bfc dynamo berlin could compromise and sport the stars on this proposed new badge “ bfc doesn ’ t deserve any championship stars .
but to write off east german soccer as a whole doesn ’ t satisfy me either , ” wrote lemur . bernd heynemann , currently a member of the german parliament , was a former referee in east germany .
in his recently printed recollections as a ref , he recalled how mielke had also tried to buy him but he resisted .
asked about the dfl decision , he thinks it has gone halfway . “ player caps , like matthias sammer ’ s with east germany , were recognized by the dfb .
magdeburg ’ s uefa cup winners ' cup -lrb- in 1974 -rrb- victory also stands .
the championships from the east german top division , as well as titles before 1963 , should all be recognized , ” the parliamentarian said . the dfl views the matter pragmatically .
the star system is purely a marketing measure .
dfl spokesman tom bender told the berliner zeitung that if clubs like fifth-division victoria frankfurt / oder -lrb- six ddr titles -rrb- were granted stars , in their case two , it would be like “ inflation . ” try telling that to the disgruntled fans of bfc dynamo berlin .

one day after its official opening , berlin 's holocaust memorial has already become the focus of new criticism .
this time it is not the monument itself in the spotlight , but the behavior of its young visitors . the sprawling memorial in remembrance of the suffering of the six million european jews murdered under the nazi regime is open all day every day of the year .
and on day one , the public were making the most of such unusually liberal opening hours . berliners , germans and visitors from all over the globe came in their thousands to wander through the surging field of concrete pillars and form their own impressions of architect peter eisenman 's highly-publicized creation . the 2711 concrete pillars , which vary in size and shape are set about a meter apart on an undulating ground , which is designed to recall the disorientation of the holocaust victims .
unsurprisingly the reactions of the first flurry of visitors have been hugely diverse . bad behavior ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unidentified couple jump over charcoal-colored concrete slabs of the holocaust memorial in berlin on thursday , may 12 , 2005 , the first day the memorial was open to the public .
among the first day 's intake were school groups from across the country who seemed , in part at least , to relate better to the monument as a kind of maze-like playground than as a testimony to the darkest chapter in germany 's history . one woman from the state of brandenburg was appalled to observe youngsters climbing on the pillars and making a game of jumping from one to another . " i ca n't understand why these young people ca n't behave in a more respectable manner , and moreover why none of their teachers intervene .
such misplaced instincts are unbelievable , " she told berlin 's bz newspaper . quiet rules and regulations although the prescribed code of conduct requests that visitors do not climb or jump on the pillars , that they do not smoke , barbecue or sunbathe at the site , the place is largely devoid of official eyes , which means individuals are left to behave in accordance with the limits of their own consciences . peter eisenman said he wanted visitors to the memorial to behave freely , and has said he can imagine it as a place where children play between the pillars or picnic on the fringes .
he has made it clear that he wants it to be a part of every day life rather than a holy place . but some visitors feel that the " playground factor " distracts them from respectful reverie provoked by the evocative atmosphere of the place . living monument chairman of the jewish community in berlin , albert meyer , said he had long feared that the memorial did not come from the heart of the public and that one must now recognize that it is a living monument , with all the advantages and disadvantages it brings with it . just what they are will become more obvious with time .
at the moment , the monument has to be worked into the fabric of the city , and people have to find their way through the pillars to form their own opinions . if there is any general sentiment it is that the memorial is a good thing .
there is high praise also for the underground information center which documents the fates of europe 's murdered jews . latest row settled lea rosh , the chairwoman of the memorial 's foundation , meanwhile backtracked on a plan to bury a tooth she found at belzec concentration camp in one of the pillars . jewish groups were outraged when rosh announced her intentions during the opening ceremony on tuesday , saying that they it was blasphemous to bury human remains outside cemetaries . on friday , rosh said she would return the tooth to the former death camp in poland , where it will be buried . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fresh row erupts over holocaust memorial the holocaust memorial in berlin officially opens to the public on thursday , but the occasion is being overshadowed by a dispute over plans to set the tooth of a murdered jew into one of the site 's 2711 stone pillars .

one day after its official opening , berlin 's holocaust memorial has already become the focus of new criticism .
this time it is not the monument itself in the spotlight , but the behavior of its young visitors . the sprawling memorial in remembrance of the suffering of the six million european jews murdered under the nazi regime is open all day every day of the year .
and on day one , the public were making the most of such unusually liberal opening hours . berliners , germans and visitors from all over the globe came in their thousands to wander through the surging field of concrete pillars and form their own impressions of architect peter eisenman 's highly-publicized creation . the 2711 concrete pillars , which vary in size and shape are set about a meter apart on an undulating ground , which is designed to recall the disorientation of the holocaust victims .
unsurprisingly the reactions of the first flurry of visitors have been hugely diverse . bad behavior ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unidentified couple jump over charcoal-colored concrete slabs of the holocaust memorial in berlin on thursday , may 12 , 2005 , the first day the memorial was open to the public .
among the first day 's intake were school groups from across the country who seemed , in part at least , to relate better to the monument as a kind of maze-like playground than as a testimony to the darkest chapter in germany 's history . one woman from the state of brandenburg was appalled to observe youngsters climbing on the pillars and making a game of jumping from one to another . " i ca n't understand why these young people ca n't behave in a more respectable manner , and moreover why none of their teachers intervene .
such misplaced instincts are unbelievable , " she told berlin 's bz newspaper . quiet rules and regulations although the prescribed code of conduct requests that visitors do not climb or jump on the pillars , that they do not smoke , barbecue or sunbathe at the site , the place is largely devoid of official eyes , which means individuals are left to behave in accordance with the limits of their own consciences . peter eisenman said he wanted visitors to the memorial to behave freely , and has said he can imagine it as a place where children play between the pillars or picnic on the fringes .
he has made it clear that he wants it to be a part of every day life rather than a holy place . but some visitors feel that the " playground factor " distracts them from respectful reverie provoked by the evocative atmosphere of the place . living monument chairman of the jewish community in berlin , albert meyer , said he had long feared that the memorial did not come from the heart of the public and that one must now recognize that it is a living monument , with all the advantages and disadvantages it brings with it . just what they are will become more obvious with time .

one day after its official opening , berlin 's holocaust memorial has already become the focus of new criticism .
this time it is not the monument itself in the spotlight , but the behavior of its young visitors . the sprawling memorial in remembrance of the suffering of the six million european jews murdered under the nazi regime is open all day every day of the year .
and on day one , the public were making the most of such unusually liberal opening hours . berliners , germans and visitors from all over the globe came in their thousands to wander through the surging field of concrete pillars and form their own impressions of architect peter eisenman 's highly-publicized creation . the 2711 concrete pillars , which vary in size and shape are set about a meter apart on an undulating ground , which is designed to recall the disorientation of the holocaust victims .
unsurprisingly the reactions of the first flurry of visitors have been hugely diverse . bad behavior ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unidentified couple jump over charcoal-colored concrete slabs of the holocaust memorial in berlin on thursday , may 12 , 2005 , the first day the memorial was open to the public .
among the first day 's intake were school groups from across the country who seemed , in part at least , to relate better to the monument as a kind of maze-like playground than as a testimony to the darkest chapter in germany 's history . one woman from the state of brandenburg was appalled to observe youngsters climbing on the pillars and making a game of jumping from one to another . " i ca n't understand why these young people ca n't behave in a more respectable manner , and moreover why none of their teachers intervene .
such misplaced instincts are unbelievable , " she told berlin 's bz newspaper . quiet rules and regulations although the prescribed code of conduct requests that visitors do not climb or jump on the pillars , that they do not smoke , barbecue or sunbathe at the site , the place is largely devoid of official eyes , which means individuals are left to behave in accordance with the limits of their own consciences . peter eisenman said he wanted visitors to the memorial to behave freely , and has said he can imagine it as a place where children play between the pillars or picnic on the fringes .
he has made it clear that he wants it to be a part of every day life rather than a holy place . but some visitors feel that the " playground factor " distracts them from respectful reverie provoked by the evocative atmosphere of the place . living monument chairman of the jewish community in berlin , albert meyer , said he had long feared that the memorial did not come from the heart of the public and that one must now recognize that it is a living monument , with all the advantages and disadvantages it brings with it . just what they are will become more obvious with time .
at the moment , the monument has to be worked into the fabric of the city , and people have to find their way through the pillars to form their own opinions . if there is any general sentiment it is that the memorial is a good thing .
there is high praise also for the underground information center which documents the fates of europe 's murdered jews . latest row settled lea rosh , the chairwoman of the memorial 's foundation , meanwhile backtracked on a plan to bury a tooth she found at belzec concentration camp in one of the pillars . jewish groups were outraged when rosh announced her intentions during the opening ceremony on tuesday , saying that they it was blasphemous to bury human remains outside cemetaries . on friday , rosh said she would return the tooth to the former death camp in poland , where it will be buried . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fresh row erupts over holocaust memorial the holocaust memorial in berlin officially opens to the public on thursday , but the occasion is being overshadowed by a dispute over plans to set the tooth of a murdered jew into one of the site 's 2711 stone pillars .

and on day one , the public were making the most of such unusually liberal opening hours . berliners , germans and visitors from all over the globe came in their thousands to wander through the surging field of concrete pillars and form their own impressions of architect peter eisenman 's highly-publicized creation . the 2711 concrete pillars , which vary in size and shape are set about a meter apart on an undulating ground , which is designed to recall the disorientation of the holocaust victims .
unsurprisingly the reactions of the first flurry of visitors have been hugely diverse . bad behavior ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unidentified couple jump over charcoal-colored concrete slabs of the holocaust memorial in berlin on thursday , may 12 , 2005 , the first day the memorial was open to the public .
among the first day 's intake were school groups from across the country who seemed , in part at least , to relate better to the monument as a kind of maze-like playground than as a testimony to the darkest chapter in germany 's history . one woman from the state of brandenburg was appalled to observe youngsters climbing on the pillars and making a game of jumping from one to another . " i ca n't understand why these young people ca n't behave in a more respectable manner , and moreover why none of their teachers intervene .
such misplaced instincts are unbelievable , " she told berlin 's bz newspaper . quiet rules and regulations although the prescribed code of conduct requests that visitors do not climb or jump on the pillars , that they do not smoke , barbecue or sunbathe at the site , the place is largely devoid of official eyes , which means individuals are left to behave in accordance with the limits of their own consciences . peter eisenman said he wanted visitors to the memorial to behave freely , and has said he can imagine it as a place where children play between the pillars or picnic on the fringes .
he has made it clear that he wants it to be a part of every day life rather than a holy place . but some visitors feel that the " playground factor " distracts them from respectful reverie provoked by the evocative atmosphere of the place . living monument chairman of the jewish community in berlin , albert meyer , said he had long feared that the memorial did not come from the heart of the public and that one must now recognize that it is a living monument , with all the advantages and disadvantages it brings with it . just what they are will become more obvious with time .
at the moment , the monument has to be worked into the fabric of the city , and people have to find their way through the pillars to form their own opinions . if there is any general sentiment it is that the memorial is a good thing .
there is high praise also for the underground information center which documents the fates of europe 's murdered jews . latest row settled lea rosh , the chairwoman of the memorial 's foundation , meanwhile backtracked on a plan to bury a tooth she found at belzec concentration camp in one of the pillars . jewish groups were outraged when rosh announced her intentions during the opening ceremony on tuesday , saying that they it was blasphemous to bury human remains outside cemetaries . on friday , rosh said she would return the tooth to the former death camp in poland , where it will be buried . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fresh row erupts over holocaust memorial the holocaust memorial in berlin officially opens to the public on thursday , but the occasion is being overshadowed by a dispute over plans to set the tooth of a murdered jew into one of the site 's 2711 stone pillars .

one german copycat got into trouble with authorities and has taken his case to the courts . it all started as a joke .
training to become a photographer in 1991 , alexander mechtold needed a passport photo for his student id .
friends had given him a goody bag that 's traditionally given to german children on their first day of school . mechtold decided to be a bit childish himself and poked out his tongue for the picture .
he liked the result so much that he 's stuck to the procedure ever since , showing a bit of flesh in all official photographs . nobody seemed to mind for years and local authorities in his hometown mühlheim an der ruhr in western germany issued him driver 's licenses , id cards and passports without a problem . defaming the authorities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : einstein 's version became famous but the last time mechtold , who now works as a cameraman and travels frequently , applied for a passport , his tongue-showing photo suddenly was n't acceptable any more .
officials had apparently contacted germany 's interior ministry to enquire about the legality of the unusual portrait and received a negative response . " unnatural facial expressions and gestures make it impossible to clearly identify someone , " a ministry spokesperson told berlin 's die tageszeitung newspaper , adding that mechtold 's tongue could be seen as a " defamation of a civil servant , " which is illegal in germany . but what about heino ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heino never takes of his sunglasses in public mechtold countered that he 's never had problems during his trips abroad .
people find his tongue funny , he said , adding that german folk music singer heino is also allowed to wear sunglasses in photos for official documents . that 's a completely different situation , ministry officials said . " the sunglasses are necessary to identify heino , " the spokesperson told the daily , adding that the man would n't be recognizable without them . mechtold 's been asked to return the offensive documents to the authorities and faces up to 500 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- in penalties per document he fails to hand over .

" our planes have been grounded but no reasons have been given , " cankut bagana , the president of the airline in question , onur air as reported by the anatolia news agency .
" today , our lawyers demanded an explanation from both dutch and german civil aviation authorities .
if we do not get an explanation , we will take them to court in the netherlands and germany . " on thursday , dutch authorities had informed the istanbul-based onur air that it had been grounded for a month due to " serious safety deficiencies observed in respect of aircraft , operational procedures and aircraft handling " , according to a copy of the dutch decision obtained by afp . german authorities followed suit shortly after , telling the company in a fax that all granted permissions had been " revoked with immediate effect due to severe safety concerns " .
it did not say how long the ban would be in effect . " the fact that the netherlands and germany adopted the same attitude within two hours of each other gives us the impression that this was a planned act , " bagana said .
" onur air is safe airline .
as is the case with every airline , it is under 24-hour scrutiny from turkey aviation authorities . " a chauvinistic approach , airline officials say some 40,000 passengers will be affected by the dutch and german decisions until the end of the week , he added . a company spokesman earlier raised the possibility that the bans were motivated by political and commercial interests and were aimed at snatching up onur air 's share in the market . " it is a chauvinistic approach .
we believe the bans are motivated by political and commercial interests , " rauf gerz told afp , adding that soon after the ban , a dutch airline , martinair , said it would shuttle between 1,500 and 2,000 of the onur air passengers back to the netherlands this weekend . " we have to search for some other reason than safety behind the ban .
they -lrb- dutch authorities -rrb- are trying to eliminate us from the market , " gerz said . turkish government angry the bans also angered the turkish government , which also accused dutch and german authorities of failing to give a satisfactory explanation for their action which it said was undertaken unilaterally against international practices . " in cases such as this , the most appropriate action under international practices is to seek a solution with civil aviation authorities from the country where the company is registered , " the transport ministry said in a statement .
" but despite a decision to hold a meeting between turkish and dutch aviation authorities , the measure was put into practice unilaterally without waiting for the meeting . " the ministry denied the existence of any " technical deficiencies " that would prevent onur air from flying .
" it would be out of the question for our ministry to allow the company to fly in case of such a deficiency , " it said in a statement . the foreign ministry has been called in to make diplomatic efforts to resolve the problem , it added . both countries home to numerous turks onur air , founded in 1992 and which currently employs 879 people , makes 300 weekly flights from turkey to belgium , austria , germany and spain and about 75 to the netherlands on its fleet of 28 . the netherlands and germany are both home to sizeable communities of turkish immigrant workers , and several million tourists from the two countries travel to turkey each summer for holidays . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu passenger rights anger airlines new eu regulations aimed at giving passengers a fair deal when flights are overbooked , delayed or cancelled come into effect on thursday - but the new rules are getting a turbulent reception from european airlines .

now the craze has hit germany .
generic terms like " olympic stadium " are passé .
first and foremost , clubs are looking for cash . this saturday 's game will be the last bayern munich ever play at the olympic stadium .
in the space of 30 years , germany 's most famous soccer club has made the transition from a run-of-the-mill provincial team to a money-making , championship winning squad contesting the big prizes year in and year out .
it all happened in one of the world 's most unusual but striking sports venues .
" the olympic stadium gave the club a financial cushion , " goalkeeping legend sepp maier commented .
" the stadium rewrote the history books . "
history has been good to bayern since the stadium was built .
they will celebrate their 19th bundesliga title one last time in the stadium that looks more like a circus tent than a top-notch soccer stadium when league official 's hand over the championship trophy to them again after saturday 's match .
as of the end of may , bayern 's new home will be the allianz arena , named after the german insurance giant based in munich .
revenue generator the -lrb- re -rrb- naming of sporting venues is not just a matter of pride for the company whose name decorates the stadium or arena .
there is big money involved . there are few soccer stadiums in germany without a sponsor name .
starting in the north with hamburg 's aol arena , moving south to the volkswagen arena in wolfsburg , the bayarena for bayer leverkusen , fans will be hard pushed these days to find a stadium sporting the name of a club legend or a reference to local history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke general manager rudi assauer -lrb- right -rrb- was the man who built the stadium formerly known as the arena aufschalke .
as of july 1 , it will be called veltins arena the arena aufschalke , the ground of schalke 04 in gelsenkirchen , financed on its own the building of the high-tech stadium that opened in 2001 .
it was a project that the management , under the cigar-chomping gaze of general manager rudi assauer , were proud of .
yet grand ambitions to compete with the likes of real madrid , manchester united and ac milan have forced the team to swallow its pride and sell the name .
the brewery veltins won the auction and as of july 1 , the arena aufschalke will be called the veltins arena after 110 million euros -lrb- $ 138.9 million -rrb- changed hands .
" veltins is the ideal partner for us .
one with whom we have had a good partnership , " said assauer .
for veltins , the close relationship with schalke is natural .
" the arena is the world 's largest and most beautiful bar , " said veltins business manager michael huber .
fans have a different opinion and what do schalke fans think of the corporate deal ?
they view the matter with a bit of scepticism .
on fc schalke 04 supporterclub e.v. , a fan web site , they clearly understand the rationale behind such moves .
" the money is more or less a present that we have to accept , " one contributor wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : because it is not an official dfb or fifa sponsor , the tourism group ltu had to cover the name on the ltu arena in düsseldorf for a german friendly in february but the supporters are cynical .
reacting to comments from assauer , who also does commercials for the brewery , that veltins is a part of the soul of schalke 04 , the site 's authors make clear that this is by no means true .
" no rudi , for you and how you look at schalke 04 , veltins may be a part of the club 's soul .
for us , veltins is - as good as it tastes - certainly not a part of schalke 's soul . "
yet as much as schalke fans rue the fact that corporate sponsorship is taking a part of the team 's identity , it 's an unavoidable phenomenon that has swept the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rights to name dortmund 's westfalen stadium will be on the auctioning block in the future schalke 's rival , bvb dortmund , who also once had great thoughts of being a top european club , desperately need money .
the club is heavily in debt .
anything and everything that can bring in badly needed capital , is being sold .
just this week , dortmund 's general manager hans-jürgen watzke announced that with the right offer , bvb 's traditional westfalen stadium would be renamed .
that 's a promise that the club made to creditors , he said .
bayern munich 's shrewd management is not acting out of desperation though .
they will be receiving additional revenue from the new stadium and continue to add on to an almost unsurpassable advantage over its underfinanced competition .
so when the final whistle blows on saturday and the last fan has filed out of the olympic stadium in munich , another icon of german soccer will be lost .
in the future when people talk about germany 's olympic stadium , then they will mean the one in berlin .
one of the last without a corporate sponsor . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de life after soccer ?

bfc dynamo berlin were once the top soccer team in east germany .
now they want to be honored appropriately for its success .
yet the club 's demands raise a few questions about fairness - both on and off the field . bfc dynamo berlin felt they had waited long enough .
the fourth-division german side had made their application for recognition in the summer of 2004 but had received no reply .
so on the easter weekend this year , they took matters into their own hands . the squad trotted onto the field in hohenschönhausen , a quarter in eastern berlin , with three stars decorating the dynamo jerseys .
the three stars symbolized the ten top division titles the club won in the 1970 's and 80 's .
while the top side in the east at the time , their success was not the only reason they were disliked .
it was rumored at the time that the championships that led to these three stars appearing had much to do with east german stasi head , erich mielke - the club 's mentor - and his blatant yet tolerated manipulation of games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich mielke 's own stars however , while the berlin side took great pleasure in sporting their stars , it was a move that sparked a greater controversy than even mielke - a firm fan of stars - could have engineered . the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- introduced the star system to honor the most successful clubs in bundesliga history - one star for three titles , two stars for five , and three stars for ten .
yet the bundesliga has only been in existence since 1963 .
and was naturally a product of west germany . dynamo berlin is a club from the former east germany and under the dfl 's rules , they do not meet the criteria for earning the stars .
the dfl has proclaimed that teams under its jurisdiction , namely in the professional first and second leagues , would only receive credit for championships won since the league ’ s start .
it also does not recognize gdr champions . the dfl decision doesn ’ t sit well with other german soccer officials . " the star system isn ’ t right , ” said german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- vice-president hans-georg moldenhauer , who is from magdeburg in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
for him , no champion , be it the title holders from before 1963 , or those from the former east german top division , should be excluded .
the dfb , however , is not directly responsible for professional soccer in germany . dynamo officials and fans have been more vocal , venting the collective spleen at the dfl and speaking of arrogance on behalf of the " wessis , ” the not-so-loving term for germans from the west by east germans . " for the people of the former gdr , this is without question a further symbol of a matter that merits discussion , namely the very real triumphant attitude -lsb- of west germany -rsb- that cuts down traditions and achievements without any consideration , " said the club 's press spokesman yiannis hd .

bfc dynamo berlin were once the top soccer team in east germany .
now they want to be honored appropriately for its success .
yet the club 's demands raise a few questions about fairness - both on and off the field . bfc dynamo berlin felt they had waited long enough .
the fourth-division german side had made their application for recognition in the summer of 2004 but had received no reply .
so on the easter weekend this year , they took matters into their own hands . the squad trotted onto the field in hohenschönhausen , a quarter in eastern berlin , with three stars decorating the dynamo jerseys .
the three stars symbolized the ten top division titles the club won in the 1970 's and 80 's .
while the top side in the east at the time , their success was not the only reason they were disliked .
it was rumored at the time that the championships that led to these three stars appearing had much to do with east german stasi head , erich mielke - the club 's mentor - and his blatant yet tolerated manipulation of games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich mielke 's own stars however , while the berlin side took great pleasure in sporting their stars , it was a move that sparked a greater controversy than even mielke - a firm fan of stars - could have engineered . the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- introduced the star system to honor the most successful clubs in bundesliga history - one star for three titles , two stars for five , and three stars for ten .
yet the bundesliga has only been in existence since 1963 .
and was naturally a product of west germany . dynamo berlin is a club from the former east germany and under the dfl 's rules , they do not meet the criteria for earning the stars .
the dfl has proclaimed that teams under its jurisdiction , namely in the professional first and second leagues , would only receive credit for championships won since the league ’ s start .
it also does not recognize gdr champions . the dfl decision doesn ’ t sit well with other german soccer officials . " the star system isn ’ t right , ” said german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- vice-president hans-georg moldenhauer , who is from magdeburg in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
for him , no champion , be it the title holders from before 1963 , or those from the former east german top division , should be excluded .
the dfb , however , is not directly responsible for professional soccer in germany . dynamo officials and fans have been more vocal , venting the collective spleen at the dfl and speaking of arrogance on behalf of the " wessis , ” the not-so-loving term for germans from the west by east germans . " for the people of the former gdr , this is without question a further symbol of a matter that merits discussion , namely the very real triumphant attitude -lsb- of west germany -rsb- that cuts down traditions and achievements without any consideration , " said the club 's press spokesman yiannis hd .

in the space of 30 years , germany 's most famous soccer club has made the transition from a run-of-the-mill provincial team to a money-making , championship winning squad contesting the big prizes year in and year out .
it all happened in one of the world 's most unusual but striking sports venues .
" the olympic stadium gave the club a financial cushion , " goalkeeping legend sepp maier commented .
" the stadium rewrote the history books . "
history has been good to bayern since the stadium was built .
they will celebrate their 19th bundesliga title one last time in the stadium that looks more like a circus tent than a top-notch soccer stadium when league official 's hand over the championship trophy to them again after saturday 's match .

revenue generator the -lrb- re -rrb- naming of sporting venues is not just a matter of pride for the company whose name decorates the stadium or arena .

one german copycat got into trouble with authorities and has taken his case to the courts . it all started as a joke .
training to become a photographer in 1991 , alexander mechtold needed a passport photo for his student id .
friends had given him a goody bag that 's traditionally given to german children on their first day of school . mechtold decided to be a bit childish himself and poked out his tongue for the picture .
he liked the result so much that he 's stuck to the procedure ever since , showing a bit of flesh in all official photographs . nobody seemed to mind for years and local authorities in his hometown mühlheim an der ruhr in western germany issued him driver 's licenses , id cards and passports without a problem . defaming the authorities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : einstein 's version became famous but the last time mechtold , who now works as a cameraman and travels frequently , applied for a passport , his tongue-showing photo suddenly was n't acceptable any more .
officials had apparently contacted germany 's interior ministry to enquire about the legality of the unusual portrait and received a negative response . " unnatural facial expressions and gestures make it impossible to clearly identify someone , " a ministry spokesperson told berlin 's die tageszeitung newspaper , adding that mechtold 's tongue could be seen as a " defamation of a civil servant , " which is illegal in germany . but what about heino ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heino never takes of his sunglasses in public mechtold countered that he 's never had problems during his trips abroad .
people find his tongue funny , he said , adding that german folk music singer heino is also allowed to wear sunglasses in photos for official documents . that 's a completely different situation , ministry officials said . " the sunglasses are necessary to identify heino , " the spokesperson told the daily , adding that the man would n't be recognizable without them . mechtold 's been asked to return the offensive documents to the authorities and faces up to 500 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- in penalties per document he fails to hand over .
the 31-year-old 's appealing the decision and has taken his case to the courts in return . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hood vs. helmet german law requires bikers to wear helmets , but a few elderly women belonging to germany 's sorbian ethnic minority are refusing to comply , saying that the safety precaution interferes with their national costume .

german civil servants are often labelled as more concerned with making check marks in boxes than actually doing work .
it ’ s easy to see why after one city employee was fined € 300 for trying to cut through the red tape .

" our planes have been grounded but no reasons have been given , " cankut bagana , the president of the airline in question , onur air as reported by the anatolia news agency .
" today , our lawyers demanded an explanation from both dutch and german civil aviation authorities .
if we do not get an explanation , we will take them to court in the netherlands and germany . " on thursday , dutch authorities had informed the istanbul-based onur air that it had been grounded for a month due to " serious safety deficiencies observed in respect of aircraft , operational procedures and aircraft handling " , according to a copy of the dutch decision obtained by afp . german authorities followed suit shortly after , telling the company in a fax that all granted permissions had been " revoked with immediate effect due to severe safety concerns " .
it did not say how long the ban would be in effect . " the fact that the netherlands and germany adopted the same attitude within two hours of each other gives us the impression that this was a planned act , " bagana said .
" onur air is safe airline .
as is the case with every airline , it is under 24-hour scrutiny from turkey aviation authorities . " a chauvinistic approach , airline officials say some 40,000 passengers will be affected by the dutch and german decisions until the end of the week , he added . a company spokesman earlier raised the possibility that the bans were motivated by political and commercial interests and were aimed at snatching up onur air 's share in the market . " it is a chauvinistic approach .
we believe the bans are motivated by political and commercial interests , " rauf gerz told afp , adding that soon after the ban , a dutch airline , martinair , said it would shuttle between 1,500 and 2,000 of the onur air passengers back to the netherlands this weekend . " we have to search for some other reason than safety behind the ban .
they -lrb- dutch authorities -rrb- are trying to eliminate us from the market , " gerz said . turkish government angry the bans also angered the turkish government , which also accused dutch and german authorities of failing to give a satisfactory explanation for their action which it said was undertaken unilaterally against international practices . " in cases such as this , the most appropriate action under international practices is to seek a solution with civil aviation authorities from the country where the company is registered , " the transport ministry said in a statement .
" but despite a decision to hold a meeting between turkish and dutch aviation authorities , the measure was put into practice unilaterally without waiting for the meeting . " the ministry denied the existence of any " technical deficiencies " that would prevent onur air from flying .
" it would be out of the question for our ministry to allow the company to fly in case of such a deficiency , " it said in a statement . the foreign ministry has been called in to make diplomatic efforts to resolve the problem , it added . both countries home to numerous turks onur air , founded in 1992 and which currently employs 879 people , makes 300 weekly flights from turkey to belgium , austria , germany and spain and about 75 to the netherlands on its fleet of 28 . the netherlands and germany are both home to sizeable communities of turkish immigrant workers , and several million tourists from the two countries travel to turkey each summer for holidays . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu passenger rights anger airlines new eu regulations aimed at giving passengers a fair deal when flights are overbooked , delayed or cancelled come into effect on thursday - but the new rules are getting a turbulent reception from european airlines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 13.05.2005 cash-strapped clubs sell stadium rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : out with the old olympic stadium , in with the new allianz arena -lrb- back -rrb- in the us , it is common for teams to sell the rights for their stadium names .
now the craze has hit germany .
generic terms like " olympic stadium " are passé .
first and foremost , clubs are looking for cash . this saturday 's game will be the last bayern munich ever play at the olympic stadium .
in the space of 30 years , germany 's most famous soccer club has made the transition from a run-of-the-mill provincial team to a money-making , championship winning squad contesting the big prizes year in and year out .
it all happened in one of the world 's most unusual but striking sports venues .
" the olympic stadium gave the club a financial cushion , " goalkeeping legend sepp maier commented .
" the stadium rewrote the history books . "
history has been good to bayern since the stadium was built .
they will celebrate their 19th bundesliga title one last time in the stadium that looks more like a circus tent than a top-notch soccer stadium when league official 's hand over the championship trophy to them again after saturday 's match .
as of the end of may , bayern 's new home will be the allianz arena , named after the german insurance giant based in munich .
revenue generator the -lrb- re -rrb- naming of sporting venues is not just a matter of pride for the company whose name decorates the stadium or arena .
there is big money involved . there are few soccer stadiums in germany without a sponsor name .
starting in the north with hamburg 's aol arena , moving south to the volkswagen arena in wolfsburg , the bayarena for bayer leverkusen , fans will be hard pushed these days to find a stadium sporting the name of a club legend or a reference to local history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke general manager rudi assauer -lrb- right -rrb- was the man who built the stadium formerly known as the arena aufschalke .
as of july 1 , it will be called veltins arena the arena aufschalke , the ground of schalke 04 in gelsenkirchen , financed on its own the building of the high-tech stadium that opened in 2001 .
it was a project that the management , under the cigar-chomping gaze of general manager rudi assauer , were proud of .
yet grand ambitions to compete with the likes of real madrid , manchester united and ac milan have forced the team to swallow its pride and sell the name .
the brewery veltins won the auction and as of july 1 , the arena aufschalke will be called the veltins arena after 110 million euros -lrb- $ 138.9 million -rrb- changed hands .
" veltins is the ideal partner for us .
one with whom we have had a good partnership , " said assauer .
for veltins , the close relationship with schalke is natural .
" the arena is the world 's largest and most beautiful bar , " said veltins business manager michael huber .
fans have a different opinion and what do schalke fans think of the corporate deal ?
they view the matter with a bit of scepticism .
on fc schalke 04 supporterclub e.v. , a fan web site , they clearly understand the rationale behind such moves .
" the money is more or less a present that we have to accept , " one contributor wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : because it is not an official dfb or fifa sponsor , the tourism group ltu had to cover the name on the ltu arena in düsseldorf for a german friendly in february but the supporters are cynical .
reacting to comments from assauer , who also does commercials for the brewery , that veltins is a part of the soul of schalke 04 , the site 's authors make clear that this is by no means true .
" no rudi , for you and how you look at schalke 04 , veltins may be a part of the club 's soul .
for us , veltins is - as good as it tastes - certainly not a part of schalke 's soul . "
yet as much as schalke fans rue the fact that corporate sponsorship is taking a part of the team 's identity , it 's an unavoidable phenomenon that has swept the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rights to name dortmund 's westfalen stadium will be on the auctioning block in the future schalke 's rival , bvb dortmund , who also once had great thoughts of being a top european club , desperately need money .
the club is heavily in debt .
anything and everything that can bring in badly needed capital , is being sold .
just this week , dortmund 's general manager hans-jürgen watzke announced that with the right offer , bvb 's traditional westfalen stadium would be renamed .
that 's a promise that the club made to creditors , he said .
bayern munich 's shrewd management is not acting out of desperation though .
they will be receiving additional revenue from the new stadium and continue to add on to an almost unsurpassable advantage over its underfinanced competition .
so when the final whistle blows on saturday and the last fan has filed out of the olympic stadium in munich , another icon of german soccer will be lost .
in the future when people talk about germany 's olympic stadium , then they will mean the one in berlin .
one of the last without a corporate sponsor . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de life after soccer ?
not in dortmund fans of the dortmund soccer club bvb borrusia are distraught .
the storied team with one of the most loyal followings in the world is on the edge of a financial collapse that threatens its existence .

19 , 2005 -rrb- munich 's soccer stadium in spotlight the president of german soccer club 1860 munich is being held on charges of accepting bribes in connection with the building of the city 's new stadium , which will host the opening match of the 2006 world cup .

bfc dynamo berlin were once the top soccer team in east germany .
now they want to be honored appropriately for its success .
yet the club 's demands raise a few questions about fairness - both on and off the field . bfc dynamo berlin felt they had waited long enough .
the fourth-division german side had made their application for recognition in the summer of 2004 but had received no reply .
so on the easter weekend this year , they took matters into their own hands . the squad trotted onto the field in hohenschönhausen , a quarter in eastern berlin , with three stars decorating the dynamo jerseys .
the three stars symbolized the ten top division titles the club won in the 1970 's and 80 's .
while the top side in the east at the time , their success was not the only reason they were disliked .
it was rumored at the time that the championships that led to these three stars appearing had much to do with east german stasi head , erich mielke - the club 's mentor - and his blatant yet tolerated manipulation of games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich mielke 's own stars however , while the berlin side took great pleasure in sporting their stars , it was a move that sparked a greater controversy than even mielke - a firm fan of stars - could have engineered . the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- introduced the star system to honor the most successful clubs in bundesliga history - one star for three titles , two stars for five , and three stars for ten .
yet the bundesliga has only been in existence since 1963 .
and was naturally a product of west germany . dynamo berlin is a club from the former east germany and under the dfl 's rules , they do not meet the criteria for earning the stars .
the dfl has proclaimed that teams under its jurisdiction , namely in the professional first and second leagues , would only receive credit for championships won since the league ’ s start .
it also does not recognize gdr champions . the dfl decision doesn ’ t sit well with other german soccer officials . " the star system isn ’ t right , ” said german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- vice-president hans-georg moldenhauer , who is from magdeburg in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
for him , no champion , be it the title holders from before 1963 , or those from the former east german top division , should be excluded .
the dfb , however , is not directly responsible for professional soccer in germany . dynamo officials and fans have been more vocal , venting the collective spleen at the dfl and speaking of arrogance on behalf of the " wessis , ” the not-so-loving term for germans from the west by east germans . " for the people of the former gdr , this is without question a further symbol of a matter that merits discussion , namely the very real triumphant attitude -lsb- of west germany -rsb- that cuts down traditions and achievements without any consideration , " said the club 's press spokesman yiannis hd .

these are substantial divergences in growth , these are divergences in the elements making up growth , these are divergences affecting competitiveness of the national economies of the euro zone , " added juncker , who hosted the meeting . germany on the mend , italy looking broke his comments came a day after the release of official data showing the german economy , which until recently was one of the euro zone 's weakest , now enjoying rude health while the italian economy slumped into recession . the german data showed that europe 's largest economy clocked its fastest growth for four years in the first three months of 2005 owing to robust exports . that contrasted sharply with figures released in italy , revealing that the italian economy entered a recession in the first quarter with the worst quarterly performance in six years . the data were included in an initial estimate from the eu statistics agency eurostat that the 12-state euro zone economy grew 0.5 percent in the first quarter from the last three months of 2004 , which was slightly better than expected . ups and downs across the euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the divergence in growth rates appears not to be limited only to germany and italy .

" some of this data gives us reason to feel optimistic , but that has to be tempered by a rather less optimistic view . " juncker said that the eu 's executive commission was going to look more closely into the divergent trends within the euro zone although he insisted that what was really needed was structural reforms . although the divergent growth trends were in part due to technical and calendar-related factors , recent studies by the european commission 's economic directorate suggest that there are deeper , structural changes causing the differing growth rates . business driving or stalling the economies one study released earlier this week said that italy 's export-oriented economy was suffering from weak growth because it had failed to build up internationally competitive , value-added industries .
" italy 's product specialisation , unlike that of countries such as germany or france , has not significantly changed over past decades in reaction to global economic developments , " the study found . meanwhile , another recent study from the commission found that germany 's export industries are becoming increasingly competitive . more painful reforms needed throughout europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysing the recent euro zone growth data , goldman sachs economist javier perez de azpillaga economist drew similar conclusions and said that painful reforms were the answer politicians needed to give .

one german copycat got into trouble with authorities and has taken his case to the courts . it all started as a joke .
training to become a photographer in 1991 , alexander mechtold needed a passport photo for his student id .
friends had given him a goody bag that 's traditionally given to german children on their first day of school . mechtold decided to be a bit childish himself and poked out his tongue for the picture .
he liked the result so much that he 's stuck to the procedure ever since , showing a bit of flesh in all official photographs . nobody seemed to mind for years and local authorities in his hometown mühlheim an der ruhr in western germany issued him driver 's licenses , id cards and passports without a problem . defaming the authorities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : einstein 's version became famous but the last time mechtold , who now works as a cameraman and travels frequently , applied for a passport , his tongue-showing photo suddenly was n't acceptable any more .
officials had apparently contacted germany 's interior ministry to enquire about the legality of the unusual portrait and received a negative response . " unnatural facial expressions and gestures make it impossible to clearly identify someone , " a ministry spokesperson told berlin 's die tageszeitung newspaper , adding that mechtold 's tongue could be seen as a " defamation of a civil servant , " which is illegal in germany . but what about heino ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heino never takes of his sunglasses in public mechtold countered that he 's never had problems during his trips abroad .
people find his tongue funny , he said , adding that german folk music singer heino is also allowed to wear sunglasses in photos for official documents . that 's a completely different situation , ministry officials said . " the sunglasses are necessary to identify heino , " the spokesperson told the daily , adding that the man would n't be recognizable without them . mechtold 's been asked to return the offensive documents to the authorities and faces up to 500 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- in penalties per document he fails to hand over .
the 31-year-old 's appealing the decision and has taken his case to the courts in return . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hood vs. helmet german law requires bikers to wear helmets , but a few elderly women belonging to germany 's sorbian ethnic minority are refusing to comply , saying that the safety precaution interferes with their national costume .

the base cuts will be the first in the united states in 10 years . " our current arrangements , designed for the cold war , must give way to the new demands of the war against extremism and other evolving 21st century challenges , " rumsfeld said in a statement announcing the closures . while the closures will affect those communities around the united states that stand to lose jobs and revenue from the closure or shrinkage of bases in their area , the reductions will be offset by the return of 70,000 troops from germany to us bases . german exodus offsets us domestic cuts about half the us military facilities in germany are to be vacated , defense department officials have indicated although details from rumfeld 's speech referring to specifics in europe were unavailable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us soldiers carrying out security checks in front of the " conn barracks " in schweinfurt , germany .
" the army will cut by nearly half the number of installations that it operates and maintains in europe , should all of these movements come to pass , " raymond dubois , the acting undersecretary of the army , told reporters last week .
" that is a significant amount of money , quote , to be saved , end quote , and reinvested in infrastructure in the united states for those returning forces . " most of the closures in the united states were army , navy and some air force regional reserve bases and centers , reflecting the pentagon 's desire to move reserve units onto active duty bases to train more closely with the active duty military .
few large active duty bases were marked for closure . the list will go to an independent nine-member commission for review and possible changes .
when the commission finishes , president george w. bush will submit the final list to congress to approve or reject the list in its entirety . while the main focus of the recommendations was on bases in the united states , the proposed closures mark the start of an exodus from bases occupied by the us military in germany and other western european countries since world war ii . drawn-out process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the corner pub may suffer if nearby rammstein air base is vacated by the united states air force .
the four previous rounds of closures in germany proved traumatic for the communities involved although studies show that most managed to eventually replace the jobs lost through base closures , and some have found innovative uses for the old bases . the us military has 860 sites in foreign countries , including 305 in germany , 158 in japan , and 105 in south korea . global realignment the closures are linked to a global realignment of us forces that calls for replacing cold war-era bases in western europe with a network of logistics hubs , smaller bases , and lightly manned and unmanned operating locations in the world 's most unstable regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us soldiers load a bradley tank of the first infantry division in a globemaster c-17 cargo plane on their way to iraq at ramstein us airbase in germany on thursday , april 10 , 2003 .
the strategy calls for keeping combat forces at us bases but have them ready to deploy rapidly to trouble stops anywhere in the world . pentagon officials said that in deciding which bases to keep and how to use them they considered for the first time its ability to handle a surge in military activity . solely a question of military value ? " we were doing this whole round during the time that we were actively engaged , our forces were actively engaged , which gave a sense of urgency , if you will , to the definition of surge , " said michael wynne , undersecretary of defense for acquisition , technology and logistics . the prime criteria for judging whether a base should be cut was its military utility , he said .
the economic impact of a closure on the community was a secondary consideration .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 13.05.2005 cash-strapped clubs sell stadium rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : out with the old olympic stadium , in with the new allianz arena -lrb- back -rrb- in the us , it is common for teams to sell the rights for their stadium names .
now the craze has hit germany .
generic terms like " olympic stadium " are passé .
first and foremost , clubs are looking for cash . this saturday 's game will be the last bayern munich ever play at the olympic stadium .
in the space of 30 years , germany 's most famous soccer club has made the transition from a run-of-the-mill provincial team to a money-making , championship winning squad contesting the big prizes year in and year out .
it all happened in one of the world 's most unusual but striking sports venues .
" the olympic stadium gave the club a financial cushion , " goalkeeping legend sepp maier commented .
" the stadium rewrote the history books . "
history has been good to bayern since the stadium was built .
they will celebrate their 19th bundesliga title one last time in the stadium that looks more like a circus tent than a top-notch soccer stadium when league official 's hand over the championship trophy to them again after saturday 's match .
as of the end of may , bayern 's new home will be the allianz arena , named after the german insurance giant based in munich .
revenue generator the -lrb- re -rrb- naming of sporting venues is not just a matter of pride for the company whose name decorates the stadium or arena .
there is big money involved . there are few soccer stadiums in germany without a sponsor name .
starting in the north with hamburg 's aol arena , moving south to the volkswagen arena in wolfsburg , the bayarena for bayer leverkusen , fans will be hard pushed these days to find a stadium sporting the name of a club legend or a reference to local history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke general manager rudi assauer -lrb- right -rrb- was the man who built the stadium formerly known as the arena aufschalke .
as of july 1 , it will be called veltins arena the arena aufschalke , the ground of schalke 04 in gelsenkirchen , financed on its own the building of the high-tech stadium that opened in 2001 .
it was a project that the management , under the cigar-chomping gaze of general manager rudi assauer , were proud of .
yet grand ambitions to compete with the likes of real madrid , manchester united and ac milan have forced the team to swallow its pride and sell the name .
the brewery veltins won the auction and as of july 1 , the arena aufschalke will be called the veltins arena after 110 million euros -lrb- $ 138.9 million -rrb- changed hands .
" veltins is the ideal partner for us .
one with whom we have had a good partnership , " said assauer .
for veltins , the close relationship with schalke is natural .
" the arena is the world 's largest and most beautiful bar , " said veltins business manager michael huber .
fans have a different opinion and what do schalke fans think of the corporate deal ?
they view the matter with a bit of scepticism .
on fc schalke 04 supporterclub e.v. , a fan web site , they clearly understand the rationale behind such moves .
" the money is more or less a present that we have to accept , " one contributor wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : because it is not an official dfb or fifa sponsor , the tourism group ltu had to cover the name on the ltu arena in düsseldorf for a german friendly in february but the supporters are cynical .
reacting to comments from assauer , who also does commercials for the brewery , that veltins is a part of the soul of schalke 04 , the site 's authors make clear that this is by no means true .
" no rudi , for you and how you look at schalke 04 , veltins may be a part of the club 's soul .
for us , veltins is - as good as it tastes - certainly not a part of schalke 's soul . "
yet as much as schalke fans rue the fact that corporate sponsorship is taking a part of the team 's identity , it 's an unavoidable phenomenon that has swept the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rights to name dortmund 's westfalen stadium will be on the auctioning block in the future schalke 's rival , bvb dortmund , who also once had great thoughts of being a top european club , desperately need money .
the club is heavily in debt .
anything and everything that can bring in badly needed capital , is being sold .
just this week , dortmund 's general manager hans-jürgen watzke announced that with the right offer , bvb 's traditional westfalen stadium would be renamed .
that 's a promise that the club made to creditors , he said .

these are substantial divergences in growth , these are divergences in the elements making up growth , these are divergences affecting competitiveness of the national economies of the euro zone , " added juncker , who hosted the meeting . germany on the mend , italy looking broke his comments came a day after the release of official data showing the german economy , which until recently was one of the euro zone 's weakest , now enjoying rude health while the italian economy slumped into recession . the german data showed that europe 's largest economy clocked its fastest growth for four years in the first three months of 2005 owing to robust exports . that contrasted sharply with figures released in italy , revealing that the italian economy entered a recession in the first quarter with the worst quarterly performance in six years . the data were included in an initial estimate from the eu statistics agency eurostat that the 12-state euro zone economy grew 0.5 percent in the first quarter from the last three months of 2004 , which was slightly better than expected . ups and downs across the euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the divergence in growth rates appears not to be limited only to germany and italy .
the eu figures showed belgian growth stalled and the dutch economy shrinking slightly in the first quarter while eu economics commissioner joaquin almunia said he expected " pretty positive " growth from france when it releases first-quarter statistics . the figures have left policymakers dazed and confused .
" the bottom line would have to be described as mixed feelings , " almunia told a news conference .
" some of this data gives us reason to feel optimistic , but that has to be tempered by a rather less optimistic view . " juncker said that the eu 's executive commission was going to look more closely into the divergent trends within the euro zone although he insisted that what was really needed was structural reforms . although the divergent growth trends were in part due to technical and calendar-related factors , recent studies by the european commission 's economic directorate suggest that there are deeper , structural changes causing the differing growth rates . business driving or stalling the economies one study released earlier this week said that italy 's export-oriented economy was suffering from weak growth because it had failed to build up internationally competitive , value-added industries .

these are substantial divergences in growth , these are divergences in the elements making up growth , these are divergences affecting competitiveness of the national economies of the euro zone , " added juncker , who hosted the meeting . germany on the mend , italy looking broke his comments came a day after the release of official data showing the german economy , which until recently was one of the euro zone 's weakest , now enjoying rude health while the italian economy slumped into recession . the german data showed that europe 's largest economy clocked its fastest growth for four years in the first three months of 2005 owing to robust exports . that contrasted sharply with figures released in italy , revealing that the italian economy entered a recession in the first quarter with the worst quarterly performance in six years . the data were included in an initial estimate from the eu statistics agency eurostat that the 12-state euro zone economy grew 0.5 percent in the first quarter from the last three months of 2004 , which was slightly better than expected . ups and downs across the euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the divergence in growth rates appears not to be limited only to germany and italy .
the eu figures showed belgian growth stalled and the dutch economy shrinking slightly in the first quarter while eu economics commissioner joaquin almunia said he expected " pretty positive " growth from france when it releases first-quarter statistics . the figures have left policymakers dazed and confused .
" the bottom line would have to be described as mixed feelings , " almunia told a news conference .
" some of this data gives us reason to feel optimistic , but that has to be tempered by a rather less optimistic view . " juncker said that the eu 's executive commission was going to look more closely into the divergent trends within the euro zone although he insisted that what was really needed was structural reforms . although the divergent growth trends were in part due to technical and calendar-related factors , recent studies by the european commission 's economic directorate suggest that there are deeper , structural changes causing the differing growth rates . business driving or stalling the economies one study released earlier this week said that italy 's export-oriented economy was suffering from weak growth because it had failed to build up internationally competitive , value-added industries .
" italy 's product specialisation , unlike that of countries such as germany or france , has not significantly changed over past decades in reaction to global economic developments , " the study found . meanwhile , another recent study from the commission found that germany 's export industries are becoming increasingly competitive . more painful reforms needed throughout europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysing the recent euro zone growth data , goldman sachs economist javier perez de azpillaga economist drew similar conclusions and said that painful reforms were the answer politicians needed to give . " the german export performance highlights italy 's competitive shortcomings against countries both in the euro area and outside it .
unfortunately , it seems that rising unemployment and rising social discontent may be needed to prompt political and social leaders to implement the necessary reforms , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin cuts growth forecast , slams ecb the german government scaled back its 2005 growth forecasts on friday , saying its earlier prognosis had been too optimistic .

" it 's vital we do n't suffer any injuries and we have to play smart . "
after his team shocked the soccer world winning the european championship in june 2004 , in june 2005 no one will underestimate the greeks , who are ranked 12th in the world .
facing stiff competition in the preliminary rounds from brazil , mexico and japan , rehhagel , a german himself , has called on the host country 's large greek population to throw their support behind his players .
" i 'm calling on every greek in germany to come to frankfurt with their families on these two days and support their team , " rehhagel said , trying to repeat the procedure that worked for greece in portugal .
" i reckon the games in frankfurt will be just like home matches for us . "
if ticket sales are anything to go by , greeks in germany have responded .

" as far as the national team goes , rest is something relative , " brazil 's national team coach carlos alberto parreira told reporters wednesday .
" to play for brazil is not a sacrifice , a favor or an obligation .
it has to involve honor , pleasure and willingness .
if the player does not feel that way , he can ask for his hat and leave . "
parreria said he plans to win the confederations cup by bringing a full-strength squad to germany next month .
it 's a small change in course for the brazilian , who used bench players to win the copa america and also gave his starters a rest during the 2003 confederations cup in france .
argentineans can have a break bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina managed to pull ahead of germany in a friendly match in february argentinean coach jose pekerman has taken a more pragmatic approach to what his players will be doing this summer .
" it is a valuable tournament and we 'll be giving it the importance it deserves , " pekerman told fifiawordcup.com.
" obviously , we want to do as well as we can , as we do in every game , but we also have to strike a balance between this tournament and our other commitments around this time . "
this summer 's contest is a way to test the team 's ability to play together as well as a chance to test new players , pekerman added .

" we do n't exactly have strength in depth , " he told fifaworldcup.com.
" it 's vital we do n't suffer any injuries and we have to play smart . "
after his team shocked the soccer world winning the european championship in june 2004 , in june 2005 no one will underestimate the greeks , who are ranked 12th in the world .
facing stiff competition in the preliminary rounds from brazil , mexico and japan , rehhagel , a german himself , has called on the host country 's large greek population to throw their support behind his players .
" i 'm calling on every greek in germany to come to frankfurt with their families on these two days and support their team , " rehhagel said , trying to repeat the procedure that worked for greece in portugal .
" i reckon the games in frankfurt will be just like home matches for us . "

the eu figures showed belgian growth stalled and the dutch economy shrinking slightly in the first quarter while eu economics commissioner joaquin almunia said he expected " pretty positive " growth from france when it releases first-quarter statistics . the figures have left policymakers dazed and confused .
" the bottom line would have to be described as mixed feelings , " almunia told a news conference .
" some of this data gives us reason to feel optimistic , but that has to be tempered by a rather less optimistic view . " juncker said that the eu 's executive commission was going to look more closely into the divergent trends within the euro zone although he insisted that what was really needed was structural reforms . although the divergent growth trends were in part due to technical and calendar-related factors , recent studies by the european commission 's economic directorate suggest that there are deeper , structural changes causing the differing growth rates . business driving or stalling the economies one study released earlier this week said that italy 's export-oriented economy was suffering from weak growth because it had failed to build up internationally competitive , value-added industries .
" italy 's product specialisation , unlike that of countries such as germany or france , has not significantly changed over past decades in reaction to global economic developments , " the study found . meanwhile , another recent study from the commission found that germany 's export industries are becoming increasingly competitive . more painful reforms needed throughout europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysing the recent euro zone growth data , goldman sachs economist javier perez de azpillaga economist drew similar conclusions and said that painful reforms were the answer politicians needed to give .

" the cause for the beatification of john paul ii is open , " the newly-elected pontiff said during a meeting with roman clergymen at the basilica of saint john in lateran . john paul ii died april 2 aged 84 , sparking widespread calls for him to be quickly declared a saint . benedict xvi announced his decision in a letter in latin read out by cardinal jose saraiva martins , the head of the vatican 's congregation for the causes of saints . the pope 's decision allows the congregation to override normal roman catholic church rules , which decree that five years must pass after death before the question of sainthood is tackled , to permit cooler assessment of the subject 's life . " no lack of miracles " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faithful pray after the death of pope john paul ii was announced in st. peter 's square at the vatican saturday april 2 , 2005 .
pope john paul ii , the polish pontiff who led the roman catholic church for more than a quarter century and became history 's most-traveled pope , has died at 84 , the vatican announced saturday .
-lrb- ap photo / gregorio borgia -rrb- but even top prelates have pushed for a speedy process .
on wednesday , cardinal dario castrillon hoyos said john paul ii should be beatified on may 18 , what would have been his 85th birthday .
" there 's no lack of miracles , he performed many while he was still alive , " said hoyos , the vatican official in charge of the clergy worldwide .
to achieve beatification the vatican has to ascertain that a person was reponsible for a miracle before or after his death . benedict xvi , who is the only person who can decide if a person is beatified , served as john paul ii 's close aide for 25 years before being elected to succeed him on april 19 . his decision on friday will likely endear him to the legions of fans around the world who mourned the passing of john paul ii , and already view him as a saint . reaching out with diplomacy the pope reached out to the international community in other ways this week , urging countries that do not have diplomatic relations with the vatican to establish such ties . some of these countries " joined ceremonies marking the death of my predecessor and my election to the throne of peter , " he said in his first meeting with diplomats accredited by the vatican since roman catholic cardinals elected him last month . " i appreciated those gestures and today want to express my gratitude and greet the civil authorities of these countries and express my wish to see them represented at the apostolic see as soon as possible , " he added . " i am also thinking of countries with which the holy see does not have diplomatic relations yet , " he said . important communities benedict did not name any countries but vatican experts said he was referring to china and vietnam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi greets the crowd from the central balcony of st. peter 's basilica at the vatican both countries sent messages to the vatican after john paul ii 's death on april 2 although they did not send envoys to his funeral , unlike saudi arabia . benedict , 78 , said he " particularly appreciated messages from these countries , notably those with large catholic communities . " i would like to say how much these communities and the people to whom they belong are dear to me and ensure them that they are in my prayers . " german background plays a role during his audience with the diplomatic corps benedict xvi also urged the world to " overcome the temptation of clashes among cultures , ethnicities and different worlds " . " altogether , joining our efforts , the christian communities , state leaders , diplomats and all people of good will are called upon to create a peaceful society , " the german-born pope said , speaking in french . " to achieve this , all peoples have to draw from their spiritual and cultural heritage the best values they have to go forward without fear of others , accepting to share spiritual and material well-being for the benefit of all .

" i think it is imperative that china explains in detail and quickly the types of additional measures that they intend to adopt and what consequences those will have on future trade flows , " he told the european parliament on thursday .
" i 'm looking forward to receiving such information as a matter of great urgency . " " and failing to receive such concrete information quickly would narrow the options available to the eu to resolve this issue and could leave me with no other alternative than to act under the wto , " he added . mandelson 's comments come after chinese premier wen jiabao had promised on wednesday more measures to curb rampant growth in textile exports to the eu . china makes concillatory noises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in response to european concerns about surging textile exports from china , wen said that beijing would " take further effective measures to strengthen our guidance and control on textile enterprises , to adopt economic measures to control the rapid growth of some textile products and clothing exports . " with a delegation of ranking eu diplomats on a two-day visit to beijing , eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner welcomed wen 's pledge , but added : " this is a signal but this has to be implemented ... as soon as possible .

but some eu textile producers have been urging the eu to adopt emergency procedures , which would fast-forward the process to a much more serious formal consultation period . however , mandelson said that some of the eu countries leading calls for emergency action have not sent him facts to base action on although he was they would be " forthcoming . " mandelson 's balancing act bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson is facing strong pressure from eu textile producers who are worried that thousands of jobs could be lost if urgent action is not taken to hold back a flood of chinese clothing that was unleashed by the end quota system . he is playing a difficult balancing act between trying to ease eu textile producers concerns and building up a strong trade relationship with the growing asian economic giant that will bear fruit for european businesses . " we need to see china as an opportunity as well as a potential threat , " he said , adding , " containers heading toward europe with all those goods , textiles and others , need to be then sent back to china filled with european goods and products , also a huge expanding market for european services as well .

" our planes have been grounded but no reasons have been given , " cankut bagana , the president of the airline in question , onur air as reported by the anatolia news agency .
" today , our lawyers demanded an explanation from both dutch and german civil aviation authorities .
if we do not get an explanation , we will take them to court in the netherlands and germany . " on thursday , dutch authorities had informed the istanbul-based onur air that it had been grounded for a month due to " serious safety deficiencies observed in respect of aircraft , operational procedures and aircraft handling " , according to a copy of the dutch decision obtained by afp . german authorities followed suit shortly after , telling the company in a fax that all granted permissions had been " revoked with immediate effect due to severe safety concerns " .
it did not say how long the ban would be in effect . " the fact that the netherlands and germany adopted the same attitude within two hours of each other gives us the impression that this was a planned act , " bagana said .
" onur air is safe airline .
as is the case with every airline , it is under 24-hour scrutiny from turkey aviation authorities . " a chauvinistic approach , airline officials say some 40,000 passengers will be affected by the dutch and german decisions until the end of the week , he added . a company spokesman earlier raised the possibility that the bans were motivated by political and commercial interests and were aimed at snatching up onur air 's share in the market . " it is a chauvinistic approach .
we believe the bans are motivated by political and commercial interests , " rauf gerz told afp , adding that soon after the ban , a dutch airline , martinair , said it would shuttle between 1,500 and 2,000 of the onur air passengers back to the netherlands this weekend . " we have to search for some other reason than safety behind the ban .
they -lrb- dutch authorities -rrb- are trying to eliminate us from the market , " gerz said . turkish government angry the bans also angered the turkish government , which also accused dutch and german authorities of failing to give a satisfactory explanation for their action which it said was undertaken unilaterally against international practices . " in cases such as this , the most appropriate action under international practices is to seek a solution with civil aviation authorities from the country where the company is registered , " the transport ministry said in a statement .
" but despite a decision to hold a meeting between turkish and dutch aviation authorities , the measure was put into practice unilaterally without waiting for the meeting . " the ministry denied the existence of any " technical deficiencies " that would prevent onur air from flying .
" it would be out of the question for our ministry to allow the company to fly in case of such a deficiency , " it said in a statement . the foreign ministry has been called in to make diplomatic efforts to resolve the problem , it added . both countries home to numerous turks onur air , founded in 1992 and which currently employs 879 people , makes 300 weekly flights from turkey to belgium , austria , germany and spain and about 75 to the netherlands on its fleet of 28 . the netherlands and germany are both home to sizeable communities of turkish immigrant workers , and several million tourists from the two countries travel to turkey each summer for holidays . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu passenger rights anger airlines new eu regulations aimed at giving passengers a fair deal when flights are overbooked , delayed or cancelled come into effect on thursday - but the new rules are getting a turbulent reception from european airlines .

" our planes have been grounded but no reasons have been given , " cankut bagana , the president of the airline in question , onur air as reported by the anatolia news agency .
" today , our lawyers demanded an explanation from both dutch and german civil aviation authorities .
if we do not get an explanation , we will take them to court in the netherlands and germany . " on thursday , dutch authorities had informed the istanbul-based onur air that it had been grounded for a month due to " serious safety deficiencies observed in respect of aircraft , operational procedures and aircraft handling " , according to a copy of the dutch decision obtained by afp . german authorities followed suit shortly after , telling the company in a fax that all granted permissions had been " revoked with immediate effect due to severe safety concerns " .
it did not say how long the ban would be in effect . " the fact that the netherlands and germany adopted the same attitude within two hours of each other gives us the impression that this was a planned act , " bagana said .
" onur air is safe airline .
as is the case with every airline , it is under 24-hour scrutiny from turkey aviation authorities . " a chauvinistic approach , airline officials say some 40,000 passengers will be affected by the dutch and german decisions until the end of the week , he added . a company spokesman earlier raised the possibility that the bans were motivated by political and commercial interests and were aimed at snatching up onur air 's share in the market . " it is a chauvinistic approach .
we believe the bans are motivated by political and commercial interests , " rauf gerz told afp , adding that soon after the ban , a dutch airline , martinair , said it would shuttle between 1,500 and 2,000 of the onur air passengers back to the netherlands this weekend . " we have to search for some other reason than safety behind the ban .
they -lrb- dutch authorities -rrb- are trying to eliminate us from the market , " gerz said . turkish government angry the bans also angered the turkish government , which also accused dutch and german authorities of failing to give a satisfactory explanation for their action which it said was undertaken unilaterally against international practices . " in cases such as this , the most appropriate action under international practices is to seek a solution with civil aviation authorities from the country where the company is registered , " the transport ministry said in a statement .
" but despite a decision to hold a meeting between turkish and dutch aviation authorities , the measure was put into practice unilaterally without waiting for the meeting . " the ministry denied the existence of any " technical deficiencies " that would prevent onur air from flying .
" it would be out of the question for our ministry to allow the company to fly in case of such a deficiency , " it said in a statement . the foreign ministry has been called in to make diplomatic efforts to resolve the problem , it added . both countries home to numerous turks onur air , founded in 1992 and which currently employs 879 people , makes 300 weekly flights from turkey to belgium , austria , germany and spain and about 75 to the netherlands on its fleet of 28 . the netherlands and germany are both home to sizeable communities of turkish immigrant workers , and several million tourists from the two countries travel to turkey each summer for holidays . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new eu passenger rights anger airlines new eu regulations aimed at giving passengers a fair deal when flights are overbooked , delayed or cancelled come into effect on thursday - but the new rules are getting a turbulent reception from european airlines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 13.05.2005 cash-strapped clubs sell stadium rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : out with the old olympic stadium , in with the new allianz arena -lrb- back -rrb- in the us , it is common for teams to sell the rights for their stadium names .
now the craze has hit germany .
generic terms like " olympic stadium " are passé .
first and foremost , clubs are looking for cash . this saturday 's game will be the last bayern munich ever play at the olympic stadium .
in the space of 30 years , germany 's most famous soccer club has made the transition from a run-of-the-mill provincial team to a money-making , championship winning squad contesting the big prizes year in and year out .
it all happened in one of the world 's most unusual but striking sports venues .
" the olympic stadium gave the club a financial cushion , " goalkeeping legend sepp maier commented .
" the stadium rewrote the history books . "
history has been good to bayern since the stadium was built .
they will celebrate their 19th bundesliga title one last time in the stadium that looks more like a circus tent than a top-notch soccer stadium when league official 's hand over the championship trophy to them again after saturday 's match .
as of the end of may , bayern 's new home will be the allianz arena , named after the german insurance giant based in munich .
revenue generator the -lrb- re -rrb- naming of sporting venues is not just a matter of pride for the company whose name decorates the stadium or arena .
there is big money involved . there are few soccer stadiums in germany without a sponsor name .
starting in the north with hamburg 's aol arena , moving south to the volkswagen arena in wolfsburg , the bayarena for bayer leverkusen , fans will be hard pushed these days to find a stadium sporting the name of a club legend or a reference to local history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke general manager rudi assauer -lrb- right -rrb- was the man who built the stadium formerly known as the arena aufschalke .
as of july 1 , it will be called veltins arena the arena aufschalke , the ground of schalke 04 in gelsenkirchen , financed on its own the building of the high-tech stadium that opened in 2001 .
it was a project that the management , under the cigar-chomping gaze of general manager rudi assauer , were proud of .
yet grand ambitions to compete with the likes of real madrid , manchester united and ac milan have forced the team to swallow its pride and sell the name .
the brewery veltins won the auction and as of july 1 , the arena aufschalke will be called the veltins arena after 110 million euros -lrb- $ 138.9 million -rrb- changed hands .
" veltins is the ideal partner for us .
one with whom we have had a good partnership , " said assauer .
for veltins , the close relationship with schalke is natural .
" the arena is the world 's largest and most beautiful bar , " said veltins business manager michael huber .
fans have a different opinion and what do schalke fans think of the corporate deal ?
they view the matter with a bit of scepticism .
on fc schalke 04 supporterclub e.v. , a fan web site , they clearly understand the rationale behind such moves .
" the money is more or less a present that we have to accept , " one contributor wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : because it is not an official dfb or fifa sponsor , the tourism group ltu had to cover the name on the ltu arena in düsseldorf for a german friendly in february but the supporters are cynical .
reacting to comments from assauer , who also does commercials for the brewery , that veltins is a part of the soul of schalke 04 , the site 's authors make clear that this is by no means true .
" no rudi , for you and how you look at schalke 04 , veltins may be a part of the club 's soul .
for us , veltins is - as good as it tastes - certainly not a part of schalke 's soul . "
yet as much as schalke fans rue the fact that corporate sponsorship is taking a part of the team 's identity , it 's an unavoidable phenomenon that has swept the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rights to name dortmund 's westfalen stadium will be on the auctioning block in the future schalke 's rival , bvb dortmund , who also once had great thoughts of being a top european club , desperately need money .
the club is heavily in debt .
anything and everything that can bring in badly needed capital , is being sold .
just this week , dortmund 's general manager hans-jürgen watzke announced that with the right offer , bvb 's traditional westfalen stadium would be renamed .
that 's a promise that the club made to creditors , he said .
bayern munich 's shrewd management is not acting out of desperation though .
they will be receiving additional revenue from the new stadium and continue to add on to an almost unsurpassable advantage over its underfinanced competition .
so when the final whistle blows on saturday and the last fan has filed out of the olympic stadium in munich , another icon of german soccer will be lost .
in the future when people talk about germany 's olympic stadium , then they will mean the one in berlin .
one of the last without a corporate sponsor . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de life after soccer ?

the base cuts will be the first in the united states in 10 years . " our current arrangements , designed for the cold war , must give way to the new demands of the war against extremism and other evolving 21st century challenges , " rumsfeld said in a statement announcing the closures . while the closures will affect those communities around the united states that stand to lose jobs and revenue from the closure or shrinkage of bases in their area , the reductions will be offset by the return of 70,000 troops from germany to us bases . german exodus offsets us domestic cuts about half the us military facilities in germany are to be vacated , defense department officials have indicated although details from rumfeld 's speech referring to specifics in europe were unavailable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us soldiers carrying out security checks in front of the " conn barracks " in schweinfurt , germany .
" the army will cut by nearly half the number of installations that it operates and maintains in europe , should all of these movements come to pass , " raymond dubois , the acting undersecretary of the army , told reporters last week .
" that is a significant amount of money , quote , to be saved , end quote , and reinvested in infrastructure in the united states for those returning forces . " most of the closures in the united states were army , navy and some air force regional reserve bases and centers , reflecting the pentagon 's desire to move reserve units onto active duty bases to train more closely with the active duty military .
few large active duty bases were marked for closure . the list will go to an independent nine-member commission for review and possible changes .
when the commission finishes , president george w. bush will submit the final list to congress to approve or reject the list in its entirety . while the main focus of the recommendations was on bases in the united states , the proposed closures mark the start of an exodus from bases occupied by the us military in germany and other western european countries since world war ii . drawn-out process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the corner pub may suffer if nearby rammstein air base is vacated by the united states air force .
the four previous rounds of closures in germany proved traumatic for the communities involved although studies show that most managed to eventually replace the jobs lost through base closures , and some have found innovative uses for the old bases . the us military has 860 sites in foreign countries , including 305 in germany , 158 in japan , and 105 in south korea . global realignment the closures are linked to a global realignment of us forces that calls for replacing cold war-era bases in western europe with a network of logistics hubs , smaller bases , and lightly manned and unmanned operating locations in the world 's most unstable regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us soldiers load a bradley tank of the first infantry division in a globemaster c-17 cargo plane on their way to iraq at ramstein us airbase in germany on thursday , april 10 , 2003 .
the strategy calls for keeping combat forces at us bases but have them ready to deploy rapidly to trouble stops anywhere in the world . pentagon officials said that in deciding which bases to keep and how to use them they considered for the first time its ability to handle a surge in military activity . solely a question of military value ? " we were doing this whole round during the time that we were actively engaged , our forces were actively engaged , which gave a sense of urgency , if you will , to the definition of surge , " said michael wynne , undersecretary of defense for acquisition , technology and logistics . the prime criteria for judging whether a base should be cut was its military utility , he said .
the economic impact of a closure on the community was a secondary consideration .

one day after its official opening , berlin 's holocaust memorial has already become the focus of new criticism .
this time it is not the monument itself in the spotlight , but the behavior of its young visitors . the sprawling memorial in remembrance of the suffering of the six million european jews murdered under the nazi regime is open all day every day of the year .
and on day one , the public were making the most of such unusually liberal opening hours . berliners , germans and visitors from all over the globe came in their thousands to wander through the surging field of concrete pillars and form their own impressions of architect peter eisenman 's highly-publicized creation . the 2711 concrete pillars , which vary in size and shape are set about a meter apart on an undulating ground , which is designed to recall the disorientation of the holocaust victims .
unsurprisingly the reactions of the first flurry of visitors have been hugely diverse . bad behavior ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unidentified couple jump over charcoal-colored concrete slabs of the holocaust memorial in berlin on thursday , may 12 , 2005 , the first day the memorial was open to the public .
among the first day 's intake were school groups from across the country who seemed , in part at least , to relate better to the monument as a kind of maze-like playground than as a testimony to the darkest chapter in germany 's history . one woman from the state of brandenburg was appalled to observe youngsters climbing on the pillars and making a game of jumping from one to another . " i ca n't understand why these young people ca n't behave in a more respectable manner , and moreover why none of their teachers intervene .
such misplaced instincts are unbelievable , " she told berlin 's bz newspaper . quiet rules and regulations although the prescribed code of conduct requests that visitors do not climb or jump on the pillars , that they do not smoke , barbecue or sunbathe at the site , the place is largely devoid of official eyes , which means individuals are left to behave in accordance with the limits of their own consciences . peter eisenman said he wanted visitors to the memorial to behave freely , and has said he can imagine it as a place where children play between the pillars or picnic on the fringes .
he has made it clear that he wants it to be a part of every day life rather than a holy place . but some visitors feel that the " playground factor " distracts them from respectful reverie provoked by the evocative atmosphere of the place . living monument chairman of the jewish community in berlin , albert meyer , said he had long feared that the memorial did not come from the heart of the public and that one must now recognize that it is a living monument , with all the advantages and disadvantages it brings with it . just what they are will become more obvious with time .
at the moment , the monument has to be worked into the fabric of the city , and people have to find their way through the pillars to form their own opinions . if there is any general sentiment it is that the memorial is a good thing .
there is high praise also for the underground information center which documents the fates of europe 's murdered jews . latest row settled lea rosh , the chairwoman of the memorial 's foundation , meanwhile backtracked on a plan to bury a tooth she found at belzec concentration camp in one of the pillars . jewish groups were outraged when rosh announced her intentions during the opening ceremony on tuesday , saying that they it was blasphemous to bury human remains outside cemetaries . on friday , rosh said she would return the tooth to the former death camp in poland , where it will be buried . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fresh row erupts over holocaust memorial the holocaust memorial in berlin officially opens to the public on thursday , but the occasion is being overshadowed by a dispute over plans to set the tooth of a murdered jew into one of the site 's 2711 stone pillars .

now they want to be honored appropriately for its success .
yet the club 's demands raise a few questions about fairness - both on and off the field . bfc dynamo berlin felt they had waited long enough .
the fourth-division german side had made their application for recognition in the summer of 2004 but had received no reply .
so on the easter weekend this year , they took matters into their own hands . the squad trotted onto the field in hohenschönhausen , a quarter in eastern berlin , with three stars decorating the dynamo jerseys .
the three stars symbolized the ten top division titles the club won in the 1970 's and 80 's .
while the top side in the east at the time , their success was not the only reason they were disliked .
it was rumored at the time that the championships that led to these three stars appearing had much to do with east german stasi head , erich mielke - the club 's mentor - and his blatant yet tolerated manipulation of games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich mielke 's own stars however , while the berlin side took great pleasure in sporting their stars , it was a move that sparked a greater controversy than even mielke - a firm fan of stars - could have engineered . the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- introduced the star system to honor the most successful clubs in bundesliga history - one star for three titles , two stars for five , and three stars for ten .
yet the bundesliga has only been in existence since 1963 .
and was naturally a product of west germany . dynamo berlin is a club from the former east germany and under the dfl 's rules , they do not meet the criteria for earning the stars .
the dfl has proclaimed that teams under its jurisdiction , namely in the professional first and second leagues , would only receive credit for championships won since the league ’ s start .
it also does not recognize gdr champions . the dfl decision doesn ’ t sit well with other german soccer officials . " the star system isn ’ t right , ” said german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- vice-president hans-georg moldenhauer , who is from magdeburg in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
for him , no champion , be it the title holders from before 1963 , or those from the former east german top division , should be excluded .
the dfb , however , is not directly responsible for professional soccer in germany . dynamo officials and fans have been more vocal , venting the collective spleen at the dfl and speaking of arrogance on behalf of the " wessis , ” the not-so-loving term for germans from the west by east germans . " for the people of the former gdr , this is without question a further symbol of a matter that merits discussion , namely the very real triumphant attitude -lsb- of west germany -rsb- that cuts down traditions and achievements without any consideration , " said the club 's press spokesman yiannis hd .

one day after its official opening , berlin 's holocaust memorial has already become the focus of new criticism .
this time it is not the monument itself in the spotlight , but the behavior of its young visitors . the sprawling memorial in remembrance of the suffering of the six million european jews murdered under the nazi regime is open all day every day of the year .
and on day one , the public were making the most of such unusually liberal opening hours . berliners , germans and visitors from all over the globe came in their thousands to wander through the surging field of concrete pillars and form their own impressions of architect peter eisenman 's highly-publicized creation . the 2711 concrete pillars , which vary in size and shape are set about a meter apart on an undulating ground , which is designed to recall the disorientation of the holocaust victims .
unsurprisingly the reactions of the first flurry of visitors have been hugely diverse . bad behavior ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unidentified couple jump over charcoal-colored concrete slabs of the holocaust memorial in berlin on thursday , may 12 , 2005 , the first day the memorial was open to the public .
among the first day 's intake were school groups from across the country who seemed , in part at least , to relate better to the monument as a kind of maze-like playground than as a testimony to the darkest chapter in germany 's history . one woman from the state of brandenburg was appalled to observe youngsters climbing on the pillars and making a game of jumping from one to another . " i ca n't understand why these young people ca n't behave in a more respectable manner , and moreover why none of their teachers intervene .
such misplaced instincts are unbelievable , " she told berlin 's bz newspaper . quiet rules and regulations although the prescribed code of conduct requests that visitors do not climb or jump on the pillars , that they do not smoke , barbecue or sunbathe at the site , the place is largely devoid of official eyes , which means individuals are left to behave in accordance with the limits of their own consciences . peter eisenman said he wanted visitors to the memorial to behave freely , and has said he can imagine it as a place where children play between the pillars or picnic on the fringes .
he has made it clear that he wants it to be a part of every day life rather than a holy place . but some visitors feel that the " playground factor " distracts them from respectful reverie provoked by the evocative atmosphere of the place . living monument chairman of the jewish community in berlin , albert meyer , said he had long feared that the memorial did not come from the heart of the public and that one must now recognize that it is a living monument , with all the advantages and disadvantages it brings with it . just what they are will become more obvious with time .
at the moment , the monument has to be worked into the fabric of the city , and people have to find their way through the pillars to form their own opinions . if there is any general sentiment it is that the memorial is a good thing .
there is high praise also for the underground information center which documents the fates of europe 's murdered jews . latest row settled lea rosh , the chairwoman of the memorial 's foundation , meanwhile backtracked on a plan to bury a tooth she found at belzec concentration camp in one of the pillars . jewish groups were outraged when rosh announced her intentions during the opening ceremony on tuesday , saying that they it was blasphemous to bury human remains outside cemetaries . on friday , rosh said she would return the tooth to the former death camp in poland , where it will be buried . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fresh row erupts over holocaust memorial the holocaust memorial in berlin officially opens to the public on thursday , but the occasion is being overshadowed by a dispute over plans to set the tooth of a murdered jew into one of the site 's 2711 stone pillars .

these are substantial divergences in growth , these are divergences in the elements making up growth , these are divergences affecting competitiveness of the national economies of the euro zone , " added juncker , who hosted the meeting . germany on the mend , italy looking broke his comments came a day after the release of official data showing the german economy , which until recently was one of the euro zone 's weakest , now enjoying rude health while the italian economy slumped into recession . the german data showed that europe 's largest economy clocked its fastest growth for four years in the first three months of 2005 owing to robust exports . that contrasted sharply with figures released in italy , revealing that the italian economy entered a recession in the first quarter with the worst quarterly performance in six years . the data were included in an initial estimate from the eu statistics agency eurostat that the 12-state euro zone economy grew 0.5 percent in the first quarter from the last three months of 2004 , which was slightly better than expected . ups and downs across the euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the divergence in growth rates appears not to be limited only to germany and italy .
the eu figures showed belgian growth stalled and the dutch economy shrinking slightly in the first quarter while eu economics commissioner joaquin almunia said he expected " pretty positive " growth from france when it releases first-quarter statistics . the figures have left policymakers dazed and confused .
" the bottom line would have to be described as mixed feelings , " almunia told a news conference .
" some of this data gives us reason to feel optimistic , but that has to be tempered by a rather less optimistic view . " juncker said that the eu 's executive commission was going to look more closely into the divergent trends within the euro zone although he insisted that what was really needed was structural reforms . although the divergent growth trends were in part due to technical and calendar-related factors , recent studies by the european commission 's economic directorate suggest that there are deeper , structural changes causing the differing growth rates . business driving or stalling the economies one study released earlier this week said that italy 's export-oriented economy was suffering from weak growth because it had failed to build up internationally competitive , value-added industries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 13.05.2005 teutonic tongue troubles großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : showing it off as germany celebrates einstein year , the nobel prize winner 's most famous picture is omnipresent .
one german copycat got into trouble with authorities and has taken his case to the courts . it all started as a joke .
training to become a photographer in 1991 , alexander mechtold needed a passport photo for his student id .
friends had given him a goody bag that 's traditionally given to german children on their first day of school . mechtold decided to be a bit childish himself and poked out his tongue for the picture .
he liked the result so much that he 's stuck to the procedure ever since , showing a bit of flesh in all official photographs . nobody seemed to mind for years and local authorities in his hometown mühlheim an der ruhr in western germany issued him driver 's licenses , id cards and passports without a problem . defaming the authorities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : einstein 's version became famous but the last time mechtold , who now works as a cameraman and travels frequently , applied for a passport , his tongue-showing photo suddenly was n't acceptable any more .
officials had apparently contacted germany 's interior ministry to enquire about the legality of the unusual portrait and received a negative response . " unnatural facial expressions and gestures make it impossible to clearly identify someone , " a ministry spokesperson told berlin 's die tageszeitung newspaper , adding that mechtold 's tongue could be seen as a " defamation of a civil servant , " which is illegal in germany . but what about heino ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heino never takes of his sunglasses in public mechtold countered that he 's never had problems during his trips abroad .
people find his tongue funny , he said , adding that german folk music singer heino is also allowed to wear sunglasses in photos for official documents . that 's a completely different situation , ministry officials said . " the sunglasses are necessary to identify heino , " the spokesperson told the daily , adding that the man would n't be recognizable without them . mechtold 's been asked to return the offensive documents to the authorities and faces up to 500 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- in penalties per document he fails to hand over .
the 31-year-old 's appealing the decision and has taken his case to the courts in return . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hood vs. helmet german law requires bikers to wear helmets , but a few elderly women belonging to germany 's sorbian ethnic minority are refusing to comply , saying that the safety precaution interferes with their national costume .
-lrb- aug .
10 , 2004 -rrb- no laughing matter rules are an important part of german life , but when berlin police officers fined a woman for laughing too late at night , even law-abiding judges had to giggle a little .
-lrb- april 28 , 2004 -rrb- that ’ s not in the rule book !
german civil servants are often labelled as more concerned with making check marks in boxes than actually doing work .
it ’ s easy to see why after one city employee was fined € 300 for trying to cut through the red tape .
-lrb- sept .

bfc dynamo berlin were once the top soccer team in east germany .
now they want to be honored appropriately for its success .
yet the club 's demands raise a few questions about fairness - both on and off the field . bfc dynamo berlin felt they had waited long enough .
the fourth-division german side had made their application for recognition in the summer of 2004 but had received no reply .
so on the easter weekend this year , they took matters into their own hands . the squad trotted onto the field in hohenschönhausen , a quarter in eastern berlin , with three stars decorating the dynamo jerseys .
the three stars symbolized the ten top division titles the club won in the 1970 's and 80 's .
while the top side in the east at the time , their success was not the only reason they were disliked .
it was rumored at the time that the championships that led to these three stars appearing had much to do with east german stasi head , erich mielke - the club 's mentor - and his blatant yet tolerated manipulation of games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich mielke 's own stars however , while the berlin side took great pleasure in sporting their stars , it was a move that sparked a greater controversy than even mielke - a firm fan of stars - could have engineered . the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- introduced the star system to honor the most successful clubs in bundesliga history - one star for three titles , two stars for five , and three stars for ten .
yet the bundesliga has only been in existence since 1963 .
and was naturally a product of west germany . dynamo berlin is a club from the former east germany and under the dfl 's rules , they do not meet the criteria for earning the stars .
the dfl has proclaimed that teams under its jurisdiction , namely in the professional first and second leagues , would only receive credit for championships won since the league ’ s start .
it also does not recognize gdr champions . the dfl decision doesn ’ t sit well with other german soccer officials . " the star system isn ’ t right , ” said german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- vice-president hans-georg moldenhauer , who is from magdeburg in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
for him , no champion , be it the title holders from before 1963 , or those from the former east german top division , should be excluded .
the dfb , however , is not directly responsible for professional soccer in germany . dynamo officials and fans have been more vocal , venting the collective spleen at the dfl and speaking of arrogance on behalf of the " wessis , ” the not-so-loving term for germans from the west by east germans . " for the people of the former gdr , this is without question a further symbol of a matter that merits discussion , namely the very real triumphant attitude -lsb- of west germany -rsb- that cuts down traditions and achievements without any consideration , " said the club 's press spokesman yiannis hd .

bfc dynamo berlin were once the top soccer team in east germany .
now they want to be honored appropriately for its success .
yet the club 's demands raise a few questions about fairness - both on and off the field . bfc dynamo berlin felt they had waited long enough .
the fourth-division german side had made their application for recognition in the summer of 2004 but had received no reply .
so on the easter weekend this year , they took matters into their own hands . the squad trotted onto the field in hohenschönhausen , a quarter in eastern berlin , with three stars decorating the dynamo jerseys .
the three stars symbolized the ten top division titles the club won in the 1970 's and 80 's .
while the top side in the east at the time , their success was not the only reason they were disliked .
it was rumored at the time that the championships that led to these three stars appearing had much to do with east german stasi head , erich mielke - the club 's mentor - and his blatant yet tolerated manipulation of games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich mielke 's own stars however , while the berlin side took great pleasure in sporting their stars , it was a move that sparked a greater controversy than even mielke - a firm fan of stars - could have engineered . the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- introduced the star system to honor the most successful clubs in bundesliga history - one star for three titles , two stars for five , and three stars for ten .
yet the bundesliga has only been in existence since 1963 .
and was naturally a product of west germany . dynamo berlin is a club from the former east germany and under the dfl 's rules , they do not meet the criteria for earning the stars .
the dfl has proclaimed that teams under its jurisdiction , namely in the professional first and second leagues , would only receive credit for championships won since the league ’ s start .
it also does not recognize gdr champions . the dfl decision doesn ’ t sit well with other german soccer officials . " the star system isn ’ t right , ” said german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- vice-president hans-georg moldenhauer , who is from magdeburg in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
for him , no champion , be it the title holders from before 1963 , or those from the former east german top division , should be excluded .
the dfb , however , is not directly responsible for professional soccer in germany . dynamo officials and fans have been more vocal , venting the collective spleen at the dfl and speaking of arrogance on behalf of the " wessis , ” the not-so-loving term for germans from the west by east germans . " for the people of the former gdr , this is without question a further symbol of a matter that merits discussion , namely the very real triumphant attitude -lsb- of west germany -rsb- that cuts down traditions and achievements without any consideration , " said the club 's press spokesman yiannis hd .

it was rumored at the time that the championships that led to these three stars appearing had much to do with east german stasi head , erich mielke - the club 's mentor - and his blatant yet tolerated manipulation of games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich mielke 's own stars however , while the berlin side took great pleasure in sporting their stars , it was a move that sparked a greater controversy than even mielke - a firm fan of stars - could have engineered . the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- introduced the star system to honor the most successful clubs in bundesliga history - one star for three titles , two stars for five , and three stars for ten .
yet the bundesliga has only been in existence since 1963 .
and was naturally a product of west germany . dynamo berlin is a club from the former east germany and under the dfl 's rules , they do not meet the criteria for earning the stars .
the dfl has proclaimed that teams under its jurisdiction , namely in the professional first and second leagues , would only receive credit for championships won since the league ’ s start .
it also does not recognize gdr champions . the dfl decision doesn ’ t sit well with other german soccer officials . " the star system isn ’ t right , ” said german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- vice-president hans-georg moldenhauer , who is from magdeburg in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
for him , no champion , be it the title holders from before 1963 , or those from the former east german top division , should be excluded .
the dfb , however , is not directly responsible for professional soccer in germany . dynamo officials and fans have been more vocal , venting the collective spleen at the dfl and speaking of arrogance on behalf of the " wessis , ” the not-so-loving term for germans from the west by east germans . " for the people of the former gdr , this is without question a further symbol of a matter that merits discussion , namely the very real triumphant attitude -lsb- of west germany -rsb- that cuts down traditions and achievements without any consideration , " said the club 's press spokesman yiannis hd .

now and then , the debate is rekindled in the media or in politics about how after the political reunification in 1990 , the people can be reunified . prof. hans joachim teichler , director of the sports history section at the university of potsdam , thinks the “ star ” question and some of the reactions are indicative of the mental divide in germany . “ in the various collective mentalities , the wall in some people ’ s heads seems to be growing higher , ” said teichler . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the last day of the stasi fifteen years ago to the day on saturday , thousands of east german demonstrators stormed the headquarters of the communist country 's hated stasi secret police .

" i think it is imperative that china explains in detail and quickly the types of additional measures that they intend to adopt and what consequences those will have on future trade flows , " he told the european parliament on thursday .
" i 'm looking forward to receiving such information as a matter of great urgency . " " and failing to receive such concrete information quickly would narrow the options available to the eu to resolve this issue and could leave me with no other alternative than to act under the wto , " he added . mandelson 's comments come after chinese premier wen jiabao had promised on wednesday more measures to curb rampant growth in textile exports to the eu . china makes concillatory noises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in response to european concerns about surging textile exports from china , wen said that beijing would " take further effective measures to strengthen our guidance and control on textile enterprises , to adopt economic measures to control the rapid growth of some textile products and clothing exports . " with a delegation of ranking eu diplomats on a two-day visit to beijing , eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner welcomed wen 's pledge , but added : " this is a signal but this has to be implemented ... as soon as possible . " eu commission launches investigation the eu 's executive commission launched an investigation into select textile and garment categories from china last month after compiling evidence that exports surged by as much as 534 percent after a 31-year-old global quota system had ended in january . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : normally , the investigation is supposed to last a maximum of 60 days during which informal consultations are to be held between brussels and beijing to try to find a solution .
but some eu textile producers have been urging the eu to adopt emergency procedures , which would fast-forward the process to a much more serious formal consultation period . however , mandelson said that some of the eu countries leading calls for emergency action have not sent him facts to base action on although he was they would be " forthcoming . " mandelson 's balancing act bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson is facing strong pressure from eu textile producers who are worried that thousands of jobs could be lost if urgent action is not taken to hold back a flood of chinese clothing that was unleashed by the end quota system . he is playing a difficult balancing act between trying to ease eu textile producers concerns and building up a strong trade relationship with the growing asian economic giant that will bear fruit for european businesses . " we need to see china as an opportunity as well as a potential threat , " he said , adding , " containers heading toward europe with all those goods , textiles and others , need to be then sent back to china filled with european goods and products , also a huge expanding market for european services as well .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.05.2005 germans , dutch ground turkish airline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : onur air 's fleet is stuck on the tarmac as the row takes off a diplomatic dispute between holland and germany on one side and turkey on the other began thursday after dutch and german officials grounded a turkish airline without satisfactory explanation , airline officials say . a private turkish airline grounded by dutch and german authorities for safety reasons threatened on friday to take legal action against both countries unless it is given a satisfactory explanation for the sanction . " our planes have been grounded but no reasons have been given , " cankut bagana , the president of the airline in question , onur air as reported by the anatolia news agency .
" today , our lawyers demanded an explanation from both dutch and german civil aviation authorities .
if we do not get an explanation , we will take them to court in the netherlands and germany . " on thursday , dutch authorities had informed the istanbul-based onur air that it had been grounded for a month due to " serious safety deficiencies observed in respect of aircraft , operational procedures and aircraft handling " , according to a copy of the dutch decision obtained by afp . german authorities followed suit shortly after , telling the company in a fax that all granted permissions had been " revoked with immediate effect due to severe safety concerns " .
it did not say how long the ban would be in effect . " the fact that the netherlands and germany adopted the same attitude within two hours of each other gives us the impression that this was a planned act , " bagana said .
" onur air is safe airline .
as is the case with every airline , it is under 24-hour scrutiny from turkey aviation authorities . " a chauvinistic approach , airline officials say some 40,000 passengers will be affected by the dutch and german decisions until the end of the week , he added . a company spokesman earlier raised the possibility that the bans were motivated by political and commercial interests and were aimed at snatching up onur air 's share in the market . " it is a chauvinistic approach .
we believe the bans are motivated by political and commercial interests , " rauf gerz told afp , adding that soon after the ban , a dutch airline , martinair , said it would shuttle between 1,500 and 2,000 of the onur air passengers back to the netherlands this weekend . " we have to search for some other reason than safety behind the ban .
they -lrb- dutch authorities -rrb- are trying to eliminate us from the market , " gerz said . turkish government angry the bans also angered the turkish government , which also accused dutch and german authorities of failing to give a satisfactory explanation for their action which it said was undertaken unilaterally against international practices .

" but despite a decision to hold a meeting between turkish and dutch aviation authorities , the measure was put into practice unilaterally without waiting for the meeting . " the ministry denied the existence of any " technical deficiencies " that would prevent onur air from flying .

as of the end of may , bayern 's new home will be the allianz arena , named after the german insurance giant based in munich .
revenue generator the -lrb- re -rrb- naming of sporting venues is not just a matter of pride for the company whose name decorates the stadium or arena .
there is big money involved . there are few soccer stadiums in germany without a sponsor name .
starting in the north with hamburg 's aol arena , moving south to the volkswagen arena in wolfsburg , the bayarena for bayer leverkusen , fans will be hard pushed these days to find a stadium sporting the name of a club legend or a reference to local history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke general manager rudi assauer -lrb- right -rrb- was the man who built the stadium formerly known as the arena aufschalke .
as of july 1 , it will be called veltins arena the arena aufschalke , the ground of schalke 04 in gelsenkirchen , financed on its own the building of the high-tech stadium that opened in 2001 .
it was a project that the management , under the cigar-chomping gaze of general manager rudi assauer , were proud of .
yet grand ambitions to compete with the likes of real madrid , manchester united and ac milan have forced the team to swallow its pride and sell the name .
the brewery veltins won the auction and as of july 1 , the arena aufschalke will be called the veltins arena after 110 million euros -lrb- $ 138.9 million -rrb- changed hands .
" veltins is the ideal partner for us .
one with whom we have had a good partnership , " said assauer .
for veltins , the close relationship with schalke is natural .
" the arena is the world 's largest and most beautiful bar , " said veltins business manager michael huber .
fans have a different opinion and what do schalke fans think of the corporate deal ?
they view the matter with a bit of scepticism .
on fc schalke 04 supporterclub e.v. , a fan web site , they clearly understand the rationale behind such moves .
" the money is more or less a present that we have to accept , " one contributor wrote .

" no rudi , for you and how you look at schalke 04 , veltins may be a part of the club 's soul .
for us , veltins is - as good as it tastes - certainly not a part of schalke 's soul . "
yet as much as schalke fans rue the fact that corporate sponsorship is taking a part of the team 's identity , it 's an unavoidable phenomenon that has swept the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rights to name dortmund 's westfalen stadium will be on the auctioning block in the future schalke 's rival , bvb dortmund , who also once had great thoughts of being a top european club , desperately need money .
the club is heavily in debt .
anything and everything that can bring in badly needed capital , is being sold .
just this week , dortmund 's general manager hans-jürgen watzke announced that with the right offer , bvb 's traditional westfalen stadium would be renamed .
that 's a promise that the club made to creditors , he said .
bayern munich 's shrewd management is not acting out of desperation though .
they will be receiving additional revenue from the new stadium and continue to add on to an almost unsurpassable advantage over its underfinanced competition .
so when the final whistle blows on saturday and the last fan has filed out of the olympic stadium in munich , another icon of german soccer will be lost .

now the craze has hit germany .
generic terms like " olympic stadium " are passé .
first and foremost , clubs are looking for cash . this saturday 's game will be the last bayern munich ever play at the olympic stadium .
in the space of 30 years , germany 's most famous soccer club has made the transition from a run-of-the-mill provincial team to a money-making , championship winning squad contesting the big prizes year in and year out .
it all happened in one of the world 's most unusual but striking sports venues .
" the olympic stadium gave the club a financial cushion , " goalkeeping legend sepp maier commented .
" the stadium rewrote the history books . "
history has been good to bayern since the stadium was built .

one day after its official opening , berlin 's holocaust memorial has already become the focus of new criticism .
this time it is not the monument itself in the spotlight , but the behavior of its young visitors . the sprawling memorial in remembrance of the suffering of the six million european jews murdered under the nazi regime is open all day every day of the year .
and on day one , the public were making the most of such unusually liberal opening hours . berliners , germans and visitors from all over the globe came in their thousands to wander through the surging field of concrete pillars and form their own impressions of architect peter eisenman 's highly-publicized creation . the 2711 concrete pillars , which vary in size and shape are set about a meter apart on an undulating ground , which is designed to recall the disorientation of the holocaust victims .
unsurprisingly the reactions of the first flurry of visitors have been hugely diverse . bad behavior ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unidentified couple jump over charcoal-colored concrete slabs of the holocaust memorial in berlin on thursday , may 12 , 2005 , the first day the memorial was open to the public .
among the first day 's intake were school groups from across the country who seemed , in part at least , to relate better to the monument as a kind of maze-like playground than as a testimony to the darkest chapter in germany 's history . one woman from the state of brandenburg was appalled to observe youngsters climbing on the pillars and making a game of jumping from one to another . " i ca n't understand why these young people ca n't behave in a more respectable manner , and moreover why none of their teachers intervene .
such misplaced instincts are unbelievable , " she told berlin 's bz newspaper . quiet rules and regulations although the prescribed code of conduct requests that visitors do not climb or jump on the pillars , that they do not smoke , barbecue or sunbathe at the site , the place is largely devoid of official eyes , which means individuals are left to behave in accordance with the limits of their own consciences . peter eisenman said he wanted visitors to the memorial to behave freely , and has said he can imagine it as a place where children play between the pillars or picnic on the fringes .
he has made it clear that he wants it to be a part of every day life rather than a holy place . but some visitors feel that the " playground factor " distracts them from respectful reverie provoked by the evocative atmosphere of the place . living monument chairman of the jewish community in berlin , albert meyer , said he had long feared that the memorial did not come from the heart of the public and that one must now recognize that it is a living monument , with all the advantages and disadvantages it brings with it . just what they are will become more obvious with time .
at the moment , the monument has to be worked into the fabric of the city , and people have to find their way through the pillars to form their own opinions . if there is any general sentiment it is that the memorial is a good thing .
there is high praise also for the underground information center which documents the fates of europe 's murdered jews . latest row settled lea rosh , the chairwoman of the memorial 's foundation , meanwhile backtracked on a plan to bury a tooth she found at belzec concentration camp in one of the pillars . jewish groups were outraged when rosh announced her intentions during the opening ceremony on tuesday , saying that they it was blasphemous to bury human remains outside cemetaries . on friday , rosh said she would return the tooth to the former death camp in poland , where it will be buried . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fresh row erupts over holocaust memorial the holocaust memorial in berlin officially opens to the public on thursday , but the occasion is being overshadowed by a dispute over plans to set the tooth of a murdered jew into one of the site 's 2711 stone pillars .

one day after its official opening , berlin 's holocaust memorial has already become the focus of new criticism .
this time it is not the monument itself in the spotlight , but the behavior of its young visitors . the sprawling memorial in remembrance of the suffering of the six million european jews murdered under the nazi regime is open all day every day of the year .
and on day one , the public were making the most of such unusually liberal opening hours . berliners , germans and visitors from all over the globe came in their thousands to wander through the surging field of concrete pillars and form their own impressions of architect peter eisenman 's highly-publicized creation . the 2711 concrete pillars , which vary in size and shape are set about a meter apart on an undulating ground , which is designed to recall the disorientation of the holocaust victims .
unsurprisingly the reactions of the first flurry of visitors have been hugely diverse . bad behavior ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unidentified couple jump over charcoal-colored concrete slabs of the holocaust memorial in berlin on thursday , may 12 , 2005 , the first day the memorial was open to the public .
among the first day 's intake were school groups from across the country who seemed , in part at least , to relate better to the monument as a kind of maze-like playground than as a testimony to the darkest chapter in germany 's history . one woman from the state of brandenburg was appalled to observe youngsters climbing on the pillars and making a game of jumping from one to another . " i ca n't understand why these young people ca n't behave in a more respectable manner , and moreover why none of their teachers intervene .
such misplaced instincts are unbelievable , " she told berlin 's bz newspaper . quiet rules and regulations although the prescribed code of conduct requests that visitors do not climb or jump on the pillars , that they do not smoke , barbecue or sunbathe at the site , the place is largely devoid of official eyes , which means individuals are left to behave in accordance with the limits of their own consciences . peter eisenman said he wanted visitors to the memorial to behave freely , and has said he can imagine it as a place where children play between the pillars or picnic on the fringes .
he has made it clear that he wants it to be a part of every day life rather than a holy place . but some visitors feel that the " playground factor " distracts them from respectful reverie provoked by the evocative atmosphere of the place . living monument chairman of the jewish community in berlin , albert meyer , said he had long feared that the memorial did not come from the heart of the public and that one must now recognize that it is a living monument , with all the advantages and disadvantages it brings with it . just what they are will become more obvious with time .

these are substantial divergences in growth , these are divergences in the elements making up growth , these are divergences affecting competitiveness of the national economies of the euro zone , " added juncker , who hosted the meeting . germany on the mend , italy looking broke his comments came a day after the release of official data showing the german economy , which until recently was one of the euro zone 's weakest , now enjoying rude health while the italian economy slumped into recession . the german data showed that europe 's largest economy clocked its fastest growth for four years in the first three months of 2005 owing to robust exports . that contrasted sharply with figures released in italy , revealing that the italian economy entered a recession in the first quarter with the worst quarterly performance in six years . the data were included in an initial estimate from the eu statistics agency eurostat that the 12-state euro zone economy grew 0.5 percent in the first quarter from the last three months of 2004 , which was slightly better than expected . ups and downs across the euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the divergence in growth rates appears not to be limited only to germany and italy .
the eu figures showed belgian growth stalled and the dutch economy shrinking slightly in the first quarter while eu economics commissioner joaquin almunia said he expected " pretty positive " growth from france when it releases first-quarter statistics . the figures have left policymakers dazed and confused .
" the bottom line would have to be described as mixed feelings , " almunia told a news conference .
" some of this data gives us reason to feel optimistic , but that has to be tempered by a rather less optimistic view . " juncker said that the eu 's executive commission was going to look more closely into the divergent trends within the euro zone although he insisted that what was really needed was structural reforms . although the divergent growth trends were in part due to technical and calendar-related factors , recent studies by the european commission 's economic directorate suggest that there are deeper , structural changes causing the differing growth rates . business driving or stalling the economies one study released earlier this week said that italy 's export-oriented economy was suffering from weak growth because it had failed to build up internationally competitive , value-added industries .
" italy 's product specialisation , unlike that of countries such as germany or france , has not significantly changed over past decades in reaction to global economic developments , " the study found . meanwhile , another recent study from the commission found that germany 's export industries are becoming increasingly competitive . more painful reforms needed throughout europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysing the recent euro zone growth data , goldman sachs economist javier perez de azpillaga economist drew similar conclusions and said that painful reforms were the answer politicians needed to give . " the german export performance highlights italy 's competitive shortcomings against countries both in the euro area and outside it .
unfortunately , it seems that rising unemployment and rising social discontent may be needed to prompt political and social leaders to implement the necessary reforms , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin cuts growth forecast , slams ecb the german government scaled back its 2005 growth forecasts on friday , saying its earlier prognosis had been too optimistic .

" we need to see china as an opportunity as well as a potential threat , " he said , adding , " containers heading toward europe with all those goods , textiles and others , need to be then sent back to china filled with european goods and products , also a huge expanding market for european services as well .

the base cuts will be the first in the united states in 10 years . " our current arrangements , designed for the cold war , must give way to the new demands of the war against extremism and other evolving 21st century challenges , " rumsfeld said in a statement announcing the closures . while the closures will affect those communities around the united states that stand to lose jobs and revenue from the closure or shrinkage of bases in their area , the reductions will be offset by the return of 70,000 troops from germany to us bases . german exodus offsets us domestic cuts about half the us military facilities in germany are to be vacated , defense department officials have indicated although details from rumfeld 's speech referring to specifics in europe were unavailable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us soldiers carrying out security checks in front of the " conn barracks " in schweinfurt , germany .

few large active duty bases were marked for closure . the list will go to an independent nine-member commission for review and possible changes .
when the commission finishes , president george w. bush will submit the final list to congress to approve or reject the list in its entirety . while the main focus of the recommendations was on bases in the united states , the proposed closures mark the start of an exodus from bases occupied by the us military in germany and other western european countries since world war ii . drawn-out process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the corner pub may suffer if nearby rammstein air base is vacated by the united states air force .

the four previous rounds of closures in germany proved traumatic for the communities involved although studies show that most managed to eventually replace the jobs lost through base closures , and some have found innovative uses for the old bases . the us military has 860 sites in foreign countries , including 305 in germany , 158 in japan , and 105 in south korea . global realignment the closures are linked to a global realignment of us forces that calls for replacing cold war-era bases in western europe with a network of logistics hubs , smaller bases , and lightly manned and unmanned operating locations in the world 's most unstable regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us soldiers load a bradley tank of the first infantry division in a globemaster c-17 cargo plane on their way to iraq at ramstein us airbase in germany on thursday , april 10 , 2003 .
the strategy calls for keeping combat forces at us bases but have them ready to deploy rapidly to trouble stops anywhere in the world . pentagon officials said that in deciding which bases to keep and how to use them they considered for the first time its ability to handle a surge in military activity . solely a question of military value ? " we were doing this whole round during the time that we were actively engaged , our forces were actively engaged , which gave a sense of urgency , if you will , to the definition of surge , " said michael wynne , undersecretary of defense for acquisition , technology and logistics . the prime criteria for judging whether a base should be cut was its military utility , he said .

one day after its official opening , berlin 's holocaust memorial has already become the focus of new criticism .
this time it is not the monument itself in the spotlight , but the behavior of its young visitors . the sprawling memorial in remembrance of the suffering of the six million european jews murdered under the nazi regime is open all day every day of the year .
and on day one , the public were making the most of such unusually liberal opening hours . berliners , germans and visitors from all over the globe came in their thousands to wander through the surging field of concrete pillars and form their own impressions of architect peter eisenman 's highly-publicized creation . the 2711 concrete pillars , which vary in size and shape are set about a meter apart on an undulating ground , which is designed to recall the disorientation of the holocaust victims .
unsurprisingly the reactions of the first flurry of visitors have been hugely diverse . bad behavior ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unidentified couple jump over charcoal-colored concrete slabs of the holocaust memorial in berlin on thursday , may 12 , 2005 , the first day the memorial was open to the public .
among the first day 's intake were school groups from across the country who seemed , in part at least , to relate better to the monument as a kind of maze-like playground than as a testimony to the darkest chapter in germany 's history . one woman from the state of brandenburg was appalled to observe youngsters climbing on the pillars and making a game of jumping from one to another . " i ca n't understand why these young people ca n't behave in a more respectable manner , and moreover why none of their teachers intervene .
such misplaced instincts are unbelievable , " she told berlin 's bz newspaper . quiet rules and regulations although the prescribed code of conduct requests that visitors do not climb or jump on the pillars , that they do not smoke , barbecue or sunbathe at the site , the place is largely devoid of official eyes , which means individuals are left to behave in accordance with the limits of their own consciences . peter eisenman said he wanted visitors to the memorial to behave freely , and has said he can imagine it as a place where children play between the pillars or picnic on the fringes .
he has made it clear that he wants it to be a part of every day life rather than a holy place . but some visitors feel that the " playground factor " distracts them from respectful reverie provoked by the evocative atmosphere of the place . living monument chairman of the jewish community in berlin , albert meyer , said he had long feared that the memorial did not come from the heart of the public and that one must now recognize that it is a living monument , with all the advantages and disadvantages it brings with it . just what they are will become more obvious with time .
at the moment , the monument has to be worked into the fabric of the city , and people have to find their way through the pillars to form their own opinions . if there is any general sentiment it is that the memorial is a good thing .
there is high praise also for the underground information center which documents the fates of europe 's murdered jews . latest row settled lea rosh , the chairwoman of the memorial 's foundation , meanwhile backtracked on a plan to bury a tooth she found at belzec concentration camp in one of the pillars . jewish groups were outraged when rosh announced her intentions during the opening ceremony on tuesday , saying that they it was blasphemous to bury human remains outside cemetaries . on friday , rosh said she would return the tooth to the former death camp in poland , where it will be buried . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fresh row erupts over holocaust memorial the holocaust memorial in berlin officially opens to the public on thursday , but the occasion is being overshadowed by a dispute over plans to set the tooth of a murdered jew into one of the site 's 2711 stone pillars .

bleesen said the engines were normally used in civilian vehicles , but could be adapted for military use .

now the craze has hit germany .
generic terms like " olympic stadium " are passé .
first and foremost , clubs are looking for cash . this saturday 's game will be the last bayern munich ever play at the olympic stadium .
in the space of 30 years , germany 's most famous soccer club has made the transition from a run-of-the-mill provincial team to a money-making , championship winning squad contesting the big prizes year in and year out .
it all happened in one of the world 's most unusual but striking sports venues .
" the olympic stadium gave the club a financial cushion , " goalkeeping legend sepp maier commented .
" the stadium rewrote the history books . "
history has been good to bayern since the stadium was built .
they will celebrate their 19th bundesliga title one last time in the stadium that looks more like a circus tent than a top-notch soccer stadium when league official 's hand over the championship trophy to them again after saturday 's match .
as of the end of may , bayern 's new home will be the allianz arena , named after the german insurance giant based in munich .
revenue generator the -lrb- re -rrb- naming of sporting venues is not just a matter of pride for the company whose name decorates the stadium or arena .
there is big money involved . there are few soccer stadiums in germany without a sponsor name .
starting in the north with hamburg 's aol arena , moving south to the volkswagen arena in wolfsburg , the bayarena for bayer leverkusen , fans will be hard pushed these days to find a stadium sporting the name of a club legend or a reference to local history .

it was a project that the management , under the cigar-chomping gaze of general manager rudi assauer , were proud of .
yet grand ambitions to compete with the likes of real madrid , manchester united and ac milan have forced the team to swallow its pride and sell the name .
the brewery veltins won the auction and as of july 1 , the arena aufschalke will be called the veltins arena after 110 million euros -lrb- $ 138.9 million -rrb- changed hands .
" veltins is the ideal partner for us .
one with whom we have had a good partnership , " said assauer .
for veltins , the close relationship with schalke is natural .
" the arena is the world 's largest and most beautiful bar , " said veltins business manager michael huber .
fans have a different opinion and what do schalke fans think of the corporate deal ?
they view the matter with a bit of scepticism .

" no rudi , for you and how you look at schalke 04 , veltins may be a part of the club 's soul .
for us , veltins is - as good as it tastes - certainly not a part of schalke 's soul . "
yet as much as schalke fans rue the fact that corporate sponsorship is taking a part of the team 's identity , it 's an unavoidable phenomenon that has swept the bundesliga .

bayern munich 's shrewd management is not acting out of desperation though .
they will be receiving additional revenue from the new stadium and continue to add on to an almost unsurpassable advantage over its underfinanced competition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 13.05.2005 cash-strapped clubs sell stadium rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : out with the old olympic stadium , in with the new allianz arena -lrb- back -rrb- in the us , it is common for teams to sell the rights for their stadium names .
now the craze has hit germany .
generic terms like " olympic stadium " are passé .
first and foremost , clubs are looking for cash . this saturday 's game will be the last bayern munich ever play at the olympic stadium .
in the space of 30 years , germany 's most famous soccer club has made the transition from a run-of-the-mill provincial team to a money-making , championship winning squad contesting the big prizes year in and year out .
it all happened in one of the world 's most unusual but striking sports venues .
" the olympic stadium gave the club a financial cushion , " goalkeeping legend sepp maier commented .
" the stadium rewrote the history books . "
history has been good to bayern since the stadium was built .
they will celebrate their 19th bundesliga title one last time in the stadium that looks more like a circus tent than a top-notch soccer stadium when league official 's hand over the championship trophy to them again after saturday 's match .
as of the end of may , bayern 's new home will be the allianz arena , named after the german insurance giant based in munich .
revenue generator the -lrb- re -rrb- naming of sporting venues is not just a matter of pride for the company whose name decorates the stadium or arena .
there is big money involved . there are few soccer stadiums in germany without a sponsor name .
starting in the north with hamburg 's aol arena , moving south to the volkswagen arena in wolfsburg , the bayarena for bayer leverkusen , fans will be hard pushed these days to find a stadium sporting the name of a club legend or a reference to local history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke general manager rudi assauer -lrb- right -rrb- was the man who built the stadium formerly known as the arena aufschalke .
as of july 1 , it will be called veltins arena the arena aufschalke , the ground of schalke 04 in gelsenkirchen , financed on its own the building of the high-tech stadium that opened in 2001 .
it was a project that the management , under the cigar-chomping gaze of general manager rudi assauer , were proud of .
yet grand ambitions to compete with the likes of real madrid , manchester united and ac milan have forced the team to swallow its pride and sell the name .
the brewery veltins won the auction and as of july 1 , the arena aufschalke will be called the veltins arena after 110 million euros -lrb- $ 138.9 million -rrb- changed hands .
" veltins is the ideal partner for us .
one with whom we have had a good partnership , " said assauer .
for veltins , the close relationship with schalke is natural .
" the arena is the world 's largest and most beautiful bar , " said veltins business manager michael huber .
fans have a different opinion and what do schalke fans think of the corporate deal ?
they view the matter with a bit of scepticism .
on fc schalke 04 supporterclub e.v. , a fan web site , they clearly understand the rationale behind such moves .
" the money is more or less a present that we have to accept , " one contributor wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : because it is not an official dfb or fifa sponsor , the tourism group ltu had to cover the name on the ltu arena in düsseldorf for a german friendly in february but the supporters are cynical .
reacting to comments from assauer , who also does commercials for the brewery , that veltins is a part of the soul of schalke 04 , the site 's authors make clear that this is by no means true .
" no rudi , for you and how you look at schalke 04 , veltins may be a part of the club 's soul .
for us , veltins is - as good as it tastes - certainly not a part of schalke 's soul . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 13.05.2005 east germany 's star quality in question 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are western clubs the only ones worthy of championship stars ?
bfc dynamo berlin were once the top soccer team in east germany .
now they want to be honored appropriately for its success .
yet the club 's demands raise a few questions about fairness - both on and off the field . bfc dynamo berlin felt they had waited long enough .
the fourth-division german side had made their application for recognition in the summer of 2004 but had received no reply .
so on the easter weekend this year , they took matters into their own hands . the squad trotted onto the field in hohenschönhausen , a quarter in eastern berlin , with three stars decorating the dynamo jerseys .
the three stars symbolized the ten top division titles the club won in the 1970 's and 80 's .
while the top side in the east at the time , their success was not the only reason they were disliked .
it was rumored at the time that the championships that led to these three stars appearing had much to do with east german stasi head , erich mielke - the club 's mentor - and his blatant yet tolerated manipulation of games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich mielke 's own stars however , while the berlin side took great pleasure in sporting their stars , it was a move that sparked a greater controversy than even mielke - a firm fan of stars - could have engineered . the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- introduced the star system to honor the most successful clubs in bundesliga history - one star for three titles , two stars for five , and three stars for ten .
yet the bundesliga has only been in existence since 1963 .
and was naturally a product of west germany . dynamo berlin is a club from the former east germany and under the dfl 's rules , they do not meet the criteria for earning the stars .
the dfl has proclaimed that teams under its jurisdiction , namely in the professional first and second leagues , would only receive credit for championships won since the league ’ s start .
it also does not recognize gdr champions . the dfl decision doesn ’ t sit well with other german soccer officials . " the star system isn ’ t right , ” said german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- vice-president hans-georg moldenhauer , who is from magdeburg in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
for him , no champion , be it the title holders from before 1963 , or those from the former east german top division , should be excluded .
the dfb , however , is not directly responsible for professional soccer in germany . dynamo officials and fans have been more vocal , venting the collective spleen at the dfl and speaking of arrogance on behalf of the " wessis , ” the not-so-loving term for germans from the west by east germans . " for the people of the former gdr , this is without question a further symbol of a matter that merits discussion , namely the very real triumphant attitude -lsb- of west germany -rsb- that cuts down traditions and achievements without any consideration , " said the club 's press spokesman yiannis hd .

trotz ungeklärter sachlage läuft der bfc erstmals mit den drei sternen über dem vereinsemblem auf .
nach der derzeit noch gültigen regel werden ein stern für drei meistertitel , zwei sterne ab fünf und drei sterne ab zehn meisterschafts-gewinnen ausschließlich für die zeit der bundesliga vergeben .

now and then , the debate is rekindled in the media or in politics about how after the political reunification in 1990 , the people can be reunified . prof. hans joachim teichler , director of the sports history section at the university of potsdam , thinks the “ star ” question and some of the reactions are indicative of the mental divide in germany . “ in the various collective mentalities , the wall in some people ’ s heads seems to be growing higher , ” said teichler . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the last day of the stasi fifteen years ago to the day on saturday , thousands of east german demonstrators stormed the headquarters of the communist country 's hated stasi secret police .

bfc dynamo berlin were once the top soccer team in east germany .
now they want to be honored appropriately for its success .
yet the club 's demands raise a few questions about fairness - both on and off the field . bfc dynamo berlin felt they had waited long enough .
the fourth-division german side had made their application for recognition in the summer of 2004 but had received no reply .
so on the easter weekend this year , they took matters into their own hands . the squad trotted onto the field in hohenschönhausen , a quarter in eastern berlin , with three stars decorating the dynamo jerseys .
the three stars symbolized the ten top division titles the club won in the 1970 's and 80 's .
while the top side in the east at the time , their success was not the only reason they were disliked .
it was rumored at the time that the championships that led to these three stars appearing had much to do with east german stasi head , erich mielke - the club 's mentor - and his blatant yet tolerated manipulation of games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich mielke 's own stars however , while the berlin side took great pleasure in sporting their stars , it was a move that sparked a greater controversy than even mielke - a firm fan of stars - could have engineered . the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- introduced the star system to honor the most successful clubs in bundesliga history - one star for three titles , two stars for five , and three stars for ten .
yet the bundesliga has only been in existence since 1963 .
and was naturally a product of west germany . dynamo berlin is a club from the former east germany and under the dfl 's rules , they do not meet the criteria for earning the stars .
the dfl has proclaimed that teams under its jurisdiction , namely in the professional first and second leagues , would only receive credit for championships won since the league ’ s start .
it also does not recognize gdr champions . the dfl decision doesn ’ t sit well with other german soccer officials . " the star system isn ’ t right , ” said german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- vice-president hans-georg moldenhauer , who is from magdeburg in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
for him , no champion , be it the title holders from before 1963 , or those from the former east german top division , should be excluded .
the dfb , however , is not directly responsible for professional soccer in germany . dynamo officials and fans have been more vocal , venting the collective spleen at the dfl and speaking of arrogance on behalf of the " wessis , ” the not-so-loving term for germans from the west by east germans . " for the people of the former gdr , this is without question a further symbol of a matter that merits discussion , namely the very real triumphant attitude -lsb- of west germany -rsb- that cuts down traditions and achievements without any consideration , " said the club 's press spokesman yiannis hd .

bfc dynamo berlin were once the top soccer team in east germany .
now they want to be honored appropriately for its success .
yet the club 's demands raise a few questions about fairness - both on and off the field . bfc dynamo berlin felt they had waited long enough .
the fourth-division german side had made their application for recognition in the summer of 2004 but had received no reply .
so on the easter weekend this year , they took matters into their own hands . the squad trotted onto the field in hohenschönhausen , a quarter in eastern berlin , with three stars decorating the dynamo jerseys .
the three stars symbolized the ten top division titles the club won in the 1970 's and 80 's .
while the top side in the east at the time , their success was not the only reason they were disliked .
it was rumored at the time that the championships that led to these three stars appearing had much to do with east german stasi head , erich mielke - the club 's mentor - and his blatant yet tolerated manipulation of games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich mielke 's own stars however , while the berlin side took great pleasure in sporting their stars , it was a move that sparked a greater controversy than even mielke - a firm fan of stars - could have engineered . the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- introduced the star system to honor the most successful clubs in bundesliga history - one star for three titles , two stars for five , and three stars for ten .
yet the bundesliga has only been in existence since 1963 .
and was naturally a product of west germany . dynamo berlin is a club from the former east germany and under the dfl 's rules , they do not meet the criteria for earning the stars .
the dfl has proclaimed that teams under its jurisdiction , namely in the professional first and second leagues , would only receive credit for championships won since the league ’ s start .
it also does not recognize gdr champions . the dfl decision doesn ’ t sit well with other german soccer officials . " the star system isn ’ t right , ” said german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- vice-president hans-georg moldenhauer , who is from magdeburg in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
for him , no champion , be it the title holders from before 1963 , or those from the former east german top division , should be excluded .
the dfb , however , is not directly responsible for professional soccer in germany . dynamo officials and fans have been more vocal , venting the collective spleen at the dfl and speaking of arrogance on behalf of the " wessis , ” the not-so-loving term for germans from the west by east germans . " for the people of the former gdr , this is without question a further symbol of a matter that merits discussion , namely the very real triumphant attitude -lsb- of west germany -rsb- that cuts down traditions and achievements without any consideration , " said the club 's press spokesman yiannis hd .

the three stars symbolized the ten top division titles the club won in the 1970 's and 80 's .
while the top side in the east at the time , their success was not the only reason they were disliked .
it was rumored at the time that the championships that led to these three stars appearing had much to do with east german stasi head , erich mielke - the club 's mentor - and his blatant yet tolerated manipulation of games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich mielke 's own stars however , while the berlin side took great pleasure in sporting their stars , it was a move that sparked a greater controversy than even mielke - a firm fan of stars - could have engineered . the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- introduced the star system to honor the most successful clubs in bundesliga history - one star for three titles , two stars for five , and three stars for ten .
yet the bundesliga has only been in existence since 1963 .
and was naturally a product of west germany . dynamo berlin is a club from the former east germany and under the dfl 's rules , they do not meet the criteria for earning the stars .
the dfl has proclaimed that teams under its jurisdiction , namely in the professional first and second leagues , would only receive credit for championships won since the league ’ s start .
it also does not recognize gdr champions . the dfl decision doesn ’ t sit well with other german soccer officials . " the star system isn ’ t right , ” said german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- vice-president hans-georg moldenhauer , who is from magdeburg in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
for him , no champion , be it the title holders from before 1963 , or those from the former east german top division , should be excluded .
the dfb , however , is not directly responsible for professional soccer in germany . dynamo officials and fans have been more vocal , venting the collective spleen at the dfl and speaking of arrogance on behalf of the " wessis , ” the not-so-loving term for germans from the west by east germans . " for the people of the former gdr , this is without question a further symbol of a matter that merits discussion , namely the very real triumphant attitude -lsb- of west germany -rsb- that cuts down traditions and achievements without any consideration , " said the club 's press spokesman yiannis hd .

the base cuts will be the first in the united states in 10 years . " our current arrangements , designed for the cold war , must give way to the new demands of the war against extremism and other evolving 21st century challenges , " rumsfeld said in a statement announcing the closures . while the closures will affect those communities around the united states that stand to lose jobs and revenue from the closure or shrinkage of bases in their area , the reductions will be offset by the return of 70,000 troops from germany to us bases . german exodus offsets us domestic cuts about half the us military facilities in germany are to be vacated , defense department officials have indicated although details from rumfeld 's speech referring to specifics in europe were unavailable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us soldiers carrying out security checks in front of the " conn barracks " in schweinfurt , germany .
" the army will cut by nearly half the number of installations that it operates and maintains in europe , should all of these movements come to pass , " raymond dubois , the acting undersecretary of the army , told reporters last week .
" that is a significant amount of money , quote , to be saved , end quote , and reinvested in infrastructure in the united states for those returning forces . " most of the closures in the united states were army , navy and some air force regional reserve bases and centers , reflecting the pentagon 's desire to move reserve units onto active duty bases to train more closely with the active duty military .
few large active duty bases were marked for closure . the list will go to an independent nine-member commission for review and possible changes .
when the commission finishes , president george w. bush will submit the final list to congress to approve or reject the list in its entirety . while the main focus of the recommendations was on bases in the united states , the proposed closures mark the start of an exodus from bases occupied by the us military in germany and other western european countries since world war ii . drawn-out process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the corner pub may suffer if nearby rammstein air base is vacated by the united states air force .
the four previous rounds of closures in germany proved traumatic for the communities involved although studies show that most managed to eventually replace the jobs lost through base closures , and some have found innovative uses for the old bases . the us military has 860 sites in foreign countries , including 305 in germany , 158 in japan , and 105 in south korea . global realignment the closures are linked to a global realignment of us forces that calls for replacing cold war-era bases in western europe with a network of logistics hubs , smaller bases , and lightly manned and unmanned operating locations in the world 's most unstable regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us soldiers load a bradley tank of the first infantry division in a globemaster c-17 cargo plane on their way to iraq at ramstein us airbase in germany on thursday , april 10 , 2003 .
the strategy calls for keeping combat forces at us bases but have them ready to deploy rapidly to trouble stops anywhere in the world . pentagon officials said that in deciding which bases to keep and how to use them they considered for the first time its ability to handle a surge in military activity . solely a question of military value ? " we were doing this whole round during the time that we were actively engaged , our forces were actively engaged , which gave a sense of urgency , if you will , to the definition of surge , " said michael wynne , undersecretary of defense for acquisition , technology and logistics . the prime criteria for judging whether a base should be cut was its military utility , he said .
the economic impact of a closure on the community was a secondary consideration .

these are substantial divergences in growth , these are divergences in the elements making up growth , these are divergences affecting competitiveness of the national economies of the euro zone , " added juncker , who hosted the meeting . germany on the mend , italy looking broke his comments came a day after the release of official data showing the german economy , which until recently was one of the euro zone 's weakest , now enjoying rude health while the italian economy slumped into recession . the german data showed that europe 's largest economy clocked its fastest growth for four years in the first three months of 2005 owing to robust exports . that contrasted sharply with figures released in italy , revealing that the italian economy entered a recession in the first quarter with the worst quarterly performance in six years . the data were included in an initial estimate from the eu statistics agency eurostat that the 12-state euro zone economy grew 0.5 percent in the first quarter from the last three months of 2004 , which was slightly better than expected . ups and downs across the euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the divergence in growth rates appears not to be limited only to germany and italy .
the eu figures showed belgian growth stalled and the dutch economy shrinking slightly in the first quarter while eu economics commissioner joaquin almunia said he expected " pretty positive " growth from france when it releases first-quarter statistics . the figures have left policymakers dazed and confused .
" the bottom line would have to be described as mixed feelings , " almunia told a news conference .
" some of this data gives us reason to feel optimistic , but that has to be tempered by a rather less optimistic view . " juncker said that the eu 's executive commission was going to look more closely into the divergent trends within the euro zone although he insisted that what was really needed was structural reforms . although the divergent growth trends were in part due to technical and calendar-related factors , recent studies by the european commission 's economic directorate suggest that there are deeper , structural changes causing the differing growth rates . business driving or stalling the economies one study released earlier this week said that italy 's export-oriented economy was suffering from weak growth because it had failed to build up internationally competitive , value-added industries .
" italy 's product specialisation , unlike that of countries such as germany or france , has not significantly changed over past decades in reaction to global economic developments , " the study found . meanwhile , another recent study from the commission found that germany 's export industries are becoming increasingly competitive . more painful reforms needed throughout europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysing the recent euro zone growth data , goldman sachs economist javier perez de azpillaga economist drew similar conclusions and said that painful reforms were the answer politicians needed to give . " the german export performance highlights italy 's competitive shortcomings against countries both in the euro area and outside it .
unfortunately , it seems that rising unemployment and rising social discontent may be needed to prompt political and social leaders to implement the necessary reforms , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin cuts growth forecast , slams ecb the german government scaled back its 2005 growth forecasts on friday , saying its earlier prognosis had been too optimistic .

" the cause for the beatification of john paul ii is open , " the newly-elected pontiff said during a meeting with roman clergymen at the basilica of saint john in lateran . john paul ii died april 2 aged 84 , sparking widespread calls for him to be quickly declared a saint . benedict xvi announced his decision in a letter in latin read out by cardinal jose saraiva martins , the head of the vatican 's congregation for the causes of saints . the pope 's decision allows the congregation to override normal roman catholic church rules , which decree that five years must pass after death before the question of sainthood is tackled , to permit cooler assessment of the subject 's life . " no lack of miracles " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faithful pray after the death of pope john paul ii was announced in st. peter 's square at the vatican saturday april 2 , 2005 .
pope john paul ii , the polish pontiff who led the roman catholic church for more than a quarter century and became history 's most-traveled pope , has died at 84 , the vatican announced saturday .
-lrb- ap photo / gregorio borgia -rrb- but even top prelates have pushed for a speedy process .
on wednesday , cardinal dario castrillon hoyos said john paul ii should be beatified on may 18 , what would have been his 85th birthday .
" there 's no lack of miracles , he performed many while he was still alive , " said hoyos , the vatican official in charge of the clergy worldwide .

" i would like to say how much these communities and the people to whom they belong are dear to me and ensure them that they are in my prayers . " german background plays a role during his audience with the diplomatic corps benedict xvi also urged the world to " overcome the temptation of clashes among cultures , ethnicities and different worlds " . " altogether , joining our efforts , the christian communities , state leaders , diplomats and all people of good will are called upon to create a peaceful society , " the german-born pope said , speaking in french .

one day after its official opening , berlin 's holocaust memorial has already become the focus of new criticism .
this time it is not the monument itself in the spotlight , but the behavior of its young visitors . the sprawling memorial in remembrance of the suffering of the six million european jews murdered under the nazi regime is open all day every day of the year .
and on day one , the public were making the most of such unusually liberal opening hours . berliners , germans and visitors from all over the globe came in their thousands to wander through the surging field of concrete pillars and form their own impressions of architect peter eisenman 's highly-publicized creation . the 2711 concrete pillars , which vary in size and shape are set about a meter apart on an undulating ground , which is designed to recall the disorientation of the holocaust victims .
unsurprisingly the reactions of the first flurry of visitors have been hugely diverse . bad behavior ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unidentified couple jump over charcoal-colored concrete slabs of the holocaust memorial in berlin on thursday , may 12 , 2005 , the first day the memorial was open to the public .
among the first day 's intake were school groups from across the country who seemed , in part at least , to relate better to the monument as a kind of maze-like playground than as a testimony to the darkest chapter in germany 's history . one woman from the state of brandenburg was appalled to observe youngsters climbing on the pillars and making a game of jumping from one to another . " i ca n't understand why these young people ca n't behave in a more respectable manner , and moreover why none of their teachers intervene .
such misplaced instincts are unbelievable , " she told berlin 's bz newspaper . quiet rules and regulations although the prescribed code of conduct requests that visitors do not climb or jump on the pillars , that they do not smoke , barbecue or sunbathe at the site , the place is largely devoid of official eyes , which means individuals are left to behave in accordance with the limits of their own consciences . peter eisenman said he wanted visitors to the memorial to behave freely , and has said he can imagine it as a place where children play between the pillars or picnic on the fringes .
he has made it clear that he wants it to be a part of every day life rather than a holy place . but some visitors feel that the " playground factor " distracts them from respectful reverie provoked by the evocative atmosphere of the place . living monument chairman of the jewish community in berlin , albert meyer , said he had long feared that the memorial did not come from the heart of the public and that one must now recognize that it is a living monument , with all the advantages and disadvantages it brings with it . just what they are will become more obvious with time .
at the moment , the monument has to be worked into the fabric of the city , and people have to find their way through the pillars to form their own opinions . if there is any general sentiment it is that the memorial is a good thing .
there is high praise also for the underground information center which documents the fates of europe 's murdered jews . latest row settled lea rosh , the chairwoman of the memorial 's foundation , meanwhile backtracked on a plan to bury a tooth she found at belzec concentration camp in one of the pillars . jewish groups were outraged when rosh announced her intentions during the opening ceremony on tuesday , saying that they it was blasphemous to bury human remains outside cemetaries . on friday , rosh said she would return the tooth to the former death camp in poland , where it will be buried . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fresh row erupts over holocaust memorial the holocaust memorial in berlin officially opens to the public on thursday , but the occasion is being overshadowed by a dispute over plans to set the tooth of a murdered jew into one of the site 's 2711 stone pillars .

" the cause for the beatification of john paul ii is open , " the newly-elected pontiff said during a meeting with roman clergymen at the basilica of saint john in lateran . john paul ii died april 2 aged 84 , sparking widespread calls for him to be quickly declared a saint . benedict xvi announced his decision in a letter in latin read out by cardinal jose saraiva martins , the head of the vatican 's congregation for the causes of saints . the pope 's decision allows the congregation to override normal roman catholic church rules , which decree that five years must pass after death before the question of sainthood is tackled , to permit cooler assessment of the subject 's life . " no lack of miracles " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faithful pray after the death of pope john paul ii was announced in st. peter 's square at the vatican saturday april 2 , 2005 .
pope john paul ii , the polish pontiff who led the roman catholic church for more than a quarter century and became history 's most-traveled pope , has died at 84 , the vatican announced saturday .
-lrb- ap photo / gregorio borgia -rrb- but even top prelates have pushed for a speedy process .
on wednesday , cardinal dario castrillon hoyos said john paul ii should be beatified on may 18 , what would have been his 85th birthday .
" there 's no lack of miracles , he performed many while he was still alive , " said hoyos , the vatican official in charge of the clergy worldwide .
to achieve beatification the vatican has to ascertain that a person was reponsible for a miracle before or after his death . benedict xvi , who is the only person who can decide if a person is beatified , served as john paul ii 's close aide for 25 years before being elected to succeed him on april 19 . his decision on friday will likely endear him to the legions of fans around the world who mourned the passing of john paul ii , and already view him as a saint . reaching out with diplomacy the pope reached out to the international community in other ways this week , urging countries that do not have diplomatic relations with the vatican to establish such ties . some of these countries " joined ceremonies marking the death of my predecessor and my election to the throne of peter , " he said in his first meeting with diplomats accredited by the vatican since roman catholic cardinals elected him last month . " i appreciated those gestures and today want to express my gratitude and greet the civil authorities of these countries and express my wish to see them represented at the apostolic see as soon as possible , " he added . " i am also thinking of countries with which the holy see does not have diplomatic relations yet , " he said . important communities benedict did not name any countries but vatican experts said he was referring to china and vietnam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi greets the crowd from the central balcony of st. peter 's basilica at the vatican both countries sent messages to the vatican after john paul ii 's death on april 2 although they did not send envoys to his funeral , unlike saudi arabia . benedict , 78 , said he " particularly appreciated messages from these countries , notably those with large catholic communities . " i would like to say how much these communities and the people to whom they belong are dear to me and ensure them that they are in my prayers . " german background plays a role during his audience with the diplomatic corps benedict xvi also urged the world to " overcome the temptation of clashes among cultures , ethnicities and different worlds " . " altogether , joining our efforts , the christian communities , state leaders , diplomats and all people of good will are called upon to create a peaceful society , " the german-born pope said , speaking in french . " to achieve this , all peoples have to draw from their spiritual and cultural heritage the best values they have to go forward without fear of others , accepting to share spiritual and material well-being for the benefit of all .

bfc dynamo berlin were once the top soccer team in east germany .
now they want to be honored appropriately for its success .
yet the club 's demands raise a few questions about fairness - both on and off the field . bfc dynamo berlin felt they had waited long enough .
the fourth-division german side had made their application for recognition in the summer of 2004 but had received no reply .
so on the easter weekend this year , they took matters into their own hands . the squad trotted onto the field in hohenschönhausen , a quarter in eastern berlin , with three stars decorating the dynamo jerseys .
the three stars symbolized the ten top division titles the club won in the 1970 's and 80 's .
while the top side in the east at the time , their success was not the only reason they were disliked .
it was rumored at the time that the championships that led to these three stars appearing had much to do with east german stasi head , erich mielke - the club 's mentor - and his blatant yet tolerated manipulation of games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich mielke 's own stars however , while the berlin side took great pleasure in sporting their stars , it was a move that sparked a greater controversy than even mielke - a firm fan of stars - could have engineered . the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- introduced the star system to honor the most successful clubs in bundesliga history - one star for three titles , two stars for five , and three stars for ten .
yet the bundesliga has only been in existence since 1963 .
and was naturally a product of west germany . dynamo berlin is a club from the former east germany and under the dfl 's rules , they do not meet the criteria for earning the stars .
the dfl has proclaimed that teams under its jurisdiction , namely in the professional first and second leagues , would only receive credit for championships won since the league ’ s start .
it also does not recognize gdr champions . the dfl decision doesn ’ t sit well with other german soccer officials . " the star system isn ’ t right , ” said german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- vice-president hans-georg moldenhauer , who is from magdeburg in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
for him , no champion , be it the title holders from before 1963 , or those from the former east german top division , should be excluded .
the dfb , however , is not directly responsible for professional soccer in germany . dynamo officials and fans have been more vocal , venting the collective spleen at the dfl and speaking of arrogance on behalf of the " wessis , ” the not-so-loving term for germans from the west by east germans . " for the people of the former gdr , this is without question a further symbol of a matter that merits discussion , namely the very real triumphant attitude -lsb- of west germany -rsb- that cuts down traditions and achievements without any consideration , " said the club 's press spokesman yiannis hd .

" i think it is imperative that china explains in detail and quickly the types of additional measures that they intend to adopt and what consequences those will have on future trade flows , " he told the european parliament on thursday .
" i 'm looking forward to receiving such information as a matter of great urgency . " " and failing to receive such concrete information quickly would narrow the options available to the eu to resolve this issue and could leave me with no other alternative than to act under the wto , " he added . mandelson 's comments come after chinese premier wen jiabao had promised on wednesday more measures to curb rampant growth in textile exports to the eu . china makes concillatory noises bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in response to european concerns about surging textile exports from china , wen said that beijing would " take further effective measures to strengthen our guidance and control on textile enterprises , to adopt economic measures to control the rapid growth of some textile products and clothing exports . " with a delegation of ranking eu diplomats on a two-day visit to beijing , eu external affairs commissioner benita ferrero-waldner welcomed wen 's pledge , but added : " this is a signal but this has to be implemented ... as soon as possible . " eu commission launches investigation the eu 's executive commission launched an investigation into select textile and garment categories from china last month after compiling evidence that exports surged by as much as 534 percent after a 31-year-old global quota system had ended in january . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : normally , the investigation is supposed to last a maximum of 60 days during which informal consultations are to be held between brussels and beijing to try to find a solution .
but some eu textile producers have been urging the eu to adopt emergency procedures , which would fast-forward the process to a much more serious formal consultation period . however , mandelson said that some of the eu countries leading calls for emergency action have not sent him facts to base action on although he was they would be " forthcoming . " mandelson 's balancing act bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson is facing strong pressure from eu textile producers who are worried that thousands of jobs could be lost if urgent action is not taken to hold back a flood of chinese clothing that was unleashed by the end quota system . he is playing a difficult balancing act between trying to ease eu textile producers concerns and building up a strong trade relationship with the growing asian economic giant that will bear fruit for european businesses . " we need to see china as an opportunity as well as a potential threat , " he said , adding , " containers heading toward europe with all those goods , textiles and others , need to be then sent back to china filled with european goods and products , also a huge expanding market for european services as well .

" as far as the national team goes , rest is something relative , " brazil 's national team coach carlos alberto parreira told reporters wednesday .
" to play for brazil is not a sacrifice , a favor or an obligation .
it has to involve honor , pleasure and willingness .
if the player does not feel that way , he can ask for his hat and leave . "
parreria said he plans to win the confederations cup by bringing a full-strength squad to germany next month .
it 's a small change in course for the brazilian , who used bench players to win the copa america and also gave his starters a rest during the 2003 confederations cup in france .
argentineans can have a break bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina managed to pull ahead of germany in a friendly match in february argentinean coach jose pekerman has taken a more pragmatic approach to what his players will be doing this summer .
" it is a valuable tournament and we 'll be giving it the importance it deserves , " pekerman told fifiawordcup.com.
" obviously , we want to do as well as we can , as we do in every game , but we also have to strike a balance between this tournament and our other commitments around this time . "
this summer 's contest is a way to test the team 's ability to play together as well as a chance to test new players , pekerman added .

" we do n't exactly have strength in depth , " he told fifaworldcup.com.
" it 's vital we do n't suffer any injuries and we have to play smart . "
after his team shocked the soccer world winning the european championship in june 2004 , in june 2005 no one will underestimate the greeks , who are ranked 12th in the world .
facing stiff competition in the preliminary rounds from brazil , mexico and japan , rehhagel , a german himself , has called on the host country 's large greek population to throw their support behind his players .
" i 'm calling on every greek in germany to come to frankfurt with their families on these two days and support their team , " rehhagel said , trying to repeat the procedure that worked for greece in portugal .
" i reckon the games in frankfurt will be just like home matches for us . "

these are substantial divergences in growth , these are divergences in the elements making up growth , these are divergences affecting competitiveness of the national economies of the euro zone , " added juncker , who hosted the meeting . germany on the mend , italy looking broke his comments came a day after the release of official data showing the german economy , which until recently was one of the euro zone 's weakest , now enjoying rude health while the italian economy slumped into recession . the german data showed that europe 's largest economy clocked its fastest growth for four years in the first three months of 2005 owing to robust exports . that contrasted sharply with figures released in italy , revealing that the italian economy entered a recession in the first quarter with the worst quarterly performance in six years . the data were included in an initial estimate from the eu statistics agency eurostat that the 12-state euro zone economy grew 0.5 percent in the first quarter from the last three months of 2004 , which was slightly better than expected . ups and downs across the euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the divergence in growth rates appears not to be limited only to germany and italy .
the eu figures showed belgian growth stalled and the dutch economy shrinking slightly in the first quarter while eu economics commissioner joaquin almunia said he expected " pretty positive " growth from france when it releases first-quarter statistics . the figures have left policymakers dazed and confused .
" the bottom line would have to be described as mixed feelings , " almunia told a news conference .
" some of this data gives us reason to feel optimistic , but that has to be tempered by a rather less optimistic view . " juncker said that the eu 's executive commission was going to look more closely into the divergent trends within the euro zone although he insisted that what was really needed was structural reforms . although the divergent growth trends were in part due to technical and calendar-related factors , recent studies by the european commission 's economic directorate suggest that there are deeper , structural changes causing the differing growth rates . business driving or stalling the economies one study released earlier this week said that italy 's export-oriented economy was suffering from weak growth because it had failed to build up internationally competitive , value-added industries .
" italy 's product specialisation , unlike that of countries such as germany or france , has not significantly changed over past decades in reaction to global economic developments , " the study found . meanwhile , another recent study from the commission found that germany 's export industries are becoming increasingly competitive . more painful reforms needed throughout europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysing the recent euro zone growth data , goldman sachs economist javier perez de azpillaga economist drew similar conclusions and said that painful reforms were the answer politicians needed to give . " the german export performance highlights italy 's competitive shortcomings against countries both in the euro area and outside it .
unfortunately , it seems that rising unemployment and rising social discontent may be needed to prompt political and social leaders to implement the necessary reforms , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin cuts growth forecast , slams ecb the german government scaled back its 2005 growth forecasts on friday , saying its earlier prognosis had been too optimistic .

now the craze has hit germany .
generic terms like " olympic stadium " are passé .
first and foremost , clubs are looking for cash . this saturday 's game will be the last bayern munich ever play at the olympic stadium .
in the space of 30 years , germany 's most famous soccer club has made the transition from a run-of-the-mill provincial team to a money-making , championship winning squad contesting the big prizes year in and year out .
it all happened in one of the world 's most unusual but striking sports venues .
" the olympic stadium gave the club a financial cushion , " goalkeeping legend sepp maier commented .
" the stadium rewrote the history books . "
history has been good to bayern since the stadium was built .
they will celebrate their 19th bundesliga title one last time in the stadium that looks more like a circus tent than a top-notch soccer stadium when league official 's hand over the championship trophy to them again after saturday 's match .
as of the end of may , bayern 's new home will be the allianz arena , named after the german insurance giant based in munich .
revenue generator the -lrb- re -rrb- naming of sporting venues is not just a matter of pride for the company whose name decorates the stadium or arena .
there is big money involved . there are few soccer stadiums in germany without a sponsor name .
starting in the north with hamburg 's aol arena , moving south to the volkswagen arena in wolfsburg , the bayarena for bayer leverkusen , fans will be hard pushed these days to find a stadium sporting the name of a club legend or a reference to local history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke general manager rudi assauer -lrb- right -rrb- was the man who built the stadium formerly known as the arena aufschalke .
as of july 1 , it will be called veltins arena the arena aufschalke , the ground of schalke 04 in gelsenkirchen , financed on its own the building of the high-tech stadium that opened in 2001 .
it was a project that the management , under the cigar-chomping gaze of general manager rudi assauer , were proud of .
yet grand ambitions to compete with the likes of real madrid , manchester united and ac milan have forced the team to swallow its pride and sell the name .
the brewery veltins won the auction and as of july 1 , the arena aufschalke will be called the veltins arena after 110 million euros -lrb- $ 138.9 million -rrb- changed hands .
" veltins is the ideal partner for us .
one with whom we have had a good partnership , " said assauer .
for veltins , the close relationship with schalke is natural .
" the arena is the world 's largest and most beautiful bar , " said veltins business manager michael huber .
fans have a different opinion and what do schalke fans think of the corporate deal ?
they view the matter with a bit of scepticism .
on fc schalke 04 supporterclub e.v. , a fan web site , they clearly understand the rationale behind such moves .
" the money is more or less a present that we have to accept , " one contributor wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : because it is not an official dfb or fifa sponsor , the tourism group ltu had to cover the name on the ltu arena in düsseldorf for a german friendly in february but the supporters are cynical .
reacting to comments from assauer , who also does commercials for the brewery , that veltins is a part of the soul of schalke 04 , the site 's authors make clear that this is by no means true .
" no rudi , for you and how you look at schalke 04 , veltins may be a part of the club 's soul .
for us , veltins is - as good as it tastes - certainly not a part of schalke 's soul . "
yet as much as schalke fans rue the fact that corporate sponsorship is taking a part of the team 's identity , it 's an unavoidable phenomenon that has swept the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rights to name dortmund 's westfalen stadium will be on the auctioning block in the future schalke 's rival , bvb dortmund , who also once had great thoughts of being a top european club , desperately need money .
the club is heavily in debt .
anything and everything that can bring in badly needed capital , is being sold .
just this week , dortmund 's general manager hans-jürgen watzke announced that with the right offer , bvb 's traditional westfalen stadium would be renamed .
that 's a promise that the club made to creditors , he said .
bayern munich 's shrewd management is not acting out of desperation though .
they will be receiving additional revenue from the new stadium and continue to add on to an almost unsurpassable advantage over its underfinanced competition .
so when the final whistle blows on saturday and the last fan has filed out of the olympic stadium in munich , another icon of german soccer will be lost .

bfc dynamo berlin were once the top soccer team in east germany .
now they want to be honored appropriately for its success .
yet the club 's demands raise a few questions about fairness - both on and off the field . bfc dynamo berlin felt they had waited long enough .
the fourth-division german side had made their application for recognition in the summer of 2004 but had received no reply .
so on the easter weekend this year , they took matters into their own hands . the squad trotted onto the field in hohenschönhausen , a quarter in eastern berlin , with three stars decorating the dynamo jerseys .
the three stars symbolized the ten top division titles the club won in the 1970 's and 80 's .
while the top side in the east at the time , their success was not the only reason they were disliked .
it was rumored at the time that the championships that led to these three stars appearing had much to do with east german stasi head , erich mielke - the club 's mentor - and his blatant yet tolerated manipulation of games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich mielke 's own stars however , while the berlin side took great pleasure in sporting their stars , it was a move that sparked a greater controversy than even mielke - a firm fan of stars - could have engineered . the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- introduced the star system to honor the most successful clubs in bundesliga history - one star for three titles , two stars for five , and three stars for ten .
yet the bundesliga has only been in existence since 1963 .
and was naturally a product of west germany . dynamo berlin is a club from the former east germany and under the dfl 's rules , they do not meet the criteria for earning the stars .
the dfl has proclaimed that teams under its jurisdiction , namely in the professional first and second leagues , would only receive credit for championships won since the league ’ s start .
it also does not recognize gdr champions . the dfl decision doesn ’ t sit well with other german soccer officials . " the star system isn ’ t right , ” said german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- vice-president hans-georg moldenhauer , who is from magdeburg in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
for him , no champion , be it the title holders from before 1963 , or those from the former east german top division , should be excluded .
the dfb , however , is not directly responsible for professional soccer in germany . dynamo officials and fans have been more vocal , venting the collective spleen at the dfl and speaking of arrogance on behalf of the " wessis , ” the not-so-loving term for germans from the west by east germans . " for the people of the former gdr , this is without question a further symbol of a matter that merits discussion , namely the very real triumphant attitude -lsb- of west germany -rsb- that cuts down traditions and achievements without any consideration , " said the club 's press spokesman yiannis hd .

getting the two to understand each other has been no easy undertaking . the sports and olympic museum in cologne , which opened in 1999 , is an example of the unwitting failure to find the proper mix .
it is true that the successes of both west and east germany are equally represented on the sports timeline .
yet in the memorabilia section , a locker room of sorts with uniforms and sporting equipment , not just from famous athletes , but also from amateurs , referees or sports officials , not one east german article appears in the 30 to 40 lockers . the idea for the museum came up in 1972 , so we of course could only collect west german items , ” explained collection director jörg weck .
he also said that being in cologne , there are naturally more connections with athletes from the west of germany .
many from the region decided to donate items upon hearing of the museum .
weck did , however , admit that the acquistion of gdr items was a matter that should be considered . politics in dynamo affair ? although dynamo berlin officials have tried to play the discrimination card against the dfl , they don ’ t find much sympathy or solidarity from soccer fans of other eastern clubs .
the memory of fixed games sits deep .
expletives for dynamo are common in web site forums of these clubs .
one 1 .
fc union berlin fan though is divided . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bfc dynamo berlin could compromise and sport the stars on this proposed new badge “ bfc doesn ’ t deserve any championship stars .
but to write off east german soccer as a whole doesn ’ t satisfy me either , ” wrote lemur . bernd heynemann , currently a member of the german parliament , was a former referee in east germany .
in his recently printed recollections as a ref , he recalled how mielke had also tried to buy him but he resisted .

getting the two to understand each other has been no easy undertaking . the sports and olympic museum in cologne , which opened in 1999 , is an example of the unwitting failure to find the proper mix .
it is true that the successes of both west and east germany are equally represented on the sports timeline .
yet in the memorabilia section , a locker room of sorts with uniforms and sporting equipment , not just from famous athletes , but also from amateurs , referees or sports officials , not one east german article appears in the 30 to 40 lockers . the idea for the museum came up in 1972 , so we of course could only collect west german items , ” explained collection director jörg weck .
he also said that being in cologne , there are naturally more connections with athletes from the west of germany .
many from the region decided to donate items upon hearing of the museum .
weck did , however , admit that the acquistion of gdr items was a matter that should be considered . politics in dynamo affair ? although dynamo berlin officials have tried to play the discrimination card against the dfl , they don ’ t find much sympathy or solidarity from soccer fans of other eastern clubs .

bfc dynamo berlin were once the top soccer team in east germany .
now they want to be honored appropriately for its success .
yet the club 's demands raise a few questions about fairness - both on and off the field . bfc dynamo berlin felt they had waited long enough .
the fourth-division german side had made their application for recognition in the summer of 2004 but had received no reply .
so on the easter weekend this year , they took matters into their own hands . the squad trotted onto the field in hohenschönhausen , a quarter in eastern berlin , with three stars decorating the dynamo jerseys .
the three stars symbolized the ten top division titles the club won in the 1970 's and 80 's .
while the top side in the east at the time , their success was not the only reason they were disliked .
it was rumored at the time that the championships that led to these three stars appearing had much to do with east german stasi head , erich mielke - the club 's mentor - and his blatant yet tolerated manipulation of games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich mielke 's own stars however , while the berlin side took great pleasure in sporting their stars , it was a move that sparked a greater controversy than even mielke - a firm fan of stars - could have engineered . the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- introduced the star system to honor the most successful clubs in bundesliga history - one star for three titles , two stars for five , and three stars for ten .
yet the bundesliga has only been in existence since 1963 .
and was naturally a product of west germany . dynamo berlin is a club from the former east germany and under the dfl 's rules , they do not meet the criteria for earning the stars .
the dfl has proclaimed that teams under its jurisdiction , namely in the professional first and second leagues , would only receive credit for championships won since the league ’ s start .
it also does not recognize gdr champions . the dfl decision doesn ’ t sit well with other german soccer officials . " the star system isn ’ t right , ” said german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- vice-president hans-georg moldenhauer , who is from magdeburg in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
for him , no champion , be it the title holders from before 1963 , or those from the former east german top division , should be excluded .
the dfb , however , is not directly responsible for professional soccer in germany . dynamo officials and fans have been more vocal , venting the collective spleen at the dfl and speaking of arrogance on behalf of the " wessis , ” the not-so-loving term for germans from the west by east germans . " for the people of the former gdr , this is without question a further symbol of a matter that merits discussion , namely the very real triumphant attitude -lsb- of west germany -rsb- that cuts down traditions and achievements without any consideration , " said the club 's press spokesman yiannis hd .

these are substantial divergences in growth , these are divergences in the elements making up growth , these are divergences affecting competitiveness of the national economies of the euro zone , " added juncker , who hosted the meeting . germany on the mend , italy looking broke his comments came a day after the release of official data showing the german economy , which until recently was one of the euro zone 's weakest , now enjoying rude health while the italian economy slumped into recession . the german data showed that europe 's largest economy clocked its fastest growth for four years in the first three months of 2005 owing to robust exports . that contrasted sharply with figures released in italy , revealing that the italian economy entered a recession in the first quarter with the worst quarterly performance in six years . the data were included in an initial estimate from the eu statistics agency eurostat that the 12-state euro zone economy grew 0.5 percent in the first quarter from the last three months of 2004 , which was slightly better than expected . ups and downs across the euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the divergence in growth rates appears not to be limited only to germany and italy .
the eu figures showed belgian growth stalled and the dutch economy shrinking slightly in the first quarter while eu economics commissioner joaquin almunia said he expected " pretty positive " growth from france when it releases first-quarter statistics . the figures have left policymakers dazed and confused .
" the bottom line would have to be described as mixed feelings , " almunia told a news conference .
" some of this data gives us reason to feel optimistic , but that has to be tempered by a rather less optimistic view . " juncker said that the eu 's executive commission was going to look more closely into the divergent trends within the euro zone although he insisted that what was really needed was structural reforms . although the divergent growth trends were in part due to technical and calendar-related factors , recent studies by the european commission 's economic directorate suggest that there are deeper , structural changes causing the differing growth rates . business driving or stalling the economies one study released earlier this week said that italy 's export-oriented economy was suffering from weak growth because it had failed to build up internationally competitive , value-added industries .
" italy 's product specialisation , unlike that of countries such as germany or france , has not significantly changed over past decades in reaction to global economic developments , " the study found . meanwhile , another recent study from the commission found that germany 's export industries are becoming increasingly competitive . more painful reforms needed throughout europe ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysing the recent euro zone growth data , goldman sachs economist javier perez de azpillaga economist drew similar conclusions and said that painful reforms were the answer politicians needed to give . " the german export performance highlights italy 's competitive shortcomings against countries both in the euro area and outside it .
unfortunately , it seems that rising unemployment and rising social discontent may be needed to prompt political and social leaders to implement the necessary reforms , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin cuts growth forecast , slams ecb the german government scaled back its 2005 growth forecasts on friday , saying its earlier prognosis had been too optimistic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 13.05.2005 east germany 's star quality in question 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are western clubs the only ones worthy of championship stars ?
bfc dynamo berlin were once the top soccer team in east germany .
now they want to be honored appropriately for its success .
yet the club 's demands raise a few questions about fairness - both on and off the field . bfc dynamo berlin felt they had waited long enough .
the fourth-division german side had made their application for recognition in the summer of 2004 but had received no reply .
so on the easter weekend this year , they took matters into their own hands . the squad trotted onto the field in hohenschönhausen , a quarter in eastern berlin , with three stars decorating the dynamo jerseys .
the three stars symbolized the ten top division titles the club won in the 1970 's and 80 's .
while the top side in the east at the time , their success was not the only reason they were disliked .
it was rumored at the time that the championships that led to these three stars appearing had much to do with east german stasi head , erich mielke - the club 's mentor - and his blatant yet tolerated manipulation of games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich mielke 's own stars however , while the berlin side took great pleasure in sporting their stars , it was a move that sparked a greater controversy than even mielke - a firm fan of stars - could have engineered . the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- introduced the star system to honor the most successful clubs in bundesliga history - one star for three titles , two stars for five , and three stars for ten .
yet the bundesliga has only been in existence since 1963 .
and was naturally a product of west germany . dynamo berlin is a club from the former east germany and under the dfl 's rules , they do not meet the criteria for earning the stars .
the dfl has proclaimed that teams under its jurisdiction , namely in the professional first and second leagues , would only receive credit for championships won since the league ’ s start .
it also does not recognize gdr champions . the dfl decision doesn ’ t sit well with other german soccer officials . " the star system isn ’ t right , ” said german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- vice-president hans-georg moldenhauer , who is from magdeburg in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
for him , no champion , be it the title holders from before 1963 , or those from the former east german top division , should be excluded .
the dfb , however , is not directly responsible for professional soccer in germany . dynamo officials and fans have been more vocal , venting the collective spleen at the dfl and speaking of arrogance on behalf of the " wessis , ” the not-so-loving term for germans from the west by east germans . " for the people of the former gdr , this is without question a further symbol of a matter that merits discussion , namely the very real triumphant attitude -lsb- of west germany -rsb- that cuts down traditions and achievements without any consideration , " said the club 's press spokesman yiannis hd .
kaufmann . bildunterschrift : fußball : sterne über dem bfc-logo drei sterne sind über dem vereinswappen des bfc dynamo auf einer werbebande mit der aufschrift .
" wir sorgen für sternstunden " angebracht .
der berliner viertligist verliert am 25.03.20005 im berliner sportforum das fußball-meisterschaftsspiel der nohv-oberliga -lrb- staffel nord -rrb- gegen die amateure von energie cottbus mit 0:1 .
trotz ungeklärter sachlage läuft der bfc erstmals mit den drei sternen über dem vereinsemblem auf .
nach der derzeit noch gültigen regel werden ein stern für drei meistertitel , zwei sterne ab fünf und drei sterne ab zehn meisterschafts-gewinnen ausschließlich für die zeit der bundesliga vergeben .

bfc dynamo berlin were once the top soccer team in east germany .
now they want to be honored appropriately for its success .
yet the club 's demands raise a few questions about fairness - both on and off the field . bfc dynamo berlin felt they had waited long enough .
the fourth-division german side had made their application for recognition in the summer of 2004 but had received no reply .
so on the easter weekend this year , they took matters into their own hands . the squad trotted onto the field in hohenschönhausen , a quarter in eastern berlin , with three stars decorating the dynamo jerseys .
the three stars symbolized the ten top division titles the club won in the 1970 's and 80 's .
while the top side in the east at the time , their success was not the only reason they were disliked .
it was rumored at the time that the championships that led to these three stars appearing had much to do with east german stasi head , erich mielke - the club 's mentor - and his blatant yet tolerated manipulation of games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich mielke 's own stars however , while the berlin side took great pleasure in sporting their stars , it was a move that sparked a greater controversy than even mielke - a firm fan of stars - could have engineered . the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- introduced the star system to honor the most successful clubs in bundesliga history - one star for three titles , two stars for five , and three stars for ten .
yet the bundesliga has only been in existence since 1963 .
and was naturally a product of west germany . dynamo berlin is a club from the former east germany and under the dfl 's rules , they do not meet the criteria for earning the stars .
the dfl has proclaimed that teams under its jurisdiction , namely in the professional first and second leagues , would only receive credit for championships won since the league ’ s start .
it also does not recognize gdr champions . the dfl decision doesn ’ t sit well with other german soccer officials . " the star system isn ’ t right , ” said german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- vice-president hans-georg moldenhauer , who is from magdeburg in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
for him , no champion , be it the title holders from before 1963 , or those from the former east german top division , should be excluded .
the dfb , however , is not directly responsible for professional soccer in germany . dynamo officials and fans have been more vocal , venting the collective spleen at the dfl and speaking of arrogance on behalf of the " wessis , ” the not-so-loving term for germans from the west by east germans . " for the people of the former gdr , this is without question a further symbol of a matter that merits discussion , namely the very real triumphant attitude -lsb- of west germany -rsb- that cuts down traditions and achievements without any consideration , " said the club 's press spokesman yiannis hd .

getting the two to understand each other has been no easy undertaking . the sports and olympic museum in cologne , which opened in 1999 , is an example of the unwitting failure to find the proper mix .
it is true that the successes of both west and east germany are equally represented on the sports timeline .
yet in the memorabilia section , a locker room of sorts with uniforms and sporting equipment , not just from famous athletes , but also from amateurs , referees or sports officials , not one east german article appears in the 30 to 40 lockers . the idea for the museum came up in 1972 , so we of course could only collect west german items , ” explained collection director jörg weck .
he also said that being in cologne , there are naturally more connections with athletes from the west of germany .
many from the region decided to donate items upon hearing of the museum .
weck did , however , admit that the acquistion of gdr items was a matter that should be considered . politics in dynamo affair ? although dynamo berlin officials have tried to play the discrimination card against the dfl , they don ’ t find much sympathy or solidarity from soccer fans of other eastern clubs .

but to write off east german soccer as a whole doesn ’ t satisfy me either , ” wrote lemur . bernd heynemann , currently a member of the german parliament , was a former referee in east germany .
in his recently printed recollections as a ref , he recalled how mielke had also tried to buy him but he resisted .
asked about the dfl decision , he thinks it has gone halfway . “ player caps , like matthias sammer ’ s with east germany , were recognized by the dfb .
magdeburg ’ s uefa cup winners ' cup -lrb- in 1974 -rrb- victory also stands .
the championships from the east german top division , as well as titles before 1963 , should all be recognized , ” the parliamentarian said . the dfl views the matter pragmatically .
the star system is purely a marketing measure .
dfl spokesman tom bender told the berliner zeitung that if clubs like fifth-division victoria frankfurt / oder -lrb- six ddr titles -rrb- were granted stars , in their case two , it would be like “ inflation . ” try telling that to the disgruntled fans of bfc dynamo berlin .

" the cause for the beatification of john paul ii is open , " the newly-elected pontiff said during a meeting with roman clergymen at the basilica of saint john in lateran . john paul ii died april 2 aged 84 , sparking widespread calls for him to be quickly declared a saint . benedict xvi announced his decision in a letter in latin read out by cardinal jose saraiva martins , the head of the vatican 's congregation for the causes of saints . the pope 's decision allows the congregation to override normal roman catholic church rules , which decree that five years must pass after death before the question of sainthood is tackled , to permit cooler assessment of the subject 's life . " no lack of miracles " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faithful pray after the death of pope john paul ii was announced in st. peter 's square at the vatican saturday april 2 , 2005 .
pope john paul ii , the polish pontiff who led the roman catholic church for more than a quarter century and became history 's most-traveled pope , has died at 84 , the vatican announced saturday .
-lrb- ap photo / gregorio borgia -rrb- but even top prelates have pushed for a speedy process .
on wednesday , cardinal dario castrillon hoyos said john paul ii should be beatified on may 18 , what would have been his 85th birthday .
" there 's no lack of miracles , he performed many while he was still alive , " said hoyos , the vatican official in charge of the clergy worldwide .
to achieve beatification the vatican has to ascertain that a person was reponsible for a miracle before or after his death . benedict xvi , who is the only person who can decide if a person is beatified , served as john paul ii 's close aide for 25 years before being elected to succeed him on april 19 . his decision on friday will likely endear him to the legions of fans around the world who mourned the passing of john paul ii , and already view him as a saint . reaching out with diplomacy the pope reached out to the international community in other ways this week , urging countries that do not have diplomatic relations with the vatican to establish such ties . some of these countries " joined ceremonies marking the death of my predecessor and my election to the throne of peter , " he said in his first meeting with diplomats accredited by the vatican since roman catholic cardinals elected him last month . " i appreciated those gestures and today want to express my gratitude and greet the civil authorities of these countries and express my wish to see them represented at the apostolic see as soon as possible , " he added . " i am also thinking of countries with which the holy see does not have diplomatic relations yet , " he said . important communities benedict did not name any countries but vatican experts said he was referring to china and vietnam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi greets the crowd from the central balcony of st. peter 's basilica at the vatican both countries sent messages to the vatican after john paul ii 's death on april 2 although they did not send envoys to his funeral , unlike saudi arabia . benedict , 78 , said he " particularly appreciated messages from these countries , notably those with large catholic communities . " i would like to say how much these communities and the people to whom they belong are dear to me and ensure them that they are in my prayers . " german background plays a role during his audience with the diplomatic corps benedict xvi also urged the world to " overcome the temptation of clashes among cultures , ethnicities and different worlds " . " altogether , joining our efforts , the christian communities , state leaders , diplomats and all people of good will are called upon to create a peaceful society , " the german-born pope said , speaking in french . " to achieve this , all peoples have to draw from their spiritual and cultural heritage the best values they have to go forward without fear of others , accepting to share spiritual and material well-being for the benefit of all .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 13.05.2005 cash-strapped clubs sell stadium rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : out with the old olympic stadium , in with the new allianz arena -lrb- back -rrb- in the us , it is common for teams to sell the rights for their stadium names .
now the craze has hit germany .
generic terms like " olympic stadium " are passé .
first and foremost , clubs are looking for cash . this saturday 's game will be the last bayern munich ever play at the olympic stadium .
in the space of 30 years , germany 's most famous soccer club has made the transition from a run-of-the-mill provincial team to a money-making , championship winning squad contesting the big prizes year in and year out .
it all happened in one of the world 's most unusual but striking sports venues .
" the olympic stadium gave the club a financial cushion , " goalkeeping legend sepp maier commented .
" the stadium rewrote the history books . "
history has been good to bayern since the stadium was built .
they will celebrate their 19th bundesliga title one last time in the stadium that looks more like a circus tent than a top-notch soccer stadium when league official 's hand over the championship trophy to them again after saturday 's match .
as of the end of may , bayern 's new home will be the allianz arena , named after the german insurance giant based in munich .
revenue generator the -lrb- re -rrb- naming of sporting venues is not just a matter of pride for the company whose name decorates the stadium or arena .
there is big money involved . there are few soccer stadiums in germany without a sponsor name .
starting in the north with hamburg 's aol arena , moving south to the volkswagen arena in wolfsburg , the bayarena for bayer leverkusen , fans will be hard pushed these days to find a stadium sporting the name of a club legend or a reference to local history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke general manager rudi assauer -lrb- right -rrb- was the man who built the stadium formerly known as the arena aufschalke .
as of july 1 , it will be called veltins arena the arena aufschalke , the ground of schalke 04 in gelsenkirchen , financed on its own the building of the high-tech stadium that opened in 2001 .
it was a project that the management , under the cigar-chomping gaze of general manager rudi assauer , were proud of .
yet grand ambitions to compete with the likes of real madrid , manchester united and ac milan have forced the team to swallow its pride and sell the name .
the brewery veltins won the auction and as of july 1 , the arena aufschalke will be called the veltins arena after 110 million euros -lrb- $ 138.9 million -rrb- changed hands .
" veltins is the ideal partner for us .
one with whom we have had a good partnership , " said assauer .
for veltins , the close relationship with schalke is natural .
" the arena is the world 's largest and most beautiful bar , " said veltins business manager michael huber .
fans have a different opinion and what do schalke fans think of the corporate deal ?
they view the matter with a bit of scepticism .
on fc schalke 04 supporterclub e.v. , a fan web site , they clearly understand the rationale behind such moves .
" the money is more or less a present that we have to accept , " one contributor wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : because it is not an official dfb or fifa sponsor , the tourism group ltu had to cover the name on the ltu arena in düsseldorf for a german friendly in february but the supporters are cynical .
reacting to comments from assauer , who also does commercials for the brewery , that veltins is a part of the soul of schalke 04 , the site 's authors make clear that this is by no means true .
" no rudi , for you and how you look at schalke 04 , veltins may be a part of the club 's soul .
for us , veltins is - as good as it tastes - certainly not a part of schalke 's soul . "
yet as much as schalke fans rue the fact that corporate sponsorship is taking a part of the team 's identity , it 's an unavoidable phenomenon that has swept the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rights to name dortmund 's westfalen stadium will be on the auctioning block in the future schalke 's rival , bvb dortmund , who also once had great thoughts of being a top european club , desperately need money .
the club is heavily in debt .
anything and everything that can bring in badly needed capital , is being sold .
just this week , dortmund 's general manager hans-jürgen watzke announced that with the right offer , bvb 's traditional westfalen stadium would be renamed .
that 's a promise that the club made to creditors , he said .
bayern munich 's shrewd management is not acting out of desperation though .
they will be receiving additional revenue from the new stadium and continue to add on to an almost unsurpassable advantage over its underfinanced competition .
so when the final whistle blows on saturday and the last fan has filed out of the olympic stadium in munich , another icon of german soccer will be lost .
in the future when people talk about germany 's olympic stadium , then they will mean the one in berlin .
one of the last without a corporate sponsor . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de life after soccer ?
not in dortmund fans of the dortmund soccer club bvb borrusia are distraught .
the storied team with one of the most loyal followings in the world is on the edge of a financial collapse that threatens its existence .
-lrb- feb .
19 , 2005 -rrb- munich 's soccer stadium in spotlight the president of german soccer club 1860 munich is being held on charges of accepting bribes in connection with the building of the city 's new stadium , which will host the opening match of the 2006 world cup .
-lrb- march 10 , 2004 -rrb- ad gimmick gives dfb a pain in the shorts the chairman of a fourth division german soccer team has taken the country 's soccer federation , the dfb , to court over rules that forbid him from displaying a sponsor on the back of his team 's shorts .

now the craze has hit germany .
generic terms like " olympic stadium " are passé .
first and foremost , clubs are looking for cash . this saturday 's game will be the last bayern munich ever play at the olympic stadium .
in the space of 30 years , germany 's most famous soccer club has made the transition from a run-of-the-mill provincial team to a money-making , championship winning squad contesting the big prizes year in and year out .
it all happened in one of the world 's most unusual but striking sports venues .
" the olympic stadium gave the club a financial cushion , " goalkeeping legend sepp maier commented .
" the stadium rewrote the history books . "
history has been good to bayern since the stadium was built .
they will celebrate their 19th bundesliga title one last time in the stadium that looks more like a circus tent than a top-notch soccer stadium when league official 's hand over the championship trophy to them again after saturday 's match .
as of the end of may , bayern 's new home will be the allianz arena , named after the german insurance giant based in munich .
revenue generator the -lrb- re -rrb- naming of sporting venues is not just a matter of pride for the company whose name decorates the stadium or arena .
there is big money involved . there are few soccer stadiums in germany without a sponsor name .
starting in the north with hamburg 's aol arena , moving south to the volkswagen arena in wolfsburg , the bayarena for bayer leverkusen , fans will be hard pushed these days to find a stadium sporting the name of a club legend or a reference to local history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke general manager rudi assauer -lrb- right -rrb- was the man who built the stadium formerly known as the arena aufschalke .
as of july 1 , it will be called veltins arena the arena aufschalke , the ground of schalke 04 in gelsenkirchen , financed on its own the building of the high-tech stadium that opened in 2001 .
it was a project that the management , under the cigar-chomping gaze of general manager rudi assauer , were proud of .
yet grand ambitions to compete with the likes of real madrid , manchester united and ac milan have forced the team to swallow its pride and sell the name .
the brewery veltins won the auction and as of july 1 , the arena aufschalke will be called the veltins arena after 110 million euros -lrb- $ 138.9 million -rrb- changed hands .
" veltins is the ideal partner for us .
one with whom we have had a good partnership , " said assauer .
for veltins , the close relationship with schalke is natural .
" the arena is the world 's largest and most beautiful bar , " said veltins business manager michael huber .
fans have a different opinion and what do schalke fans think of the corporate deal ?
they view the matter with a bit of scepticism .
on fc schalke 04 supporterclub e.v. , a fan web site , they clearly understand the rationale behind such moves .
" the money is more or less a present that we have to accept , " one contributor wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : because it is not an official dfb or fifa sponsor , the tourism group ltu had to cover the name on the ltu arena in düsseldorf for a german friendly in february but the supporters are cynical .
reacting to comments from assauer , who also does commercials for the brewery , that veltins is a part of the soul of schalke 04 , the site 's authors make clear that this is by no means true .
" no rudi , for you and how you look at schalke 04 , veltins may be a part of the club 's soul .
for us , veltins is - as good as it tastes - certainly not a part of schalke 's soul . "
yet as much as schalke fans rue the fact that corporate sponsorship is taking a part of the team 's identity , it 's an unavoidable phenomenon that has swept the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rights to name dortmund 's westfalen stadium will be on the auctioning block in the future schalke 's rival , bvb dortmund , who also once had great thoughts of being a top european club , desperately need money .
the club is heavily in debt .
anything and everything that can bring in badly needed capital , is being sold .
just this week , dortmund 's general manager hans-jürgen watzke announced that with the right offer , bvb 's traditional westfalen stadium would be renamed .
that 's a promise that the club made to creditors , he said .
bayern munich 's shrewd management is not acting out of desperation though .
they will be receiving additional revenue from the new stadium and continue to add on to an almost unsurpassable advantage over its underfinanced competition .
so when the final whistle blows on saturday and the last fan has filed out of the olympic stadium in munich , another icon of german soccer will be lost .
in the future when people talk about germany 's olympic stadium , then they will mean the one in berlin .
one of the last without a corporate sponsor . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de life after soccer ?

one german copycat got into trouble with authorities and has taken his case to the courts . it all started as a joke .
training to become a photographer in 1991 , alexander mechtold needed a passport photo for his student id .
friends had given him a goody bag that 's traditionally given to german children on their first day of school . mechtold decided to be a bit childish himself and poked out his tongue for the picture .
he liked the result so much that he 's stuck to the procedure ever since , showing a bit of flesh in all official photographs . nobody seemed to mind for years and local authorities in his hometown mühlheim an der ruhr in western germany issued him driver 's licenses , id cards and passports without a problem . defaming the authorities ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : einstein 's version became famous but the last time mechtold , who now works as a cameraman and travels frequently , applied for a passport , his tongue-showing photo suddenly was n't acceptable any more .
officials had apparently contacted germany 's interior ministry to enquire about the legality of the unusual portrait and received a negative response . " unnatural facial expressions and gestures make it impossible to clearly identify someone , " a ministry spokesperson told berlin 's die tageszeitung newspaper , adding that mechtold 's tongue could be seen as a " defamation of a civil servant , " which is illegal in germany . but what about heino ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heino never takes of his sunglasses in public mechtold countered that he 's never had problems during his trips abroad .
people find his tongue funny , he said , adding that german folk music singer heino is also allowed to wear sunglasses in photos for official documents . that 's a completely different situation , ministry officials said . " the sunglasses are necessary to identify heino , " the spokesperson told the daily , adding that the man would n't be recognizable without them . mechtold 's been asked to return the offensive documents to the authorities and faces up to 500 euros -lrb- $ 630 -rrb- in penalties per document he fails to hand over .
the 31-year-old 's appealing the decision and has taken his case to the courts in return . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hood vs. helmet german law requires bikers to wear helmets , but a few elderly women belonging to germany 's sorbian ethnic minority are refusing to comply , saying that the safety precaution interferes with their national costume .

10 , 2004 -rrb- no laughing matter rules are an important part of german life , but when berlin police officers fined a woman for laughing too late at night , even law-abiding judges had to giggle a little .
-lrb- april 28 , 2004 -rrb- that ’ s not in the rule book !
german civil servants are often labelled as more concerned with making check marks in boxes than actually doing work .
it ’ s easy to see why after one city employee was fined € 300 for trying to cut through the red tape .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.05.2005 john paul ii on fast track to sainthood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans of the late pope john paul ii already see him as a saint pope benedict xvi announced on friday that he had started the process to beatify his predecessor john paul ii , dispensing with rules that require a five-year waiting period before the sainthood procedure can start . " the cause for the beatification of john paul ii is open , " the newly-elected pontiff said during a meeting with roman clergymen at the basilica of saint john in lateran . john paul ii died april 2 aged 84 , sparking widespread calls for him to be quickly declared a saint . benedict xvi announced his decision in a letter in latin read out by cardinal jose saraiva martins , the head of the vatican 's congregation for the causes of saints . the pope 's decision allows the congregation to override normal roman catholic church rules , which decree that five years must pass after death before the question of sainthood is tackled , to permit cooler assessment of the subject 's life . " no lack of miracles " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faithful pray after the death of pope john paul ii was announced in st. peter 's square at the vatican saturday april 2 , 2005 .
pope john paul ii , the polish pontiff who led the roman catholic church for more than a quarter century and became history 's most-traveled pope , has died at 84 , the vatican announced saturday .
-lrb- ap photo / gregorio borgia -rrb- but even top prelates have pushed for a speedy process .
on wednesday , cardinal dario castrillon hoyos said john paul ii should be beatified on may 18 , what would have been his 85th birthday .
" there 's no lack of miracles , he performed many while he was still alive , " said hoyos , the vatican official in charge of the clergy worldwide .
to achieve beatification the vatican has to ascertain that a person was reponsible for a miracle before or after his death . benedict xvi , who is the only person who can decide if a person is beatified , served as john paul ii 's close aide for 25 years before being elected to succeed him on april 19 . his decision on friday will likely endear him to the legions of fans around the world who mourned the passing of john paul ii , and already view him as a saint . reaching out with diplomacy the pope reached out to the international community in other ways this week , urging countries that do not have diplomatic relations with the vatican to establish such ties . some of these countries " joined ceremonies marking the death of my predecessor and my election to the throne of peter , " he said in his first meeting with diplomats accredited by the vatican since roman catholic cardinals elected him last month . " i appreciated those gestures and today want to express my gratitude and greet the civil authorities of these countries and express my wish to see them represented at the apostolic see as soon as possible , " he added . " i am also thinking of countries with which the holy see does not have diplomatic relations yet , " he said . important communities benedict did not name any countries but vatican experts said he was referring to china and vietnam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi greets the crowd from the central balcony of st. peter 's basilica at the vatican both countries sent messages to the vatican after john paul ii 's death on april 2 although they did not send envoys to his funeral , unlike saudi arabia . benedict , 78 , said he " particularly appreciated messages from these countries , notably those with large catholic communities . " i would like to say how much these communities and the people to whom they belong are dear to me and ensure them that they are in my prayers . " german background plays a role during his audience with the diplomatic corps benedict xvi also urged the world to " overcome the temptation of clashes among cultures , ethnicities and different worlds " . " altogether , joining our efforts , the christian communities , state leaders , diplomats and all people of good will are called upon to create a peaceful society , " the german-born pope said , speaking in french . " to achieve this , all peoples have to draw from their spiritual and cultural heritage the best values they have to go forward without fear of others , accepting to share spiritual and material well-being for the benefit of all .

one day after its official opening , berlin 's holocaust memorial has already become the focus of new criticism .
this time it is not the monument itself in the spotlight , but the behavior of its young visitors . the sprawling memorial in remembrance of the suffering of the six million european jews murdered under the nazi regime is open all day every day of the year .
and on day one , the public were making the most of such unusually liberal opening hours . berliners , germans and visitors from all over the globe came in their thousands to wander through the surging field of concrete pillars and form their own impressions of architect peter eisenman 's highly-publicized creation . the 2711 concrete pillars , which vary in size and shape are set about a meter apart on an undulating ground , which is designed to recall the disorientation of the holocaust victims .
unsurprisingly the reactions of the first flurry of visitors have been hugely diverse . bad behavior ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unidentified couple jump over charcoal-colored concrete slabs of the holocaust memorial in berlin on thursday , may 12 , 2005 , the first day the memorial was open to the public .
among the first day 's intake were school groups from across the country who seemed , in part at least , to relate better to the monument as a kind of maze-like playground than as a testimony to the darkest chapter in germany 's history . one woman from the state of brandenburg was appalled to observe youngsters climbing on the pillars and making a game of jumping from one to another . " i ca n't understand why these young people ca n't behave in a more respectable manner , and moreover why none of their teachers intervene .
such misplaced instincts are unbelievable , " she told berlin 's bz newspaper . quiet rules and regulations although the prescribed code of conduct requests that visitors do not climb or jump on the pillars , that they do not smoke , barbecue or sunbathe at the site , the place is largely devoid of official eyes , which means individuals are left to behave in accordance with the limits of their own consciences . peter eisenman said he wanted visitors to the memorial to behave freely , and has said he can imagine it as a place where children play between the pillars or picnic on the fringes .
he has made it clear that he wants it to be a part of every day life rather than a holy place . but some visitors feel that the " playground factor " distracts them from respectful reverie provoked by the evocative atmosphere of the place . living monument chairman of the jewish community in berlin , albert meyer , said he had long feared that the memorial did not come from the heart of the public and that one must now recognize that it is a living monument , with all the advantages and disadvantages it brings with it . just what they are will become more obvious with time .

one day after its official opening , berlin 's holocaust memorial has already become the focus of new criticism .
this time it is not the monument itself in the spotlight , but the behavior of its young visitors . the sprawling memorial in remembrance of the suffering of the six million european jews murdered under the nazi regime is open all day every day of the year .
and on day one , the public were making the most of such unusually liberal opening hours . berliners , germans and visitors from all over the globe came in their thousands to wander through the surging field of concrete pillars and form their own impressions of architect peter eisenman 's highly-publicized creation . the 2711 concrete pillars , which vary in size and shape are set about a meter apart on an undulating ground , which is designed to recall the disorientation of the holocaust victims .
unsurprisingly the reactions of the first flurry of visitors have been hugely diverse . bad behavior ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an unidentified couple jump over charcoal-colored concrete slabs of the holocaust memorial in berlin on thursday , may 12 , 2005 , the first day the memorial was open to the public .
among the first day 's intake were school groups from across the country who seemed , in part at least , to relate better to the monument as a kind of maze-like playground than as a testimony to the darkest chapter in germany 's history . one woman from the state of brandenburg was appalled to observe youngsters climbing on the pillars and making a game of jumping from one to another . " i ca n't understand why these young people ca n't behave in a more respectable manner , and moreover why none of their teachers intervene .
such misplaced instincts are unbelievable , " she told berlin 's bz newspaper . quiet rules and regulations although the prescribed code of conduct requests that visitors do not climb or jump on the pillars , that they do not smoke , barbecue or sunbathe at the site , the place is largely devoid of official eyes , which means individuals are left to behave in accordance with the limits of their own consciences . peter eisenman said he wanted visitors to the memorial to behave freely , and has said he can imagine it as a place where children play between the pillars or picnic on the fringes .
he has made it clear that he wants it to be a part of every day life rather than a holy place . but some visitors feel that the " playground factor " distracts them from respectful reverie provoked by the evocative atmosphere of the place . living monument chairman of the jewish community in berlin , albert meyer , said he had long feared that the memorial did not come from the heart of the public and that one must now recognize that it is a living monument , with all the advantages and disadvantages it brings with it . just what they are will become more obvious with time .
at the moment , the monument has to be worked into the fabric of the city , and people have to find their way through the pillars to form their own opinions . if there is any general sentiment it is that the memorial is a good thing .
there is high praise also for the underground information center which documents the fates of europe 's murdered jews . latest row settled lea rosh , the chairwoman of the memorial 's foundation , meanwhile backtracked on a plan to bury a tooth she found at belzec concentration camp in one of the pillars . jewish groups were outraged when rosh announced her intentions during the opening ceremony on tuesday , saying that they it was blasphemous to bury human remains outside cemetaries . on friday , rosh said she would return the tooth to the former death camp in poland , where it will be buried . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fresh row erupts over holocaust memorial the holocaust memorial in berlin officially opens to the public on thursday , but the occasion is being overshadowed by a dispute over plans to set the tooth of a murdered jew into one of the site 's 2711 stone pillars .

the base cuts will be the first in the united states in 10 years . " our current arrangements , designed for the cold war , must give way to the new demands of the war against extremism and other evolving 21st century challenges , " rumsfeld said in a statement announcing the closures . while the closures will affect those communities around the united states that stand to lose jobs and revenue from the closure or shrinkage of bases in their area , the reductions will be offset by the return of 70,000 troops from germany to us bases . german exodus offsets us domestic cuts about half the us military facilities in germany are to be vacated , defense department officials have indicated although details from rumfeld 's speech referring to specifics in europe were unavailable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us soldiers carrying out security checks in front of the " conn barracks " in schweinfurt , germany .
" the army will cut by nearly half the number of installations that it operates and maintains in europe , should all of these movements come to pass , " raymond dubois , the acting undersecretary of the army , told reporters last week .
" that is a significant amount of money , quote , to be saved , end quote , and reinvested in infrastructure in the united states for those returning forces . " most of the closures in the united states were army , navy and some air force regional reserve bases and centers , reflecting the pentagon 's desire to move reserve units onto active duty bases to train more closely with the active duty military .
few large active duty bases were marked for closure . the list will go to an independent nine-member commission for review and possible changes .
when the commission finishes , president george w. bush will submit the final list to congress to approve or reject the list in its entirety . while the main focus of the recommendations was on bases in the united states , the proposed closures mark the start of an exodus from bases occupied by the us military in germany and other western european countries since world war ii . drawn-out process bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the corner pub may suffer if nearby rammstein air base is vacated by the united states air force .
the four previous rounds of closures in germany proved traumatic for the communities involved although studies show that most managed to eventually replace the jobs lost through base closures , and some have found innovative uses for the old bases . the us military has 860 sites in foreign countries , including 305 in germany , 158 in japan , and 105 in south korea . global realignment the closures are linked to a global realignment of us forces that calls for replacing cold war-era bases in western europe with a network of logistics hubs , smaller bases , and lightly manned and unmanned operating locations in the world 's most unstable regions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us soldiers load a bradley tank of the first infantry division in a globemaster c-17 cargo plane on their way to iraq at ramstein us airbase in germany on thursday , april 10 , 2003 .
the strategy calls for keeping combat forces at us bases but have them ready to deploy rapidly to trouble stops anywhere in the world . pentagon officials said that in deciding which bases to keep and how to use them they considered for the first time its ability to handle a surge in military activity . solely a question of military value ? " we were doing this whole round during the time that we were actively engaged , our forces were actively engaged , which gave a sense of urgency , if you will , to the definition of surge , " said michael wynne , undersecretary of defense for acquisition , technology and logistics . the prime criteria for judging whether a base should be cut was its military utility , he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.05.2005 john paul ii on fast track to sainthood großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans of the late pope john paul ii already see him as a saint pope benedict xvi announced on friday that he had started the process to beatify his predecessor john paul ii , dispensing with rules that require a five-year waiting period before the sainthood procedure can start . " the cause for the beatification of john paul ii is open , " the newly-elected pontiff said during a meeting with roman clergymen at the basilica of saint john in lateran . john paul ii died april 2 aged 84 , sparking widespread calls for him to be quickly declared a saint . benedict xvi announced his decision in a letter in latin read out by cardinal jose saraiva martins , the head of the vatican 's congregation for the causes of saints . the pope 's decision allows the congregation to override normal roman catholic church rules , which decree that five years must pass after death before the question of sainthood is tackled , to permit cooler assessment of the subject 's life . " no lack of miracles " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faithful pray after the death of pope john paul ii was announced in st. peter 's square at the vatican saturday april 2 , 2005 .
pope john paul ii , the polish pontiff who led the roman catholic church for more than a quarter century and became history 's most-traveled pope , has died at 84 , the vatican announced saturday .
-lrb- ap photo / gregorio borgia -rrb- but even top prelates have pushed for a speedy process .
on wednesday , cardinal dario castrillon hoyos said john paul ii should be beatified on may 18 , what would have been his 85th birthday .
" there 's no lack of miracles , he performed many while he was still alive , " said hoyos , the vatican official in charge of the clergy worldwide .
to achieve beatification the vatican has to ascertain that a person was reponsible for a miracle before or after his death . benedict xvi , who is the only person who can decide if a person is beatified , served as john paul ii 's close aide for 25 years before being elected to succeed him on april 19 . his decision on friday will likely endear him to the legions of fans around the world who mourned the passing of john paul ii , and already view him as a saint . reaching out with diplomacy the pope reached out to the international community in other ways this week , urging countries that do not have diplomatic relations with the vatican to establish such ties . some of these countries " joined ceremonies marking the death of my predecessor and my election to the throne of peter , " he said in his first meeting with diplomats accredited by the vatican since roman catholic cardinals elected him last month . " i appreciated those gestures and today want to express my gratitude and greet the civil authorities of these countries and express my wish to see them represented at the apostolic see as soon as possible , " he added . " i am also thinking of countries with which the holy see does not have diplomatic relations yet , " he said . important communities benedict did not name any countries but vatican experts said he was referring to china and vietnam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi greets the crowd from the central balcony of st. peter 's basilica at the vatican both countries sent messages to the vatican after john paul ii 's death on april 2 although they did not send envoys to his funeral , unlike saudi arabia . benedict , 78 , said he " particularly appreciated messages from these countries , notably those with large catholic communities . " i would like to say how much these communities and the people to whom they belong are dear to me and ensure them that they are in my prayers . " german background plays a role during his audience with the diplomatic corps benedict xvi also urged the world to " overcome the temptation of clashes among cultures , ethnicities and different worlds " . " altogether , joining our efforts , the christian communities , state leaders , diplomats and all people of good will are called upon to create a peaceful society , " the german-born pope said , speaking in french . " to achieve this , all peoples have to draw from their spiritual and cultural heritage the best values they have to go forward without fear of others , accepting to share spiritual and material well-being for the benefit of all .

" you can therefore understand that that i am particularly sensitive to dialogue between all people to overcome all forms of conflict and tensions , and to make of our earth an earth of peace and brotherhood , " he said . afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de papal help in overcoming nazi history as pope benedict xvi pledged to continue working toward unity across religions , observers in germany hope having a countryman on the papal throne will help the country take another step beyond its nazi past .

" the cause for the beatification of john paul ii is open , " the newly-elected pontiff said during a meeting with roman clergymen at the basilica of saint john in lateran . john paul ii died april 2 aged 84 , sparking widespread calls for him to be quickly declared a saint . benedict xvi announced his decision in a letter in latin read out by cardinal jose saraiva martins , the head of the vatican 's congregation for the causes of saints . the pope 's decision allows the congregation to override normal roman catholic church rules , which decree that five years must pass after death before the question of sainthood is tackled , to permit cooler assessment of the subject 's life . " no lack of miracles " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : faithful pray after the death of pope john paul ii was announced in st. peter 's square at the vatican saturday april 2 , 2005 .
pope john paul ii , the polish pontiff who led the roman catholic church for more than a quarter century and became history 's most-traveled pope , has died at 84 , the vatican announced saturday .
-lrb- ap photo / gregorio borgia -rrb- but even top prelates have pushed for a speedy process .
on wednesday , cardinal dario castrillon hoyos said john paul ii should be beatified on may 18 , what would have been his 85th birthday .
" there 's no lack of miracles , he performed many while he was still alive , " said hoyos , the vatican official in charge of the clergy worldwide .
to achieve beatification the vatican has to ascertain that a person was reponsible for a miracle before or after his death . benedict xvi , who is the only person who can decide if a person is beatified , served as john paul ii 's close aide for 25 years before being elected to succeed him on april 19 . his decision on friday will likely endear him to the legions of fans around the world who mourned the passing of john paul ii , and already view him as a saint . reaching out with diplomacy the pope reached out to the international community in other ways this week , urging countries that do not have diplomatic relations with the vatican to establish such ties . some of these countries " joined ceremonies marking the death of my predecessor and my election to the throne of peter , " he said in his first meeting with diplomats accredited by the vatican since roman catholic cardinals elected him last month . " i appreciated those gestures and today want to express my gratitude and greet the civil authorities of these countries and express my wish to see them represented at the apostolic see as soon as possible , " he added . " i am also thinking of countries with which the holy see does not have diplomatic relations yet , " he said . important communities benedict did not name any countries but vatican experts said he was referring to china and vietnam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi greets the crowd from the central balcony of st. peter 's basilica at the vatican both countries sent messages to the vatican after john paul ii 's death on april 2 although they did not send envoys to his funeral , unlike saudi arabia . benedict , 78 , said he " particularly appreciated messages from these countries , notably those with large catholic communities . " i would like to say how much these communities and the people to whom they belong are dear to me and ensure them that they are in my prayers . " german background plays a role during his audience with the diplomatic corps benedict xvi also urged the world to " overcome the temptation of clashes among cultures , ethnicities and different worlds " . " altogether , joining our efforts , the christian communities , state leaders , diplomats and all people of good will are called upon to create a peaceful society , " the german-born pope said , speaking in french . " to achieve this , all peoples have to draw from their spiritual and cultural heritage the best values they have to go forward without fear of others , accepting to share spiritual and material well-being for the benefit of all .

bfc dynamo berlin were once the top soccer team in east germany .
now they want to be honored appropriately for its success .
yet the club 's demands raise a few questions about fairness - both on and off the field . bfc dynamo berlin felt they had waited long enough .
the fourth-division german side had made their application for recognition in the summer of 2004 but had received no reply .
so on the easter weekend this year , they took matters into their own hands . the squad trotted onto the field in hohenschönhausen , a quarter in eastern berlin , with three stars decorating the dynamo jerseys .
the three stars symbolized the ten top division titles the club won in the 1970 's and 80 's .
while the top side in the east at the time , their success was not the only reason they were disliked .
it was rumored at the time that the championships that led to these three stars appearing had much to do with east german stasi head , erich mielke - the club 's mentor - and his blatant yet tolerated manipulation of games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich mielke 's own stars however , while the berlin side took great pleasure in sporting their stars , it was a move that sparked a greater controversy than even mielke - a firm fan of stars - could have engineered . the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- introduced the star system to honor the most successful clubs in bundesliga history - one star for three titles , two stars for five , and three stars for ten .
yet the bundesliga has only been in existence since 1963 .
and was naturally a product of west germany . dynamo berlin is a club from the former east germany and under the dfl 's rules , they do not meet the criteria for earning the stars .
the dfl has proclaimed that teams under its jurisdiction , namely in the professional first and second leagues , would only receive credit for championships won since the league ’ s start .
it also does not recognize gdr champions . the dfl decision doesn ’ t sit well with other german soccer officials . " the star system isn ’ t right , ” said german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- vice-president hans-georg moldenhauer , who is from magdeburg in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
for him , no champion , be it the title holders from before 1963 , or those from the former east german top division , should be excluded .
the dfb , however , is not directly responsible for professional soccer in germany . dynamo officials and fans have been more vocal , venting the collective spleen at the dfl and speaking of arrogance on behalf of the " wessis , ” the not-so-loving term for germans from the west by east germans . " for the people of the former gdr , this is without question a further symbol of a matter that merits discussion , namely the very real triumphant attitude -lsb- of west germany -rsb- that cuts down traditions and achievements without any consideration , " said the club 's press spokesman yiannis hd .

bfc dynamo berlin were once the top soccer team in east germany .
now they want to be honored appropriately for its success .
yet the club 's demands raise a few questions about fairness - both on and off the field . bfc dynamo berlin felt they had waited long enough .
the fourth-division german side had made their application for recognition in the summer of 2004 but had received no reply .
so on the easter weekend this year , they took matters into their own hands . the squad trotted onto the field in hohenschönhausen , a quarter in eastern berlin , with three stars decorating the dynamo jerseys .
the three stars symbolized the ten top division titles the club won in the 1970 's and 80 's .
while the top side in the east at the time , their success was not the only reason they were disliked .
it was rumored at the time that the championships that led to these three stars appearing had much to do with east german stasi head , erich mielke - the club 's mentor - and his blatant yet tolerated manipulation of games . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich mielke 's own stars however , while the berlin side took great pleasure in sporting their stars , it was a move that sparked a greater controversy than even mielke - a firm fan of stars - could have engineered . the german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- introduced the star system to honor the most successful clubs in bundesliga history - one star for three titles , two stars for five , and three stars for ten .
yet the bundesliga has only been in existence since 1963 .
and was naturally a product of west germany . dynamo berlin is a club from the former east germany and under the dfl 's rules , they do not meet the criteria for earning the stars .
the dfl has proclaimed that teams under its jurisdiction , namely in the professional first and second leagues , would only receive credit for championships won since the league ’ s start .
it also does not recognize gdr champions . the dfl decision doesn ’ t sit well with other german soccer officials . " the star system isn ’ t right , ” said german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- vice-president hans-georg moldenhauer , who is from magdeburg in the eastern state of saxony-anhalt .
for him , no champion , be it the title holders from before 1963 , or those from the former east german top division , should be excluded .
the dfb , however , is not directly responsible for professional soccer in germany . dynamo officials and fans have been more vocal , venting the collective spleen at the dfl and speaking of arrogance on behalf of the " wessis , ” the not-so-loving term for germans from the west by east germans . " for the people of the former gdr , this is without question a further symbol of a matter that merits discussion , namely the very real triumphant attitude -lsb- of west germany -rsb- that cuts down traditions and achievements without any consideration , " said the club 's press spokesman yiannis hd .

now the craze has hit germany .
generic terms like " olympic stadium " are passé .
first and foremost , clubs are looking for cash . this saturday 's game will be the last bayern munich ever play at the olympic stadium .
in the space of 30 years , germany 's most famous soccer club has made the transition from a run-of-the-mill provincial team to a money-making , championship winning squad contesting the big prizes year in and year out .
it all happened in one of the world 's most unusual but striking sports venues .
" the olympic stadium gave the club a financial cushion , " goalkeeping legend sepp maier commented .
" the stadium rewrote the history books . "
history has been good to bayern since the stadium was built .
they will celebrate their 19th bundesliga title one last time in the stadium that looks more like a circus tent than a top-notch soccer stadium when league official 's hand over the championship trophy to them again after saturday 's match .
as of the end of may , bayern 's new home will be the allianz arena , named after the german insurance giant based in munich .
revenue generator the -lrb- re -rrb- naming of sporting venues is not just a matter of pride for the company whose name decorates the stadium or arena .
there is big money involved . there are few soccer stadiums in germany without a sponsor name .
starting in the north with hamburg 's aol arena , moving south to the volkswagen arena in wolfsburg , the bayarena for bayer leverkusen , fans will be hard pushed these days to find a stadium sporting the name of a club legend or a reference to local history .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke general manager rudi assauer -lrb- right -rrb- was the man who built the stadium formerly known as the arena aufschalke .
as of july 1 , it will be called veltins arena the arena aufschalke , the ground of schalke 04 in gelsenkirchen , financed on its own the building of the high-tech stadium that opened in 2001 .
it was a project that the management , under the cigar-chomping gaze of general manager rudi assauer , were proud of .
yet grand ambitions to compete with the likes of real madrid , manchester united and ac milan have forced the team to swallow its pride and sell the name .
the brewery veltins won the auction and as of july 1 , the arena aufschalke will be called the veltins arena after 110 million euros -lrb- $ 138.9 million -rrb- changed hands .
" veltins is the ideal partner for us .
one with whom we have had a good partnership , " said assauer .
for veltins , the close relationship with schalke is natural .
" the arena is the world 's largest and most beautiful bar , " said veltins business manager michael huber .
fans have a different opinion and what do schalke fans think of the corporate deal ?
they view the matter with a bit of scepticism .
on fc schalke 04 supporterclub e.v. , a fan web site , they clearly understand the rationale behind such moves .
" the money is more or less a present that we have to accept , " one contributor wrote .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : because it is not an official dfb or fifa sponsor , the tourism group ltu had to cover the name on the ltu arena in düsseldorf for a german friendly in february but the supporters are cynical .
reacting to comments from assauer , who also does commercials for the brewery , that veltins is a part of the soul of schalke 04 , the site 's authors make clear that this is by no means true .
" no rudi , for you and how you look at schalke 04 , veltins may be a part of the club 's soul .
for us , veltins is - as good as it tastes - certainly not a part of schalke 's soul . "
yet as much as schalke fans rue the fact that corporate sponsorship is taking a part of the team 's identity , it 's an unavoidable phenomenon that has swept the bundesliga .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rights to name dortmund 's westfalen stadium will be on the auctioning block in the future schalke 's rival , bvb dortmund , who also once had great thoughts of being a top european club , desperately need money .
the club is heavily in debt .
anything and everything that can bring in badly needed capital , is being sold .
just this week , dortmund 's general manager hans-jürgen watzke announced that with the right offer , bvb 's traditional westfalen stadium would be renamed .
that 's a promise that the club made to creditors , he said .
bayern munich 's shrewd management is not acting out of desperation though .
they will be receiving additional revenue from the new stadium and continue to add on to an almost unsurpassable advantage over its underfinanced competition .
so when the final whistle blows on saturday and the last fan has filed out of the olympic stadium in munich , another icon of german soccer will be lost .
in the future when people talk about germany 's olympic stadium , then they will mean the one in berlin .
one of the last without a corporate sponsor . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de life after soccer ?

president bush 's chief climate negotiator has told the bbc that the usa will agree to only one of three of mr blair 's targets for the gleneagles meeting .
mr blair hopes the americans will agree that recent developments in climate science have proved the need for urgent action to protect the planet from the risk of catastrophic harm .
he wants to tie the americans into a new international agreement on cutting emissions now they have refused to ratify the kyoto protocol .
and he wants the us to commit more of its wealth towards developing new technologies that will allow people to keep their current lifestyles without damaging the climate .
unfair competition ?
but mr bush 's climate negotiator harlan watson said the president would agree to only one of the three .
mr watson said the us would continue its investment in technology .
but he said the science on climate was still uncertain and did not merit urgent action .
mr watson said the us would not commit to any new international climate agreement on cutting emissions .
he said the president had committed to reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emitted for every dollar earned in the economy .
but he would not agree to the overall cuts in emissions to which most other leading nations aspire .
the uk government 's chief scientist says industrialised nations need to cut emissions by at least 60 % and believes simply making production a little more efficient is irresponsibly inadequate .
scientists are particularly angry that the us ' reluctance to move urgently on the issue is holding back the rest of the world .
the canadians and japanese are resisting further emissions cuts because their firms fear being out-competed by us companies feasting on cheap energy .
the us will not agree cuts until china and india have agreed cuts too - but these nations complain that their per capita energy use is a fraction of that in the usa .
the americans , they say , must lead the way on cutting emissions .
a number of experts who have seen mr blair attempting to tackle climate change recently say he appears to believe that he can harness a special relationship with president bush to persuade him to change his mind .
mr watson did not hold out any hope of that outcome during his interview with the bbc .

mr blair wants agreement on targets for cutting emissions president bush 's chief climate negotiator has told the bbc that the usa will agree to only one of three of mr blair 's targets for the gleneagles meeting .
mr blair hopes the americans will agree that recent developments in climate science have proved the need for urgent action to protect the planet from the risk of catastrophic harm .
he wants to tie the americans into a new international agreement on cutting emissions now they have refused to ratify the kyoto protocol .
and he wants the us to commit more of its wealth towards developing new technologies that will allow people to keep their current lifestyles without damaging the climate .
unfair competition ?
but mr bush 's climate negotiator harlan watson said the president would agree to only one of the three .
mr watson said the us would continue its investment in technology .
but he said the science on climate was still uncertain and did not merit urgent action .
mr watson said the us would not commit to any new international climate agreement on cutting emissions .
he said the president had committed to reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emitted for every dollar earned in the economy .
but he would not agree to the overall cuts in emissions to which most other leading nations aspire .
the uk government 's chief scientist says industrialised nations need to cut emissions by at least 60 % and believes simply making production a little more efficient is irresponsibly inadequate .
scientists are particularly angry that the us ' reluctance to move urgently on the issue is holding back the rest of the world .
the canadians and japanese are resisting further emissions cuts because their firms fear being out-competed by us companies feasting on cheap energy .
the us will not agree cuts until china and india have agreed cuts too - but these nations complain that their per capita energy use is a fraction of that in the usa .
the americans , they say , must lead the way on cutting emissions .
a number of experts who have seen mr blair attempting to tackle climate change recently say he appears to believe that he can harness a special relationship with president bush to persuade him to change his mind .
mr watson did not hold out any hope of that outcome during his interview with the bbc .

dr alan barclay is switching his ruabon and cefn mawr surgeries to private practice because of increasing pressures on himself and his staff .
there are 16 practices in the area but none are accepting new nhs patients .
wrexham health board has said it had not received an official notice from dr barclay .
dr barclay claimed the board had not responded to his request for more flexible working arrangements under the personal dental services scheme .
health officials said strenuous efforts were being made to attract more dentists to the area , with grants from the welsh assembly government .
last month the assembly government announced an extra £ 5m aimed at keeping dentists in the welsh nhs . "
people are waking up to the fact that the nhs dental service is a shambles " councillor stuart davies the funds was to for " personal dental schemes , " like the one dr barclay said he was trying to arrange for his own practices .
the schemes would let dentists and local health boards introduce local contract arrangements .
wrexham local health board confirmed there are 37 dentists at 16 practices in the town .
around 48 % of wrexham 's 132,000 population are nhs registered with dentists , but none of the practices are accepting new nhs patients , a spokeswoman confirmed .
denbighshire county councillor for llangollen , stuart davies , condemned the news of the latest opt-out from the nhs .

" a lot of people go to ruabon and cefn from here , so it 's going to affect a lot of people around here . "
he said the situation affected both the patients and the dentists , because they worked all the hours possible to see as many people as they could .
" a dental practice opened in llangollen a couple of months ago , but they 're full now and they 've closed their books to new nhs patients . "
the problems surrounding the lack of nhs dentists have led to huge queues all around wales as patients try to find state care .
around 100 people queued outside a llangollen practice last september when it announced it was taking on nhs patients .
in carmarthen , some 600 would-be nhs patients queued in 2003 .
a recent report produced for the wrexham health board showed that nearly half of 12-year-olds having at least one rotting tooth .

dr alan barclay is switching his ruabon and cefn mawr surgeries to private practice because of increasing pressures on himself and his staff .
there are 16 practices in the area but none are accepting new nhs patients .
wrexham health board has said it had not received an official notice from dr barclay .
dr barclay claimed the board had not responded to his request for more flexible working arrangements under the personal dental services scheme .
health officials said strenuous efforts were being made to attract more dentists to the area , with grants from the welsh assembly government .
last month the assembly government announced an extra £ 5m aimed at keeping dentists in the welsh nhs .
people are waking up to the fact that the nhs dental service is a shambles councillor stuart davies the funds was to for " personal dental schemes , " like the one dr barclay said he was trying to arrange for his own practices .
the schemes would let dentists and local health boards introduce local contract arrangements .

around 48 % of wrexham 's 132,000 population are nhs registered with dentists , but none of the practices are accepting new nhs patients , a spokeswoman confirmed .
denbighshire county councillor for llangollen , stuart davies , condemned the news of the latest opt-out from the nhs .
" people are waking up to the fact that the nhs dental service is a shambles , " said mr davies .
people queued in llangollen last autumn for an nhs dentist " a lot of people go to ruabon and cefn from here , so it 's going to affect a lot of people around here . "
he said the situation affected both the patients and the dentists , because they worked all the hours possible to see as many people as they could .
" a dental practice opened in llangollen a couple of months ago , but they 're full now and they 've closed their books to new nhs patients . "

the white , sleek machine was unveiled during a glitzy show on mtv in the us , hosted by actor elijah wood .
microsoft is the first console maker to show off its next-generation video game machine .
rivals sony and nintendo are expected to provide more details about their consoles next week at the annual games trade show , e3 in los angeles .
' captivate people ' this is the first major home game console launch since november 2001 .
the xbox 360 is one of the most important products for microsoft this year .
the software giant has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into becoming a leading player in the world of video games .
new consoles are usually unveiled at e3 -lrb- electronic entertainment expo -rrb- .
but microsoft has ruffled some feathers by offering gamers a first look at the 360 on mtv .

the front panel houses a disc drawer , two memory card slots , an infra-red receiver for an optional remote control , the power button and two covered usb ports .
separate panels will be available to replace and customise the front of the console .
the controllers are similar to current ones , but are wireless and white to match the console .
the machine is designed to stand on one end and comes with a removable 20gb hard drive .
" they 're hoping it will captivate people from the off , " said margaret robertson , games editor with the specialist games magazine edge .
" it is certainly going to alienate far fewer people than the first xbox design , " said ms robertson , who was given exclusive access to the 360 for edge .
pc power the technical make-up of the machine is largely what was expected .
under the bonnet , the 360 is powered by a processor with three ibm powerpc 3.2ghz chips , with a custom ati 500mhz graphics processor and 512mb of ram .
according to microsoft , this will offer a teraflop of overall performance .

" but microsoft 's argument is that it is not about the specs .
specs are irrelevant if you do n't have the tools to support developers . "
the 360 builds on microsoft 's online gaming service , xbox live .
more services will be available to paid subscribers , while others will be able to access some of the service for free .
microsoft is not talking about the 360 as a digital entertainment hub .
but the machine can be used to play music , watch dvds and stream media from portable devices or a windows xp computer .
what is not known is if gamers will be able to play current xbox games on the 360 .
the price of the console has yet to be announced but some speculate it could go on sale in the us for $ 300 -lrb- £ 162 -rrb- .
microsoft is aiming for what is called backwards compatibility but is facing technical difficulties .
games for the 360 itself will be designed for widescreen high-definition screens and are expected to offer a dazzling level of graphical detail .
a range of titles are under development for the machine , with kameo and perfect dark zero from developers rare leading the way .
but it is not known which games will be ready by the time the console is released , which is due to be by christmas according to edge .
head start microsoft was a year behind sony 's playstation 2 in launching the original xbox and it never managed to make up the time .
xbox is a distant second in console sales behind the playstation 2 , in a market that analysts predict will be worth $ 11.3bn -lrb- £ 6.1bn -rrb- in five years ' time .
this time round , the software giant is aiming to be first out of the gate .
the xbox 360 is due to go on sale before christmas , launching first in the us , closely followed by europe and japan .
sony 's playstation 3 and nintendo 's revolution are not expected until next year .
" microsoft think they can be market leaders , " said ms robertson .

sony would really have to drop the ball . "
" nintendo is the dark horse .

microsoft is the first console maker to show off its next-generation video game machine .
rivals sony and nintendo are expected to provide more details about their consoles next week at the annual games trade show , e3 in los angeles .
' captivate people ' this is the first major home game console launch since november 2001 .
the xbox 360 is one of the most important products for microsoft this year .
the software giant has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into becoming a leading player in the world of video games .
new consoles are usually unveiled at e3 -lrb- electronic entertainment expo -rrb- .
but microsoft has ruffled some feathers by offering gamers a first look at the 360 on mtv .

the front panel houses a disc drawer , two memory card slots , an infra-red receiver for an optional remote control , the power button and two covered usb ports .
separate panels will be available to replace and customise the front of the console .
the controllers are similar to current ones , but are wireless and white to match the console .
the machine is designed to stand on one end and comes with a removable 20gb hard drive .
" they 're hoping it will captivate people from the off , " said margaret robertson , games editor with the specialist games magazine edge .
" it is certainly going to alienate far fewer people than the first xbox design , " said ms robertson , who was given exclusive access to the 360 for edge .
pc power the technical make-up of the machine is largely what was expected .
under the bonnet , the 360 is powered by a processor with three ibm powerpc 3.2ghz chips , with a custom ati 500mhz graphics processor and 512mb of ram .
according to microsoft , this will offer a teraflop of overall performance .

" but microsoft 's argument is that it is not about the specs .
specs are irrelevant if you do n't have the tools to support developers . "
the 360 builds on microsoft 's online gaming service , xbox live .
more services will be available to paid subscribers , while others will be able to access some of the service for free .
microsoft is not talking about the 360 as a digital entertainment hub .
but the machine can be used to play music , watch dvds and stream media from portable devices or a windows xp computer .
what is not known is if gamers will be able to play current xbox games on the 360 .
the price of the console has yet to be announced but some speculate it could go on sale in the us for $ 300 -lrb- £ 162 -rrb- .
microsoft is aiming for what is called backwards compatibility but is facing technical difficulties .
games for the 360 itself will be designed for widescreen high-definition screens and are expected to offer a dazzling level of graphical detail .
a range of titles are under development for the machine , with kameo and perfect dark zero from developers rare leading the way .
but it is not known which games will be ready by the time the console is released , which is due to be by christmas according to edge .
head start microsoft was a year behind sony 's playstation 2 in launching the original xbox and it never managed to make up the time .
xbox is a distant second in console sales behind the playstation 2 , in a market that analysts predict will be worth $ 11.3bn -lrb- £ 6.1bn -rrb- in five years ' time .
this time round , the software giant is aiming to be first out of the gate .
the xbox 360 is due to go on sale before christmas , launching first in the us , closely followed by europe and japan .
sony 's playstation 3 and nintendo 's revolution are not expected until next year .
" microsoft think they can be market leaders , " said ms robertson .

sony would really have to drop the ball . "

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- cases of mumps soaring across uk home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health medical notes science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : friday , 13 may , 2005 , 07:06 gmt 08:06 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version cases of mumps soaring across uk the government has a catch-up campaign for those who missed out on mmr the uk is in the grip of a mumps epidemic which struck nearly 5,000 people in january alone , say experts .
cases in england and wales soared by 12,000 to 16,436 in 2004 , they say .
most of those who have caught the virus are aged 19 to 23 , but cases are also cropping up in vulnerable children , two british medical journal papers show .
cases are being seen in people born before mmr became routine in 1988 and children who have not been vaccinated , possibly due to vaccine safety fears .
every effort should be made to ensure that all children are fully immunised even if they are older than the recommended age range a spokeswoman from the department of health ' my testicle swelled up ' medical notes : mumps the bmj findings corroborate recent reports of rising mumps rates across england , wales and ireland .
in the first paper , investigators at the health protection agency report that in 2004 , the number of cases of mumps recorded in england and wales hit 16,436 , up from 4,204 in 2003 .
and in the first month of 2005 , there were nearly 5,000 cases .
most were among young adults born before 1988 and who would , therefore , not have been offered mmr as a child .
in the second paper , dr ravindra gupta , from london 's guy 's and st thomas ' , working with colleagues from king 's college london , found cases have also occurring in very young children who would have been eligible for the mmr - measles , mumps and rubella - vaccine .
the world health organization recommends that at least 90 % of all those eligible receive the vaccine .
however , dr gupta 's group said uptake of mmr among two-year-olds in the uk fell from around 92 % in early 1995 to around 80 % in 2003/4 .
mumps a viral infection of the saliva-producing glands found either side of the face spread by coughs and sneezes symptoms develop 14 to 24 days after exposure begins with fever , shivers , tiredness and painful swelling of parotid glands can rarely cause serious complications " in some areas of london , as few as 60 % of two-year-olds had received a first dose of mmr .
" this would account for our recent experience with mumps in younger children , " they said .
health secretary patricia hewitt said the rapid rise in cases of mumps " is a very real worry " .
speaking on bbc 's breakfast programme , she said : " the most important thing for parents and for young adults who did n't get a vaccination at the normal age , is go to the gp , go to the surgery and get the vaccination done now . "
a spokeswoman for the department of health said : " the department of health has alerted gps to the risk posed by mumps to young adults and recommends that every effort should be made to ensure that all children are fully immunised even if they are older than the recommended age range .
" some higher education establishments have been offering special mmr sessions to protect these young people against mumps .
" the department supplies vaccine and leaflets for these sessions .
in order to limit the spread of mumps in the uk , we recommend that all at-risk school leavers and other young adults who have not received mmr or only received one dose , should ensure that they take up the offer of mmr vaccination . "
your comments why all the fear and loathing over what is essentially a mild childhood illness suse , london why all the fear and loathing over what is essentially a mild childhood illness , involving a bit of discomfort - and boosting the immune system in the process .
when an adult gets mumps , it can be more unpleasant and more serious , but even the much-vaunted danger of mumps-induced infertility among males is much less of a risk than usually assumed .
what 's all the fuss ?
and as has been pointed out in another e-mail : previous years have not seen epidemics of young adults suffering - it would be very useful to allow an unbiased investigation of the underlying causes , especially as evidence suggests that a high proportion of those suffering in the current outbreak were in fact fully immunised .
suse , london i 'm a student at sussex university , and there seems to be an extremely high number of people coming down with mumps on campus - while i was waiting 30 minutes for an appointment there were three people who came in with mumps .
the worse thing is that the university seems to be doing nothing about it , such as putting up posters to advise about immunization , and considering that campus is such a closed environment and there are many international students who may not have been vaccinated , this is a dangerous game to play .
clare l , brighton reading between the lines , it seems many recent and current mumps sufferers did receive two shots as children but the immunity has since worn off .
perhaps there should be a third shot for teenagers ?
lesley , edinburgh , scotland , uk my two-year-old daughter had mumps in february - diagnosis was confirmed in hospital although no explanation given as to why the mmr vaccine had failed .
my seven-year-old , who had mmr at 14 months and the pre-school booster is suffering now .
justine , buckinghamshire i am 31 and have had mumps recently .
i was told to go to the dentists for an abscess and luckily i was diagnosed before the dentist took my one and only filling out .
i count myself lucky though as it would be far more serious if i was a 31-year-old man !
tracey , london , uk my 17-year-old has just recovered from a very bad dose of mumps .
the nhs doctor said it would take three weeks to have him tested .
i went privately and got him tested immediately .
tests revealed a very high level of the virus in his blood .
i can only guess at how many other people he infected at school due to the delay .
why should this test not be made available for all if the government is so worried about an " epidemic " ?
sally , london immunisation is the single most effective medical intervention ever bekkie , london people seem to forget that immunisation is the single most effective medical intervention ever , and the second most important public health intervention after a safe water supply !
immunisations are there for a reason - to contain , eliminate or eradicate disease that would otherwise cause even greater morbidity and mortality than they do now .
by not immunising your child you are not only risking their health , but the health of tens of thousands of others .
without immunisations diseases like polio , smallpox and hib would still be endemic in the uk .
bekkie , london there seems to be a great misunderstanding of the purpose of a vaccine .
it is not to prevent one from catching an infectious disease , but rather to lessen the effect if one does catch it .
my grandmother was a fever nurse before the war - in the days where children died from such childhood diseases .
today , with adequate vaccinations your child is likely only to be poorly for a few days - that means the vaccination worked !
nicola , berkshire both my children have suffered mumps recently having had only one dose of the mmr vaccine as infants .
it has been known for some time that two doses were required - so why were n't they recalled and given the opportunity to have the booster .
i am tired of hearing in the media that the epidemic is due to people not taking up the mmr vaccine , in mine , and many other cases , we were unaware that our children were at risk .
mrs l jackson , selby , north yorkshire i 'll never believe the so-called experts of our traditional western medical system .
if you have a strong immune system your body can fight off all viruses .
once our medical experts promote the truths about how our body works , then the public can reap the rewards .
there is much evidence these so called beneficial shots cause more damage than good .
why do so many babies die from crib death shortly after receiving these shots ?

i encourage all to investigate other treatments than go down the line of believing everything they are told by the system !
gregory langen , chesterfield i believe all children should be immunised and parents should have the right to choose either single jabs or the triple mmr .
my husband and i after careful consideration choose to have the single jabs for my son .
we have been waiting for over 18 months for the mumps vaccination .
the reason given is that the government have reduced the amount of single dose mumps vaccines that can be imported to the uk !
karen jones , cheshire vaccinations are to lessen the chance of catching a disease they are not 100 % effective but then what medication is ?
people do not realise the severity of these illnesses due to the fact that there has been widespread immunisation in the past , the complications of measles and mumps are horrific , why play fast and loose with your child 's health and well being ?
j. mccormick , liverpool u.k. i am quite shocked that this news report mentions nothing about the failure rate of such vaccines .
whatever one 's opinion is on vaccinations , it would appear from the feedback on this site that a great many people who have been vaccinated are still getting mumps .

i lived there in the 70s and it was great , even had medical attention , no problem .

linda , usa it 's quite clear that there is lack of informed debate in this country regarding the wider benefit of immunisation , accepting that there may be a very small risk to some individuals .
the media is at least partly to be blamed for it !
it was front page news when a gastroenterologist -lrb- not infectious disease specialist or epidemiologist -rrb- , published a small paper on the alleged link between mmr and autism .
some people may be interested to know that co-authors of this particular paper published a statement last year that they no longer believe there is link between mmr and autism .
the government and the media should take the lead in the informed debate of this important public health issue .
proponents and opponents of mmr should be invited to argue their case on live bbc and be covered in front page major newspapers .
dr l , cambridge , england people seem to be under the misapprehension that it individuals who have not been vaccinated against mumps who are being affected .
this is simply not true .
all my children had all their vaccination as and when they should have .
my 17 year old son is just recovering from mumps .
is this vaccination really that successful ?
linda , york i have recently been refused the mmr no1 and booster , at 37 , because the gp ' does n't get paid for it , ' despite my occupation as practice nurse in a university , where we currently have an outbreak of mumps and me dealing first line with those affected and therefore being at high risk .
anne , bradford my 18-year-old daughter has just had mumps , despite being fully vaccinated as a child -lrb- the mmr plus the booster -rrb- .
i wonder if the health protection agency is monitoring the failure rate of the vaccine .
she caught it from her three-year-old brother , who was on the interminable waiting list for the single mumps vaccine .
we opted for single vaccines rather than the mmr but had no idea that due to the shortage of mumps vaccine imports he would have to wait two years - in the event we got a letter asking him to book mumps vaccination the day after he came down with the disease .
the shortage of the single mumps vaccine is a big contributor to the current mumps epidemic , i 'm sure .
wendy , isle of wight , england the uptake of mmr in this country is embarrassing , we are on a level with many less economically developed countries simply because of media hype .
we have the facilities to keep up a 90 % vaccination rate so we should be doing so ?

the provision of public goods can not be contingent on upon individual consent .

she returned to college on monday and has been sitting her art exam all this week .
mary saviile , middlesbrough , england mr blair now says he will listen to the people , therefore now is the time to offer individual vaccines to parents who do n't want to risk possible harm to their children from the mmr jab .

mick , spalding , lincolnshire being sure that mumps was a notifiable disease i took my case to my doctor , who to my great surprise said , " i think you probably do have mumps , but by the time any test results come back , you will be over it .
just go home and rest " if this is at all common , we can assume the epidemic is much more widespread than the official figures suggest .
carl , london i am a gp - we have been told by the immunisation team , department of health - there is a shortage of mmr vaccines in the country and that we are unable to give these to teenagers - we are only allowed to immunise children at 13 months and at 5 years at the moment !
obviously patricia hewitt needs to found out more about her department dr s , leeds perhaps many of those burying their heads over mmr should finally accept the views of the experts instead of the sensationalism of the media .

it is arrogance to assume they are feeding misinformation on this matter simon p , scarborough , n yorks it 's rife throughout the student population of manchester rob s , manchester it 's rife throughout the student population of manchester - i have just had a mild dose , thanks to having the first of the mmr vaccines but not the second .
i was totally unaware of the need for two doses until it was too late .
rob s , manchester today is friday and i went to the doctors on monday who informed me i have mumps , i 'm awaiting the test which comes in the post , surely this test can be done at the doctors , as this adds extra time on getting the results , and as a student i have exams in less than two weeks .
also i had the vaccination as a child so therefore i should not have caught it !
sarah logan , london , uk i had mumps last july when i was 22 , i caught it off my 19 year old brother who is a student in york .
i can honestly say that it was horrific .
the pain caused from the swelling was unbearable , i was unable to move my head up or down nor from side to side and it felt as though my head was going to explode .
my face stayed swollen for a good while after the pain had gone .
i found it quite depressing because i did n't want to be seen by anyone as the swelling was so disfiguring .
i would never put my children at the risk of getting mumps and personally find the number of children who are not getting vaccinated very alarming .
kat , manchester i was given the mmr jab as a child but it did n't stop me catching mumps .
not all immunisations work .
helen , cheshire most of my friends and i had mumps when we were in primary school -lrb- late 1980 's -rrb- .
to us , it was just another illness that we expected to catch along with chicken pox .
sd , cheshire , uk my son is 3 and a half yrs old , and due to family health concerns we opted for him to have separate vaccines .
this option is not available on the nhs and so we have had to have them done privately .
he has still not had the mumps vaccine due to import restrictions placed by the government .
i would gladly pay my gp to administer the vaccines separately , as i realise that three visits place an extra burden on the surgery .
i understand that the option to have separate vaccines on the nhs was available in the past , but this option was taken away .
hazel s , kent the protection for my age group seems well established in this area .
i received the vaccine in the final year of sixth form when i was 18 , and when i got to university in september , the mmr ii vaccine was available for anyone who was n't protected .
sam e , nottingham university , nottingham one of our children has had mumps this year and several of their friends have .
as far as i am aware all had the mmr jab but , crucially , none had the booster jab that is now administered .
the government appear to have been dragging their feet since last year both in recognising this and in offering community wide booster vaccination .
nick rowson , wotton-under-edge , glos people need to realise that vaccination is important and has wider implications for society hannah c , oxford i go to university at oxford where we have had many cases of mumps in the last year - lots of my friends got it , i was lucky enough to see the doctor before i came into contact with them .
i think to suggest that the epidemic is " convenient " is ridiculous , it happened because certain ages ranges missed out the vaccine , and the falling levels of uptake in young children .
people need to realise that vaccination is important and has wider implications for society -lrb- rather than it just affecting your child -rrb- .
the media also has to be responsible and not try to sell scare stories - the mmr / autism link was based on a study of 12 people , anyone in science knows that an investigation of that size is not statistically valid .
hannah c , oxford my brother has just caught mumps , and he was born in 1991 and has had the mmr .
the doctor has said that there is a particularly virulent strain which you can get even if you have had the jab and is appearing in many major cities in the south .
poppy quinn , london i 'm in my mid-twenties and have just recovered from a mild version of the mumps .
i did not believe i could be affected due to my age but to say the last two weeks have been unpleasant would be understatement .
jamie , wrexham well i am still recovering from the mumps and i did have the injection when i was younger .
i am outraged as it has caused so much pain - i have never felt so bad in my life !
laura pollard , folkestone , kent there would be more children vaccinated if the mumps vaccine was given as a single dose and at a later age - say just before starting school .
alan challoner , bodelwyddan , wales i 'm not concerned , unlike the people who did not vaccinate their children , mine where .
it will be interesting to see the figures for autism to see whether or not the number of cases has continued with the trend or gone down .
my money is on the former .
jim , milton keynes " the department of health has alerted gps to the risk posed by mumps to young adults and recommends that every effort should be made to ensure that all children are fully immunised . "
how patronising can they be ?
i 'm sure gps , with their years of medical training , are far more aware of the risks than non-medically based bureaucrats .
henry , durham , uk .
i 'm in bed with mumps now .
i 'm 35 years old .
louise , hartlepool , uk my teenagers were due for the booster last year , but could n't take the first appointment due to illness , this was re-scheduled , but then cancelled due to a shortage of vaccine .
i have just got off the phone to my gp surgery , they advise that there is still no vaccine .
how are parents supposed to ensure that their children are protected if there 's no vaccine , and no prospect of getting any ?
claire , uk this is an appalling indictment of the media 's poorly informed reporting of claims by mavericks .
one can only hope that newspapers , and other media outlets , acknowledge how they have contributed to this public health problem .
anthony , birmingham , uk my son -lrb- aged 17 -rrb- had a recent gp appointment for mmr vaccination .
however , when he arrived for his appointment he was told that because of a department of health directive which had been received that day , informing of a national shortage of the vaccine , he would be contacted with a new appointment when vaccine became available .
so far there has been no further contact from the surgery .
if there is indeed a shortage of vaccine what is being done to resolve it ?
norman wilson , witham , england your report suggests that only people who have not been vaccinated are getting mumps .
my youngest -lrb- 2 years 7 months -rrb- is just at the tail end of a case , and he had his mmr at the correct time .
it 's highly likely that he suffered less than he would have done without , but vaccines are n't a guarantee that you wo n't get it at all .
however , due to his age , he has only had the one dose , so maybe that made a difference .
tracey , eastleigh what a convenient epidemic !
why did n't it happen last year , or the year before , or the year before that , to teenagers born before 1988 ? is this another attempt to restore faith in the mmr vaccine before the launch of the quadruple vaccine ?
and yet again , the many thousands of susceptible children that had their lives ruined by the effects of mmr are completely ignored .
julie loch , cardiff wales .
julie : this ' epidemic ' started at the end of last year in a number of universities .
it seems to have started at the university games held in spain , and then spread amongst students , who would n't have had the mmr .
i like a good conspiracy story / government spin bashing as much as the next punter , but this one seems to be innocent reporting of the truth .
isobel , oxford this was predicted .
i hope those parents who thought they knew more than the medical profession when it came to immunisation are now eating their ill-informed words .
get your kids immunised !
jo , uk my husband -lrb- 37 -rrb- recently asked for mumps immunisation when a colleague came down with the illness .
he was refused by our gp as he was deemed by the nhs to be not at sufficiently high risk .
our two children have both had their mmr jab , and i had the mumps as a child , but my husband remains at risk unless we go private .

cases in england and wales soared by 12,000 to 16,436 in 2004 , they say .
most of those who have caught the virus are aged 19 to 23 , but cases are also cropping up in vulnerable children , two british medical journal papers show .
cases are being seen in people born before mmr became routine in 1988 and children who have not been vaccinated , possibly due to vaccine safety fears .
every effort should be made to ensure that all children are fully immunised even if they are older than the recommended age range a spokeswoman from the department of health ' my testicle swelled up ' medical notes : mumps the bmj findings corroborate recent reports of rising mumps rates across england , wales and ireland .
in the first paper , investigators at the health protection agency report that in 2004 , the number of cases of mumps recorded in england and wales hit 16,436 , up from 4,204 in 2003 .
and in the first month of 2005 , there were nearly 5,000 cases .
most were among young adults born before 1988 and who would , therefore , not have been offered mmr as a child .
in the second paper , dr ravindra gupta , from london 's guy 's and st thomas ' , working with colleagues from king 's college london , found cases have also occurring in very young children who would have been eligible for the mmr - measles , mumps and rubella - vaccine .
the world health organization recommends that at least 90 % of all those eligible receive the vaccine .
however , dr gupta 's group said uptake of mmr among two-year-olds in the uk fell from around 92 % in early 1995 to around 80 % in 2003/4 .
mumps a viral infection of the saliva-producing glands found either side of the face spread by coughs and sneezes symptoms develop 14 to 24 days after exposure begins with fever , shivers , tiredness and painful swelling of parotid glands can rarely cause serious complications " in some areas of london , as few as 60 % of two-year-olds had received a first dose of mmr .
" this would account for our recent experience with mumps in younger children , " they said .
health secretary patricia hewitt said the rapid rise in cases of mumps " is a very real worry " .
speaking on bbc 's breakfast programme , she said : " the most important thing for parents and for young adults who did n't get a vaccination at the normal age , is go to the gp , go to the surgery and get the vaccination done now . "
a spokeswoman for the department of health said : " the department of health has alerted gps to the risk posed by mumps to young adults and recommends that every effort should be made to ensure that all children are fully immunised even if they are older than the recommended age range .
" some higher education establishments have been offering special mmr sessions to protect these young people against mumps .
" the department supplies vaccine and leaflets for these sessions .
in order to limit the spread of mumps in the uk , we recommend that all at-risk school leavers and other young adults who have not received mmr or only received one dose , should ensure that they take up the offer of mmr vaccination . "
your comments why all the fear and loathing over what is essentially a mild childhood illness suse , london why all the fear and loathing over what is essentially a mild childhood illness , involving a bit of discomfort - and boosting the immune system in the process .
when an adult gets mumps , it can be more unpleasant and more serious , but even the much-vaunted danger of mumps-induced infertility among males is much less of a risk than usually assumed .
what 's all the fuss ?
and as has been pointed out in another e-mail : previous years have not seen epidemics of young adults suffering - it would be very useful to allow an unbiased investigation of the underlying causes , especially as evidence suggests that a high proportion of those suffering in the current outbreak were in fact fully immunised .
suse , london i 'm a student at sussex university , and there seems to be an extremely high number of people coming down with mumps on campus - while i was waiting 30 minutes for an appointment there were three people who came in with mumps .
the worse thing is that the university seems to be doing nothing about it , such as putting up posters to advise about immunization , and considering that campus is such a closed environment and there are many international students who may not have been vaccinated , this is a dangerous game to play .
clare l , brighton reading between the lines , it seems many recent and current mumps sufferers did receive two shots as children but the immunity has since worn off .
perhaps there should be a third shot for teenagers ?
lesley , edinburgh , scotland , uk my two-year-old daughter had mumps in february - diagnosis was confirmed in hospital although no explanation given as to why the mmr vaccine had failed .
my seven-year-old , who had mmr at 14 months and the pre-school booster is suffering now .
justine , buckinghamshire i am 31 and have had mumps recently .
i was told to go to the dentists for an abscess and luckily i was diagnosed before the dentist took my one and only filling out .
i count myself lucky though as it would be far more serious if i was a 31-year-old man !
tracey , london , uk my 17-year-old has just recovered from a very bad dose of mumps .
the nhs doctor said it would take three weeks to have him tested .
i went privately and got him tested immediately .
tests revealed a very high level of the virus in his blood .
i can only guess at how many other people he infected at school due to the delay .
why should this test not be made available for all if the government is so worried about an " epidemic " ?
sally , london immunisation is the single most effective medical intervention ever bekkie , london people seem to forget that immunisation is the single most effective medical intervention ever , and the second most important public health intervention after a safe water supply !
immunisations are there for a reason - to contain , eliminate or eradicate disease that would otherwise cause even greater morbidity and mortality than they do now .
by not immunising your child you are not only risking their health , but the health of tens of thousands of others .
without immunisations diseases like polio , smallpox and hib would still be endemic in the uk .
bekkie , london there seems to be a great misunderstanding of the purpose of a vaccine .
it is not to prevent one from catching an infectious disease , but rather to lessen the effect if one does catch it .
my grandmother was a fever nurse before the war - in the days where children died from such childhood diseases .
today , with adequate vaccinations your child is likely only to be poorly for a few days - that means the vaccination worked !
nicola , berkshire both my children have suffered mumps recently having had only one dose of the mmr vaccine as infants .
it has been known for some time that two doses were required - so why were n't they recalled and given the opportunity to have the booster .
i am tired of hearing in the media that the epidemic is due to people not taking up the mmr vaccine , in mine , and many other cases , we were unaware that our children were at risk .
mrs l jackson , selby , north yorkshire i 'll never believe the so-called experts of our traditional western medical system .
if you have a strong immune system your body can fight off all viruses .
once our medical experts promote the truths about how our body works , then the public can reap the rewards .
there is much evidence these so called beneficial shots cause more damage than good .
why do so many babies die from crib death shortly after receiving these shots ?
this is only one example .
i encourage all to investigate other treatments than go down the line of believing everything they are told by the system !
gregory langen , chesterfield i believe all children should be immunised and parents should have the right to choose either single jabs or the triple mmr .

cases in england and wales soared by 12,000 to 16,436 in 2004 , they say .
most of those who have caught the virus are aged 19 to 23 , but cases are also cropping up in vulnerable children , two british medical journal papers show .
cases are being seen in people born before mmr became routine in 1988 and children who have not been vaccinated , possibly due to vaccine safety fears .
every effort should be made to ensure that all children are fully immunised even if they are older than the recommended age range a spokeswoman from the department of health ' my testicle swelled up ' medical notes : mumps the bmj findings corroborate recent reports of rising mumps rates across england , wales and ireland .
in the first paper , investigators at the health protection agency report that in 2004 , the number of cases of mumps recorded in england and wales hit 16,436 , up from 4,204 in 2003 .
and in the first month of 2005 , there were nearly 5,000 cases .
most were among young adults born before 1988 and who would , therefore , not have been offered mmr as a child .
in the second paper , dr ravindra gupta , from london 's guy 's and st thomas ' , working with colleagues from king 's college london , found cases have also occurring in very young children who would have been eligible for the mmr - measles , mumps and rubella - vaccine .
the world health organization recommends that at least 90 % of all those eligible receive the vaccine .
however , dr gupta 's group said uptake of mmr among two-year-olds in the uk fell from around 92 % in early 1995 to around 80 % in 2003/4 .
mumps a viral infection of the saliva-producing glands found either side of the face spread by coughs and sneezes symptoms develop 14 to 24 days after exposure begins with fever , shivers , tiredness and painful swelling of parotid glands can rarely cause serious complications " in some areas of london , as few as 60 % of two-year-olds had received a first dose of mmr .
" this would account for our recent experience with mumps in younger children , " they said .
health secretary patricia hewitt said the rapid rise in cases of mumps " is a very real worry " .
speaking on bbc 's breakfast programme , she said : " the most important thing for parents and for young adults who did n't get a vaccination at the normal age , is go to the gp , go to the surgery and get the vaccination done now . "
a spokeswoman for the department of health said : " the department of health has alerted gps to the risk posed by mumps to young adults and recommends that every effort should be made to ensure that all children are fully immunised even if they are older than the recommended age range .
" some higher education establishments have been offering special mmr sessions to protect these young people against mumps .
" the department supplies vaccine and leaflets for these sessions .
in order to limit the spread of mumps in the uk , we recommend that all at-risk school leavers and other young adults who have not received mmr or only received one dose , should ensure that they take up the offer of mmr vaccination . "
your comments why all the fear and loathing over what is essentially a mild childhood illness suse , london why all the fear and loathing over what is essentially a mild childhood illness , involving a bit of discomfort - and boosting the immune system in the process .
when an adult gets mumps , it can be more unpleasant and more serious , but even the much-vaunted danger of mumps-induced infertility among males is much less of a risk than usually assumed .
what 's all the fuss ?
and as has been pointed out in another e-mail : previous years have not seen epidemics of young adults suffering - it would be very useful to allow an unbiased investigation of the underlying causes , especially as evidence suggests that a high proportion of those suffering in the current outbreak were in fact fully immunised .
suse , london i 'm a student at sussex university , and there seems to be an extremely high number of people coming down with mumps on campus - while i was waiting 30 minutes for an appointment there were three people who came in with mumps .
the worse thing is that the university seems to be doing nothing about it , such as putting up posters to advise about immunization , and considering that campus is such a closed environment and there are many international students who may not have been vaccinated , this is a dangerous game to play .
clare l , brighton reading between the lines , it seems many recent and current mumps sufferers did receive two shots as children but the immunity has since worn off .
perhaps there should be a third shot for teenagers ?
lesley , edinburgh , scotland , uk my two-year-old daughter had mumps in february - diagnosis was confirmed in hospital although no explanation given as to why the mmr vaccine had failed .
my seven-year-old , who had mmr at 14 months and the pre-school booster is suffering now .
justine , buckinghamshire i am 31 and have had mumps recently .
i was told to go to the dentists for an abscess and luckily i was diagnosed before the dentist took my one and only filling out .
i count myself lucky though as it would be far more serious if i was a 31-year-old man !
tracey , london , uk my 17-year-old has just recovered from a very bad dose of mumps .
the nhs doctor said it would take three weeks to have him tested .
i went privately and got him tested immediately .
tests revealed a very high level of the virus in his blood .
i can only guess at how many other people he infected at school due to the delay .
why should this test not be made available for all if the government is so worried about an " epidemic " ?
sally , london immunisation is the single most effective medical intervention ever bekkie , london people seem to forget that immunisation is the single most effective medical intervention ever , and the second most important public health intervention after a safe water supply !
immunisations are there for a reason - to contain , eliminate or eradicate disease that would otherwise cause even greater morbidity and mortality than they do now .
by not immunising your child you are not only risking their health , but the health of tens of thousands of others .
without immunisations diseases like polio , smallpox and hib would still be endemic in the uk .
bekkie , london there seems to be a great misunderstanding of the purpose of a vaccine .
it is not to prevent one from catching an infectious disease , but rather to lessen the effect if one does catch it .
my grandmother was a fever nurse before the war - in the days where children died from such childhood diseases .
today , with adequate vaccinations your child is likely only to be poorly for a few days - that means the vaccination worked !
nicola , berkshire both my children have suffered mumps recently having had only one dose of the mmr vaccine as infants .
it has been known for some time that two doses were required - so why were n't they recalled and given the opportunity to have the booster .
i am tired of hearing in the media that the epidemic is due to people not taking up the mmr vaccine , in mine , and many other cases , we were unaware that our children were at risk .
mrs l jackson , selby , north yorkshire i 'll never believe the so-called experts of our traditional western medical system .
if you have a strong immune system your body can fight off all viruses .
once our medical experts promote the truths about how our body works , then the public can reap the rewards .
there is much evidence these so called beneficial shots cause more damage than good .
why do so many babies die from crib death shortly after receiving these shots ?
this is only one example .
i encourage all to investigate other treatments than go down the line of believing everything they are told by the system !
gregory langen , chesterfield i believe all children should be immunised and parents should have the right to choose either single jabs or the triple mmr .
my husband and i after careful consideration choose to have the single jabs for my son .
we have been waiting for over 18 months for the mumps vaccination .
the reason given is that the government have reduced the amount of single dose mumps vaccines that can be imported to the uk !
karen jones , cheshire vaccinations are to lessen the chance of catching a disease they are not 100 % effective but then what medication is ?
people do not realise the severity of these illnesses due to the fact that there has been widespread immunisation in the past , the complications of measles and mumps are horrific , why play fast and loose with your child 's health and well being ?
j. mccormick , liverpool u.k. i am quite shocked that this news report mentions nothing about the failure rate of such vaccines .
whatever one 's opinion is on vaccinations , it would appear from the feedback on this site that a great many people who have been vaccinated are still getting mumps .
naomi , cambridge , england here in the us all children have to be immunized before they can attend school at 5 , or they do n't go linda , usa i am very surprised at the uk , it does sound like a third world country of late .
i lived there in the 70s and it was great , even had medical attention , no problem .
here in the us all children have to be immunized before they can attend school at 5 , or they do n't go !
i think that 's the way to do it , we hardly ever hear of mumps or other illnesses anymore .
linda , usa it 's quite clear that there is lack of informed debate in this country regarding the wider benefit of immunisation , accepting that there may be a very small risk to some individuals .
the media is at least partly to be blamed for it !
it was front page news when a gastroenterologist -lrb- not infectious disease specialist or epidemiologist -rrb- , published a small paper on the alleged link between mmr and autism .
some people may be interested to know that co-authors of this particular paper published a statement last year that they no longer believe there is link between mmr and autism .
the government and the media should take the lead in the informed debate of this important public health issue .
proponents and opponents of mmr should be invited to argue their case on live bbc and be covered in front page major newspapers .
dr l , cambridge , england people seem to be under the misapprehension that it individuals who have not been vaccinated against mumps who are being affected .
this is simply not true .
all my children had all their vaccination as and when they should have .
my 17 year old son is just recovering from mumps .
is this vaccination really that successful ?
linda , york i have recently been refused the mmr no1 and booster , at 37 , because the gp ' does n't get paid for it , ' despite my occupation as practice nurse in a university , where we currently have an outbreak of mumps and me dealing first line with those affected and therefore being at high risk .
anne , bradford my 18-year-old daughter has just had mumps , despite being fully vaccinated as a child -lrb- the mmr plus the booster -rrb- .
i wonder if the health protection agency is monitoring the failure rate of the vaccine .
she caught it from her three-year-old brother , who was on the interminable waiting list for the single mumps vaccine .
we opted for single vaccines rather than the mmr but had no idea that due to the shortage of mumps vaccine imports he would have to wait two years - in the event we got a letter asking him to book mumps vaccination the day after he came down with the disease .
the shortage of the single mumps vaccine is a big contributor to the current mumps epidemic , i 'm sure .
wendy , isle of wight , england the uptake of mmr in this country is embarrassing , we are on a level with many less economically developed countries simply because of media hype .
we have the facilities to keep up a 90 % vaccination rate so we should be doing so ?
these outbreaks should not be a surprise , and if current low level of mmr uptake persists we 're also risking the possible re-establishment of endemic measles .
the provision of public goods can not be contingent on upon individual consent .
rachael , uk i have had the mmr and a booster , yet i still had mumps last november lindsey , cambridge i was born in 1986 , and i have had the mmr and a booster , yet i still had mumps last november , along with many other students at my university who had also had the mmr , so it seems even those who have been vaccinated are at risk .
lindsey , cambridge are all the parents that refused to have their children immunised after unfounded reports going to blame everyone else when their kids go down with mumps ?
well , what do you know ?
i told you so .
ng , brighton , uk my 18 year old daughter has just recovered from mumps , she was born in 1986 and had the mmr vaccine in 1990 .
she is a full time student at 6th form and missed her art a level last week due to the illness .
she returned to college on monday and has been sitting her art exam all this week .
mary saviile , middlesbrough , england mr blair now says he will listen to the people , therefore now is the time to offer individual vaccines to parents who do n't want to risk possible harm to their children from the mmr jab .
after the bse fiasco i 'm afraid politicians do not reassure me about mmr .
mick , spalding , lincolnshire being sure that mumps was a notifiable disease i took my case to my doctor , who to my great surprise said , " i think you probably do have mumps , but by the time any test results come back , you will be over it .
just go home and rest " if this is at all common , we can assume the epidemic is much more widespread than the official figures suggest .
carl , london i am a gp - we have been told by the immunisation team , department of health - there is a shortage of mmr vaccines in the country and that we are unable to give these to teenagers - we are only allowed to immunise children at 13 months and at 5 years at the moment !
obviously patricia hewitt needs to found out more about her department dr s , leeds perhaps many of those burying their heads over mmr should finally accept the views of the experts instead of the sensationalism of the media .
the who is one of the most trusted bodies on the planet .
it is arrogance to assume they are feeding misinformation on this matter simon p , scarborough , n yorks it 's rife throughout the student population of manchester rob s , manchester it 's rife throughout the student population of manchester - i have just had a mild dose , thanks to having the first of the mmr vaccines but not the second .
i was totally unaware of the need for two doses until it was too late .
rob s , manchester today is friday and i went to the doctors on monday who informed me i have mumps , i 'm awaiting the test which comes in the post , surely this test can be done at the doctors , as this adds extra time on getting the results , and as a student i have exams in less than two weeks .
also i had the vaccination as a child so therefore i should not have caught it !
sarah logan , london , uk i had mumps last july when i was 22 , i caught it off my 19 year old brother who is a student in york .
i can honestly say that it was horrific .
the pain caused from the swelling was unbearable , i was unable to move my head up or down nor from side to side and it felt as though my head was going to explode .
my face stayed swollen for a good while after the pain had gone .
i found it quite depressing because i did n't want to be seen by anyone as the swelling was so disfiguring .
i would never put my children at the risk of getting mumps and personally find the number of children who are not getting vaccinated very alarming .
kat , manchester i was given the mmr jab as a child but it did n't stop me catching mumps .
not all immunisations work .
helen , cheshire most of my friends and i had mumps when we were in primary school -lrb- late 1980 's -rrb- .
to us , it was just another illness that we expected to catch along with chicken pox .
sd , cheshire , uk my son is 3 and a half yrs old , and due to family health concerns we opted for him to have separate vaccines .
this option is not available on the nhs and so we have had to have them done privately .
he has still not had the mumps vaccine due to import restrictions placed by the government .
i would gladly pay my gp to administer the vaccines separately , as i realise that three visits place an extra burden on the surgery .
i understand that the option to have separate vaccines on the nhs was available in the past , but this option was taken away .
hazel s , kent the protection for my age group seems well established in this area .
i received the vaccine in the final year of sixth form when i was 18 , and when i got to university in september , the mmr ii vaccine was available for anyone who was n't protected .
sam e , nottingham university , nottingham one of our children has had mumps this year and several of their friends have .
as far as i am aware all had the mmr jab but , crucially , none had the booster jab that is now administered .
the government appear to have been dragging their feet since last year both in recognising this and in offering community wide booster vaccination .
nick rowson , wotton-under-edge , glos people need to realise that vaccination is important and has wider implications for society hannah c , oxford i go to university at oxford where we have had many cases of mumps in the last year - lots of my friends got it , i was lucky enough to see the doctor before i came into contact with them .

mumps a viral infection of the saliva-producing glands found either side of the face spread by coughs and sneezes symptoms develop 14 to 24 days after exposure begins with fever , shivers , tiredness and painful swelling of parotid glands can rarely cause serious complications " in some areas of london , as few as 60 % of two-year-olds had received a first dose of mmr .
" this would account for our recent experience with mumps in younger children , " they said .
health secretary patricia hewitt said the rapid rise in cases of mumps " is a very real worry " .
speaking on bbc 's breakfast programme , she said : " the most important thing for parents and for young adults who did n't get a vaccination at the normal age , is go to the gp , go to the surgery and get the vaccination done now . "
a spokeswoman for the department of health said : " the department of health has alerted gps to the risk posed by mumps to young adults and recommends that every effort should be made to ensure that all children are fully immunised even if they are older than the recommended age range .

in order to limit the spread of mumps in the uk , we recommend that all at-risk school leavers and other young adults who have not received mmr or only received one dose , should ensure that they take up the offer of mmr vaccination . "
your comments why all the fear and loathing over what is essentially a mild childhood illness suse , london why all the fear and loathing over what is essentially a mild childhood illness , involving a bit of discomfort - and boosting the immune system in the process .
when an adult gets mumps , it can be more unpleasant and more serious , but even the much-vaunted danger of mumps-induced infertility among males is much less of a risk than usually assumed .
what 's all the fuss ?
and as has been pointed out in another e-mail : previous years have not seen epidemics of young adults suffering - it would be very useful to allow an unbiased investigation of the underlying causes , especially as evidence suggests that a high proportion of those suffering in the current outbreak were in fact fully immunised .
suse , london i 'm a student at sussex university , and there seems to be an extremely high number of people coming down with mumps on campus - while i was waiting 30 minutes for an appointment there were three people who came in with mumps .
the worse thing is that the university seems to be doing nothing about it , such as putting up posters to advise about immunization , and considering that campus is such a closed environment and there are many international students who may not have been vaccinated , this is a dangerous game to play .
clare l , brighton reading between the lines , it seems many recent and current mumps sufferers did receive two shots as children but the immunity has since worn off .
perhaps there should be a third shot for teenagers ?
lesley , edinburgh , scotland , uk my two-year-old daughter had mumps in february - diagnosis was confirmed in hospital although no explanation given as to why the mmr vaccine had failed .
my seven-year-old , who had mmr at 14 months and the pre-school booster is suffering now .
justine , buckinghamshire i am 31 and have had mumps recently .
i was told to go to the dentists for an abscess and luckily i was diagnosed before the dentist took my one and only filling out .
i count myself lucky though as it would be far more serious if i was a 31-year-old man !
tracey , london , uk my 17-year-old has just recovered from a very bad dose of mumps .
the nhs doctor said it would take three weeks to have him tested .
i went privately and got him tested immediately .
tests revealed a very high level of the virus in his blood .
i can only guess at how many other people he infected at school due to the delay .
why should this test not be made available for all if the government is so worried about an " epidemic " ?
sally , london immunisation is the single most effective medical intervention ever bekkie , london people seem to forget that immunisation is the single most effective medical intervention ever , and the second most important public health intervention after a safe water supply !
immunisations are there for a reason - to contain , eliminate or eradicate disease that would otherwise cause even greater morbidity and mortality than they do now .
by not immunising your child you are not only risking their health , but the health of tens of thousands of others .
without immunisations diseases like polio , smallpox and hib would still be endemic in the uk .
bekkie , london there seems to be a great misunderstanding of the purpose of a vaccine .
it is not to prevent one from catching an infectious disease , but rather to lessen the effect if one does catch it .
my grandmother was a fever nurse before the war - in the days where children died from such childhood diseases .
today , with adequate vaccinations your child is likely only to be poorly for a few days - that means the vaccination worked !
nicola , berkshire both my children have suffered mumps recently having had only one dose of the mmr vaccine as infants .
it has been known for some time that two doses were required - so why were n't they recalled and given the opportunity to have the booster .
i am tired of hearing in the media that the epidemic is due to people not taking up the mmr vaccine , in mine , and many other cases , we were unaware that our children were at risk .
mrs l jackson , selby , north yorkshire i 'll never believe the so-called experts of our traditional western medical system .
if you have a strong immune system your body can fight off all viruses .
once our medical experts promote the truths about how our body works , then the public can reap the rewards .
there is much evidence these so called beneficial shots cause more damage than good .
why do so many babies die from crib death shortly after receiving these shots ?
this is only one example .
i encourage all to investigate other treatments than go down the line of believing everything they are told by the system !
gregory langen , chesterfield i believe all children should be immunised and parents should have the right to choose either single jabs or the triple mmr .
my husband and i after careful consideration choose to have the single jabs for my son .
we have been waiting for over 18 months for the mumps vaccination .
the reason given is that the government have reduced the amount of single dose mumps vaccines that can be imported to the uk !
karen jones , cheshire vaccinations are to lessen the chance of catching a disease they are not 100 % effective but then what medication is ?
people do not realise the severity of these illnesses due to the fact that there has been widespread immunisation in the past , the complications of measles and mumps are horrific , why play fast and loose with your child 's health and well being ?
j. mccormick , liverpool u.k. i am quite shocked that this news report mentions nothing about the failure rate of such vaccines .
whatever one 's opinion is on vaccinations , it would appear from the feedback on this site that a great many people who have been vaccinated are still getting mumps .
naomi , cambridge , england here in the us all children have to be immunized before they can attend school at 5 , or they do n't go linda , usa i am very surprised at the uk , it does sound like a third world country of late .
i lived there in the 70s and it was great , even had medical attention , no problem .
here in the us all children have to be immunized before they can attend school at 5 , or they do n't go !
i think that 's the way to do it , we hardly ever hear of mumps or other illnesses anymore .
linda , usa it 's quite clear that there is lack of informed debate in this country regarding the wider benefit of immunisation , accepting that there may be a very small risk to some individuals .
the media is at least partly to be blamed for it !
it was front page news when a gastroenterologist -lrb- not infectious disease specialist or epidemiologist -rrb- , published a small paper on the alleged link between mmr and autism .
some people may be interested to know that co-authors of this particular paper published a statement last year that they no longer believe there is link between mmr and autism .
the government and the media should take the lead in the informed debate of this important public health issue .
proponents and opponents of mmr should be invited to argue their case on live bbc and be covered in front page major newspapers .
dr l , cambridge , england people seem to be under the misapprehension that it individuals who have not been vaccinated against mumps who are being affected .
this is simply not true .
all my children had all their vaccination as and when they should have .
my 17 year old son is just recovering from mumps .
is this vaccination really that successful ?
linda , york i have recently been refused the mmr no1 and booster , at 37 , because the gp ' does n't get paid for it , ' despite my occupation as practice nurse in a university , where we currently have an outbreak of mumps and me dealing first line with those affected and therefore being at high risk .
anne , bradford my 18-year-old daughter has just had mumps , despite being fully vaccinated as a child -lrb- the mmr plus the booster -rrb- .
i wonder if the health protection agency is monitoring the failure rate of the vaccine .
she caught it from her three-year-old brother , who was on the interminable waiting list for the single mumps vaccine .
we opted for single vaccines rather than the mmr but had no idea that due to the shortage of mumps vaccine imports he would have to wait two years - in the event we got a letter asking him to book mumps vaccination the day after he came down with the disease .
the shortage of the single mumps vaccine is a big contributor to the current mumps epidemic , i 'm sure .
wendy , isle of wight , england the uptake of mmr in this country is embarrassing , we are on a level with many less economically developed countries simply because of media hype .
we have the facilities to keep up a 90 % vaccination rate so we should be doing so ?
these outbreaks should not be a surprise , and if current low level of mmr uptake persists we 're also risking the possible re-establishment of endemic measles .
the provision of public goods can not be contingent on upon individual consent .
rachael , uk i have had the mmr and a booster , yet i still had mumps last november lindsey , cambridge i was born in 1986 , and i have had the mmr and a booster , yet i still had mumps last november , along with many other students at my university who had also had the mmr , so it seems even those who have been vaccinated are at risk .
lindsey , cambridge are all the parents that refused to have their children immunised after unfounded reports going to blame everyone else when their kids go down with mumps ?
well , what do you know ?
i told you so .
ng , brighton , uk my 18 year old daughter has just recovered from mumps , she was born in 1986 and had the mmr vaccine in 1990 .
she is a full time student at 6th form and missed her art a level last week due to the illness .
she returned to college on monday and has been sitting her art exam all this week .
mary saviile , middlesbrough , england mr blair now says he will listen to the people , therefore now is the time to offer individual vaccines to parents who do n't want to risk possible harm to their children from the mmr jab .
after the bse fiasco i 'm afraid politicians do not reassure me about mmr .
mick , spalding , lincolnshire being sure that mumps was a notifiable disease i took my case to my doctor , who to my great surprise said , " i think you probably do have mumps , but by the time any test results come back , you will be over it .
just go home and rest " if this is at all common , we can assume the epidemic is much more widespread than the official figures suggest .
carl , london i am a gp - we have been told by the immunisation team , department of health - there is a shortage of mmr vaccines in the country and that we are unable to give these to teenagers - we are only allowed to immunise children at 13 months and at 5 years at the moment !
obviously patricia hewitt needs to found out more about her department dr s , leeds perhaps many of those burying their heads over mmr should finally accept the views of the experts instead of the sensationalism of the media .
the who is one of the most trusted bodies on the planet .
it is arrogance to assume they are feeding misinformation on this matter simon p , scarborough , n yorks it 's rife throughout the student population of manchester rob s , manchester it 's rife throughout the student population of manchester - i have just had a mild dose , thanks to having the first of the mmr vaccines but not the second .
i was totally unaware of the need for two doses until it was too late .
rob s , manchester today is friday and i went to the doctors on monday who informed me i have mumps , i 'm awaiting the test which comes in the post , surely this test can be done at the doctors , as this adds extra time on getting the results , and as a student i have exams in less than two weeks .
also i had the vaccination as a child so therefore i should not have caught it !
sarah logan , london , uk i had mumps last july when i was 22 , i caught it off my 19 year old brother who is a student in york .
i can honestly say that it was horrific .
the pain caused from the swelling was unbearable , i was unable to move my head up or down nor from side to side and it felt as though my head was going to explode .
my face stayed swollen for a good while after the pain had gone .
i found it quite depressing because i did n't want to be seen by anyone as the swelling was so disfiguring .
i would never put my children at the risk of getting mumps and personally find the number of children who are not getting vaccinated very alarming .
kat , manchester i was given the mmr jab as a child but it did n't stop me catching mumps .
not all immunisations work .
helen , cheshire most of my friends and i had mumps when we were in primary school -lrb- late 1980 's -rrb- .
to us , it was just another illness that we expected to catch along with chicken pox .
sd , cheshire , uk my son is 3 and a half yrs old , and due to family health concerns we opted for him to have separate vaccines .
this option is not available on the nhs and so we have had to have them done privately .
he has still not had the mumps vaccine due to import restrictions placed by the government .
i would gladly pay my gp to administer the vaccines separately , as i realise that three visits place an extra burden on the surgery .
i understand that the option to have separate vaccines on the nhs was available in the past , but this option was taken away .
hazel s , kent the protection for my age group seems well established in this area .
i received the vaccine in the final year of sixth form when i was 18 , and when i got to university in september , the mmr ii vaccine was available for anyone who was n't protected .
sam e , nottingham university , nottingham one of our children has had mumps this year and several of their friends have .
as far as i am aware all had the mmr jab but , crucially , none had the booster jab that is now administered .
the government appear to have been dragging their feet since last year both in recognising this and in offering community wide booster vaccination .
nick rowson , wotton-under-edge , glos people need to realise that vaccination is important and has wider implications for society hannah c , oxford i go to university at oxford where we have had many cases of mumps in the last year - lots of my friends got it , i was lucky enough to see the doctor before i came into contact with them .
i think to suggest that the epidemic is " convenient " is ridiculous , it happened because certain ages ranges missed out the vaccine , and the falling levels of uptake in young children .
people need to realise that vaccination is important and has wider implications for society -lrb- rather than it just affecting your child -rrb- .
the media also has to be responsible and not try to sell scare stories - the mmr / autism link was based on a study of 12 people , anyone in science knows that an investigation of that size is not statistically valid .
hannah c , oxford my brother has just caught mumps , and he was born in 1991 and has had the mmr .
the doctor has said that there is a particularly virulent strain which you can get even if you have had the jab and is appearing in many major cities in the south .
poppy quinn , london i 'm in my mid-twenties and have just recovered from a mild version of the mumps .
i did not believe i could be affected due to my age but to say the last two weeks have been unpleasant would be understatement .
jamie , wrexham well i am still recovering from the mumps and i did have the injection when i was younger .
i am outraged as it has caused so much pain - i have never felt so bad in my life !
laura pollard , folkestone , kent there would be more children vaccinated if the mumps vaccine was given as a single dose and at a later age - say just before starting school .
alan challoner , bodelwyddan , wales i 'm not concerned , unlike the people who did not vaccinate their children , mine where .
it will be interesting to see the figures for autism to see whether or not the number of cases has continued with the trend or gone down .
my money is on the former .
jim , milton keynes " the department of health has alerted gps to the risk posed by mumps to young adults and recommends that every effort should be made to ensure that all children are fully immunised . "
how patronising can they be ?
i 'm sure gps , with their years of medical training , are far more aware of the risks than non-medically based bureaucrats .
henry , durham , uk .
i 'm in bed with mumps now .
i 'm 35 years old .
louise , hartlepool , uk my teenagers were due for the booster last year , but could n't take the first appointment due to illness , this was re-scheduled , but then cancelled due to a shortage of vaccine .
i have just got off the phone to my gp surgery , they advise that there is still no vaccine .
how are parents supposed to ensure that their children are protected if there 's no vaccine , and no prospect of getting any ?
claire , uk this is an appalling indictment of the media 's poorly informed reporting of claims by mavericks .
one can only hope that newspapers , and other media outlets , acknowledge how they have contributed to this public health problem .
anthony , birmingham , uk my son -lrb- aged 17 -rrb- had a recent gp appointment for mmr vaccination .
however , when he arrived for his appointment he was told that because of a department of health directive which had been received that day , informing of a national shortage of the vaccine , he would be contacted with a new appointment when vaccine became available .
so far there has been no further contact from the surgery .
if there is indeed a shortage of vaccine what is being done to resolve it ?
norman wilson , witham , england your report suggests that only people who have not been vaccinated are getting mumps .
my youngest -lrb- 2 years 7 months -rrb- is just at the tail end of a case , and he had his mmr at the correct time .
it 's highly likely that he suffered less than he would have done without , but vaccines are n't a guarantee that you wo n't get it at all .
however , due to his age , he has only had the one dose , so maybe that made a difference .
tracey , eastleigh what a convenient epidemic !
why did n't it happen last year , or the year before , or the year before that , to teenagers born before 1988 ? is this another attempt to restore faith in the mmr vaccine before the launch of the quadruple vaccine ?
and yet again , the many thousands of susceptible children that had their lives ruined by the effects of mmr are completely ignored .
julie loch , cardiff wales .
julie : this ' epidemic ' started at the end of last year in a number of universities .
it seems to have started at the university games held in spain , and then spread amongst students , who would n't have had the mmr .
i like a good conspiracy story / government spin bashing as much as the next punter , but this one seems to be innocent reporting of the truth .
isobel , oxford this was predicted .
i hope those parents who thought they knew more than the medical profession when it came to immunisation are now eating their ill-informed words .
get your kids immunised !
jo , uk my husband -lrb- 37 -rrb- recently asked for mumps immunisation when a colleague came down with the illness .
he was refused by our gp as he was deemed by the nhs to be not at sufficiently high risk .
our two children have both had their mmr jab , and i had the mumps as a child , but my husband remains at risk unless we go private .

cases in england and wales soared by 12,000 to 16,436 in 2004 , they say .
most of those who have caught the virus are aged 19 to 23 , but cases are also cropping up in vulnerable children , two british medical journal papers show .
cases are being seen in people born before mmr became routine in 1988 and children who have not been vaccinated , possibly due to vaccine safety fears .
every effort should be made to ensure that all children are fully immunised even if they are older than the recommended age range a spokeswoman from the department of health ' my testicle swelled up ' medical notes : mumps the bmj findings corroborate recent reports of rising mumps rates across england , wales and ireland .
in the first paper , investigators at the health protection agency report that in 2004 , the number of cases of mumps recorded in england and wales hit 16,436 , up from 4,204 in 2003 .
and in the first month of 2005 , there were nearly 5,000 cases .
most were among young adults born before 1988 and who would , therefore , not have been offered mmr as a child .
in the second paper , dr ravindra gupta , from london 's guy 's and st thomas ' , working with colleagues from king 's college london , found cases have also occurring in very young children who would have been eligible for the mmr - measles , mumps and rubella - vaccine .
the world health organization recommends that at least 90 % of all those eligible receive the vaccine .
however , dr gupta 's group said uptake of mmr among two-year-olds in the uk fell from around 92 % in early 1995 to around 80 % in 2003/4 .

your comments why all the fear and loathing over what is essentially a mild childhood illness suse , london why all the fear and loathing over what is essentially a mild childhood illness , involving a bit of discomfort - and boosting the immune system in the process .

norman wilson , witham , england your report suggests that only people who have not been vaccinated are getting mumps .
my youngest -lrb- 2 years 7 months -rrb- is just at the tail end of a case , and he had his mmr at the correct time .
it 's highly likely that he suffered less than he would have done without , but vaccines are n't a guarantee that you wo n't get it at all .
however , due to his age , he has only had the one dose , so maybe that made a difference .
tracey , eastleigh what a convenient epidemic !
why did n't it happen last year , or the year before , or the year before that , to teenagers born before 1988 ? is this another attempt to restore faith in the mmr vaccine before the launch of the quadruple vaccine ?
and yet again , the many thousands of susceptible children that had their lives ruined by the effects of mmr are completely ignored .
julie loch , cardiff wales .
julie : this ' epidemic ' started at the end of last year in a number of universities .
it seems to have started at the university games held in spain , and then spread amongst students , who would n't have had the mmr .
i like a good conspiracy story / government spin bashing as much as the next punter , but this one seems to be innocent reporting of the truth .

i hope those parents who thought they knew more than the medical profession when it came to immunisation are now eating their ill-informed words .

cases in england and wales soared by 12,000 to 16,436 in 2004 , they say .
most of those who have caught the virus are aged 19 to 23 , but cases are also cropping up in vulnerable children , two british medical journal papers show .
cases are being seen in people born before mmr became routine in 1988 and children who have not been vaccinated , possibly due to vaccine safety fears .
every effort should be made to ensure that all children are fully immunised even if they are older than the recommended age range a spokeswoman from the department of health ' my testicle swelled up ' medical notes : mumps the bmj findings corroborate recent reports of rising mumps rates across england , wales and ireland .
in the first paper , investigators at the health protection agency report that in 2004 , the number of cases of mumps recorded in england and wales hit 16,436 , up from 4,204 in 2003 .
and in the first month of 2005 , there were nearly 5,000 cases .
most were among young adults born before 1988 and who would , therefore , not have been offered mmr as a child .
in the second paper , dr ravindra gupta , from london 's guy 's and st thomas ' , working with colleagues from king 's college london , found cases have also occurring in very young children who would have been eligible for the mmr - measles , mumps and rubella - vaccine .
the world health organization recommends that at least 90 % of all those eligible receive the vaccine .
however , dr gupta 's group said uptake of mmr among two-year-olds in the uk fell from around 92 % in early 1995 to around 80 % in 2003/4 .
mumps a viral infection of the saliva-producing glands found either side of the face spread by coughs and sneezes symptoms develop 14 to 24 days after exposure begins with fever , shivers , tiredness and painful swelling of parotid glands can rarely cause serious complications " in some areas of london , as few as 60 % of two-year-olds had received a first dose of mmr .
" this would account for our recent experience with mumps in younger children , " they said .
health secretary patricia hewitt said the rapid rise in cases of mumps " is a very real worry " .
speaking on bbc 's breakfast programme , she said : " the most important thing for parents and for young adults who did n't get a vaccination at the normal age , is go to the gp , go to the surgery and get the vaccination done now . "
a spokeswoman for the department of health said : " the department of health has alerted gps to the risk posed by mumps to young adults and recommends that every effort should be made to ensure that all children are fully immunised even if they are older than the recommended age range .
" some higher education establishments have been offering special mmr sessions to protect these young people against mumps .
" the department supplies vaccine and leaflets for these sessions .
in order to limit the spread of mumps in the uk , we recommend that all at-risk school leavers and other young adults who have not received mmr or only received one dose , should ensure that they take up the offer of mmr vaccination . "
your comments why all the fear and loathing over what is essentially a mild childhood illness suse , london why all the fear and loathing over what is essentially a mild childhood illness , involving a bit of discomfort - and boosting the immune system in the process .
when an adult gets mumps , it can be more unpleasant and more serious , but even the much-vaunted danger of mumps-induced infertility among males is much less of a risk than usually assumed .
what 's all the fuss ?
and as has been pointed out in another e-mail : previous years have not seen epidemics of young adults suffering - it would be very useful to allow an unbiased investigation of the underlying causes , especially as evidence suggests that a high proportion of those suffering in the current outbreak were in fact fully immunised .
suse , london i 'm a student at sussex university , and there seems to be an extremely high number of people coming down with mumps on campus - while i was waiting 30 minutes for an appointment there were three people who came in with mumps .
the worse thing is that the university seems to be doing nothing about it , such as putting up posters to advise about immunization , and considering that campus is such a closed environment and there are many international students who may not have been vaccinated , this is a dangerous game to play .
clare l , brighton reading between the lines , it seems many recent and current mumps sufferers did receive two shots as children but the immunity has since worn off .
perhaps there should be a third shot for teenagers ?
lesley , edinburgh , scotland , uk my two-year-old daughter had mumps in february - diagnosis was confirmed in hospital although no explanation given as to why the mmr vaccine had failed .
my seven-year-old , who had mmr at 14 months and the pre-school booster is suffering now .
justine , buckinghamshire i am 31 and have had mumps recently .
i was told to go to the dentists for an abscess and luckily i was diagnosed before the dentist took my one and only filling out .
i count myself lucky though as it would be far more serious if i was a 31-year-old man !
tracey , london , uk my 17-year-old has just recovered from a very bad dose of mumps .
the nhs doctor said it would take three weeks to have him tested .
i went privately and got him tested immediately .
tests revealed a very high level of the virus in his blood .
i can only guess at how many other people he infected at school due to the delay .
why should this test not be made available for all if the government is so worried about an " epidemic " ?
sally , london immunisation is the single most effective medical intervention ever bekkie , london people seem to forget that immunisation is the single most effective medical intervention ever , and the second most important public health intervention after a safe water supply !
immunisations are there for a reason - to contain , eliminate or eradicate disease that would otherwise cause even greater morbidity and mortality than they do now .
by not immunising your child you are not only risking their health , but the health of tens of thousands of others .
without immunisations diseases like polio , smallpox and hib would still be endemic in the uk .
bekkie , london there seems to be a great misunderstanding of the purpose of a vaccine .
it is not to prevent one from catching an infectious disease , but rather to lessen the effect if one does catch it .
my grandmother was a fever nurse before the war - in the days where children died from such childhood diseases .
today , with adequate vaccinations your child is likely only to be poorly for a few days - that means the vaccination worked !
nicola , berkshire both my children have suffered mumps recently having had only one dose of the mmr vaccine as infants .
it has been known for some time that two doses were required - so why were n't they recalled and given the opportunity to have the booster .
i am tired of hearing in the media that the epidemic is due to people not taking up the mmr vaccine , in mine , and many other cases , we were unaware that our children were at risk .
mrs l jackson , selby , north yorkshire i 'll never believe the so-called experts of our traditional western medical system .
if you have a strong immune system your body can fight off all viruses .
once our medical experts promote the truths about how our body works , then the public can reap the rewards .
there is much evidence these so called beneficial shots cause more damage than good .
why do so many babies die from crib death shortly after receiving these shots ?
this is only one example .
i encourage all to investigate other treatments than go down the line of believing everything they are told by the system !
gregory langen , chesterfield i believe all children should be immunised and parents should have the right to choose either single jabs or the triple mmr .
my husband and i after careful consideration choose to have the single jabs for my son .
we have been waiting for over 18 months for the mumps vaccination .
the reason given is that the government have reduced the amount of single dose mumps vaccines that can be imported to the uk !
karen jones , cheshire vaccinations are to lessen the chance of catching a disease they are not 100 % effective but then what medication is ?
people do not realise the severity of these illnesses due to the fact that there has been widespread immunisation in the past , the complications of measles and mumps are horrific , why play fast and loose with your child 's health and well being ?
j. mccormick , liverpool u.k. i am quite shocked that this news report mentions nothing about the failure rate of such vaccines .
whatever one 's opinion is on vaccinations , it would appear from the feedback on this site that a great many people who have been vaccinated are still getting mumps .
naomi , cambridge , england here in the us all children have to be immunized before they can attend school at 5 , or they do n't go linda , usa i am very surprised at the uk , it does sound like a third world country of late .
i lived there in the 70s and it was great , even had medical attention , no problem .
here in the us all children have to be immunized before they can attend school at 5 , or they do n't go !
i think that 's the way to do it , we hardly ever hear of mumps or other illnesses anymore .
linda , usa it 's quite clear that there is lack of informed debate in this country regarding the wider benefit of immunisation , accepting that there may be a very small risk to some individuals .
the media is at least partly to be blamed for it !
it was front page news when a gastroenterologist -lrb- not infectious disease specialist or epidemiologist -rrb- , published a small paper on the alleged link between mmr and autism .
some people may be interested to know that co-authors of this particular paper published a statement last year that they no longer believe there is link between mmr and autism .
the government and the media should take the lead in the informed debate of this important public health issue .
proponents and opponents of mmr should be invited to argue their case on live bbc and be covered in front page major newspapers .
dr l , cambridge , england people seem to be under the misapprehension that it individuals who have not been vaccinated against mumps who are being affected .
this is simply not true .
all my children had all their vaccination as and when they should have .
my 17 year old son is just recovering from mumps .
is this vaccination really that successful ?
linda , york i have recently been refused the mmr no1 and booster , at 37 , because the gp ' does n't get paid for it , ' despite my occupation as practice nurse in a university , where we currently have an outbreak of mumps and me dealing first line with those affected and therefore being at high risk .
anne , bradford my 18-year-old daughter has just had mumps , despite being fully vaccinated as a child -lrb- the mmr plus the booster -rrb- .
i wonder if the health protection agency is monitoring the failure rate of the vaccine .
she caught it from her three-year-old brother , who was on the interminable waiting list for the single mumps vaccine .
we opted for single vaccines rather than the mmr but had no idea that due to the shortage of mumps vaccine imports he would have to wait two years - in the event we got a letter asking him to book mumps vaccination the day after he came down with the disease .
the shortage of the single mumps vaccine is a big contributor to the current mumps epidemic , i 'm sure .
wendy , isle of wight , england the uptake of mmr in this country is embarrassing , we are on a level with many less economically developed countries simply because of media hype .
we have the facilities to keep up a 90 % vaccination rate so we should be doing so ?
these outbreaks should not be a surprise , and if current low level of mmr uptake persists we 're also risking the possible re-establishment of endemic measles .
the provision of public goods can not be contingent on upon individual consent .

however , due to his age , he has only had the one dose , so maybe that made a difference .

jo , uk my husband -lrb- 37 -rrb- recently asked for mumps immunisation when a colleague came down with the illness .
he was refused by our gp as he was deemed by the nhs to be not at sufficiently high risk .
our two children have both had their mmr jab , and i had the mumps as a child , but my husband remains at risk unless we go private .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- cases of mumps soaring across uk bbc news / health graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- health contents : medical notes friday , 13 may , 2005 , 07:06 gmt 08:06 uk cases of mumps soaring across uk the uk is in the grip of a mumps epidemic which struck nearly 5,000 people in january alone , say experts .
cases in england and wales soared by 12,000 to 16,436 in 2004 , they say .
most of those who have caught the virus are aged 19 to 23 , but cases are also cropping up in vulnerable children , two british medical journal papers show .
cases are being seen in people born before mmr became routine in 1988 and children who have not been vaccinated , possibly due to vaccine safety fears . "
every effort should be made to ensure that all children are fully immunised even if they are older than the recommended age range " a spokeswoman from the department of health ' my testicle swelled up ' medical notes : mumps the bmj findings corroborate recent reports of rising mumps rates across england , wales and ireland .
in the first paper , investigators at the health protection agency report that in 2004 , the number of cases of mumps recorded in england and wales hit 16,436 , up from 4,204 in 2003 .
and in the first month of 2005 , there were nearly 5,000 cases .
most were among young adults born before 1988 and who would , therefore , not have been offered mmr as a child .
in the second paper , dr ravindra gupta , from london 's guy 's and st thomas ' , working with colleagues from king 's college london , found cases have also occurring in very young children who would have been eligible for the mmr - measles , mumps and rubella - vaccine .
the world health organization recommends that at least 90 % of all those eligible receive the vaccine .
however , dr gupta 's group said uptake of mmr among two-year-olds in the uk fell from around 92 % in early 1995 to around 80 % in 2003/4 .
mumps a viral infection of the saliva-producing glands found either side of the face spread by coughs and sneezes symptoms develop 14 to 24 days after exposure begins with fever , shivers , tiredness and painful swelling of parotid glands can rarely cause serious complications " in some areas of london , as few as 60 % of two-year-olds had received a first dose of mmr .
" this would account for our recent experience with mumps in younger children , " they said .
health secretary patricia hewitt said the rapid rise in cases of mumps " is a very real worry " .
speaking on bbc 's breakfast programme , she said : " the most important thing for parents and for young adults who did n't get a vaccination at the normal age , is go to the gp , go to the surgery and get the vaccination done now . "
a spokeswoman for the department of health said : " the department of health has alerted gps to the risk posed by mumps to young adults and recommends that every effort should be made to ensure that all children are fully immunised even if they are older than the recommended age range .
" some higher education establishments have been offering special mmr sessions to protect these young people against mumps .
" the department supplies vaccine and leaflets for these sessions .
in order to limit the spread of mumps in the uk , we recommend that all at-risk school leavers and other young adults who have not received mmr or only received one dose , should ensure that they take up the offer of mmr vaccination . "
your comments " why all the fear and loathing over what is essentially a mild childhood illness " suse , london why all the fear and loathing over what is essentially a mild childhood illness , involving a bit of discomfort - and boosting the immune system in the process .
when an adult gets mumps , it can be more unpleasant and more serious , but even the much-vaunted danger of mumps-induced infertility among males is much less of a risk than usually assumed .
what 's all the fuss ?
and as has been pointed out in another e-mail : previous years have not seen epidemics of young adults suffering - it would be very useful to allow an unbiased investigation of the underlying causes , especially as evidence suggests that a high proportion of those suffering in the current outbreak were in fact fully immunised .
suse , london i 'm a student at sussex university , and there seems to be an extremely high number of people coming down with mumps on campus - while i was waiting 30 minutes for an appointment there were three people who came in with mumps .
the worse thing is that the university seems to be doing nothing about it , such as putting up posters to advise about immunization , and considering that campus is such a closed environment and there are many international students who may not have been vaccinated , this is a dangerous game to play .
clare l , brighton reading between the lines , it seems many recent and current mumps sufferers did receive two shots as children but the immunity has since worn off .
perhaps there should be a third shot for teenagers ?
lesley , edinburgh , scotland , uk my two-year-old daughter had mumps in february - diagnosis was confirmed in hospital although no explanation given as to why the mmr vaccine had failed .
my seven-year-old , who had mmr at 14 months and the pre-school booster is suffering now .
justine , buckinghamshire i am 31 and have had mumps recently .
i was told to go to the dentists for an abscess and luckily i was diagnosed before the dentist took my one and only filling out .
i count myself lucky though as it would be far more serious if i was a 31-year-old man !
tracey , london , uk my 17-year-old has just recovered from a very bad dose of mumps .
the nhs doctor said it would take three weeks to have him tested .
i went privately and got him tested immediately .
tests revealed a very high level of the virus in his blood .
i can only guess at how many other people he infected at school due to the delay .
why should this test not be made available for all if the government is so worried about an " epidemic " ?
sally , london " immunisation is the single most effective medical intervention ever " bekkie , london people seem to forget that immunisation is the single most effective medical intervention ever , and the second most important public health intervention after a safe water supply !
immunisations are there for a reason - to contain , eliminate or eradicate disease that would otherwise cause even greater morbidity and mortality than they do now .
by not immunising your child you are not only risking their health , but the health of tens of thousands of others .
without immunisations diseases like polio , smallpox and hib would still be endemic in the uk .
bekkie , london there seems to be a great misunderstanding of the purpose of a vaccine .
it is not to prevent one from catching an infectious disease , but rather to lessen the effect if one does catch it .
my grandmother was a fever nurse before the war - in the days where children died from such childhood diseases .
today , with adequate vaccinations your child is likely only to be poorly for a few days - that means the vaccination worked !
nicola , berkshire both my children have suffered mumps recently having had only one dose of the mmr vaccine as infants .
it has been known for some time that two doses were required - so why were n't they recalled and given the opportunity to have the booster .
i am tired of hearing in the media that the epidemic is due to people not taking up the mmr vaccine , in mine , and many other cases , we were unaware that our children were at risk .
mrs l jackson , selby , north yorkshire i 'll never believe the so-called experts of our traditional western medical system .
if you have a strong immune system your body can fight off all viruses .
once our medical experts promote the truths about how our body works , then the public can reap the rewards .
there is much evidence these so called beneficial shots cause more damage than good .
why do so many babies die from crib death shortly after receiving these shots ?
this is only one example .
i encourage all to investigate other treatments than go down the line of believing everything they are told by the system !
gregory langen , chesterfield i believe all children should be immunised and parents should have the right to choose either single jabs or the triple mmr .
my husband and i after careful consideration choose to have the single jabs for my son .
we have been waiting for over 18 months for the mumps vaccination .
the reason given is that the government have reduced the amount of single dose mumps vaccines that can be imported to the uk !
karen jones , cheshire vaccinations are to lessen the chance of catching a disease they are not 100 % effective but then what medication is ?
people do not realise the severity of these illnesses due to the fact that there has been widespread immunisation in the past , the complications of measles and mumps are horrific , why play fast and loose with your child 's health and well being ?
j. mccormick , liverpool u.k. i am quite shocked that this news report mentions nothing about the failure rate of such vaccines .
whatever one 's opinion is on vaccinations , it would appear from the feedback on this site that a great many people who have been vaccinated are still getting mumps .
naomi , cambridge , england " here in the us all children have to be immunized before they can attend school at 5 , or they do n't go " linda , usa i am very surprised at the uk , it does sound like a third world country of late .
i lived there in the 70s and it was great , even had medical attention , no problem .
here in the us all children have to be immunized before they can attend school at 5 , or they do n't go !
i think that 's the way to do it , we hardly ever hear of mumps or other illnesses anymore .
linda , usa it 's quite clear that there is lack of informed debate in this country regarding the wider benefit of immunisation , accepting that there may be a very small risk to some individuals .
the media is at least partly to be blamed for it !
it was front page news when a gastroenterologist -lrb- not infectious disease specialist or epidemiologist -rrb- , published a small paper on the alleged link between mmr and autism .
some people may be interested to know that co-authors of this particular paper published a statement last year that they no longer believe there is link between mmr and autism .
the government and the media should take the lead in the informed debate of this important public health issue .
proponents and opponents of mmr should be invited to argue their case on live bbc and be covered in front page major newspapers .
dr l , cambridge , england people seem to be under the misapprehension that it individuals who have not been vaccinated against mumps who are being affected .
this is simply not true .
all my children had all their vaccination as and when they should have .
my 17 year old son is just recovering from mumps .
is this vaccination really that successful ?
linda , york i have recently been refused the mmr no1 and booster , at 37 , because the gp ' does n't get paid for it , ' despite my occupation as practice nurse in a university , where we currently have an outbreak of mumps and me dealing first line with those affected and therefore being at high risk .
anne , bradford my 18-year-old daughter has just had mumps , despite being fully vaccinated as a child -lrb- the mmr plus the booster -rrb- .
i wonder if the health protection agency is monitoring the failure rate of the vaccine .
she caught it from her three-year-old brother , who was on the interminable waiting list for the single mumps vaccine .
we opted for single vaccines rather than the mmr but had no idea that due to the shortage of mumps vaccine imports he would have to wait two years - in the event we got a letter asking him to book mumps vaccination the day after he came down with the disease .
the shortage of the single mumps vaccine is a big contributor to the current mumps epidemic , i 'm sure .
wendy , isle of wight , england the uptake of mmr in this country is embarrassing , we are on a level with many less economically developed countries simply because of media hype .
we have the facilities to keep up a 90 % vaccination rate so we should be doing so ?
these outbreaks should not be a surprise , and if current low level of mmr uptake persists we 're also risking the possible re-establishment of endemic measles .
the provision of public goods can not be contingent on upon individual consent .
rachael , uk " i have had the mmr and a booster , yet i still had mumps last november " lindsey , cambridge i was born in 1986 , and i have had the mmr and a booster , yet i still had mumps last november , along with many other students at my university who had also had the mmr , so it seems even those who have been vaccinated are at risk .
lindsey , cambridge are all the parents that refused to have their children immunised after unfounded reports going to blame everyone else when their kids go down with mumps ?
well , what do you know ?
i told you so .
ng , brighton , uk my 18 year old daughter has just recovered from mumps , she was born in 1986 and had the mmr vaccine in 1990 .
she is a full time student at 6th form and missed her art a level last week due to the illness .
she returned to college on monday and has been sitting her art exam all this week .
mary saviile , middlesbrough , england mr blair now says he will listen to the people , therefore now is the time to offer individual vaccines to parents who do n't want to risk possible harm to their children from the mmr jab .
after the bse fiasco i 'm afraid politicians do not reassure me about mmr .
mick , spalding , lincolnshire being sure that mumps was a notifiable disease i took my case to my doctor , who to my great surprise said , " i think you probably do have mumps , but by the time any test results come back , you will be over it .
just go home and rest " if this is at all common , we can assume the epidemic is much more widespread than the official figures suggest .
carl , london i am a gp - we have been told by the immunisation team , department of health - there is a shortage of mmr vaccines in the country and that we are unable to give these to teenagers - we are only allowed to immunise children at 13 months and at 5 years at the moment !
obviously patricia hewitt needs to found out more about her department dr s , leeds perhaps many of those burying their heads over mmr should finally accept the views of the experts instead of the sensationalism of the media .
the who is one of the most trusted bodies on the planet .
it is arrogance to assume they are feeding misinformation on this matter simon p , scarborough , n yorks " it 's rife throughout the student population of manchester " rob s , manchester it 's rife throughout the student population of manchester - i have just had a mild dose , thanks to having the first of the mmr vaccines but not the second .
i was totally unaware of the need for two doses until it was too late .
rob s , manchester today is friday and i went to the doctors on monday who informed me i have mumps , i 'm awaiting the test which comes in the post , surely this test can be done at the doctors , as this adds extra time on getting the results , and as a student i have exams in less than two weeks .
also i had the vaccination as a child so therefore i should not have caught it !
sarah logan , london , uk i had mumps last july when i was 22 , i caught it off my 19 year old brother who is a student in york .
i can honestly say that it was horrific .
the pain caused from the swelling was unbearable , i was unable to move my head up or down nor from side to side and it felt as though my head was going to explode .
my face stayed swollen for a good while after the pain had gone .
i found it quite depressing because i did n't want to be seen by anyone as the swelling was so disfiguring .
i would never put my children at the risk of getting mumps and personally find the number of children who are not getting vaccinated very alarming .
kat , manchester i was given the mmr jab as a child but it did n't stop me catching mumps .
not all immunisations work .
helen , cheshire most of my friends and i had mumps when we were in primary school -lrb- late 1980 's -rrb- .
to us , it was just another illness that we expected to catch along with chicken pox .
sd , cheshire , uk my son is 3 and a half yrs old , and due to family health concerns we opted for him to have separate vaccines .
this option is not available on the nhs and so we have had to have them done privately .
he has still not had the mumps vaccine due to import restrictions placed by the government .
i would gladly pay my gp to administer the vaccines separately , as i realise that three visits place an extra burden on the surgery .
i understand that the option to have separate vaccines on the nhs was available in the past , but this option was taken away .
hazel s , kent the protection for my age group seems well established in this area .
i received the vaccine in the final year of sixth form when i was 18 , and when i got to university in september , the mmr ii vaccine was available for anyone who was n't protected .
sam e , nottingham university , nottingham one of our children has had mumps this year and several of their friends have .
as far as i am aware all had the mmr jab but , crucially , none had the booster jab that is now administered .
the government appear to have been dragging their feet since last year both in recognising this and in offering community wide booster vaccination .
nick rowson , wotton-under-edge , glos " people need to realise that vaccination is important and has wider implications for society " hannah c , oxford i go to university at oxford where we have had many cases of mumps in the last year - lots of my friends got it , i was lucky enough to see the doctor before i came into contact with them .
i think to suggest that the epidemic is " convenient " is ridiculous , it happened because certain ages ranges missed out the vaccine , and the falling levels of uptake in young children .
people need to realise that vaccination is important and has wider implications for society -lrb- rather than it just affecting your child -rrb- .
the media also has to be responsible and not try to sell scare stories - the mmr / autism link was based on a study of 12 people , anyone in science knows that an investigation of that size is not statistically valid .
hannah c , oxford my brother has just caught mumps , and he was born in 1991 and has had the mmr .
the doctor has said that there is a particularly virulent strain which you can get even if you have had the jab and is appearing in many major cities in the south .
poppy quinn , london i 'm in my mid-twenties and have just recovered from a mild version of the mumps .
i did not believe i could be affected due to my age but to say the last two weeks have been unpleasant would be understatement .
jamie , wrexham well i am still recovering from the mumps and i did have the injection when i was younger .
i am outraged as it has caused so much pain - i have never felt so bad in my life !
laura pollard , folkestone , kent there would be more children vaccinated if the mumps vaccine was given as a single dose and at a later age - say just before starting school .
alan challoner , bodelwyddan , wales i 'm not concerned , unlike the people who did not vaccinate their children , mine where .
it will be interesting to see the figures for autism to see whether or not the number of cases has continued with the trend or gone down .
my money is on the former .
jim , milton keynes " the department of health has alerted gps to the risk posed by mumps to young adults and recommends that every effort should be made to ensure that all children are fully immunised . "
how patronising can they be ?
i 'm sure gps , with their years of medical training , are far more aware of the risks than non-medically based bureaucrats .
henry , durham , uk .
i 'm in bed with mumps now .
i 'm 35 years old .
louise , hartlepool , uk my teenagers were due for the booster last year , but could n't take the first appointment due to illness , this was re-scheduled , but then cancelled due to a shortage of vaccine .
i have just got off the phone to my gp surgery , they advise that there is still no vaccine .
how are parents supposed to ensure that their children are protected if there 's no vaccine , and no prospect of getting any ?
claire , uk this is an appalling indictment of the media 's poorly informed reporting of claims by mavericks .
one can only hope that newspapers , and other media outlets , acknowledge how they have contributed to this public health problem .
anthony , birmingham , uk my son -lrb- aged 17 -rrb- had a recent gp appointment for mmr vaccination .
however , when he arrived for his appointment he was told that because of a department of health directive which had been received that day , informing of a national shortage of the vaccine , he would be contacted with a new appointment when vaccine became available .
so far there has been no further contact from the surgery .
if there is indeed a shortage of vaccine what is being done to resolve it ?
norman wilson , witham , england your report suggests that only people who have not been vaccinated are getting mumps .
my youngest -lrb- 2 years 7 months -rrb- is just at the tail end of a case , and he had his mmr at the correct time .
it 's highly likely that he suffered less than he would have done without , but vaccines are n't a guarantee that you wo n't get it at all .
however , due to his age , he has only had the one dose , so maybe that made a difference .
tracey , eastleigh what a convenient epidemic !
why did n't it happen last year , or the year before , or the year before that , to teenagers born before 1988 ? is this another attempt to restore faith in the mmr vaccine before the launch of the quadruple vaccine ?
and yet again , the many thousands of susceptible children that had their lives ruined by the effects of mmr are completely ignored .
julie loch , cardiff wales .
julie : this ' epidemic ' started at the end of last year in a number of universities .
it seems to have started at the university games held in spain , and then spread amongst students , who would n't have had the mmr .
i like a good conspiracy story / government spin bashing as much as the next punter , but this one seems to be innocent reporting of the truth .
isobel , oxford this was predicted .
i hope those parents who thought they knew more than the medical profession when it came to immunisation are now eating their ill-informed words .

it is almost 40 years since the first episode was broadcast .
actress fenella fielding , who provided the unseen village voice , unveiled the plaque on her first visit to the location .
the prisoner is not the only programme to have used portmeirion - cold feet filmed a key episode there in 2003 .
in the series , patrick mcgoohan played a secret agent trapped among a brainwashed population held captive by a mysterious regime .
the prisoners were known only by numbers and mcgoohan 's character was famously called number six .
patrick mcgoohan starred in the 17-episode series there were no bars or barbed wire , and massive balloons would smother anyone attempting to escape .
the series was shown in more than 60 countries throughout the world .
ms fielding , whose uncredited role in the show only took her an hour to complete , said she still received lots of fan mail about it .
she said the programme remained " an enigma " .
" there is something about the hero 's predicament that really grabs you , you 've got to follow it - and i think it was that that made it so popular , " she said .
after her first look at portmeirion , she said : " it 's wonderful .
at the time i did n't know it existed and thought it was an invented place for the series and came to realise it 's not only real , but pretty substantial and very beautiful " .
fan roger langley , from six of one , the prisoner appreciation society , said the show was meant to be enjoyed , not understood .
portmeirion was designed by sir clough williams-ellis " it was a television revolution and created as many fans and admirers as it did critics and lots of people did n't understand it , " he said .
" i have always argued that , without portmeirion , the prisoner would n't have been the series it was - it would not have had the visual appeal , it would n't have had that magical impact . "
every year , around 250,000 people visit the italianate village , which was designed by sir clough williams-ellis and opened in 1925 .
the plaque , which forms part of the north wales film and television trail , has been organised by the wales screen commission .
spokesman richard coombs said : " the prisoner is an important landmark series in the history of television , not just here but across the world . "
two years ago , a dedicated guidebook was launched highlighting locations where the prisoner was filmed in portmeirion .

mr law , who left the party when he stood in protest against its policy of all-women candidates ' shortlists , won the seat by 9,121 votes .
he said he might consider rejoining labour if there was an ' amnesty ' for party members who backed him .
but mr hain said " nobody was going to be blackmailed over this " .
mr hain said the door back into the labour party had not been shut to mr law if he votes with the party in cardiff bay and westminster .
mr hain said mr law had automatically expelled himself when he stood as an independent candidate in the general election , but the party would " see how he behaves " in his dual role as am and mp for blaenau gwent .
i 'm not saying either that the door is being shut to peter law coming back into welsh labour , or any of those who supported him .
welsh secretary peter hain in an interview with the bbc programme dragon 's eye , mr law , 57 , said : " i think everything is open for discussion but i really do n't think there will be any discussion for some while yet because -lrb- emotions on both sides -rrb- are inflamed . "
he said he would not consider returning to the party without his supporters , former labour party members , being given an amnesty .
mr law , who is also the constituency 's am , inflicted a heavy defeat on labour 's candidate , maggie jones , overturning a majority of 19,000 .
it was the party 's safest seat in wales .
' expelled himself ' his expulsion from labour has a knock-on effect in the welsh assembly where the party had held 30 of the 60 seats , until mr law became an independent .
but welsh secretary peter hain said he was confident first minister rhodri morgan would be able to conduct his assembly administration .
he told dragon 's eye that the way mr law voted in the assembly would be important for his future relationship with welsh labour .
he said : " we never picked a fight with peter law , he picked a fight with the labour party .
" and those members of blaenau gwent labour party who joined him and supported him , they have expelled themselves and he has expelled himself . "
mr hain campaigned for maggie jones in blaenau gwent mr hain said there was no " witchhunt " against mr law or " vendetta " against his ex-labour supporters .
" let 's just see how he behaves .
he holds the welsh assembly government labour majority in his hands in the national assembly .
" you ca n't offer instant concessions but i 'm not saying either that the door is being shut to peter law coming back into welsh labour , or any of those who supported him .
" but what i am saying is that nobody is going to be blackmailed over this . "
on friday morning , a welsh labour spokesman said : " the spotlight will be on peter law now , but there will be no early return for him to the party . "
mr law withdrew from the electoral contest a month ago when he discovered he had a brain tumour , but underwent surgery and then decided to press ahead and stand as an independent .

mr law , who left the party when he stood in protest against its policy of all-women candidates ' shortlists , won the seat by 9,121 votes .
he said he might consider rejoining labour if there was an ' amnesty ' for party members who backed him .
but mr hain said " nobody was going to be blackmailed over this " .
mr hain said the door back into the labour party had not been shut to mr law if he votes with the party in cardiff bay and westminster .
mr hain said mr law had automatically expelled himself when he stood as an independent candidate in the general election , but the party would " see how he behaves " in his dual role as am and mp for blaenau gwent .
i 'm not saying either that the door is being shut to peter law coming back into welsh labour , or any of those who supported him .
welsh secretary peter hain in an interview with the bbc programme dragon 's eye , mr law , 57 , said : " i think everything is open for discussion but i really do n't think there will be any discussion for some while yet because -lrb- emotions on both sides -rrb- are inflamed . "
he said he would not consider returning to the party without his supporters , former labour party members , being given an amnesty .
mr law , who is also the constituency 's am , inflicted a heavy defeat on labour 's candidate , maggie jones , overturning a majority of 19,000 .
it was the party 's safest seat in wales .
' expelled himself ' his expulsion from labour has a knock-on effect in the welsh assembly where the party had held 30 of the 60 seats , until mr law became an independent .
but welsh secretary peter hain said he was confident first minister rhodri morgan would be able to conduct his assembly administration .
he told dragon 's eye that the way mr law voted in the assembly would be important for his future relationship with welsh labour .
he said : " we never picked a fight with peter law , he picked a fight with the labour party .
" and those members of blaenau gwent labour party who joined him and supported him , they have expelled themselves and he has expelled himself . "
mr hain campaigned for maggie jones in blaenau gwent mr hain said there was no " witchhunt " against mr law or " vendetta " against his ex-labour supporters .
" let 's just see how he behaves .
he holds the welsh assembly government labour majority in his hands in the national assembly .
" you ca n't offer instant concessions but i 'm not saying either that the door is being shut to peter law coming back into welsh labour , or any of those who supported him .
" but what i am saying is that nobody is going to be blackmailed over this . "
on friday morning , a welsh labour spokesman said : " the spotlight will be on peter law now , but there will be no early return for him to the party . "
mr law withdrew from the electoral contest a month ago when he discovered he had a brain tumour , but underwent surgery and then decided to press ahead and stand as an independent .

analysis of whales stranded between 1712 and 2003 shows that more are stranded when solar activity is high .
writing in the journal of sea research , scientists propose that whales use the earth 's magnetic field to assist navigation like homing pigeons do .
as the sun disrupts the magnetic field whales can become confused , they say .
animal magnetism the sun goes through a cycle with an average length of about 11 years , though individual cycle lengths have ranged from eight to 17 years .
some evidence exists to suggest that shorter cycles produce a higher flux of radiation from the sun .
dr klaus vanselow and colleagues from the university of kiel have analysed the lengths of solar cycles and have found that 87 of the 97 reported sperm whale strandings over the past 300 years in the north sea region occurred when the length of the sun 's activity cycle was below average .
they argue that whales may be like pigeons and dolphins in having a magnetic sense based on small crystals of magnetite found in certain cells .
pigeons use such cells to sense the earth 's magnetic field to help in their navigation .
pigeon enthusiasts are well aware that the birds can go astray during times of high solar activity , when disturbances in the magnetic field confuse them .
" it may be the same for whales , " dr vanselow told the bbc news website .
" sperm whales migrate long distances with very little visual clues as to where they are going .
it would be unsurprising if they too had a magnetic sense .
" we believe that our research showing that more whales are beached during times when the sun disrupts the earth 's magnetic field makes it a strong possibility that they do . "
the numbers of cetacean - whale , dolphin and porpoise - strandings around the uk have doubled over the last 10 years .
marine mammal experts say an increase in fishing activity , which leads to more " by-catch " , is a major cause of the problem .
campaigners also claim increased noise in the oceans , coming from ships ' engines and sonar , is a significant factor in whales losing their way .

despite mounting its strongest challenge yet , the opposition is not expected to unseat prime minister meles zenawi 's ethiopian people 's revolutionary democratic front -lrb- eprdf -rrb- , which has ruled the country since 1991 .
q : who is standing ?
some 35 parties are contesting the seats , although most of these are members of the three main coalitions : the ruling eprdf and the opposition coalition of unity and democracy -lrb- cud -rrb- and the united ethiopian democratic forces -lrb- uedf -rrb- .
ruling coalition members tigray people 's liberation front -lrb- tplf -rrb- amhara national democratic movement -lrb- andm -rrb- oromo people 's democratic organization -lrb- opdo -rrb- the south ethiopia people 's democratic movement -lrb- sepdm -rrb- the eprdf is a four-party coalition founded in 1989 in a merger between the tigray people 's liberation front -lrb- tplf -rrb- and the ethiopian people 's democratic movement - later renamed amhara national democratic movement .
the tplf draws most of its support from the tigray people of northern ethiopia , mr zenawi 's home base .
the opposition cud and uedf say they have set aside ethnic differences to form the two coalitions , and have pledged to unite to win a parliamentary majority .
in the last parliament , the opposition held just 14 seats in the 547-member chamber .
q : how will the election work ?
around 25 million ethiopians are registered to vote in the polls .
the ruling eprdf is confident of victory voting will take place in each of ethiopia 's nine states , except in the south-eastern somali region , where the election will not take place until august , to allow resources to register nomadic pastoralists in the area .
the party or coalition with the most seats will nominate the prime minister .
on the same day , voters will also elect representatives to nine regional state parliaments , which will in turn appoint members to the upper house of parliament .
results are expected at the end of may .
q : what are the main issues ?
peace with eritrea remains one of the most contentious issues in this election and voters view it as a matter of national pride .
the two countries fought a border war in 1998-2000 which cost 70,000 lives .
a truce has just about held since but in april both the un and the eritrean government warned continuing disputes over border demarcation pose a danger to peace .
land ownership is another important election issue .
the opposition believes the best way to fight poverty is ending the state 's ownership of all land , and argues farmers must be free to buy and sell property and develop wealth .
the government insists the state must own land , arguing it gives more security to farmers .
good governance is another issue preoccupying the parties .
the ruling eprdf coalition calls itself a stout defender of democracy and says it has brought about tangible changes in the areas of land reform , education and democracy .
this is strongly contested by the uedf which says the eprdf has not addressed problems faced by ethnic nationalities .
q : what part have the media played ?
in this election the ruling eprdf has allowed the opposition access to the state-run media , with its members taking part in televised debates .
but there have been accusations of biased reporting in the state-run media in favour of the ruling party and the opposition has complained that it has been denied media access .
q : are there any international observers ?
for the first time ethiopia has invited international observers to monitor its elections .
the european union , the us-based carter centre and the african union have all sent observers to country .
this has not gone without hitches .
in march , six us election observers were expelled on the grounds they were operating illegally and " not invited " .
q : will the vote be free and fair ?
although some international observers have acknowledged that ethiopia has made progress on the road to democracy , concerns have been raised over alleged human rights abuses in the run-up to polls .
the opposition says it will reduce tensions with eritrea a report by the new york-based human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- said regional authorities and security forces continue to suppress political dissent in the southern oromia state .
oromia is home to the oromo ethnic group and has been the centre of dissent against the eprdf .
ethiopia 's information minister berekat simon has dismissed the hrw report .
the chief eu observer in the country , ana gomez , has also raised a number of concerns about the election campaign , notably government accusations that the opposition is promoting ethnic hatred that could flare into violence similar to the 1994 rwandan genocide .
bbc monitoring selects and translates news from radio , television , press , news agencies and the internet from 150 countries in more than 70 languages .

despite mounting its strongest challenge yet , the opposition is not expected to unseat prime minister meles zenawi 's ethiopian people 's revolutionary democratic front -lrb- eprdf -rrb- , which has ruled the country since 1991 .
q : who is standing ?
some 35 parties are contesting the seats , although most of these are members of the three main coalitions : the ruling eprdf and the opposition coalition of unity and democracy -lrb- cud -rrb- and the united ethiopian democratic forces -lrb- uedf -rrb- .
ruling coalition members tigray people 's liberation front -lrb- tplf -rrb- amhara national democratic movement -lrb- andm -rrb- oromo people 's democratic organization -lrb- opdo -rrb- the south ethiopia people 's democratic movement -lrb- sepdm -rrb- the eprdf is a four-party coalition founded in 1989 in a merger between the tigray people 's liberation front -lrb- tplf -rrb- and the ethiopian people 's democratic movement - later renamed amhara national democratic movement .
the tplf draws most of its support from the tigray people of northern ethiopia , mr zenawi 's home base .
the opposition cud and uedf say they have set aside ethnic differences to form the two coalitions , and have pledged to unite to win a parliamentary majority .
in the last parliament , the opposition held just 14 seats in the 547-member chamber .
q : how will the election work ?
around 25 million ethiopians are registered to vote in the polls .
the ruling eprdf is confident of victory voting will take place in each of ethiopia 's nine states , except in the south-eastern somali region , where the election will not take place until august , to allow resources to register nomadic pastoralists in the area .
the party or coalition with the most seats will nominate the prime minister .
on the same day , voters will also elect representatives to nine regional state parliaments , which will in turn appoint members to the upper house of parliament .
results are expected at the end of may .
q : what are the main issues ?
peace with eritrea remains one of the most contentious issues in this election and voters view it as a matter of national pride .
the two countries fought a border war in 1998-2000 which cost 70,000 lives .
a truce has just about held since but in april both the un and the eritrean government warned continuing disputes over border demarcation pose a danger to peace .
land ownership is another important election issue .
the opposition believes the best way to fight poverty is ending the state 's ownership of all land , and argues farmers must be free to buy and sell property and develop wealth .
the government insists the state must own land , arguing it gives more security to farmers .
good governance is another issue preoccupying the parties .
the ruling eprdf coalition calls itself a stout defender of democracy and says it has brought about tangible changes in the areas of land reform , education and democracy .
this is strongly contested by the uedf which says the eprdf has not addressed problems faced by ethnic nationalities .
q : what part have the media played ?
in this election the ruling eprdf has allowed the opposition access to the state-run media , with its members taking part in televised debates .
but there have been accusations of biased reporting in the state-run media in favour of the ruling party and the opposition has complained that it has been denied media access .
q : are there any international observers ?
for the first time ethiopia has invited international observers to monitor its elections .
the european union , the us-based carter centre and the african union have all sent observers to country .
this has not gone without hitches .
in march , six us election observers were expelled on the grounds they were operating illegally and " not invited " .
q : will the vote be free and fair ?
although some international observers have acknowledged that ethiopia has made progress on the road to democracy , concerns have been raised over alleged human rights abuses in the run-up to polls .
the opposition says it will reduce tensions with eritrea a report by the new york-based human rights watch -lrb- hrw -rrb- said regional authorities and security forces continue to suppress political dissent in the southern oromia state .
oromia is home to the oromo ethnic group and has been the centre of dissent against the eprdf .
ethiopia 's information minister berekat simon has dismissed the hrw report .
the chief eu observer in the country , ana gomez , has also raised a number of concerns about the election campaign , notably government accusations that the opposition is promoting ethnic hatred that could flare into violence similar to the 1994 rwandan genocide .

the mausoleum is on course to be ready in november harvests in one of the world 's poorest countries have been poor once more .
the idea of building a mausoleum has been around for many years but construction only started following last year 's election victory of president bingu wa mutharika .
banda , the self-styled " president-for-life " ruled the country with an iron fist for three decades , but was finally beaten at the ballot box in 1994 in the country 's first multi-party elections .
after his death three years later , he was buried in a humble grave .
the multi-million dollar mausoleum is expected to have , among other things , a library , a dancing arena , a viewing bay for banda 's remains and a research centre where people can find out information about malawi 's history .
' well-deserved ' the project architect for banda 's mausoleum , knight munthali , says work is progressing well .
banda made himself ' president-for-life ' " you can see the chamber which houses the original tomb where kamuzu is resting , " he says .
" it is on two levels .
the lower level is the chamber .
the upper level is a public area with a replica of the tomb and lighting that will make it visible even at night . "
he did not mention libraries or dance-floors , but the scale of the project is still impressive .
during the first official visit , were members of the banda family .
" we are very happy with the progress being made on the construction site , " says their spokesperson , ken kandodo .
" we have been informed today that 10 % of the work has been done .
and the project is on schedule for completion in november .
if you consider what dr banda did for this country , all that is being planned is well deserved . "
whether there is hunger or not , the dead are always given their due respect henry chimunthu banda culture minister -lrb- no relation -rrb- but john tembo , banda 's former right-hand man and the leader of his party , has some reservations about the project .
" i am happy that it has started but i am not sure sufficient is being done to honour him , " he says .
" i think we are rushing it .
we want to make sure that it is done properly . "
since the project kicked off two months ago , people have expressed mixed feelings about the mausoleum .
waste of money while some support the government 's plans , others feel the authorities should concentrate on the acute shortage of food that is facing malawi this year .
" the project is good , because kamuzu is the father and founder of this nation , " said one man in the capital , lilongwe .
banda 's funeral was an elaborate affair " we are just wasting our 65 million for this graveyard , " said another man .
" people in malawi are suffering from different diseases and they are hungry .
the government should deal with this hunger .
so my view is that i am not happy with this mausoleum . "
culture minister henry chimunthu banda -lrb- no relation of the former ruler -rrb- says the government has a duty to honour the dead , as well as look after the living .
" culturally , whether there is hunger or not , the dead are always given their due respect , " he says .
" what we are doing here is not wasting money .
we are honouring the former head of state . "
hastings kamuzu banda died in november 1997 .
despite mixed feelings about the construction , it seems like the mausoleum will be finished in november - in time for the eighth anniversary of his death .
what do you think ?
is this a waste of money or a suitable memorial ?
how important is it to honour the dead ?
this debate has now closed .
here is a selection of your comments : as an african , it is saddening to see how ignorant our african leaders are .
kamuzu banda was a fighter for the liberation of malawi against white oppression , therefore an african hero .
from the moment he began oppressing his own people , he became a villan and history should hold him to account , just as the russians did in denouncing stalin after his death in 1953 .
people are dying of aids , hunger and poverty in malawi and yet their leaders are spending so much money on a grave and saying that despite the colossal death rate of their people the project should continue .
is it not enough that his casket was golden ?
by making such dubious financial decisions it shows that the ' cancer ' destroying africa is not just its debt but selfish , arrogant and small minded african politicans with the me , me , me and some more for me syndrome .
thando siziba , london , united kingdom a monument for the late dr. hastings kamuzu is needed to remind the squabbling now going on in the country that we miss him .
he kept malawi peaceful without any military intervention .
he was foresighted by introducing classics in schools for think tanks .
he encouraged farming by example .
tsimbamba tsakamutsu , lilongwe , malawi i feel the construction was supposed to be carried out soon after kamuzu died .
therefore i support it because i am sure malawi will never find another wise leader like him .
sydney mkata , blantyre in malawi another monument to despotism , just what africa needs .
andy , uk in most poor african coutries , like malawi , those in power decide the fate of the country , hence the fate of the poor majority .
malawian officials know well enough that malawi is one of the countries in africa that are suffering from acute shortage of food .
personally , i am dumbfounded at reading such irritating news - constructing a mausoleum for a dictator to the disappointment of poor malawians .
this immoral decision to go on with the construction is a reflection of the insensitivity of the current officails to thier people. weldu ghebreyesus , asmara , eritrea banda deserves a monument .
so does nkruma , azikiwe etc .
it is history and has nothing to do with being despot , dictator etc .
china has their mao everywhere , britain has wellington , churchill , france napoleon , de gaulle and italy mussolini .
and i am not in favour of angry citizens tearing down these monuments in the event of political upheavals etc .
let malawi build this monument no matter the cost .
monuments are vestiges that will continue to stand there and remind future generations of people and events that characterised a given period , century in any country 's history .
ngozi , geneva , switzerland it is a waste of money to built a mausoleum for kamuzu banda .
the man was a dictator.look at pope john paul ii 's coffin - so simple stop building that thing.feed the starving malawians .
chauncy mopho jere , los angeles , california .usa africa must monumentalise their history .
this way you get pride and self worth 500 years later .
if king leopold is honoured in belgium , despite the heart of darkness , then banda surely deserves a little footnote in africa 's monuments .
kip , joburg sa kamuzu deserves more than whatever we can do because malawi is where she is because of him - no tribal wars and peaceful .
colvin chirwa , nottingham brilliant colvin - malawi is also one of the poorest countries in the world and facing yet another year of famine .
i grew up under banda 's thumb , and , judging by your name , so did you .
do you remember being forced out of school by the police to stand on the road for hours to applaud his motorcade as it passed on it 's way to the airport ?
or nervously looking over your shoulder to see who might be spying on what you were saying ?
the man was a disgrace but still not as bad as the cronies that surrounded him and fed him the information they thought he wanted to know , cutting him off from the potholes and poverty that diseased my lovely country .
s , planet earth the mausoleum is indeed a befiting respect for the father and founder of the malawi nation , ngwazi dr hastings kamuzu banda .
but the timing !
and the moral / religious implication .
do people know that , today , now , somewhere in malawi , there 's somebody who does n't have any food in the house ?
oh , the merciful god , postpone the construction and feed the people .
kamchanda , leeds , uk kamuzu banda should have a monument bulit in his honour .
although a dictator , in the banda years crimes such as murder and theft were unheard of and his people were never starved .
banda did the best for malawi and always had malawi 's interests ay heart .
just look what democracy has done to malawi .
murders and theft are common and nearly all the houses have burglar bars and electric fencing to keep intruders out .
this was not the case in the banda years .
the currency has devalued from once being 2 kwacha to the pound to over 205 kwacha today .
the democracy in malawi has taken malawi back 200 years and it has to take alot of time to make up the standards set by kamuzu banda .
banda without doubt did the best for malawi and now you have politicians stealing public funds and abusing government funds .
banda will always be the number one leader for malawi .
he deserves a monument .
chiraag patel , leicester england as a former president , kamuzu is part of our history and deserves that new mausoleum .
even if , the money is deviated to buying food , hunger will still be there due to our poor agricultural policies .
grivin chipula , leuven , belgium a multi-million dollar monument to a man who treated his people with contempt , enforced racial segregation and was generally an embarassment -lrb- banning flared trousers etc -rrb- !
why are we surprised and hurt when the world takes a dim view of us africans when we constantly shoot ourselves in the foot ?
juma boy , it is the nature and culture of africans to honour the dead , no matter what their past live was .
that culture should not be allowed to die just because the west is singing ' democracy ' let the project for banda go on .
tomorrow , future malawians will have the privelege to see the remains of the man who thought he could be " president for life " but was proved wrong .
that vestige will itself be a lesson from history .
most of our african leaders are guilty of not learning from history .

the mausoleum is on course to be ready in november harvests in one of the world 's poorest countries have been poor once more .
the idea of building a mausoleum has been around for many years but construction only started following last year 's election victory of president bingu wa mutharika .
banda , the self-styled " president-for-life " ruled the country with an iron fist for three decades , but was finally beaten at the ballot box in 1994 in the country 's first multi-party elections .
after his death three years later , he was buried in a humble grave .
the multi-million dollar mausoleum is expected to have , among other things , a library , a dancing arena , a viewing bay for banda 's remains and a research centre where people can find out information about malawi 's history .
' well-deserved ' the project architect for banda 's mausoleum , knight munthali , says work is progressing well .
banda made himself ' president-for-life ' " you can see the chamber which houses the original tomb where kamuzu is resting , " he says .
" it is on two levels .
the lower level is the chamber .
the upper level is a public area with a replica of the tomb and lighting that will make it visible even at night . "
he did not mention libraries or dance-floors , but the scale of the project is still impressive .
during the first official visit , were members of the banda family .
" we are very happy with the progress being made on the construction site , " says their spokesperson , ken kandodo .
" we have been informed today that 10 % of the work has been done .
and the project is on schedule for completion in november .
if you consider what dr banda did for this country , all that is being planned is well deserved . "
whether there is hunger or not , the dead are always given their due respect henry chimunthu banda culture minister -lrb- no relation -rrb- but john tembo , banda 's former right-hand man and the leader of his party , has some reservations about the project .
" i am happy that it has started but i am not sure sufficient is being done to honour him , " he says .
" i think we are rushing it .
we want to make sure that it is done properly . "
since the project kicked off two months ago , people have expressed mixed feelings about the mausoleum .
waste of money while some support the government 's plans , others feel the authorities should concentrate on the acute shortage of food that is facing malawi this year .
" the project is good , because kamuzu is the father and founder of this nation , " said one man in the capital , lilongwe .
banda 's funeral was an elaborate affair " we are just wasting our 65 million for this graveyard , " said another man .
" people in malawi are suffering from different diseases and they are hungry .
the government should deal with this hunger .
so my view is that i am not happy with this mausoleum . "
culture minister henry chimunthu banda -lrb- no relation of the former ruler -rrb- says the government has a duty to honour the dead , as well as look after the living .
" culturally , whether there is hunger or not , the dead are always given their due respect , " he says .
" what we are doing here is not wasting money .
we are honouring the former head of state . "
hastings kamuzu banda died in november 1997 .
despite mixed feelings about the construction , it seems like the mausoleum will be finished in november - in time for the eighth anniversary of his death .
what do you think ?
is this a waste of money or a suitable memorial ?
how important is it to honour the dead ?
this debate has now closed .
here is a selection of your comments : as an african , it is saddening to see how ignorant our african leaders are .
kamuzu banda was a fighter for the liberation of malawi against white oppression , therefore an african hero .
from the moment he began oppressing his own people , he became a villan and history should hold him to account , just as the russians did in denouncing stalin after his death in 1953 .
people are dying of aids , hunger and poverty in malawi and yet their leaders are spending so much money on a grave and saying that despite the colossal death rate of their people the project should continue .
is it not enough that his casket was golden ?
by making such dubious financial decisions it shows that the ' cancer ' destroying africa is not just its debt but selfish , arrogant and small minded african politicans with the me , me , me and some more for me syndrome .
thando siziba , london , united kingdom a monument for the late dr. hastings kamuzu is needed to remind the squabbling now going on in the country that we miss him .
he kept malawi peaceful without any military intervention .
he was foresighted by introducing classics in schools for think tanks .
he encouraged farming by example .
tsimbamba tsakamutsu , lilongwe , malawi i feel the construction was supposed to be carried out soon after kamuzu died .
therefore i support it because i am sure malawi will never find another wise leader like him .
sydney mkata , blantyre in malawi another monument to despotism , just what africa needs .
andy , uk in most poor african coutries , like malawi , those in power decide the fate of the country , hence the fate of the poor majority .
malawian officials know well enough that malawi is one of the countries in africa that are suffering from acute shortage of food .
personally , i am dumbfounded at reading such irritating news - constructing a mausoleum for a dictator to the disappointment of poor malawians .
this immoral decision to go on with the construction is a reflection of the insensitivity of the current officails to thier people. weldu ghebreyesus , asmara , eritrea banda deserves a monument .
so does nkruma , azikiwe etc .
it is history and has nothing to do with being despot , dictator etc .
china has their mao everywhere , britain has wellington , churchill , france napoleon , de gaulle and italy mussolini .
and i am not in favour of angry citizens tearing down these monuments in the event of political upheavals etc .
let malawi build this monument no matter the cost .
monuments are vestiges that will continue to stand there and remind future generations of people and events that characterised a given period , century in any country 's history .
ngozi , geneva , switzerland it is a waste of money to built a mausoleum for kamuzu banda .
the man was a dictator.look at pope john paul ii 's coffin - so simple stop building that thing.feed the starving malawians .
chauncy mopho jere , los angeles , california .usa africa must monumentalise their history .
this way you get pride and self worth 500 years later .
if king leopold is honoured in belgium , despite the heart of darkness , then banda surely deserves a little footnote in africa 's monuments .
kip , joburg sa kamuzu deserves more than whatever we can do because malawi is where she is because of him - no tribal wars and peaceful .
colvin chirwa , nottingham brilliant colvin - malawi is also one of the poorest countries in the world and facing yet another year of famine .
i grew up under banda 's thumb , and , judging by your name , so did you .
do you remember being forced out of school by the police to stand on the road for hours to applaud his motorcade as it passed on it 's way to the airport ?
or nervously looking over your shoulder to see who might be spying on what you were saying ?
the man was a disgrace but still not as bad as the cronies that surrounded him and fed him the information they thought he wanted to know , cutting him off from the potholes and poverty that diseased my lovely country .
s , planet earth the mausoleum is indeed a befiting respect for the father and founder of the malawi nation , ngwazi dr hastings kamuzu banda .
but the timing !
and the moral / religious implication .
do people know that , today , now , somewhere in malawi , there 's somebody who does n't have any food in the house ?
oh , the merciful god , postpone the construction and feed the people .
kamchanda , leeds , uk kamuzu banda should have a monument bulit in his honour .
although a dictator , in the banda years crimes such as murder and theft were unheard of and his people were never starved .
banda did the best for malawi and always had malawi 's interests ay heart .
just look what democracy has done to malawi .
murders and theft are common and nearly all the houses have burglar bars and electric fencing to keep intruders out .
this was not the case in the banda years .
the currency has devalued from once being 2 kwacha to the pound to over 205 kwacha today .

the mausoleum is on course to be ready in november harvests in one of the world 's poorest countries have been poor once more .
the idea of building a mausoleum has been around for many years but construction only started following last year 's election victory of president bingu wa mutharika .
banda , the self-styled " president-for-life " ruled the country with an iron fist for three decades , but was finally beaten at the ballot box in 1994 in the country 's first multi-party elections .
after his death three years later , he was buried in a humble grave .
the multi-million dollar mausoleum is expected to have , among other things , a library , a dancing arena , a viewing bay for banda 's remains and a research centre where people can find out information about malawi 's history .
' well-deserved ' the project architect for banda 's mausoleum , knight munthali , says work is progressing well .
banda made himself ' president-for-life ' " you can see the chamber which houses the original tomb where kamuzu is resting , " he says .
" it is on two levels .
the lower level is the chamber .
the upper level is a public area with a replica of the tomb and lighting that will make it visible even at night . "
he did not mention libraries or dance-floors , but the scale of the project is still impressive .
during the first official visit , were members of the banda family .
" we are very happy with the progress being made on the construction site , " says their spokesperson , ken kandodo .
" we have been informed today that 10 % of the work has been done .
and the project is on schedule for completion in november .
if you consider what dr banda did for this country , all that is being planned is well deserved . "
whether there is hunger or not , the dead are always given their due respect henry chimunthu banda culture minister -lrb- no relation -rrb- but john tembo , banda 's former right-hand man and the leader of his party , has some reservations about the project .
" i am happy that it has started but i am not sure sufficient is being done to honour him , " he says .
" i think we are rushing it .
we want to make sure that it is done properly . "
since the project kicked off two months ago , people have expressed mixed feelings about the mausoleum .
waste of money while some support the government 's plans , others feel the authorities should concentrate on the acute shortage of food that is facing malawi this year .
" the project is good , because kamuzu is the father and founder of this nation , " said one man in the capital , lilongwe .
banda 's funeral was an elaborate affair " we are just wasting our 65 million for this graveyard , " said another man .
" people in malawi are suffering from different diseases and they are hungry .
the government should deal with this hunger .
so my view is that i am not happy with this mausoleum . "
culture minister henry chimunthu banda -lrb- no relation of the former ruler -rrb- says the government has a duty to honour the dead , as well as look after the living .
" culturally , whether there is hunger or not , the dead are always given their due respect , " he says .
" what we are doing here is not wasting money .
we are honouring the former head of state . "
hastings kamuzu banda died in november 1997 .
despite mixed feelings about the construction , it seems like the mausoleum will be finished in november - in time for the eighth anniversary of his death .
what do you think ?
is this a waste of money or a suitable memorial ?
how important is it to honour the dead ?
this debate has now closed .
here is a selection of your comments : as an african , it is saddening to see how ignorant our african leaders are .
kamuzu banda was a fighter for the liberation of malawi against white oppression , therefore an african hero .
from the moment he began oppressing his own people , he became a villan and history should hold him to account , just as the russians did in denouncing stalin after his death in 1953 .
people are dying of aids , hunger and poverty in malawi and yet their leaders are spending so much money on a grave and saying that despite the colossal death rate of their people the project should continue .
is it not enough that his casket was golden ?
by making such dubious financial decisions it shows that the ' cancer ' destroying africa is not just its debt but selfish , arrogant and small minded african politicans with the me , me , me and some more for me syndrome .
thando siziba , london , united kingdom a monument for the late dr. hastings kamuzu is needed to remind the squabbling now going on in the country that we miss him .
he kept malawi peaceful without any military intervention .
he was foresighted by introducing classics in schools for think tanks .
he encouraged farming by example .
tsimbamba tsakamutsu , lilongwe , malawi i feel the construction was supposed to be carried out soon after kamuzu died .
therefore i support it because i am sure malawi will never find another wise leader like him .
sydney mkata , blantyre in malawi another monument to despotism , just what africa needs .
andy , uk in most poor african coutries , like malawi , those in power decide the fate of the country , hence the fate of the poor majority .
malawian officials know well enough that malawi is one of the countries in africa that are suffering from acute shortage of food .
personally , i am dumbfounded at reading such irritating news - constructing a mausoleum for a dictator to the disappointment of poor malawians .
this immoral decision to go on with the construction is a reflection of the insensitivity of the current officails to thier people. weldu ghebreyesus , asmara , eritrea banda deserves a monument .
so does nkruma , azikiwe etc .
it is history and has nothing to do with being despot , dictator etc .
china has their mao everywhere , britain has wellington , churchill , france napoleon , de gaulle and italy mussolini .
and i am not in favour of angry citizens tearing down these monuments in the event of political upheavals etc .
let malawi build this monument no matter the cost .
monuments are vestiges that will continue to stand there and remind future generations of people and events that characterised a given period , century in any country 's history .
