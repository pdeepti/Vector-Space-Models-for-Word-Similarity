program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.10.2005 looking abroad for reform models großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other european countries could show germany how to save while what worked in other countries is n't a guarantee for success , many believe looking beyond germany 's borders could provide the inspiration needed to reform europe 's largest economy . how to get more people working and increase germany 's economic growth will be a critical topic when the members of a possible power-sharing coalition of the christian union and social democratic parties meet for negotiations next week . over past five years , germans have watched their country slip in european business and economic rankings .
suffering from 11 percent unemployment and anemic 1.6 percent growth , germany will need to see substantial economic improvement if it does n't want to break european union debt rules for a fourth time in a row next year .
it is doubtful that will happen , since germany 's 2005 growth rate is forecast at only 0.8 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could what helped the pound help germany too ?
organizing the budget great britain and sweden once had similar problems of low , sometimes even negative , growth and high unemployment on par with germany today .
both nations started turning themselves around by cutting state expenditures and privatizing state-run companies .
sweden then went on to invest 6 percent of its gdp in education and great britain instituted labor market reforms focused on cutting unemployment . " big eu states like germany , france and italy are struggling with their budgets and are not doing well economically , while smaller states that have a better grip on their budgets , such as great britain , denmark and the new members states in eastern europe , are doing better , " said benjamin scharnagel of the cologne institute for economic research . regardless of whether german politicians ultimately choose to mirror sweden 's , britain 's or another nation 's reform processes , they should note that the first step has always been cutting state spending , which has shown to be an effective way of increasing private investment across europe , scharnagel added . getting out of germany 's dire budgetary situation is an issue the grand coalition parties principally agree on .
that should also please officials in brussels , who are demanding germany meet regulations set out in the eu 's stability and growth pact by bringing the deficit down to less than 3 percent of the gdp by 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a grand coalition will have to focus on cutting spending " a grand coalition could achieve quite a bit when it comes to reorganizing state expenditures , " said carsten seim a spokesperson for the initiative for a new social market economy , a pro-business , pro-economic reform group .
" arguments that the next high deficits are inherited headaches from previous administrations are not possible in a grand coalition , and the reciprocal accusations over unpopular cuts would also not apply . " jobs could bring growth in addition to reigning in public finances , german growth could be stimulated by getting more people into jobs , following a system employed in great britain , according to henning klodt of the kiel institute for world economics . by the 1980s , britain was faced with an unemployment rate of over 11 percent and the country had sunk into an economic malaise .
in terms of national wealth , the uk was 8 percent below the average western european average .
according to many , prime minister margaret thatcher 's sometimes controversial reforms , which reduced public spending , lowered direct taxes , deregulated and privatized state-run companies , were key in turning britain 's economy around . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister margaret thatcher 's reforms started great britain on the road to recovery " thatcher 's reforms in great britain in the beginning of the 80s , which were also carried out by tony blair , demanded people either learn a new trade or do community work , " klodt said .
" the german hartz iv reforms started on this path but were not completely implemented , " he added , referring to the spate of controversial welfare and labor market reforms that chancellor gerhard schröder 's government instituted to spur economic growth . in fact , questions on whether the reforms went too far in cutting benefits for the unemployed kept chancellor gerhard schröder from applying all the changes and rebellion within his own ranks ultimately led to his decision to call early elections , klodt added . " now i fear that the spd will slow down labor market reforms that go further in this direction , " he said , referring to the chances that a grand coalition government would be able to enact serious reforms to the labor market .
" schröder was on that path and that is what led to his problems . " difficult to pick and choose reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more swedes are getting university degrees since the government began investing in education the concentration of both major parties ' attention on growth and unemployment should have a positive impact on the nation 's economic predicament , scharnagel said . " in a grand coalition we can nearly assume the economy will improve as it will have to focus on budget issues , " he added . if germany were to follow england 's lead , per capita gdp growth could increase to 2.1 percent by 2009 and leave germans with an extra 503 euros -lrb- $ 603 -rrb- in their pocket by the end of 2009 .
the swedish model would yield 1.9 percent growth and an average of 257 euros more per person , according to seim . but the experts agreed turning an economy around is n't as easy as simply applying programs that worked in other countries . " while it is worth considering what was successful in other countries , it is impossible to take individual elements from other nations , put them in place here and expect the same results , " klodt said .

taking the eyes off the ground while walking can be dangerous in berlin : the city 's streets are notoriously plastered with dog poop .
while many complain about the problem , one resident is now trying to profit from it . it 's probably not a good idea to try and figure out how karl-friedrich lentze came up with the idea to turn dog droppings into a building material . suffice it to say that he 's the proud owner of a karlchen , the terrier , and a reportedly nameless microwave .

they 're probably still recovering from the unemployed artist 's last patent application for a machine to straighten bananas . while lentze assured reporters that he 's " serious " about his inventions , there 's a good chance he 's just trying to pull people 's legs : in the past , he 's also suggested opening a brothel for dogs and suggested that berlin 's garbage collection service should cremate him after his death to save money . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dna against doggy droppings dna analysis is useful in solving crimes , determining parentage and making medical advances .

armed with a new album and nation-wide tour , he 's securing a reputation as the star of germany 's classical scene . with his carefully disheveled crop of dark hair , elegant suits and soulful gaze , martin stadtfeld has the kind of heartthrob appeal that helped launch the careers of other young male artists such as america 's josh groban or canada 's michael bublé .
but whereas they 've conquered international pop music charts with their operatic ballads and jazz covers , stadtfeld 's success has been in the realm of classical music . with the release last year of his first cd of bach 's goldberg variations , he established himself as one of the most successful bach interpreters of the younger generation . his age had everything to do with his overnight rise to fame .
only the audacity of youth could propel a promising pianist to , at his own cost , import a special piano from italy and rent studio time at a local radio station to record the formidable goldberg variations .
and only the confidence of a young talent with nothing to lose would see the recording be sent , unsolicited , to the berlin branch of sony music , unfazed by the fact that sony 's catalog already contains glenn gould 's monumental recording . chart-topping success the bosses at sony were suitably impressed with stadtfeld 's recording .
it was n't long before the cd took the number one spot on germany 's classical music charts , and stadtfeld was being toasted as a " sensation " and " the new face of classical music . " sony wanted stadtfeld to do for classical music what josh groban did for opera and michael bublé did for jazz - attract a whole new target group to the genre .
and indeed , a noticeable number of young fans can be seen in the concert halls where stadtfeld appears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " he 's more accessible than others , he 's completely unreserved , " said the vice president of sony classical in germany , michael brüggemann . spontaneous approach stadtfeld says he 's happy with the way his career is unfolding .
he 's finally getting to play the big venues and festivals he dreamed of as a child , enjoying reaching audiences with his spontaneous approach to great classical works . " it does n't put me under pressure , " stadtfeld said , adding that it 's important to " always play with passion and really go for it . " stadtfeld 's new cd features mozart concertos , though bach is also on the program as stadtfeld opens his german tour on thursday .
he 's being accompanied for the first time by an orchestra , the residentie orkest from the hague .

armed with a new album and nation-wide tour , he 's securing a reputation as the star of germany 's classical scene . with his carefully disheveled crop of dark hair , elegant suits and soulful gaze , martin stadtfeld has the kind of heartthrob appeal that helped launch the careers of other young male artists such as america 's josh groban or canada 's michael bublé .
but whereas they 've conquered international pop music charts with their operatic ballads and jazz covers , stadtfeld 's success has been in the realm of classical music . with the release last year of his first cd of bach 's goldberg variations , he established himself as one of the most successful bach interpreters of the younger generation . his age had everything to do with his overnight rise to fame .
only the audacity of youth could propel a promising pianist to , at his own cost , import a special piano from italy and rent studio time at a local radio station to record the formidable goldberg variations .
and only the confidence of a young talent with nothing to lose would see the recording be sent , unsolicited , to the berlin branch of sony music , unfazed by the fact that sony 's catalog already contains glenn gould 's monumental recording . chart-topping success the bosses at sony were suitably impressed with stadtfeld 's recording .
it was n't long before the cd took the number one spot on germany 's classical music charts , and stadtfeld was being toasted as a " sensation " and " the new face of classical music . " sony wanted stadtfeld to do for classical music what josh groban did for opera and michael bublé did for jazz - attract a whole new target group to the genre .
and indeed , a noticeable number of young fans can be seen in the concert halls where stadtfeld appears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " he 's more accessible than others , he 's completely unreserved , " said the vice president of sony classical in germany , michael brüggemann . spontaneous approach stadtfeld says he 's happy with the way his career is unfolding .
he 's finally getting to play the big venues and festivals he dreamed of as a child , enjoying reaching audiences with his spontaneous approach to great classical works . " it does n't put me under pressure , " stadtfeld said , adding that it 's important to " always play with passion and really go for it . " stadtfeld 's new cd features mozart concertos , though bach is also on the program as stadtfeld opens his german tour on thursday .
he 's being accompanied for the first time by an orchestra , the residentie orkest from the hague .

" if it appears that there are similar opportunities in other markets , we will do it , " lufthansa manager christoph klingenberg , who is responsible for the program , said thursday .

the company aims for the new service to quell the expansion of discount air carriers in germany .
lufthansa was able to offer the low-price tickets , which klingenberg said would be available for 20-30 percent of the seats on hamburg flights , thanks to cutting personnel costs and deploying larger planes more effectively .
klingenberg did n't indicate where else the low-cost tickets could be introduced .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.10.2005 looking abroad for reform models großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other european countries could show germany how to save while what worked in other countries is n't a guarantee for success , many believe looking beyond germany 's borders could provide the inspiration needed to reform europe 's largest economy . how to get more people working and increase germany 's economic growth will be a critical topic when the members of a possible power-sharing coalition of the christian union and social democratic parties meet for negotiations next week . over past five years , germans have watched their country slip in european business and economic rankings .
suffering from 11 percent unemployment and anemic 1.6 percent growth , germany will need to see substantial economic improvement if it does n't want to break european union debt rules for a fourth time in a row next year .
it is doubtful that will happen , since germany 's 2005 growth rate is forecast at only 0.8 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could what helped the pound help germany too ?
organizing the budget great britain and sweden once had similar problems of low , sometimes even negative , growth and high unemployment on par with germany today .
both nations started turning themselves around by cutting state expenditures and privatizing state-run companies .
sweden then went on to invest 6 percent of its gdp in education and great britain instituted labor market reforms focused on cutting unemployment . " big eu states like germany , france and italy are struggling with their budgets and are not doing well economically , while smaller states that have a better grip on their budgets , such as great britain , denmark and the new members states in eastern europe , are doing better , " said benjamin scharnagel of the cologne institute for economic research . regardless of whether german politicians ultimately choose to mirror sweden 's , britain 's or another nation 's reform processes , they should note that the first step has always been cutting state spending , which has shown to be an effective way of increasing private investment across europe , scharnagel added . getting out of germany 's dire budgetary situation is an issue the grand coalition parties principally agree on .
that should also please officials in brussels , who are demanding germany meet regulations set out in the eu 's stability and growth pact by bringing the deficit down to less than 3 percent of the gdp by 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a grand coalition will have to focus on cutting spending " a grand coalition could achieve quite a bit when it comes to reorganizing state expenditures , " said carsten seim a spokesperson for the initiative for a new social market economy , a pro-business , pro-economic reform group .
" arguments that the next high deficits are inherited headaches from previous administrations are not possible in a grand coalition , and the reciprocal accusations over unpopular cuts would also not apply . " jobs could bring growth in addition to reigning in public finances , german growth could be stimulated by getting more people into jobs , following a system employed in great britain , according to henning klodt of the kiel institute for world economics . by the 1980s , britain was faced with an unemployment rate of over 11 percent and the country had sunk into an economic malaise .

suffering from 11 percent unemployment and anemic 1.6 percent growth , germany will need to see substantial economic improvement if it does n't want to break european union debt rules for a fourth time in a row next year .
it is doubtful that will happen , since germany 's 2005 growth rate is forecast at only 0.8 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could what helped the pound help germany too ?
organizing the budget great britain and sweden once had similar problems of low , sometimes even negative , growth and high unemployment on par with germany today .
both nations started turning themselves around by cutting state expenditures and privatizing state-run companies .
sweden then went on to invest 6 percent of its gdp in education and great britain instituted labor market reforms focused on cutting unemployment . " big eu states like germany , france and italy are struggling with their budgets and are not doing well economically , while smaller states that have a better grip on their budgets , such as great britain , denmark and the new members states in eastern europe , are doing better , " said benjamin scharnagel of the cologne institute for economic research . regardless of whether german politicians ultimately choose to mirror sweden 's , britain 's or another nation 's reform processes , they should note that the first step has always been cutting state spending , which has shown to be an effective way of increasing private investment across europe , scharnagel added . getting out of germany 's dire budgetary situation is an issue the grand coalition parties principally agree on .
that should also please officials in brussels , who are demanding germany meet regulations set out in the eu 's stability and growth pact by bringing the deficit down to less than 3 percent of the gdp by 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a grand coalition will have to focus on cutting spending " a grand coalition could achieve quite a bit when it comes to reorganizing state expenditures , " said carsten seim a spokesperson for the initiative for a new social market economy , a pro-business , pro-economic reform group .
" arguments that the next high deficits are inherited headaches from previous administrations are not possible in a grand coalition , and the reciprocal accusations over unpopular cuts would also not apply . " jobs could bring growth in addition to reigning in public finances , german growth could be stimulated by getting more people into jobs , following a system employed in great britain , according to henning klodt of the kiel institute for world economics . by the 1980s , britain was faced with an unemployment rate of over 11 percent and the country had sunk into an economic malaise .
in terms of national wealth , the uk was 8 percent below the average western european average .
according to many , prime minister margaret thatcher 's sometimes controversial reforms , which reduced public spending , lowered direct taxes , deregulated and privatized state-run companies , were key in turning britain 's economy around . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister margaret thatcher 's reforms started great britain on the road to recovery " thatcher 's reforms in great britain in the beginning of the 80s , which were also carried out by tony blair , demanded people either learn a new trade or do community work , " klodt said .

13 , 1980 to prevent the kronos titan freighter from dumping poisonous acid into the baltic sea .
their protest was both successful and the start of german greenpeace . one group of activists tied their two life rafts in front of the kronos titan freighter , preventing it from motoring out to sea , and blocked the loading dock for the dilute acid the ship was meant to dump in the north sea .
other activists deposited piles of sick and mutated fish in front of both the bayer plant , which had disposed of its waste in the sea , and the hamburg hydrographic institute , which had approved the disposal method . thus , a new branch of greenpeace , in its ninth year internationally , was founded in germany .
the group did n't attract much attention here until , a year later , two of the environmental activists scaled and occupied a smokestack at the boehringer chemical plant in hamburg . " we climbed the smokestack in protest and attached a banner to it that said , ' only when the last tree is cleared , the last river is polluted , the last fish is caught , you will realize that one ca n't eat money , ' because it contaminated the whole area with highly poisonous chemicals , " explained gerhard wallmeyer , one of greenpeace germany 's founders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protesters tried to stop nuclear waste from being dumped in the gorleben facility in nov .
2004 the activists made headlines and , in subsequent years , the citizens ' initiative became one of the most influential german environmental organizations .
nowadays , greenpeace germany says it has 180 employees and almost 2,700 volunteers , a large number of whom are children and teenagers .
influential in larger scheme in 2004 , the group had around 41.5 million euros -lrb- $ 49.6 million -rrb- to spend on their spectacular protests .
over half a million donors have made greenpeace germany the richest greenpeace branch in the world as well as one of most influential financial backers of the international head office in amsterdam . there greenpeace makes all policy decisions , decides when and where to deploy its ships and coordinates international public relations .
the greenpeace head office devises campaigns focused on particular themes , such as nuclear energy , genetically modified food or the protection of endangered species , and the branches pursue the campaigns in their own countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrating at the eu council building in the 1990s , greenpeace made large strides in its development into a strictly hierarchical , internationally active environmental organization .
but the process did n't go smoothly .
critics complained that greenpeace turned voluntary activists into servants with no influence and that the group gave people who backed them absolution from their bad consciences , a modern form of selling indulgences . but greenpeace countered that its vast number of supporters was proof that the new organizational structure had been accepted and that a clear chain of command was a practical way to ensure efficient decision making and successful action .
from activists to lobbyists the group is now less visible on smokestacks and life rafts , although it does still launch attention-getting campaigns . it was germany 's thilo bode , who headed the national branch in the early 1990s - and the international organization from 1995 to 2000 - who is credited with having pushed greenpeace in a new direction - namely , to take on the world .
the group started lobbying international bodies , such as the un general assembly and global conferences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protested against wmds in march 2004 at the us embassy in berlin under bode 's command , greenpeace germany also took a new approach by developing technologies to cut emissions .
in 1991 , the group developed a method to bleach paper without employing environmentally harmful chlorine , which has since become standard in every printers shop .
a year later , the german branch presented the world 's first refrigerator that did not emit gases damaging to the environment - which has also become a standard . developing the refrigerator was also a form of protest , and a very effective one , according to wallmeyer . " either you change or we will market -lrb- our development -rrb- , become your competitor and show that one can make a more modern , more environmentally friendly technology , " he said .

influential in larger scheme in 2004 , the group had around 41.5 million euros -lrb- $ 49.6 million -rrb- to spend on their spectacular protests .
over half a million donors have made greenpeace germany the richest greenpeace branch in the world as well as one of most influential financial backers of the international head office in amsterdam . there greenpeace makes all policy decisions , decides when and where to deploy its ships and coordinates international public relations .
the greenpeace head office devises campaigns focused on particular themes , such as nuclear energy , genetically modified food or the protection of endangered species , and the branches pursue the campaigns in their own countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrating at the eu council building in the 1990s , greenpeace made large strides in its development into a strictly hierarchical , internationally active environmental organization .
but the process did n't go smoothly .
critics complained that greenpeace turned voluntary activists into servants with no influence and that the group gave people who backed them absolution from their bad consciences , a modern form of selling indulgences . but greenpeace countered that its vast number of supporters was proof that the new organizational structure had been accepted and that a clear chain of command was a practical way to ensure efficient decision making and successful action .
from activists to lobbyists the group is now less visible on smokestacks and life rafts , although it does still launch attention-getting campaigns . it was germany 's thilo bode , who headed the national branch in the early 1990s - and the international organization from 1995 to 2000 - who is credited with having pushed greenpeace in a new direction - namely , to take on the world .
the group started lobbying international bodies , such as the un general assembly and global conferences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protested against wmds in march 2004 at the us embassy in berlin under bode 's command , greenpeace germany also took a new approach by developing technologies to cut emissions .
in 1991 , the group developed a method to bleach paper without employing environmentally harmful chlorine , which has since become standard in every printers shop .
a year later , the german branch presented the world 's first refrigerator that did not emit gases damaging to the environment - which has also become a standard . developing the refrigerator was also a form of protest , and a very effective one , according to wallmeyer . " either you change or we will market -lrb- our development -rrb- , become your competitor and show that one can make a more modern , more environmentally friendly technology , " he said .
" if someone does n't behave in an acceptable fashion - environmentally or socially - he should feel it in his profits and we want to ensure that that 's the case .

" if it appears that there are similar opportunities in other markets , we will do it , " lufthansa manager christoph klingenberg , who is responsible for the program , said thursday .
starting saturday , passengers will be able to take lufthansa from hamburg to 23 european destinations and back for 99 euros -lrb- $ 118 -rrb- .
the company aims for the new service to quell the expansion of discount air carriers in germany .
lufthansa was able to offer the low-price tickets , which klingenberg said would be available for 20-30 percent of the seats on hamburg flights , thanks to cutting personnel costs and deploying larger planes more effectively .
klingenberg did n't indicate where else the low-cost tickets could be introduced .
but germany 's biggest airports , in frankfurt and munich , had already been ruled out in the past , according to reuters .
hamburg 's airport could profit from 1 million more passengers if lufthansa 's service is a success . dw-world.de communities court cheap airlines at a cost discount airlines such as ryanair are basing themselves at small german airports , far from big cities .
to attract the business , local communities are prepared to sweeten the deal , much to the competition 's displeasure .

trittin said that a meeting in bonn on wednesday of germany 's crisis unit for preventing animal diseases had concluded there was a problem with illegal imports of animals , animal parts and meat .
controls would be concentrated on flights arriving from places where the virus had been detected such as turkey and romania , he said , adding that the government would also step up efforts to make sure people were aware of the dangers .
romania 's chief veterinarian and the european commission said on thursday a strain of avian flu had been detected in samples from romanian ducks , which confirms that the virus has arrived in europe .
it is unknown whether it is the h5n1 strain , which has killed or forced the slaughter of millions of birds across asia and killed more than 60 people .
experts fear h5n1 could mutate into a virus which spreads easily among humans , creating a pandemic . dw-world.de eu : turkey 's bird flu dangerous to humans the eu said turkish poultry had been infected with the aggressive h5n1 strain of avian flu that can be dangerous to people .

a penalty from torsten frings saved germany 's blushes at the aol arena . it was germany 's first clean sheet in nine games but it could not disguise some shaky moments with stand-in captain oliver kahn called upon to make two crucial saves against a team ranked 45 places lower in the fifa rankings .

13 , 1980 to prevent the kronos titan freighter from dumping poisonous acid into the baltic sea .
their protest was both successful and the start of german greenpeace . one group of activists tied their two life rafts in front of the kronos titan freighter , preventing it from motoring out to sea , and blocked the loading dock for the dilute acid the ship was meant to dump in the north sea .
other activists deposited piles of sick and mutated fish in front of both the bayer plant , which had disposed of its waste in the sea , and the hamburg hydrographic institute , which had approved the disposal method . thus , a new branch of greenpeace , in its ninth year internationally , was founded in germany .
the group did n't attract much attention here until , a year later , two of the environmental activists scaled and occupied a smokestack at the boehringer chemical plant in hamburg . " we climbed the smokestack in protest and attached a banner to it that said , ' only when the last tree is cleared , the last river is polluted , the last fish is caught , you will realize that one ca n't eat money , ' because it contaminated the whole area with highly poisonous chemicals , " explained gerhard wallmeyer , one of greenpeace germany 's founders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protesters tried to stop nuclear waste from being dumped in the gorleben facility in nov .
2004 the activists made headlines and , in subsequent years , the citizens ' initiative became one of the most influential german environmental organizations .
nowadays , greenpeace germany says it has 180 employees and almost 2,700 volunteers , a large number of whom are children and teenagers .
influential in larger scheme in 2004 , the group had around 41.5 million euros -lrb- $ 49.6 million -rrb- to spend on their spectacular protests .
over half a million donors have made greenpeace germany the richest greenpeace branch in the world as well as one of most influential financial backers of the international head office in amsterdam . there greenpeace makes all policy decisions , decides when and where to deploy its ships and coordinates international public relations .
the greenpeace head office devises campaigns focused on particular themes , such as nuclear energy , genetically modified food or the protection of endangered species , and the branches pursue the campaigns in their own countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrating at the eu council building in the 1990s , greenpeace made large strides in its development into a strictly hierarchical , internationally active environmental organization .
but the process did n't go smoothly .
critics complained that greenpeace turned voluntary activists into servants with no influence and that the group gave people who backed them absolution from their bad consciences , a modern form of selling indulgences . but greenpeace countered that its vast number of supporters was proof that the new organizational structure had been accepted and that a clear chain of command was a practical way to ensure efficient decision making and successful action .
from activists to lobbyists the group is now less visible on smokestacks and life rafts , although it does still launch attention-getting campaigns . it was germany 's thilo bode , who headed the national branch in the early 1990s - and the international organization from 1995 to 2000 - who is credited with having pushed greenpeace in a new direction - namely , to take on the world .
the group started lobbying international bodies , such as the un general assembly and global conferences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protested against wmds in march 2004 at the us embassy in berlin under bode 's command , greenpeace germany also took a new approach by developing technologies to cut emissions .
in 1991 , the group developed a method to bleach paper without employing environmentally harmful chlorine , which has since become standard in every printers shop .
a year later , the german branch presented the world 's first refrigerator that did not emit gases damaging to the environment - which has also become a standard . developing the refrigerator was also a form of protest , and a very effective one , according to wallmeyer . " either you change or we will market -lrb- our development -rrb- , become your competitor and show that one can make a more modern , more environmentally friendly technology , " he said .
" if someone does n't behave in an acceptable fashion - environmentally or socially - he should feel it in his profits and we want to ensure that that 's the case .

the web site said that montgomery 's investment fund mecom , along with the two other parties , were expected to bid between 150 and 160 million euros -lrb- $ 180 to $ 192 million -rrb- for the publisher . the companies involved in the deal refused to confirm the reports or comment on the deal . " the most-hated manager " germany 's süddeutsche zeitung said in an article that the three-party consortium wanted to double the annual sales of the publisher , berliner verlag , which are current at 20 million euros .
it has been reported that the consortium would consider selling off its printing press as well as its berlin events magazine tip to reach that goal . in addition , the article reported that the intensive subscription campaign in the west of the city for the group 's flagship newspaper , berliner zeitung , would be stopped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daily mirror the tough measures would be in line with montgomery 's reputedly no-nonsense style .

" if the consortium did manage to take over the publisher , it would mark the first time that a german newspaper would be sold to foreign investors . however , it would not be the first time that montgomery and 3i have worked together .
the two bought ireland 's local press group together in 2003 and sold it at a profit last month . more changes afoot in berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der tagesspiegel currently , the the holtzbrinck media group is involved in separate negotiations about selling off its second publishing house in the german capital , which publishes another daily , der tagespiegel , spiegel online wrote .

trittin said that a meeting in bonn on wednesday of germany 's crisis unit for preventing animal diseases had concluded there was a problem with illegal imports of animals , animal parts and meat .
controls would be concentrated on flights arriving from places where the virus had been detected such as turkey and romania , he said , adding that the government would also step up efforts to make sure people were aware of the dangers .
romania 's chief veterinarian and the european commission said on thursday a strain of avian flu had been detected in samples from romanian ducks , which confirms that the virus has arrived in europe .
it is unknown whether it is the h5n1 strain , which has killed or forced the slaughter of millions of birds across asia and killed more than 60 people .
experts fear h5n1 could mutate into a virus which spreads easily among humans , creating a pandemic . dw-world.de eu : turkey 's bird flu dangerous to humans the eu said turkish poultry had been infected with the aggressive h5n1 strain of avian flu that can be dangerous to people .

trittin said that a meeting in bonn on wednesday of germany 's crisis unit for preventing animal diseases had concluded there was a problem with illegal imports of animals , animal parts and meat .
controls would be concentrated on flights arriving from places where the virus had been detected such as turkey and romania , he said , adding that the government would also step up efforts to make sure people were aware of the dangers .
romania 's chief veterinarian and the european commission said on thursday a strain of avian flu had been detected in samples from romanian ducks , which confirms that the virus has arrived in europe .
it is unknown whether it is the h5n1 strain , which has killed or forced the slaughter of millions of birds across asia and killed more than 60 people .
experts fear h5n1 could mutate into a virus which spreads easily among humans , creating a pandemic . dw-world.de eu : turkey 's bird flu dangerous to humans the eu said turkish poultry had been infected with the aggressive h5n1 strain of avian flu that can be dangerous to people .
romania also confirmed thursday that the virus had been detected in fowl in the danube delta .

trittin said that a meeting in bonn on wednesday of germany 's crisis unit for preventing animal diseases had concluded there was a problem with illegal imports of animals , animal parts and meat .
controls would be concentrated on flights arriving from places where the virus had been detected such as turkey and romania , he said , adding that the government would also step up efforts to make sure people were aware of the dangers .
romania 's chief veterinarian and the european commission said on thursday a strain of avian flu had been detected in samples from romanian ducks , which confirms that the virus has arrived in europe .
it is unknown whether it is the h5n1 strain , which has killed or forced the slaughter of millions of birds across asia and killed more than 60 people .
experts fear h5n1 could mutate into a virus which spreads easily among humans , creating a pandemic . dw-world.de eu : turkey 's bird flu dangerous to humans the eu said turkish poultry had been infected with the aggressive h5n1 strain of avian flu that can be dangerous to people .

they include interactive games which comment on maneuvers and strategies via an integrated computer as well as ravenburger 's high-tech game " the island " where a legendary island complete with a three-dimensional volcano can be chip-controlled with dramatic sound and light effects . the profusion of games on show this year is matched by the industry 's optimism about its financial prospects . german game makers say they expect a turnover boom for 2005 and 2006 .
for the current year , the industry is counting on growth of 6.5 percent , amounting to some 350 million euros . " fun and addictive " there are different theories as to why germans enjoy playing board games so much .
some say it has to do with the weather as dark , cold winter evenings create the perfect conditions for a cozy evening at home with a board game .
others say games provide a playful release and a form of interaction that 's rare in germany 's typically still society . " it 's definitely the interaction with the opponents , " dirk tedes , a games fan who also does public relations work for ravensburger , told deutsche welle .

" it 's a sensational cult puzzle , " said pohle . already immensely popular in europe and in germany with a few newspapers even running the puzzle daily , several game-makers at the fair have attempted to translate the logic-based numerical crossword into a board game that involves several different strategies . world cup mania and booming profits other showpieces include an adventurous children 's game called " akaba , " which won the german children 's game prize .
meant for kids aged five and above , the game involves blowing an airplane-shaped air pump to steer a carpet over an oriental bazaar and buy gifts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several games have been influenced by the world cup a slew of games also take their cue from the soccer world cup in germany next year .
the latter range from simple board games to four square meter felt pitches featuring large figures of german soccer stars oliver kahn and lukas podolski .
the emphasis is on tactics rather than physical power . another big trend is classical board games mixed with modern electronics .
they include interactive games which comment on maneuvers and strategies via an integrated computer as well as ravenburger 's high-tech game " the island " where a legendary island complete with a three-dimensional volcano can be chip-controlled with dramatic sound and light effects . the profusion of games on show this year is matched by the industry 's optimism about its financial prospects . german game makers say they expect a turnover boom for 2005 and 2006 .
for the current year , the industry is counting on growth of 6.5 percent , amounting to some 350 million euros . " fun and addictive " there are different theories as to why germans enjoy playing board games so much .
some say it has to do with the weather as dark , cold winter evenings create the perfect conditions for a cozy evening at home with a board game .
others say games provide a playful release and a form of interaction that 's rare in germany 's typically still society . " it 's definitely the interaction with the opponents , " dirk tedes , a games fan who also does public relations work for ravensburger , told deutsche welle . " or maybe it 's because most germans are n't very happy people most of the time , " tedes said jokingly . " it 's a sort of vent .

the waste products were supposed to have been processed for use only in dog or cat food .
the state of bavaria is planning a recall campaign to pull the meat out of stores , if the products can be identified .
bavaria 's environment minister , werner schnappauf , said while disgusting , the meat did not pose a health hazard , since the waste products had been heated to high temperatures during processing .
shipments of the waste products apparently made their way from germany to italy , switzerland , austria and france .
according to a report in the magazine stern , the meat company under investigation was convicted of fraud in 2003 and had no authorization to trade in food products . dw-world.de polluted feed scare shuts down german farms three german farms have been closed due to a suspicion that their animal feed had been contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals .

" if it appears that there are similar opportunities in other markets , we will do it , " lufthansa manager christoph klingenberg , who is responsible for the program , said thursday .
starting saturday , passengers will be able to take lufthansa from hamburg to 23 european destinations and back for 99 euros -lrb- $ 118 -rrb- .
the company aims for the new service to quell the expansion of discount air carriers in germany .
lufthansa was able to offer the low-price tickets , which klingenberg said would be available for 20-30 percent of the seats on hamburg flights , thanks to cutting personnel costs and deploying larger planes more effectively .
klingenberg did n't indicate where else the low-cost tickets could be introduced .
but germany 's biggest airports , in frankfurt and munich , had already been ruled out in the past , according to reuters .
hamburg 's airport could profit from 1 million more passengers if lufthansa 's service is a success . dw-world.de communities court cheap airlines at a cost discount airlines such as ryanair are basing themselves at small german airports , far from big cities .
to attract the business , local communities are prepared to sweeten the deal , much to the competition 's displeasure .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.10.2005 greenpeace germany celebrates 25 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attention-getting protests are still part of greenpeace 's repertoire a handful of environmental activists set out on oct .
13 , 1980 to prevent the kronos titan freighter from dumping poisonous acid into the baltic sea .
their protest was both successful and the start of german greenpeace . one group of activists tied their two life rafts in front of the kronos titan freighter , preventing it from motoring out to sea , and blocked the loading dock for the dilute acid the ship was meant to dump in the north sea .
other activists deposited piles of sick and mutated fish in front of both the bayer plant , which had disposed of its waste in the sea , and the hamburg hydrographic institute , which had approved the disposal method . thus , a new branch of greenpeace , in its ninth year internationally , was founded in germany .
the group did n't attract much attention here until , a year later , two of the environmental activists scaled and occupied a smokestack at the boehringer chemical plant in hamburg . " we climbed the smokestack in protest and attached a banner to it that said , ' only when the last tree is cleared , the last river is polluted , the last fish is caught , you will realize that one ca n't eat money , ' because it contaminated the whole area with highly poisonous chemicals , " explained gerhard wallmeyer , one of greenpeace germany 's founders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protesters tried to stop nuclear waste from being dumped in the gorleben facility in nov .
2004 the activists made headlines and , in subsequent years , the citizens ' initiative became one of the most influential german environmental organizations .
nowadays , greenpeace germany says it has 180 employees and almost 2,700 volunteers , a large number of whom are children and teenagers .
influential in larger scheme in 2004 , the group had around 41.5 million euros -lrb- $ 49.6 million -rrb- to spend on their spectacular protests .
over half a million donors have made greenpeace germany the richest greenpeace branch in the world as well as one of most influential financial backers of the international head office in amsterdam . there greenpeace makes all policy decisions , decides when and where to deploy its ships and coordinates international public relations .
the greenpeace head office devises campaigns focused on particular themes , such as nuclear energy , genetically modified food or the protection of endangered species , and the branches pursue the campaigns in their own countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrating at the eu council building in the 1990s , greenpeace made large strides in its development into a strictly hierarchical , internationally active environmental organization .
but the process did n't go smoothly .
critics complained that greenpeace turned voluntary activists into servants with no influence and that the group gave people who backed them absolution from their bad consciences , a modern form of selling indulgences . but greenpeace countered that its vast number of supporters was proof that the new organizational structure had been accepted and that a clear chain of command was a practical way to ensure efficient decision making and successful action .
from activists to lobbyists the group is now less visible on smokestacks and life rafts , although it does still launch attention-getting campaigns . it was germany 's thilo bode , who headed the national branch in the early 1990s - and the international organization from 1995 to 2000 - who is credited with having pushed greenpeace in a new direction - namely , to take on the world .
the group started lobbying international bodies , such as the un general assembly and global conferences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protested against wmds in march 2004 at the us embassy in berlin under bode 's command , greenpeace germany also took a new approach by developing technologies to cut emissions .
in 1991 , the group developed a method to bleach paper without employing environmentally harmful chlorine , which has since become standard in every printers shop .
a year later , the german branch presented the world 's first refrigerator that did not emit gases damaging to the environment - which has also become a standard . developing the refrigerator was also a form of protest , and a very effective one , according to wallmeyer . " either you change or we will market -lrb- our development -rrb- , become your competitor and show that one can make a more modern , more environmentally friendly technology , " he said .
" if someone does n't behave in an acceptable fashion - environmentally or socially - he should feel it in his profits and we want to ensure that that 's the case .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.10.2005 looking abroad for reform models großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other european countries could show germany how to save while what worked in other countries is n't a guarantee for success , many believe looking beyond germany 's borders could provide the inspiration needed to reform europe 's largest economy . how to get more people working and increase germany 's economic growth will be a critical topic when the members of a possible power-sharing coalition of the christian union and social democratic parties meet for negotiations next week . over past five years , germans have watched their country slip in european business and economic rankings .
suffering from 11 percent unemployment and anemic 1.6 percent growth , germany will need to see substantial economic improvement if it does n't want to break european union debt rules for a fourth time in a row next year .
it is doubtful that will happen , since germany 's 2005 growth rate is forecast at only 0.8 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could what helped the pound help germany too ?
organizing the budget great britain and sweden once had similar problems of low , sometimes even negative , growth and high unemployment on par with germany today .
both nations started turning themselves around by cutting state expenditures and privatizing state-run companies .
sweden then went on to invest 6 percent of its gdp in education and great britain instituted labor market reforms focused on cutting unemployment . " big eu states like germany , france and italy are struggling with their budgets and are not doing well economically , while smaller states that have a better grip on their budgets , such as great britain , denmark and the new members states in eastern europe , are doing better , " said benjamin scharnagel of the cologne institute for economic research . regardless of whether german politicians ultimately choose to mirror sweden 's , britain 's or another nation 's reform processes , they should note that the first step has always been cutting state spending , which has shown to be an effective way of increasing private investment across europe , scharnagel added . getting out of germany 's dire budgetary situation is an issue the grand coalition parties principally agree on .
that should also please officials in brussels , who are demanding germany meet regulations set out in the eu 's stability and growth pact by bringing the deficit down to less than 3 percent of the gdp by 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a grand coalition will have to focus on cutting spending " a grand coalition could achieve quite a bit when it comes to reorganizing state expenditures , " said carsten seim a spokesperson for the initiative for a new social market economy , a pro-business , pro-economic reform group .
" arguments that the next high deficits are inherited headaches from previous administrations are not possible in a grand coalition , and the reciprocal accusations over unpopular cuts would also not apply . " jobs could bring growth in addition to reigning in public finances , german growth could be stimulated by getting more people into jobs , following a system employed in great britain , according to henning klodt of the kiel institute for world economics . by the 1980s , britain was faced with an unemployment rate of over 11 percent and the country had sunk into an economic malaise .
in terms of national wealth , the uk was 8 percent below the average western european average .
according to many , prime minister margaret thatcher 's sometimes controversial reforms , which reduced public spending , lowered direct taxes , deregulated and privatized state-run companies , were key in turning britain 's economy around . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister margaret thatcher 's reforms started great britain on the road to recovery " thatcher 's reforms in great britain in the beginning of the 80s , which were also carried out by tony blair , demanded people either learn a new trade or do community work , " klodt said .
" the german hartz iv reforms started on this path but were not completely implemented , " he added , referring to the spate of controversial welfare and labor market reforms that chancellor gerhard schröder 's government instituted to spur economic growth . in fact , questions on whether the reforms went too far in cutting benefits for the unemployed kept chancellor gerhard schröder from applying all the changes and rebellion within his own ranks ultimately led to his decision to call early elections , klodt added . " now i fear that the spd will slow down labor market reforms that go further in this direction , " he said , referring to the chances that a grand coalition government would be able to enact serious reforms to the labor market .
" schröder was on that path and that is what led to his problems . " difficult to pick and choose reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more swedes are getting university degrees since the government began investing in education the concentration of both major parties ' attention on growth and unemployment should have a positive impact on the nation 's economic predicament , scharnagel said . " in a grand coalition we can nearly assume the economy will improve as it will have to focus on budget issues , " he added . if germany were to follow england 's lead , per capita gdp growth could increase to 2.1 percent by 2009 and leave germans with an extra 503 euros -lrb- $ 603 -rrb- in their pocket by the end of 2009 .
the swedish model would yield 1.9 percent growth and an average of 257 euros more per person , according to seim . but the experts agreed turning an economy around is n't as easy as simply applying programs that worked in other countries . " while it is worth considering what was successful in other countries , it is impossible to take individual elements from other nations , put them in place here and expect the same results , " klodt said .

some 150,000 visitors are expected to stream in over the next four days and test the more than 350 new games on show . " in germany we have the world 's largest variety in the games industry , " said ernst pohle , chairman of the expert group spiel . germany indeed has the widest range of board games , more and more of which are being translated and exported around the world .
industry experts estimate that the average german family owns about 30 games . court intrigues and brain teasers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poker can also be played at the ongoing game fair in essen in a taste of the mind-boggling things to come , industry representatives and insiders presented some of the highlights of this year 's gaming fair at a press conference a day earlier . the centerpiece was the awarding of the prestigious german games prize 2005 , which usually guarantees the winner booming sales over christmas .
this year 's pick was a rather unlikely strategy game called " louis xiv , " which is all about intrigues and power-struggles at the court of the sun king . created by author rüdiger dorn for the alea / ravensburger game publishing company , the game , which involved extensive historical research by its inventors , can be played by up to four players who try to get the coveted crowns and scepters by using bribes and connections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudoku is featured regularly in german dailies another huge attraction at this year 's game fair includes numerous variations of the iconic japanese brain teaser " sudoku . "
" it 's a sensational cult puzzle , " said pohle . already immensely popular in europe and in germany with a few newspapers even running the puzzle daily , several game-makers at the fair have attempted to translate the logic-based numerical crossword into a board game that involves several different strategies . world cup mania and booming profits other showpieces include an adventurous children 's game called " akaba , " which won the german children 's game prize .
meant for kids aged five and above , the game involves blowing an airplane-shaped air pump to steer a carpet over an oriental bazaar and buy gifts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several games have been influenced by the world cup a slew of games also take their cue from the soccer world cup in germany next year .
the latter range from simple board games to four square meter felt pitches featuring large figures of german soccer stars oliver kahn and lukas podolski .
the emphasis is on tactics rather than physical power . another big trend is classical board games mixed with modern electronics .
they include interactive games which comment on maneuvers and strategies via an integrated computer as well as ravenburger 's high-tech game " the island " where a legendary island complete with a three-dimensional volcano can be chip-controlled with dramatic sound and light effects . the profusion of games on show this year is matched by the industry 's optimism about its financial prospects . german game makers say they expect a turnover boom for 2005 and 2006 .
for the current year , the industry is counting on growth of 6.5 percent , amounting to some 350 million euros . " fun and addictive " there are different theories as to why germans enjoy playing board games so much .
some say it has to do with the weather as dark , cold winter evenings create the perfect conditions for a cozy evening at home with a board game .
others say games provide a playful release and a form of interaction that 's rare in germany 's typically still society . " it 's definitely the interaction with the opponents , " dirk tedes , a games fan who also does public relations work for ravensburger , told deutsche welle . " or maybe it 's because most germans are n't very happy people most of the time , " tedes said jokingly . " it 's a sort of vent .

the waste products were supposed to have been processed for use only in dog or cat food .
the state of bavaria is planning a recall campaign to pull the meat out of stores , if the products can be identified .
bavaria 's environment minister , werner schnappauf , said while disgusting , the meat did not pose a health hazard , since the waste products had been heated to high temperatures during processing .
shipments of the waste products apparently made their way from germany to italy , switzerland , austria and france .
according to a report in the magazine stern , the meat company under investigation was convicted of fraud in 2003 and had no authorization to trade in food products . dw-world.de polluted feed scare shuts down german farms three german farms have been closed due to a suspicion that their animal feed had been contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.10.2005 looking abroad for reform models großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other european countries could show germany how to save while what worked in other countries is n't a guarantee for success , many believe looking beyond germany 's borders could provide the inspiration needed to reform europe 's largest economy . how to get more people working and increase germany 's economic growth will be a critical topic when the members of a possible power-sharing coalition of the christian union and social democratic parties meet for negotiations next week . over past five years , germans have watched their country slip in european business and economic rankings .
suffering from 11 percent unemployment and anemic 1.6 percent growth , germany will need to see substantial economic improvement if it does n't want to break european union debt rules for a fourth time in a row next year .
it is doubtful that will happen , since germany 's 2005 growth rate is forecast at only 0.8 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could what helped the pound help germany too ?
organizing the budget great britain and sweden once had similar problems of low , sometimes even negative , growth and high unemployment on par with germany today .
both nations started turning themselves around by cutting state expenditures and privatizing state-run companies .
sweden then went on to invest 6 percent of its gdp in education and great britain instituted labor market reforms focused on cutting unemployment . " big eu states like germany , france and italy are struggling with their budgets and are not doing well economically , while smaller states that have a better grip on their budgets , such as great britain , denmark and the new members states in eastern europe , are doing better , " said benjamin scharnagel of the cologne institute for economic research . regardless of whether german politicians ultimately choose to mirror sweden 's , britain 's or another nation 's reform processes , they should note that the first step has always been cutting state spending , which has shown to be an effective way of increasing private investment across europe , scharnagel added . getting out of germany 's dire budgetary situation is an issue the grand coalition parties principally agree on .
that should also please officials in brussels , who are demanding germany meet regulations set out in the eu 's stability and growth pact by bringing the deficit down to less than 3 percent of the gdp by 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a grand coalition will have to focus on cutting spending " a grand coalition could achieve quite a bit when it comes to reorganizing state expenditures , " said carsten seim a spokesperson for the initiative for a new social market economy , a pro-business , pro-economic reform group .
" arguments that the next high deficits are inherited headaches from previous administrations are not possible in a grand coalition , and the reciprocal accusations over unpopular cuts would also not apply . " jobs could bring growth in addition to reigning in public finances , german growth could be stimulated by getting more people into jobs , following a system employed in great britain , according to henning klodt of the kiel institute for world economics . by the 1980s , britain was faced with an unemployment rate of over 11 percent and the country had sunk into an economic malaise .
in terms of national wealth , the uk was 8 percent below the average western european average .
according to many , prime minister margaret thatcher 's sometimes controversial reforms , which reduced public spending , lowered direct taxes , deregulated and privatized state-run companies , were key in turning britain 's economy around . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister margaret thatcher 's reforms started great britain on the road to recovery " thatcher 's reforms in great britain in the beginning of the 80s , which were also carried out by tony blair , demanded people either learn a new trade or do community work , " klodt said .
" the german hartz iv reforms started on this path but were not completely implemented , " he added , referring to the spate of controversial welfare and labor market reforms that chancellor gerhard schröder 's government instituted to spur economic growth . in fact , questions on whether the reforms went too far in cutting benefits for the unemployed kept chancellor gerhard schröder from applying all the changes and rebellion within his own ranks ultimately led to his decision to call early elections , klodt added . " now i fear that the spd will slow down labor market reforms that go further in this direction , " he said , referring to the chances that a grand coalition government would be able to enact serious reforms to the labor market .
" schröder was on that path and that is what led to his problems . " difficult to pick and choose reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more swedes are getting university degrees since the government began investing in education the concentration of both major parties ' attention on growth and unemployment should have a positive impact on the nation 's economic predicament , scharnagel said . " in a grand coalition we can nearly assume the economy will improve as it will have to focus on budget issues , " he added . if germany were to follow england 's lead , per capita gdp growth could increase to 2.1 percent by 2009 and leave germans with an extra 503 euros -lrb- $ 603 -rrb- in their pocket by the end of 2009 .
the swedish model would yield 1.9 percent growth and an average of 257 euros more per person , according to seim . but the experts agreed turning an economy around is n't as easy as simply applying programs that worked in other countries . " while it is worth considering what was successful in other countries , it is impossible to take individual elements from other nations , put them in place here and expect the same results , " klodt said .

their protest was both successful and the start of german greenpeace . one group of activists tied their two life rafts in front of the kronos titan freighter , preventing it from motoring out to sea , and blocked the loading dock for the dilute acid the ship was meant to dump in the north sea .
other activists deposited piles of sick and mutated fish in front of both the bayer plant , which had disposed of its waste in the sea , and the hamburg hydrographic institute , which had approved the disposal method . thus , a new branch of greenpeace , in its ninth year internationally , was founded in germany .
the group did n't attract much attention here until , a year later , two of the environmental activists scaled and occupied a smokestack at the boehringer chemical plant in hamburg . " we climbed the smokestack in protest and attached a banner to it that said , ' only when the last tree is cleared , the last river is polluted , the last fish is caught , you will realize that one ca n't eat money , ' because it contaminated the whole area with highly poisonous chemicals , " explained gerhard wallmeyer , one of greenpeace germany 's founders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protesters tried to stop nuclear waste from being dumped in the gorleben facility in nov .
2004 the activists made headlines and , in subsequent years , the citizens ' initiative became one of the most influential german environmental organizations .

critics complained that greenpeace turned voluntary activists into servants with no influence and that the group gave people who backed them absolution from their bad consciences , a modern form of selling indulgences . but greenpeace countered that its vast number of supporters was proof that the new organizational structure had been accepted and that a clear chain of command was a practical way to ensure efficient decision making and successful action .

13 , 1980 to prevent the kronos titan freighter from dumping poisonous acid into the baltic sea .
their protest was both successful and the start of german greenpeace . one group of activists tied their two life rafts in front of the kronos titan freighter , preventing it from motoring out to sea , and blocked the loading dock for the dilute acid the ship was meant to dump in the north sea .
other activists deposited piles of sick and mutated fish in front of both the bayer plant , which had disposed of its waste in the sea , and the hamburg hydrographic institute , which had approved the disposal method . thus , a new branch of greenpeace , in its ninth year internationally , was founded in germany .
the group did n't attract much attention here until , a year later , two of the environmental activists scaled and occupied a smokestack at the boehringer chemical plant in hamburg . " we climbed the smokestack in protest and attached a banner to it that said , ' only when the last tree is cleared , the last river is polluted , the last fish is caught , you will realize that one ca n't eat money , ' because it contaminated the whole area with highly poisonous chemicals , " explained gerhard wallmeyer , one of greenpeace germany 's founders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protesters tried to stop nuclear waste from being dumped in the gorleben facility in nov .
2004 the activists made headlines and , in subsequent years , the citizens ' initiative became one of the most influential german environmental organizations .
nowadays , greenpeace germany says it has 180 employees and almost 2,700 volunteers , a large number of whom are children and teenagers .
influential in larger scheme in 2004 , the group had around 41.5 million euros -lrb- $ 49.6 million -rrb- to spend on their spectacular protests .
over half a million donors have made greenpeace germany the richest greenpeace branch in the world as well as one of most influential financial backers of the international head office in amsterdam . there greenpeace makes all policy decisions , decides when and where to deploy its ships and coordinates international public relations .
the greenpeace head office devises campaigns focused on particular themes , such as nuclear energy , genetically modified food or the protection of endangered species , and the branches pursue the campaigns in their own countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrating at the eu council building in the 1990s , greenpeace made large strides in its development into a strictly hierarchical , internationally active environmental organization .
but the process did n't go smoothly .
critics complained that greenpeace turned voluntary activists into servants with no influence and that the group gave people who backed them absolution from their bad consciences , a modern form of selling indulgences . but greenpeace countered that its vast number of supporters was proof that the new organizational structure had been accepted and that a clear chain of command was a practical way to ensure efficient decision making and successful action .
from activists to lobbyists the group is now less visible on smokestacks and life rafts , although it does still launch attention-getting campaigns . it was germany 's thilo bode , who headed the national branch in the early 1990s - and the international organization from 1995 to 2000 - who is credited with having pushed greenpeace in a new direction - namely , to take on the world .
the group started lobbying international bodies , such as the un general assembly and global conferences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protested against wmds in march 2004 at the us embassy in berlin under bode 's command , greenpeace germany also took a new approach by developing technologies to cut emissions .
in 1991 , the group developed a method to bleach paper without employing environmentally harmful chlorine , which has since become standard in every printers shop .
a year later , the german branch presented the world 's first refrigerator that did not emit gases damaging to the environment - which has also become a standard . developing the refrigerator was also a form of protest , and a very effective one , according to wallmeyer . " either you change or we will market -lrb- our development -rrb- , become your competitor and show that one can make a more modern , more environmentally friendly technology , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.10.2005 bringing bach to the mtv generation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stadtfeld-factor is bringing new fans to classical music last year , 25-year-old martin stadtfeld shot to fame on a daring recording of bach 's goldberg variations .
armed with a new album and nation-wide tour , he 's securing a reputation as the star of germany 's classical scene . with his carefully disheveled crop of dark hair , elegant suits and soulful gaze , martin stadtfeld has the kind of heartthrob appeal that helped launch the careers of other young male artists such as america 's josh groban or canada 's michael bublé .
but whereas they 've conquered international pop music charts with their operatic ballads and jazz covers , stadtfeld 's success has been in the realm of classical music . with the release last year of his first cd of bach 's goldberg variations , he established himself as one of the most successful bach interpreters of the younger generation . his age had everything to do with his overnight rise to fame .
only the audacity of youth could propel a promising pianist to , at his own cost , import a special piano from italy and rent studio time at a local radio station to record the formidable goldberg variations .
and only the confidence of a young talent with nothing to lose would see the recording be sent , unsolicited , to the berlin branch of sony music , unfazed by the fact that sony 's catalog already contains glenn gould 's monumental recording . chart-topping success the bosses at sony were suitably impressed with stadtfeld 's recording .

armed with a new album and nation-wide tour , he 's securing a reputation as the star of germany 's classical scene . with his carefully disheveled crop of dark hair , elegant suits and soulful gaze , martin stadtfeld has the kind of heartthrob appeal that helped launch the careers of other young male artists such as america 's josh groban or canada 's michael bublé .
but whereas they 've conquered international pop music charts with their operatic ballads and jazz covers , stadtfeld 's success has been in the realm of classical music . with the release last year of his first cd of bach 's goldberg variations , he established himself as one of the most successful bach interpreters of the younger generation . his age had everything to do with his overnight rise to fame .
only the audacity of youth could propel a promising pianist to , at his own cost , import a special piano from italy and rent studio time at a local radio station to record the formidable goldberg variations .
and only the confidence of a young talent with nothing to lose would see the recording be sent , unsolicited , to the berlin branch of sony music , unfazed by the fact that sony 's catalog already contains glenn gould 's monumental recording . chart-topping success the bosses at sony were suitably impressed with stadtfeld 's recording .

a penalty from torsten frings saved germany 's blushes at the aol arena . it was germany 's first clean sheet in nine games but it could not disguise some shaky moments with stand-in captain oliver kahn called upon to make two crucial saves against a team ranked 45 places lower in the fifa rankings .

klinsmann reshuffled the defense with borussia dortmund 's christoph metzelder -lrb- photo , center -rrb- , whose career has been hindered by injuries , making his first appearance since february 2002 . in the opening exchanges metzelder was strolling around as germany made the running and bayern munich midfielder bastian schweinsteiger forced a fine save from li leilei in the 29th minute . china were far from overawed though and spurned two good chances to take the lead shortly before the interval .
in the 43rd minute xie hui was clear through on goal but curled the ball wide with kahn forced to rush out of his goal and narrow down the angle . sixty seconds later kahn was called into action again with defender sun jihai forcing a fine low save as the german backline wobbled . critical captain kahn passified by clean sheet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the positive thing was the result and the fact we did not concede , " said kahn .
" we have high expectations and this was far from a vintage performance .

the waste products were supposed to have been processed for use only in dog or cat food .
the state of bavaria is planning a recall campaign to pull the meat out of stores , if the products can be identified .
bavaria 's environment minister , werner schnappauf , said while disgusting , the meat did not pose a health hazard , since the waste products had been heated to high temperatures during processing .
shipments of the waste products apparently made their way from germany to italy , switzerland , austria and france .

trittin said that a meeting in bonn on wednesday of germany 's crisis unit for preventing animal diseases had concluded there was a problem with illegal imports of animals , animal parts and meat .
controls would be concentrated on flights arriving from places where the virus had been detected such as turkey and romania , he said , adding that the government would also step up efforts to make sure people were aware of the dangers .
romania 's chief veterinarian and the european commission said on thursday a strain of avian flu had been detected in samples from romanian ducks , which confirms that the virus has arrived in europe .

experts fear h5n1 could mutate into a virus which spreads easily among humans , creating a pandemic . dw-world.de eu : turkey 's bird flu dangerous to humans the eu said turkish poultry had been infected with the aggressive h5n1 strain of avian flu that can be dangerous to people .

" we have received all relevant anti-trust clearances for the sale of salomon to amer and the transaction is expected to close within the next week , " adidas-salomon said in a statement .
the group , which will henceforth be known simply as adidas , had announced in may that it planned to sell salomon to amer in a deal worth 485 million euros -lrb- $ 582 million -rrb- .
salomon specializes in winter sports , alpine and cross-country skis , snowboards and inline skates .
but it also includes mavic , a brand of bicycle components , the bonfire snowboard activities and the arc 'teryx outdoor and cliche skateboard brands .
by selling salomon , adidas wants to focus much more on running shoes where it competes directly with arch-rival and world leader , nike .
to this end , it recently launched a bid to acquire us sports shoe specialist reebok for 3.1 billion euros . dw-world.de puma battling to tear stripe off adidas all 's fair in love , war ... and the sportswear market , apparently .
while neither adidas or puma have much hope of eclipsing nike at the sales summit , the german rivals continue to battle it out for domestic superiority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 13.10.2005 bringing bach to the mtv generation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stadtfeld-factor is bringing new fans to classical music last year , 25-year-old martin stadtfeld shot to fame on a daring recording of bach 's goldberg variations .
armed with a new album and nation-wide tour , he 's securing a reputation as the star of germany 's classical scene . with his carefully disheveled crop of dark hair , elegant suits and soulful gaze , martin stadtfeld has the kind of heartthrob appeal that helped launch the careers of other young male artists such as america 's josh groban or canada 's michael bublé .
but whereas they 've conquered international pop music charts with their operatic ballads and jazz covers , stadtfeld 's success has been in the realm of classical music . with the release last year of his first cd of bach 's goldberg variations , he established himself as one of the most successful bach interpreters of the younger generation . his age had everything to do with his overnight rise to fame .
only the audacity of youth could propel a promising pianist to , at his own cost , import a special piano from italy and rent studio time at a local radio station to record the formidable goldberg variations .
and only the confidence of a young talent with nothing to lose would see the recording be sent , unsolicited , to the berlin branch of sony music , unfazed by the fact that sony 's catalog already contains glenn gould 's monumental recording . chart-topping success the bosses at sony were suitably impressed with stadtfeld 's recording .

their protest was both successful and the start of german greenpeace . one group of activists tied their two life rafts in front of the kronos titan freighter , preventing it from motoring out to sea , and blocked the loading dock for the dilute acid the ship was meant to dump in the north sea .
other activists deposited piles of sick and mutated fish in front of both the bayer plant , which had disposed of its waste in the sea , and the hamburg hydrographic institute , which had approved the disposal method . thus , a new branch of greenpeace , in its ninth year internationally , was founded in germany .
the group did n't attract much attention here until , a year later , two of the environmental activists scaled and occupied a smokestack at the boehringer chemical plant in hamburg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.10.2005 -pipe- 14:00 utc new meat scandal erupts in germany customs authorities are investigating a bavarian businessman , who allegedly declared tons of meat waste products as food fit for human consumption and shipped it within germany and to other european countries .
the waste products were supposed to have been processed for use only in dog or cat food .
the state of bavaria is planning a recall campaign to pull the meat out of stores , if the products can be identified .

" in germany we have the world 's largest variety in the games industry , " said ernst pohle , chairman of the expert group spiel . germany indeed has the widest range of board games , more and more of which are being translated and exported around the world .

meant for kids aged five and above , the game involves blowing an airplane-shaped air pump to steer a carpet over an oriental bazaar and buy gifts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several games have been influenced by the world cup a slew of games also take their cue from the soccer world cup in germany next year .
the latter range from simple board games to four square meter felt pitches featuring large figures of german soccer stars oliver kahn and lukas podolski .
the emphasis is on tactics rather than physical power . another big trend is classical board games mixed with modern electronics .
they include interactive games which comment on maneuvers and strategies via an integrated computer as well as ravenburger 's high-tech game " the island " where a legendary island complete with a three-dimensional volcano can be chip-controlled with dramatic sound and light effects . the profusion of games on show this year is matched by the industry 's optimism about its financial prospects . german game makers say they expect a turnover boom for 2005 and 2006 .
for the current year , the industry is counting on growth of 6.5 percent , amounting to some 350 million euros . " fun and addictive " there are different theories as to why germans enjoy playing board games so much .
some say it has to do with the weather as dark , cold winter evenings create the perfect conditions for a cozy evening at home with a board game .
others say games provide a playful release and a form of interaction that 's rare in germany 's typically still society . " it 's definitely the interaction with the opponents , " dirk tedes , a games fan who also does public relations work for ravensburger , told deutsche welle . " or maybe it 's because most germans are n't very happy people most of the time , " tedes said jokingly . " it 's a sort of vent .

some 150,000 visitors are expected to stream in over the next four days and test the more than 350 new games on show . " in germany we have the world 's largest variety in the games industry , " said ernst pohle , chairman of the expert group spiel . germany indeed has the widest range of board games , more and more of which are being translated and exported around the world .
industry experts estimate that the average german family owns about 30 games . court intrigues and brain teasers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poker can also be played at the ongoing game fair in essen in a taste of the mind-boggling things to come , industry representatives and insiders presented some of the highlights of this year 's gaming fair at a press conference a day earlier . the centerpiece was the awarding of the prestigious german games prize 2005 , which usually guarantees the winner booming sales over christmas .
this year 's pick was a rather unlikely strategy game called " louis xiv , " which is all about intrigues and power-struggles at the court of the sun king . created by author rüdiger dorn for the alea / ravensburger game publishing company , the game , which involved extensive historical research by its inventors , can be played by up to four players who try to get the coveted crowns and scepters by using bribes and connections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudoku is featured regularly in german dailies another huge attraction at this year 's game fair includes numerous variations of the iconic japanese brain teaser " sudoku . "
" it 's a sensational cult puzzle , " said pohle . already immensely popular in europe and in germany with a few newspapers even running the puzzle daily , several game-makers at the fair have attempted to translate the logic-based numerical crossword into a board game that involves several different strategies . world cup mania and booming profits other showpieces include an adventurous children 's game called " akaba , " which won the german children 's game prize .
meant for kids aged five and above , the game involves blowing an airplane-shaped air pump to steer a carpet over an oriental bazaar and buy gifts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several games have been influenced by the world cup a slew of games also take their cue from the soccer world cup in germany next year .

13 , 1980 to prevent the kronos titan freighter from dumping poisonous acid into the baltic sea .
their protest was both successful and the start of german greenpeace . one group of activists tied their two life rafts in front of the kronos titan freighter , preventing it from motoring out to sea , and blocked the loading dock for the dilute acid the ship was meant to dump in the north sea .
other activists deposited piles of sick and mutated fish in front of both the bayer plant , which had disposed of its waste in the sea , and the hamburg hydrographic institute , which had approved the disposal method . thus , a new branch of greenpeace , in its ninth year internationally , was founded in germany .
the group did n't attract much attention here until , a year later , two of the environmental activists scaled and occupied a smokestack at the boehringer chemical plant in hamburg . " we climbed the smokestack in protest and attached a banner to it that said , ' only when the last tree is cleared , the last river is polluted , the last fish is caught , you will realize that one ca n't eat money , ' because it contaminated the whole area with highly poisonous chemicals , " explained gerhard wallmeyer , one of greenpeace germany 's founders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protesters tried to stop nuclear waste from being dumped in the gorleben facility in nov .
2004 the activists made headlines and , in subsequent years , the citizens ' initiative became one of the most influential german environmental organizations .
nowadays , greenpeace germany says it has 180 employees and almost 2,700 volunteers , a large number of whom are children and teenagers .
influential in larger scheme in 2004 , the group had around 41.5 million euros -lrb- $ 49.6 million -rrb- to spend on their spectacular protests .
over half a million donors have made greenpeace germany the richest greenpeace branch in the world as well as one of most influential financial backers of the international head office in amsterdam . there greenpeace makes all policy decisions , decides when and where to deploy its ships and coordinates international public relations .
the greenpeace head office devises campaigns focused on particular themes , such as nuclear energy , genetically modified food or the protection of endangered species , and the branches pursue the campaigns in their own countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrating at the eu council building in the 1990s , greenpeace made large strides in its development into a strictly hierarchical , internationally active environmental organization .
but the process did n't go smoothly .
critics complained that greenpeace turned voluntary activists into servants with no influence and that the group gave people who backed them absolution from their bad consciences , a modern form of selling indulgences . but greenpeace countered that its vast number of supporters was proof that the new organizational structure had been accepted and that a clear chain of command was a practical way to ensure efficient decision making and successful action .
from activists to lobbyists the group is now less visible on smokestacks and life rafts , although it does still launch attention-getting campaigns . it was germany 's thilo bode , who headed the national branch in the early 1990s - and the international organization from 1995 to 2000 - who is credited with having pushed greenpeace in a new direction - namely , to take on the world .
the group started lobbying international bodies , such as the un general assembly and global conferences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protested against wmds in march 2004 at the us embassy in berlin under bode 's command , greenpeace germany also took a new approach by developing technologies to cut emissions .
in 1991 , the group developed a method to bleach paper without employing environmentally harmful chlorine , which has since become standard in every printers shop .
a year later , the german branch presented the world 's first refrigerator that did not emit gases damaging to the environment - which has also become a standard . developing the refrigerator was also a form of protest , and a very effective one , according to wallmeyer . " either you change or we will market -lrb- our development -rrb- , become your competitor and show that one can make a more modern , more environmentally friendly technology , " he said .
" if someone does n't behave in an acceptable fashion - environmentally or socially - he should feel it in his profits and we want to ensure that that 's the case .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.10.2005 looking abroad for reform models großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other european countries could show germany how to save while what worked in other countries is n't a guarantee for success , many believe looking beyond germany 's borders could provide the inspiration needed to reform europe 's largest economy . how to get more people working and increase germany 's economic growth will be a critical topic when the members of a possible power-sharing coalition of the christian union and social democratic parties meet for negotiations next week . over past five years , germans have watched their country slip in european business and economic rankings .
suffering from 11 percent unemployment and anemic 1.6 percent growth , germany will need to see substantial economic improvement if it does n't want to break european union debt rules for a fourth time in a row next year .
it is doubtful that will happen , since germany 's 2005 growth rate is forecast at only 0.8 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could what helped the pound help germany too ?
organizing the budget great britain and sweden once had similar problems of low , sometimes even negative , growth and high unemployment on par with germany today .
both nations started turning themselves around by cutting state expenditures and privatizing state-run companies .
sweden then went on to invest 6 percent of its gdp in education and great britain instituted labor market reforms focused on cutting unemployment . " big eu states like germany , france and italy are struggling with their budgets and are not doing well economically , while smaller states that have a better grip on their budgets , such as great britain , denmark and the new members states in eastern europe , are doing better , " said benjamin scharnagel of the cologne institute for economic research . regardless of whether german politicians ultimately choose to mirror sweden 's , britain 's or another nation 's reform processes , they should note that the first step has always been cutting state spending , which has shown to be an effective way of increasing private investment across europe , scharnagel added . getting out of germany 's dire budgetary situation is an issue the grand coalition parties principally agree on .
that should also please officials in brussels , who are demanding germany meet regulations set out in the eu 's stability and growth pact by bringing the deficit down to less than 3 percent of the gdp by 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a grand coalition will have to focus on cutting spending " a grand coalition could achieve quite a bit when it comes to reorganizing state expenditures , " said carsten seim a spokesperson for the initiative for a new social market economy , a pro-business , pro-economic reform group .
" arguments that the next high deficits are inherited headaches from previous administrations are not possible in a grand coalition , and the reciprocal accusations over unpopular cuts would also not apply . " jobs could bring growth in addition to reigning in public finances , german growth could be stimulated by getting more people into jobs , following a system employed in great britain , according to henning klodt of the kiel institute for world economics . by the 1980s , britain was faced with an unemployment rate of over 11 percent and the country had sunk into an economic malaise .
in terms of national wealth , the uk was 8 percent below the average western european average .
according to many , prime minister margaret thatcher 's sometimes controversial reforms , which reduced public spending , lowered direct taxes , deregulated and privatized state-run companies , were key in turning britain 's economy around . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister margaret thatcher 's reforms started great britain on the road to recovery " thatcher 's reforms in great britain in the beginning of the 80s , which were also carried out by tony blair , demanded people either learn a new trade or do community work , " klodt said .
" the german hartz iv reforms started on this path but were not completely implemented , " he added , referring to the spate of controversial welfare and labor market reforms that chancellor gerhard schröder 's government instituted to spur economic growth . in fact , questions on whether the reforms went too far in cutting benefits for the unemployed kept chancellor gerhard schröder from applying all the changes and rebellion within his own ranks ultimately led to his decision to call early elections , klodt added . " now i fear that the spd will slow down labor market reforms that go further in this direction , " he said , referring to the chances that a grand coalition government would be able to enact serious reforms to the labor market .
" schröder was on that path and that is what led to his problems . " difficult to pick and choose reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more swedes are getting university degrees since the government began investing in education the concentration of both major parties ' attention on growth and unemployment should have a positive impact on the nation 's economic predicament , scharnagel said . " in a grand coalition we can nearly assume the economy will improve as it will have to focus on budget issues , " he added . if germany were to follow england 's lead , per capita gdp growth could increase to 2.1 percent by 2009 and leave germans with an extra 503 euros -lrb- $ 603 -rrb- in their pocket by the end of 2009 .
the swedish model would yield 1.9 percent growth and an average of 257 euros more per person , according to seim . but the experts agreed turning an economy around is n't as easy as simply applying programs that worked in other countries . " while it is worth considering what was successful in other countries , it is impossible to take individual elements from other nations , put them in place here and expect the same results , " klodt said .
" you can not put reforms in a shopping basket then make them work at home . " sean sinico , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts hope merkel gets germany working angela merkel will have to soften some of her radical economic reforms if the so-called grand coalition of left and right is to get germany back to work , analysts said on monday .

" if it appears that there are similar opportunities in other markets , we will do it , " lufthansa manager christoph klingenberg , who is responsible for the program , said thursday .
starting saturday , passengers will be able to take lufthansa from hamburg to 23 european destinations and back for 99 euros -lrb- $ 118 -rrb- .
the company aims for the new service to quell the expansion of discount air carriers in germany .
lufthansa was able to offer the low-price tickets , which klingenberg said would be available for 20-30 percent of the seats on hamburg flights , thanks to cutting personnel costs and deploying larger planes more effectively .
klingenberg did n't indicate where else the low-cost tickets could be introduced .
but germany 's biggest airports , in frankfurt and munich , had already been ruled out in the past , according to reuters .
hamburg 's airport could profit from 1 million more passengers if lufthansa 's service is a success . dw-world.de communities court cheap airlines at a cost discount airlines such as ryanair are basing themselves at small german airports , far from big cities .
to attract the business , local communities are prepared to sweeten the deal , much to the competition 's displeasure .

the waste products were supposed to have been processed for use only in dog or cat food .
the state of bavaria is planning a recall campaign to pull the meat out of stores , if the products can be identified .
bavaria 's environment minister , werner schnappauf , said while disgusting , the meat did not pose a health hazard , since the waste products had been heated to high temperatures during processing .
shipments of the waste products apparently made their way from germany to italy , switzerland , austria and france .
according to a report in the magazine stern , the meat company under investigation was convicted of fraud in 2003 and had no authorization to trade in food products . dw-world.de polluted feed scare shuts down german farms three german farms have been closed due to a suspicion that their animal feed had been contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals .

13 , 1980 to prevent the kronos titan freighter from dumping poisonous acid into the baltic sea .
their protest was both successful and the start of german greenpeace . one group of activists tied their two life rafts in front of the kronos titan freighter , preventing it from motoring out to sea , and blocked the loading dock for the dilute acid the ship was meant to dump in the north sea .
other activists deposited piles of sick and mutated fish in front of both the bayer plant , which had disposed of its waste in the sea , and the hamburg hydrographic institute , which had approved the disposal method . thus , a new branch of greenpeace , in its ninth year internationally , was founded in germany .
the group did n't attract much attention here until , a year later , two of the environmental activists scaled and occupied a smokestack at the boehringer chemical plant in hamburg . " we climbed the smokestack in protest and attached a banner to it that said , ' only when the last tree is cleared , the last river is polluted , the last fish is caught , you will realize that one ca n't eat money , ' because it contaminated the whole area with highly poisonous chemicals , " explained gerhard wallmeyer , one of greenpeace germany 's founders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protesters tried to stop nuclear waste from being dumped in the gorleben facility in nov .
2004 the activists made headlines and , in subsequent years , the citizens ' initiative became one of the most influential german environmental organizations .
nowadays , greenpeace germany says it has 180 employees and almost 2,700 volunteers , a large number of whom are children and teenagers .
influential in larger scheme in 2004 , the group had around 41.5 million euros -lrb- $ 49.6 million -rrb- to spend on their spectacular protests .
over half a million donors have made greenpeace germany the richest greenpeace branch in the world as well as one of most influential financial backers of the international head office in amsterdam . there greenpeace makes all policy decisions , decides when and where to deploy its ships and coordinates international public relations .

13 , 1980 to prevent the kronos titan freighter from dumping poisonous acid into the baltic sea .
their protest was both successful and the start of german greenpeace . one group of activists tied their two life rafts in front of the kronos titan freighter , preventing it from motoring out to sea , and blocked the loading dock for the dilute acid the ship was meant to dump in the north sea .
other activists deposited piles of sick and mutated fish in front of both the bayer plant , which had disposed of its waste in the sea , and the hamburg hydrographic institute , which had approved the disposal method . thus , a new branch of greenpeace , in its ninth year internationally , was founded in germany .
the group did n't attract much attention here until , a year later , two of the environmental activists scaled and occupied a smokestack at the boehringer chemical plant in hamburg . " we climbed the smokestack in protest and attached a banner to it that said , ' only when the last tree is cleared , the last river is polluted , the last fish is caught , you will realize that one ca n't eat money , ' because it contaminated the whole area with highly poisonous chemicals , " explained gerhard wallmeyer , one of greenpeace germany 's founders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protesters tried to stop nuclear waste from being dumped in the gorleben facility in nov .
2004 the activists made headlines and , in subsequent years , the citizens ' initiative became one of the most influential german environmental organizations .
nowadays , greenpeace germany says it has 180 employees and almost 2,700 volunteers , a large number of whom are children and teenagers .
influential in larger scheme in 2004 , the group had around 41.5 million euros -lrb- $ 49.6 million -rrb- to spend on their spectacular protests .
over half a million donors have made greenpeace germany the richest greenpeace branch in the world as well as one of most influential financial backers of the international head office in amsterdam . there greenpeace makes all policy decisions , decides when and where to deploy its ships and coordinates international public relations .
the greenpeace head office devises campaigns focused on particular themes , such as nuclear energy , genetically modified food or the protection of endangered species , and the branches pursue the campaigns in their own countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrating at the eu council building in the 1990s , greenpeace made large strides in its development into a strictly hierarchical , internationally active environmental organization .
but the process did n't go smoothly .
critics complained that greenpeace turned voluntary activists into servants with no influence and that the group gave people who backed them absolution from their bad consciences , a modern form of selling indulgences . but greenpeace countered that its vast number of supporters was proof that the new organizational structure had been accepted and that a clear chain of command was a practical way to ensure efficient decision making and successful action .
from activists to lobbyists the group is now less visible on smokestacks and life rafts , although it does still launch attention-getting campaigns . it was germany 's thilo bode , who headed the national branch in the early 1990s - and the international organization from 1995 to 2000 - who is credited with having pushed greenpeace in a new direction - namely , to take on the world .
the group started lobbying international bodies , such as the un general assembly and global conferences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protested against wmds in march 2004 at the us embassy in berlin under bode 's command , greenpeace germany also took a new approach by developing technologies to cut emissions .
in 1991 , the group developed a method to bleach paper without employing environmentally harmful chlorine , which has since become standard in every printers shop .
a year later , the german branch presented the world 's first refrigerator that did not emit gases damaging to the environment - which has also become a standard . developing the refrigerator was also a form of protest , and a very effective one , according to wallmeyer . " either you change or we will market -lrb- our development -rrb- , become your competitor and show that one can make a more modern , more environmentally friendly technology , " he said .
" if someone does n't behave in an acceptable fashion - environmentally or socially - he should feel it in his profits and we want to ensure that that 's the case .

some 150,000 visitors are expected to stream in over the next four days and test the more than 350 new games on show . " in germany we have the world 's largest variety in the games industry , " said ernst pohle , chairman of the expert group spiel . germany indeed has the widest range of board games , more and more of which are being translated and exported around the world .
industry experts estimate that the average german family owns about 30 games . court intrigues and brain teasers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poker can also be played at the ongoing game fair in essen in a taste of the mind-boggling things to come , industry representatives and insiders presented some of the highlights of this year 's gaming fair at a press conference a day earlier . the centerpiece was the awarding of the prestigious german games prize 2005 , which usually guarantees the winner booming sales over christmas .
this year 's pick was a rather unlikely strategy game called " louis xiv , " which is all about intrigues and power-struggles at the court of the sun king . created by author rüdiger dorn for the alea / ravensburger game publishing company , the game , which involved extensive historical research by its inventors , can be played by up to four players who try to get the coveted crowns and scepters by using bribes and connections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sudoku is featured regularly in german dailies another huge attraction at this year 's game fair includes numerous variations of the iconic japanese brain teaser " sudoku . "
" it 's a sensational cult puzzle , " said pohle . already immensely popular in europe and in germany with a few newspapers even running the puzzle daily , several game-makers at the fair have attempted to translate the logic-based numerical crossword into a board game that involves several different strategies . world cup mania and booming profits other showpieces include an adventurous children 's game called " akaba , " which won the german children 's game prize .
meant for kids aged five and above , the game involves blowing an airplane-shaped air pump to steer a carpet over an oriental bazaar and buy gifts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several games have been influenced by the world cup a slew of games also take their cue from the soccer world cup in germany next year .
the latter range from simple board games to four square meter felt pitches featuring large figures of german soccer stars oliver kahn and lukas podolski .
the emphasis is on tactics rather than physical power . another big trend is classical board games mixed with modern electronics .
they include interactive games which comment on maneuvers and strategies via an integrated computer as well as ravenburger 's high-tech game " the island " where a legendary island complete with a three-dimensional volcano can be chip-controlled with dramatic sound and light effects . the profusion of games on show this year is matched by the industry 's optimism about its financial prospects . german game makers say they expect a turnover boom for 2005 and 2006 .
for the current year , the industry is counting on growth of 6.5 percent , amounting to some 350 million euros . " fun and addictive " there are different theories as to why germans enjoy playing board games so much .
some say it has to do with the weather as dark , cold winter evenings create the perfect conditions for a cozy evening at home with a board game .
others say games provide a playful release and a form of interaction that 's rare in germany 's typically still society . " it 's definitely the interaction with the opponents , " dirk tedes , a games fan who also does public relations work for ravensburger , told deutsche welle . " or maybe it 's because most germans are n't very happy people most of the time , " tedes said jokingly . " it 's a sort of vent .

a penalty from torsten frings saved germany 's blushes at the aol arena . it was germany 's first clean sheet in nine games but it could not disguise some shaky moments with stand-in captain oliver kahn called upon to make two crucial saves against a team ranked 45 places lower in the fifa rankings .

armed with a new album and nation-wide tour , he 's securing a reputation as the star of germany 's classical scene . with his carefully disheveled crop of dark hair , elegant suits and soulful gaze , martin stadtfeld has the kind of heartthrob appeal that helped launch the careers of other young male artists such as america 's josh groban or canada 's michael bublé .
but whereas they 've conquered international pop music charts with their operatic ballads and jazz covers , stadtfeld 's success has been in the realm of classical music . with the release last year of his first cd of bach 's goldberg variations , he established himself as one of the most successful bach interpreters of the younger generation . his age had everything to do with his overnight rise to fame .
only the audacity of youth could propel a promising pianist to , at his own cost , import a special piano from italy and rent studio time at a local radio station to record the formidable goldberg variations .
and only the confidence of a young talent with nothing to lose would see the recording be sent , unsolicited , to the berlin branch of sony music , unfazed by the fact that sony 's catalog already contains glenn gould 's monumental recording . chart-topping success the bosses at sony were suitably impressed with stadtfeld 's recording .
it was n't long before the cd took the number one spot on germany 's classical music charts , and stadtfeld was being toasted as a " sensation " and " the new face of classical music . " sony wanted stadtfeld to do for classical music what josh groban did for opera and michael bublé did for jazz - attract a whole new target group to the genre .
and indeed , a noticeable number of young fans can be seen in the concert halls where stadtfeld appears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " he 's more accessible than others , he 's completely unreserved , " said the vice president of sony classical in germany , michael brüggemann . spontaneous approach stadtfeld says he 's happy with the way his career is unfolding .
he 's finally getting to play the big venues and festivals he dreamed of as a child , enjoying reaching audiences with his spontaneous approach to great classical works . " it does n't put me under pressure , " stadtfeld said , adding that it 's important to " always play with passion and really go for it . " stadtfeld 's new cd features mozart concertos , though bach is also on the program as stadtfeld opens his german tour on thursday .
he 's being accompanied for the first time by an orchestra , the residentie orkest from the hague .
the 25-year-old is also quickly gathering new fans outside of his native germany , with sony classical reporting interest in stadtfeld in other european countries , the united states , and japan . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de long-lost bach cantata revived a piece by german composer johann sebastian bach lost for decades has come to life in japan this week , shedding new light on the 18th-century baroque master .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.10.2005 looking abroad for reform models großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other european countries could show germany how to save while what worked in other countries is n't a guarantee for success , many believe looking beyond germany 's borders could provide the inspiration needed to reform europe 's largest economy . how to get more people working and increase germany 's economic growth will be a critical topic when the members of a possible power-sharing coalition of the christian union and social democratic parties meet for negotiations next week . over past five years , germans have watched their country slip in european business and economic rankings .
suffering from 11 percent unemployment and anemic 1.6 percent growth , germany will need to see substantial economic improvement if it does n't want to break european union debt rules for a fourth time in a row next year .
it is doubtful that will happen , since germany 's 2005 growth rate is forecast at only 0.8 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could what helped the pound help germany too ?
organizing the budget great britain and sweden once had similar problems of low , sometimes even negative , growth and high unemployment on par with germany today .
both nations started turning themselves around by cutting state expenditures and privatizing state-run companies .
sweden then went on to invest 6 percent of its gdp in education and great britain instituted labor market reforms focused on cutting unemployment . " big eu states like germany , france and italy are struggling with their budgets and are not doing well economically , while smaller states that have a better grip on their budgets , such as great britain , denmark and the new members states in eastern europe , are doing better , " said benjamin scharnagel of the cologne institute for economic research . regardless of whether german politicians ultimately choose to mirror sweden 's , britain 's or another nation 's reform processes , they should note that the first step has always been cutting state spending , which has shown to be an effective way of increasing private investment across europe , scharnagel added . getting out of germany 's dire budgetary situation is an issue the grand coalition parties principally agree on .
that should also please officials in brussels , who are demanding germany meet regulations set out in the eu 's stability and growth pact by bringing the deficit down to less than 3 percent of the gdp by 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a grand coalition will have to focus on cutting spending " a grand coalition could achieve quite a bit when it comes to reorganizing state expenditures , " said carsten seim a spokesperson for the initiative for a new social market economy , a pro-business , pro-economic reform group .
" arguments that the next high deficits are inherited headaches from previous administrations are not possible in a grand coalition , and the reciprocal accusations over unpopular cuts would also not apply . " jobs could bring growth in addition to reigning in public finances , german growth could be stimulated by getting more people into jobs , following a system employed in great britain , according to henning klodt of the kiel institute for world economics . by the 1980s , britain was faced with an unemployment rate of over 11 percent and the country had sunk into an economic malaise .
in terms of national wealth , the uk was 8 percent below the average western european average .
according to many , prime minister margaret thatcher 's sometimes controversial reforms , which reduced public spending , lowered direct taxes , deregulated and privatized state-run companies , were key in turning britain 's economy around . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister margaret thatcher 's reforms started great britain on the road to recovery " thatcher 's reforms in great britain in the beginning of the 80s , which were also carried out by tony blair , demanded people either learn a new trade or do community work , " klodt said .
" the german hartz iv reforms started on this path but were not completely implemented , " he added , referring to the spate of controversial welfare and labor market reforms that chancellor gerhard schröder 's government instituted to spur economic growth . in fact , questions on whether the reforms went too far in cutting benefits for the unemployed kept chancellor gerhard schröder from applying all the changes and rebellion within his own ranks ultimately led to his decision to call early elections , klodt added . " now i fear that the spd will slow down labor market reforms that go further in this direction , " he said , referring to the chances that a grand coalition government would be able to enact serious reforms to the labor market .
" schröder was on that path and that is what led to his problems . " difficult to pick and choose reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more swedes are getting university degrees since the government began investing in education the concentration of both major parties ' attention on growth and unemployment should have a positive impact on the nation 's economic predicament , scharnagel said . " in a grand coalition we can nearly assume the economy will improve as it will have to focus on budget issues , " he added . if germany were to follow england 's lead , per capita gdp growth could increase to 2.1 percent by 2009 and leave germans with an extra 503 euros -lrb- $ 603 -rrb- in their pocket by the end of 2009 .
the swedish model would yield 1.9 percent growth and an average of 257 euros more per person , according to seim . but the experts agreed turning an economy around is n't as easy as simply applying programs that worked in other countries . " while it is worth considering what was successful in other countries , it is impossible to take individual elements from other nations , put them in place here and expect the same results , " klodt said .

spd leaders are expected to announce more cabinet posts later thursday . going into the a meeting of the social democratic party 's leadership to discuss the new ministers in a grand coalition with the christian democrats under angela merkel 's leadership , eichel said that he would not keep the job he has held for six and a half years .

steinbrück led germany 's most populous state from 2002 until earlier this year , when his governing red-green coalition lost power to christian democrats and free-market liberal free democrats .
the election defeat caused german chancellor gerhard schröder to push for national elections .
steinbrück is seen as a member of the spd 's right wing .
he previously also served as north rhine-westphalia 's finance minister .

armed with a new album and nation-wide tour , he 's securing a reputation as the star of germany 's classical scene . with his carefully disheveled crop of dark hair , elegant suits and soulful gaze , martin stadtfeld has the kind of heartthrob appeal that helped launch the careers of other young male artists such as america 's josh groban or canada 's michael bublé .
but whereas they 've conquered international pop music charts with their operatic ballads and jazz covers , stadtfeld 's success has been in the realm of classical music . with the release last year of his first cd of bach 's goldberg variations , he established himself as one of the most successful bach interpreters of the younger generation . his age had everything to do with his overnight rise to fame .
only the audacity of youth could propel a promising pianist to , at his own cost , import a special piano from italy and rent studio time at a local radio station to record the formidable goldberg variations .
and only the confidence of a young talent with nothing to lose would see the recording be sent , unsolicited , to the berlin branch of sony music , unfazed by the fact that sony 's catalog already contains glenn gould 's monumental recording . chart-topping success the bosses at sony were suitably impressed with stadtfeld 's recording .
it was n't long before the cd took the number one spot on germany 's classical music charts , and stadtfeld was being toasted as a " sensation " and " the new face of classical music . " sony wanted stadtfeld to do for classical music what josh groban did for opera and michael bublé did for jazz - attract a whole new target group to the genre .
and indeed , a noticeable number of young fans can be seen in the concert halls where stadtfeld appears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " he 's more accessible than others , he 's completely unreserved , " said the vice president of sony classical in germany , michael brüggemann . spontaneous approach stadtfeld says he 's happy with the way his career is unfolding .
he 's finally getting to play the big venues and festivals he dreamed of as a child , enjoying reaching audiences with his spontaneous approach to great classical works . " it does n't put me under pressure , " stadtfeld said , adding that it 's important to " always play with passion and really go for it . " stadtfeld 's new cd features mozart concertos , though bach is also on the program as stadtfeld opens his german tour on thursday .
he 's being accompanied for the first time by an orchestra , the residentie orkest from the hague .
the 25-year-old is also quickly gathering new fans outside of his native germany , with sony classical reporting interest in stadtfeld in other european countries , the united states , and japan . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de long-lost bach cantata revived a piece by german composer johann sebastian bach lost for decades has come to life in japan this week , shedding new light on the 18th-century baroque master .

armed with a new album and nation-wide tour , he 's securing a reputation as the star of germany 's classical scene . with his carefully disheveled crop of dark hair , elegant suits and soulful gaze , martin stadtfeld has the kind of heartthrob appeal that helped launch the careers of other young male artists such as america 's josh groban or canada 's michael bublé .
but whereas they 've conquered international pop music charts with their operatic ballads and jazz covers , stadtfeld 's success has been in the realm of classical music . with the release last year of his first cd of bach 's goldberg variations , he established himself as one of the most successful bach interpreters of the younger generation . his age had everything to do with his overnight rise to fame .
only the audacity of youth could propel a promising pianist to , at his own cost , import a special piano from italy and rent studio time at a local radio station to record the formidable goldberg variations .
and only the confidence of a young talent with nothing to lose would see the recording be sent , unsolicited , to the berlin branch of sony music , unfazed by the fact that sony 's catalog already contains glenn gould 's monumental recording . chart-topping success the bosses at sony were suitably impressed with stadtfeld 's recording .
it was n't long before the cd took the number one spot on germany 's classical music charts , and stadtfeld was being toasted as a " sensation " and " the new face of classical music . " sony wanted stadtfeld to do for classical music what josh groban did for opera and michael bublé did for jazz - attract a whole new target group to the genre .
and indeed , a noticeable number of young fans can be seen in the concert halls where stadtfeld appears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " he 's more accessible than others , he 's completely unreserved , " said the vice president of sony classical in germany , michael brüggemann . spontaneous approach stadtfeld says he 's happy with the way his career is unfolding .
he 's finally getting to play the big venues and festivals he dreamed of as a child , enjoying reaching audiences with his spontaneous approach to great classical works . " it does n't put me under pressure , " stadtfeld said , adding that it 's important to " always play with passion and really go for it . " stadtfeld 's new cd features mozart concertos , though bach is also on the program as stadtfeld opens his german tour on thursday .
he 's being accompanied for the first time by an orchestra , the residentie orkest from the hague .
the 25-year-old is also quickly gathering new fans outside of his native germany , with sony classical reporting interest in stadtfeld in other european countries , the united states , and japan . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de long-lost bach cantata revived a piece by german composer johann sebastian bach lost for decades has come to life in japan this week , shedding new light on the 18th-century baroque master .

" if it appears that there are similar opportunities in other markets , we will do it , " lufthansa manager christoph klingenberg , who is responsible for the program , said thursday .
starting saturday , passengers will be able to take lufthansa from hamburg to 23 european destinations and back for 99 euros -lrb- $ 118 -rrb- .
the company aims for the new service to quell the expansion of discount air carriers in germany .
lufthansa was able to offer the low-price tickets , which klingenberg said would be available for 20-30 percent of the seats on hamburg flights , thanks to cutting personnel costs and deploying larger planes more effectively .
klingenberg did n't indicate where else the low-cost tickets could be introduced .
but germany 's biggest airports , in frankfurt and munich , had already been ruled out in the past , according to reuters .
hamburg 's airport could profit from 1 million more passengers if lufthansa 's service is a success . dw-world.de communities court cheap airlines at a cost discount airlines such as ryanair are basing themselves at small german airports , far from big cities .
to attract the business , local communities are prepared to sweeten the deal , much to the competition 's displeasure .

the waste products were supposed to have been processed for use only in dog or cat food .
the state of bavaria is planning a recall campaign to pull the meat out of stores , if the products can be identified .
bavaria 's environment minister , werner schnappauf , said while disgusting , the meat did not pose a health hazard , since the waste products had been heated to high temperatures during processing .
shipments of the waste products apparently made their way from germany to italy , switzerland , austria and france .
according to a report in the magazine stern , the meat company under investigation was convicted of fraud in 2003 and had no authorization to trade in food products . dw-world.de polluted feed scare shuts down german farms three german farms have been closed due to a suspicion that their animal feed had been contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.10.2005 greenpeace germany celebrates 25 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attention-getting protests are still part of greenpeace 's repertoire a handful of environmental activists set out on oct .
13 , 1980 to prevent the kronos titan freighter from dumping poisonous acid into the baltic sea .
their protest was both successful and the start of german greenpeace . one group of activists tied their two life rafts in front of the kronos titan freighter , preventing it from motoring out to sea , and blocked the loading dock for the dilute acid the ship was meant to dump in the north sea .
other activists deposited piles of sick and mutated fish in front of both the bayer plant , which had disposed of its waste in the sea , and the hamburg hydrographic institute , which had approved the disposal method . thus , a new branch of greenpeace , in its ninth year internationally , was founded in germany .
the group did n't attract much attention here until , a year later , two of the environmental activists scaled and occupied a smokestack at the boehringer chemical plant in hamburg . " we climbed the smokestack in protest and attached a banner to it that said , ' only when the last tree is cleared , the last river is polluted , the last fish is caught , you will realize that one ca n't eat money , ' because it contaminated the whole area with highly poisonous chemicals , " explained gerhard wallmeyer , one of greenpeace germany 's founders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protesters tried to stop nuclear waste from being dumped in the gorleben facility in nov .
2004 the activists made headlines and , in subsequent years , the citizens ' initiative became one of the most influential german environmental organizations .
nowadays , greenpeace germany says it has 180 employees and almost 2,700 volunteers , a large number of whom are children and teenagers .
influential in larger scheme in 2004 , the group had around 41.5 million euros -lrb- $ 49.6 million -rrb- to spend on their spectacular protests .
over half a million donors have made greenpeace germany the richest greenpeace branch in the world as well as one of most influential financial backers of the international head office in amsterdam . there greenpeace makes all policy decisions , decides when and where to deploy its ships and coordinates international public relations .
the greenpeace head office devises campaigns focused on particular themes , such as nuclear energy , genetically modified food or the protection of endangered species , and the branches pursue the campaigns in their own countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrating at the eu council building in the 1990s , greenpeace made large strides in its development into a strictly hierarchical , internationally active environmental organization .
but the process did n't go smoothly .
critics complained that greenpeace turned voluntary activists into servants with no influence and that the group gave people who backed them absolution from their bad consciences , a modern form of selling indulgences . but greenpeace countered that its vast number of supporters was proof that the new organizational structure had been accepted and that a clear chain of command was a practical way to ensure efficient decision making and successful action .
from activists to lobbyists the group is now less visible on smokestacks and life rafts , although it does still launch attention-getting campaigns . it was germany 's thilo bode , who headed the national branch in the early 1990s - and the international organization from 1995 to 2000 - who is credited with having pushed greenpeace in a new direction - namely , to take on the world .
the group started lobbying international bodies , such as the un general assembly and global conferences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protested against wmds in march 2004 at the us embassy in berlin under bode 's command , greenpeace germany also took a new approach by developing technologies to cut emissions .
in 1991 , the group developed a method to bleach paper without employing environmentally harmful chlorine , which has since become standard in every printers shop .
a year later , the german branch presented the world 's first refrigerator that did not emit gases damaging to the environment - which has also become a standard . developing the refrigerator was also a form of protest , and a very effective one , according to wallmeyer . " either you change or we will market -lrb- our development -rrb- , become your competitor and show that one can make a more modern , more environmentally friendly technology , " he said .
" if someone does n't behave in an acceptable fashion - environmentally or socially - he should feel it in his profits and we want to ensure that that 's the case .

13 , 1980 to prevent the kronos titan freighter from dumping poisonous acid into the baltic sea .
their protest was both successful and the start of german greenpeace . one group of activists tied their two life rafts in front of the kronos titan freighter , preventing it from motoring out to sea , and blocked the loading dock for the dilute acid the ship was meant to dump in the north sea .
other activists deposited piles of sick and mutated fish in front of both the bayer plant , which had disposed of its waste in the sea , and the hamburg hydrographic institute , which had approved the disposal method . thus , a new branch of greenpeace , in its ninth year internationally , was founded in germany .
the group did n't attract much attention here until , a year later , two of the environmental activists scaled and occupied a smokestack at the boehringer chemical plant in hamburg . " we climbed the smokestack in protest and attached a banner to it that said , ' only when the last tree is cleared , the last river is polluted , the last fish is caught , you will realize that one ca n't eat money , ' because it contaminated the whole area with highly poisonous chemicals , " explained gerhard wallmeyer , one of greenpeace germany 's founders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protesters tried to stop nuclear waste from being dumped in the gorleben facility in nov .
2004 the activists made headlines and , in subsequent years , the citizens ' initiative became one of the most influential german environmental organizations .
nowadays , greenpeace germany says it has 180 employees and almost 2,700 volunteers , a large number of whom are children and teenagers .

over half a million donors have made greenpeace germany the richest greenpeace branch in the world as well as one of most influential financial backers of the international head office in amsterdam . there greenpeace makes all policy decisions , decides when and where to deploy its ships and coordinates international public relations .
the greenpeace head office devises campaigns focused on particular themes , such as nuclear energy , genetically modified food or the protection of endangered species , and the branches pursue the campaigns in their own countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrating at the eu council building in the 1990s , greenpeace made large strides in its development into a strictly hierarchical , internationally active environmental organization .
but the process did n't go smoothly .
critics complained that greenpeace turned voluntary activists into servants with no influence and that the group gave people who backed them absolution from their bad consciences , a modern form of selling indulgences . but greenpeace countered that its vast number of supporters was proof that the new organizational structure had been accepted and that a clear chain of command was a practical way to ensure efficient decision making and successful action .
from activists to lobbyists the group is now less visible on smokestacks and life rafts , although it does still launch attention-getting campaigns . it was germany 's thilo bode , who headed the national branch in the early 1990s - and the international organization from 1995 to 2000 - who is credited with having pushed greenpeace in a new direction - namely , to take on the world .

a year later , the german branch presented the world 's first refrigerator that did not emit gases damaging to the environment - which has also become a standard . developing the refrigerator was also a form of protest , and a very effective one , according to wallmeyer . " either you change or we will market -lrb- our development -rrb- , become your competitor and show that one can make a more modern , more environmentally friendly technology , " he said .

" it 's a sensational cult puzzle , " said pohle . already immensely popular in europe and in germany with a few newspapers even running the puzzle daily , several game-makers at the fair have attempted to translate the logic-based numerical crossword into a board game that involves several different strategies . world cup mania and booming profits other showpieces include an adventurous children 's game called " akaba , " which won the german children 's game prize .
meant for kids aged five and above , the game involves blowing an airplane-shaped air pump to steer a carpet over an oriental bazaar and buy gifts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : several games have been influenced by the world cup a slew of games also take their cue from the soccer world cup in germany next year .
the latter range from simple board games to four square meter felt pitches featuring large figures of german soccer stars oliver kahn and lukas podolski .

they include interactive games which comment on maneuvers and strategies via an integrated computer as well as ravenburger 's high-tech game " the island " where a legendary island complete with a three-dimensional volcano can be chip-controlled with dramatic sound and light effects . the profusion of games on show this year is matched by the industry 's optimism about its financial prospects . german game makers say they expect a turnover boom for 2005 and 2006 .
for the current year , the industry is counting on growth of 6.5 percent , amounting to some 350 million euros . " fun and addictive " there are different theories as to why germans enjoy playing board games so much .
some say it has to do with the weather as dark , cold winter evenings create the perfect conditions for a cozy evening at home with a board game .
others say games provide a playful release and a form of interaction that 's rare in germany 's typically still society . " it 's definitely the interaction with the opponents , " dirk tedes , a games fan who also does public relations work for ravensburger , told deutsche welle . " or maybe it 's because most germans are n't very happy people most of the time , " tedes said jokingly . " it 's a sort of vent .

drafted in the wake of the july 7 bombings in london , the legislation also calls for a ban on those who glorify terrorism , sell extremist books , receive or provide terrorist training , and prepare to commit attacks . however , members of both the governing and opposition parties , human rights activists and muslim leaders are mobilizing against many aspects of the bill , which they claim tramples on civil liberties and could even fuel the anger behind terrorism . even the government 's own independent terror watchdog , lord alexander carlile , warned that the extended detention period could be challenged in the courts under the human rights act . among other concerns he expressed in a report on the bill , carlile said a planned new offense of attending a terrorist training camp could lead to responsible journalists being prosecuted . wide-spread protests on wednesday evening , london 's mayor ken livingstone - a member of blair 's labour party - led a protest meeting against the law , attended muslim leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many worry the new laws will alienate peaceful muslims living in britain .

armed with a new album and nation-wide tour , he 's securing a reputation as the star of germany 's classical scene . with his carefully disheveled crop of dark hair , elegant suits and soulful gaze , martin stadtfeld has the kind of heartthrob appeal that helped launch the careers of other young male artists such as america 's josh groban or canada 's michael bublé .
but whereas they 've conquered international pop music charts with their operatic ballads and jazz covers , stadtfeld 's success has been in the realm of classical music . with the release last year of his first cd of bach 's goldberg variations , he established himself as one of the most successful bach interpreters of the younger generation . his age had everything to do with his overnight rise to fame .

a penalty from torsten frings saved germany 's blushes at the aol arena . it was germany 's first clean sheet in nine games but it could not disguise some shaky moments with stand-in captain oliver kahn called upon to make two crucial saves against a team ranked 45 places lower in the fifa rankings .
" this was good preparation for the world cup as we will come up against teams who just sit back and defend like china did tonight , " declared germany manager jürgen klinsmann .
" we have to find a way to break them down but we showed during the confederations cup that we can do that when required . " but despite getting his team back to winning ways , klinsmann faced derision from the home crowd , a reaction the coach said he completely understood .
" i completely understand them for jeering , " klinsmann said . candid coach admits fans had right to boo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi takes it on the chin .
" one expects us to score a few more goals against china .
the expectations are higher .
but it 's not a problem .

but we understand the fans .
next time we hope to get applause again . " " the boos are part of the game , " added klinsmann , who enjoyed a love-hate relationship with many sets of fans during his long and varied playing career . speaking of the criticism now coming his ways as trainer of the national team he said , " coaches also have to go through the experience .

klinsmann reshuffled the defense with borussia dortmund 's christoph metzelder -lrb- photo , center -rrb- , whose career has been hindered by injuries , making his first appearance since february 2002 . in the opening exchanges metzelder was strolling around as germany made the running and bayern munich midfielder bastian schweinsteiger forced a fine save from li leilei in the 29th minute . china were far from overawed though and spurned two good chances to take the lead shortly before the interval .
in the 43rd minute xie hui was clear through on goal but curled the ball wide with kahn forced to rush out of his goal and narrow down the angle . sixty seconds later kahn was called into action again with defender sun jihai forcing a fine low save as the german backline wobbled . critical captain kahn passified by clean sheet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the positive thing was the result and the fact we did not concede , " said kahn .
" we have high expectations and this was far from a vintage performance .
but the win gives us a push in the right direction . " the half-time break came to germany 's rescue and six minutes into the second period the hosts were in front .
bernd schneider was felled by china captain li weifeng in the box and frings watched with relief as his spot-kick crept past goalkeeper leilei . chinese come out of game with honor intact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zhu guanghu " germany were under pressure after losing to turkey but they coped well , " concluded china coach zhu guanghu .
" we can take a lot out of this game and it will aid our development .

suffering from 11 percent unemployment and anemic 1.6 percent growth , germany will need to see substantial economic improvement if it does n't want to break european union debt rules for a fourth time in a row next year .
it is doubtful that will happen , since germany 's 2005 growth rate is forecast at only 0.8 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could what helped the pound help germany too ?
organizing the budget great britain and sweden once had similar problems of low , sometimes even negative , growth and high unemployment on par with germany today .
both nations started turning themselves around by cutting state expenditures and privatizing state-run companies .
sweden then went on to invest 6 percent of its gdp in education and great britain instituted labor market reforms focused on cutting unemployment . " big eu states like germany , france and italy are struggling with their budgets and are not doing well economically , while smaller states that have a better grip on their budgets , such as great britain , denmark and the new members states in eastern europe , are doing better , " said benjamin scharnagel of the cologne institute for economic research . regardless of whether german politicians ultimately choose to mirror sweden 's , britain 's or another nation 's reform processes , they should note that the first step has always been cutting state spending , which has shown to be an effective way of increasing private investment across europe , scharnagel added . getting out of germany 's dire budgetary situation is an issue the grand coalition parties principally agree on .
that should also please officials in brussels , who are demanding germany meet regulations set out in the eu 's stability and growth pact by bringing the deficit down to less than 3 percent of the gdp by 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a grand coalition will have to focus on cutting spending " a grand coalition could achieve quite a bit when it comes to reorganizing state expenditures , " said carsten seim a spokesperson for the initiative for a new social market economy , a pro-business , pro-economic reform group .
" arguments that the next high deficits are inherited headaches from previous administrations are not possible in a grand coalition , and the reciprocal accusations over unpopular cuts would also not apply . " jobs could bring growth in addition to reigning in public finances , german growth could be stimulated by getting more people into jobs , following a system employed in great britain , according to henning klodt of the kiel institute for world economics . by the 1980s , britain was faced with an unemployment rate of over 11 percent and the country had sunk into an economic malaise .
in terms of national wealth , the uk was 8 percent below the average western european average .
according to many , prime minister margaret thatcher 's sometimes controversial reforms , which reduced public spending , lowered direct taxes , deregulated and privatized state-run companies , were key in turning britain 's economy around . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister margaret thatcher 's reforms started great britain on the road to recovery " thatcher 's reforms in great britain in the beginning of the 80s , which were also carried out by tony blair , demanded people either learn a new trade or do community work , " klodt said .
" the german hartz iv reforms started on this path but were not completely implemented , " he added , referring to the spate of controversial welfare and labor market reforms that chancellor gerhard schröder 's government instituted to spur economic growth . in fact , questions on whether the reforms went too far in cutting benefits for the unemployed kept chancellor gerhard schröder from applying all the changes and rebellion within his own ranks ultimately led to his decision to call early elections , klodt added . " now i fear that the spd will slow down labor market reforms that go further in this direction , " he said , referring to the chances that a grand coalition government would be able to enact serious reforms to the labor market .
" schröder was on that path and that is what led to his problems . " difficult to pick and choose reforms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more swedes are getting university degrees since the government began investing in education the concentration of both major parties ' attention on growth and unemployment should have a positive impact on the nation 's economic predicament , scharnagel said . " in a grand coalition we can nearly assume the economy will improve as it will have to focus on budget issues , " he added . if germany were to follow england 's lead , per capita gdp growth could increase to 2.1 percent by 2009 and leave germans with an extra 503 euros -lrb- $ 603 -rrb- in their pocket by the end of 2009 .
the swedish model would yield 1.9 percent growth and an average of 257 euros more per person , according to seim . but the experts agreed turning an economy around is n't as easy as simply applying programs that worked in other countries . " while it is worth considering what was successful in other countries , it is impossible to take individual elements from other nations , put them in place here and expect the same results , " klodt said .

in the 43rd minute xie hui was clear through on goal but curled the ball wide with kahn forced to rush out of his goal and narrow down the angle . sixty seconds later kahn was called into action again with defender sun jihai forcing a fine low save as the german backline wobbled . critical captain kahn passified by clean sheet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the positive thing was the result and the fact we did not concede , " said kahn .

armed with a new album and nation-wide tour , he 's securing a reputation as the star of germany 's classical scene . with his carefully disheveled crop of dark hair , elegant suits and soulful gaze , martin stadtfeld has the kind of heartthrob appeal that helped launch the careers of other young male artists such as america 's josh groban or canada 's michael bublé .
but whereas they 've conquered international pop music charts with their operatic ballads and jazz covers , stadtfeld 's success has been in the realm of classical music . with the release last year of his first cd of bach 's goldberg variations , he established himself as one of the most successful bach interpreters of the younger generation . his age had everything to do with his overnight rise to fame .
only the audacity of youth could propel a promising pianist to , at his own cost , import a special piano from italy and rent studio time at a local radio station to record the formidable goldberg variations .
and only the confidence of a young talent with nothing to lose would see the recording be sent , unsolicited , to the berlin branch of sony music , unfazed by the fact that sony 's catalog already contains glenn gould 's monumental recording . chart-topping success the bosses at sony were suitably impressed with stadtfeld 's recording .
it was n't long before the cd took the number one spot on germany 's classical music charts , and stadtfeld was being toasted as a " sensation " and " the new face of classical music . " sony wanted stadtfeld to do for classical music what josh groban did for opera and michael bublé did for jazz - attract a whole new target group to the genre .
and indeed , a noticeable number of young fans can be seen in the concert halls where stadtfeld appears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " he 's more accessible than others , he 's completely unreserved , " said the vice president of sony classical in germany , michael brüggemann . spontaneous approach stadtfeld says he 's happy with the way his career is unfolding .
he 's finally getting to play the big venues and festivals he dreamed of as a child , enjoying reaching audiences with his spontaneous approach to great classical works . " it does n't put me under pressure , " stadtfeld said , adding that it 's important to " always play with passion and really go for it . " stadtfeld 's new cd features mozart concertos , though bach is also on the program as stadtfeld opens his german tour on thursday .
he 's being accompanied for the first time by an orchestra , the residentie orkest from the hague .
the 25-year-old is also quickly gathering new fans outside of his native germany , with sony classical reporting interest in stadtfeld in other european countries , the united states , and japan . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de long-lost bach cantata revived a piece by german composer johann sebastian bach lost for decades has come to life in japan this week , shedding new light on the 18th-century baroque master .

a penalty from torsten frings saved germany 's blushes at the aol arena . it was germany 's first clean sheet in nine games but it could not disguise some shaky moments with stand-in captain oliver kahn called upon to make two crucial saves against a team ranked 45 places lower in the fifa rankings .
" this was good preparation for the world cup as we will come up against teams who just sit back and defend like china did tonight , " declared germany manager jürgen klinsmann .
" we have to find a way to break them down but we showed during the confederations cup that we can do that when required . " but despite getting his team back to winning ways , klinsmann faced derision from the home crowd , a reaction the coach said he completely understood .
" i completely understand them for jeering , " klinsmann said . candid coach admits fans had right to boo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi takes it on the chin .
" one expects us to score a few more goals against china .
the expectations are higher .
but it 's not a problem .
obviously we ’ d rather be cheered .
but we understand the fans .
next time we hope to get applause again . " " the boos are part of the game , " added klinsmann , who enjoyed a love-hate relationship with many sets of fans during his long and varied playing career . speaking of the criticism now coming his ways as trainer of the national team he said , " coaches also have to go through the experience .
you absorb what people are saying .
it 's not the case that coaches are exempt from criticism .
we are all very self-critical .
and when it does n't work we have to accept the criticism and the jeers . " re-jigged defense holds firm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph metzfelder goes through his paces during training before the china game .
klinsmann reshuffled the defense with borussia dortmund 's christoph metzelder -lrb- photo , center -rrb- , whose career has been hindered by injuries , making his first appearance since february 2002 . in the opening exchanges metzelder was strolling around as germany made the running and bayern munich midfielder bastian schweinsteiger forced a fine save from li leilei in the 29th minute . china were far from overawed though and spurned two good chances to take the lead shortly before the interval .
in the 43rd minute xie hui was clear through on goal but curled the ball wide with kahn forced to rush out of his goal and narrow down the angle . sixty seconds later kahn was called into action again with defender sun jihai forcing a fine low save as the german backline wobbled . critical captain kahn passified by clean sheet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the positive thing was the result and the fact we did not concede , " said kahn .
" we have high expectations and this was far from a vintage performance .
but the win gives us a push in the right direction . " the half-time break came to germany 's rescue and six minutes into the second period the hosts were in front .
bernd schneider was felled by china captain li weifeng in the box and frings watched with relief as his spot-kick crept past goalkeeper leilei . chinese come out of game with honor intact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zhu guanghu " germany were under pressure after losing to turkey but they coped well , " concluded china coach zhu guanghu .
" we can take a lot out of this game and it will aid our development . " the goal visibly lifted germany and they dominated proceedings but china rattled the post in the 76th minute . but there was no equalizer for china who have failed to qualify for the world cup finals and must now concentrate on hosting the 2008 olympic games in peking . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wounded lions versus crouching tigers germany face china on wednesday in a friendly match in hamburg .

a penalty from torsten frings saved germany 's blushes at the aol arena . it was germany 's first clean sheet in nine games but it could not disguise some shaky moments with stand-in captain oliver kahn called upon to make two crucial saves against a team ranked 45 places lower in the fifa rankings .
" this was good preparation for the world cup as we will come up against teams who just sit back and defend like china did tonight , " declared germany manager jürgen klinsmann .
" we have to find a way to break them down but we showed during the confederations cup that we can do that when required . " but despite getting his team back to winning ways , klinsmann faced derision from the home crowd , a reaction the coach said he completely understood .
" i completely understand them for jeering , " klinsmann said . candid coach admits fans had right to boo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsi takes it on the chin .
" one expects us to score a few more goals against china .
the expectations are higher .
but it 's not a problem .
obviously we ’ d rather be cheered .
but we understand the fans .
next time we hope to get applause again . " " the boos are part of the game , " added klinsmann , who enjoyed a love-hate relationship with many sets of fans during his long and varied playing career . speaking of the criticism now coming his ways as trainer of the national team he said , " coaches also have to go through the experience .
you absorb what people are saying .
it 's not the case that coaches are exempt from criticism .
we are all very self-critical .
and when it does n't work we have to accept the criticism and the jeers . " re-jigged defense holds firm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christoph metzfelder goes through his paces during training before the china game .
klinsmann reshuffled the defense with borussia dortmund 's christoph metzelder -lrb- photo , center -rrb- , whose career has been hindered by injuries , making his first appearance since february 2002 . in the opening exchanges metzelder was strolling around as germany made the running and bayern munich midfielder bastian schweinsteiger forced a fine save from li leilei in the 29th minute . china were far from overawed though and spurned two good chances to take the lead shortly before the interval .
in the 43rd minute xie hui was clear through on goal but curled the ball wide with kahn forced to rush out of his goal and narrow down the angle . sixty seconds later kahn was called into action again with defender sun jihai forcing a fine low save as the german backline wobbled . critical captain kahn passified by clean sheet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the positive thing was the result and the fact we did not concede , " said kahn .
" we have high expectations and this was far from a vintage performance .
but the win gives us a push in the right direction . " the half-time break came to germany 's rescue and six minutes into the second period the hosts were in front .
bernd schneider was felled by china captain li weifeng in the box and frings watched with relief as his spot-kick crept past goalkeeper leilei . chinese come out of game with honor intact bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zhu guanghu " germany were under pressure after losing to turkey but they coped well , " concluded china coach zhu guanghu .
" we can take a lot out of this game and it will aid our development . " the goal visibly lifted germany and they dominated proceedings but china rattled the post in the 76th minute . but there was no equalizer for china who have failed to qualify for the world cup finals and must now concentrate on hosting the 2008 olympic games in peking . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wounded lions versus crouching tigers germany face china on wednesday in a friendly match in hamburg .

drafted in the wake of the july 7 bombings in london , the legislation also calls for a ban on those who glorify terrorism , sell extremist books , receive or provide terrorist training , and prepare to commit attacks . however , members of both the governing and opposition parties , human rights activists and muslim leaders are mobilizing against many aspects of the bill , which they claim tramples on civil liberties and could even fuel the anger behind terrorism . even the government 's own independent terror watchdog , lord alexander carlile , warned that the extended detention period could be challenged in the courts under the human rights act . among other concerns he expressed in a report on the bill , carlile said a planned new offense of attending a terrorist training camp could lead to responsible journalists being prosecuted . wide-spread protests on wednesday evening , london 's mayor ken livingstone - a member of blair 's labour party - led a protest meeting against the law , attended muslim leaders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many worry the new laws will alienate peaceful muslims living in britain .

" what i have to do is to try to do my best to protect people in this country and to make sure that their safety and their civil liberty to life come first , and that is what i 'm going to try to do , " blair told lawmakers . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a month on , london still in grip of terror thousands of police mounted a huge operation to protect london thursday , as al qaeda warned of more horrors exactly four weeks after suicide bombers brought carnage to the british capital .

it would mark the first time a german daily is sold to foreign investors . several german newspapers reported thursday that british media tycoon david montgomery , a former mirror group chief executive , along with british venture capital company 3i and investment bank veronis , suhler , stevenson , is in exclusive negotiations to take over the berlin-based publisher . the online arm of news magazine spiegel reported that the consortium would have to make a concrete offer to the stuttgart-based media group holtzbrinck , the owner of the berliner zeitung , within the next two weeks .
the web site said that montgomery 's investment fund mecom , along with the two other parties , were expected to bid between 150 and 160 million euros -lrb- $ 180 to $ 192 million -rrb- for the publisher . the companies involved in the deal refused to confirm the reports or comment on the deal . " the most-hated manager " germany 's süddeutsche zeitung said in an article that the three-party consortium wanted to double the annual sales of the publisher , berliner verlag , which are current at 20 million euros .
it has been reported that the consortium would consider selling off its printing press as well as its berlin events magazine tip to reach that goal . in addition , the article reported that the intensive subscription campaign in the west of the city for the group 's flagship newspaper , berliner zeitung , would be stopped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daily mirror the tough measures would be in line with montgomery 's reputedly no-nonsense style .

" if the consortium did manage to take over the publisher , it would mark the first time that a german newspaper would be sold to foreign investors . however , it would not be the first time that montgomery and 3i have worked together .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.10.2005 looking abroad for reform models großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other european countries could show germany how to save while what worked in other countries is n't a guarantee for success , many believe looking beyond germany 's borders could provide the inspiration needed to reform europe 's largest economy . how to get more people working and increase germany 's economic growth will be a critical topic when the members of a possible power-sharing coalition of the christian union and social democratic parties meet for negotiations next week . over past five years , germans have watched their country slip in european business and economic rankings .
suffering from 11 percent unemployment and anemic 1.6 percent growth , germany will need to see substantial economic improvement if it does n't want to break european union debt rules for a fourth time in a row next year .
it is doubtful that will happen , since germany 's 2005 growth rate is forecast at only 0.8 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could what helped the pound help germany too ?
organizing the budget great britain and sweden once had similar problems of low , sometimes even negative , growth and high unemployment on par with germany today .
both nations started turning themselves around by cutting state expenditures and privatizing state-run companies .
sweden then went on to invest 6 percent of its gdp in education and great britain instituted labor market reforms focused on cutting unemployment . " big eu states like germany , france and italy are struggling with their budgets and are not doing well economically , while smaller states that have a better grip on their budgets , such as great britain , denmark and the new members states in eastern europe , are doing better , " said benjamin scharnagel of the cologne institute for economic research . regardless of whether german politicians ultimately choose to mirror sweden 's , britain 's or another nation 's reform processes , they should note that the first step has always been cutting state spending , which has shown to be an effective way of increasing private investment across europe , scharnagel added . getting out of germany 's dire budgetary situation is an issue the grand coalition parties principally agree on .
that should also please officials in brussels , who are demanding germany meet regulations set out in the eu 's stability and growth pact by bringing the deficit down to less than 3 percent of the gdp by 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a grand coalition will have to focus on cutting spending " a grand coalition could achieve quite a bit when it comes to reorganizing state expenditures , " said carsten seim a spokesperson for the initiative for a new social market economy , a pro-business , pro-economic reform group .
" arguments that the next high deficits are inherited headaches from previous administrations are not possible in a grand coalition , and the reciprocal accusations over unpopular cuts would also not apply . " jobs could bring growth in addition to reigning in public finances , german growth could be stimulated by getting more people into jobs , following a system employed in great britain , according to henning klodt of the kiel institute for world economics . by the 1980s , britain was faced with an unemployment rate of over 11 percent and the country had sunk into an economic malaise .
in terms of national wealth , the uk was 8 percent below the average western european average .
according to many , prime minister margaret thatcher 's sometimes controversial reforms , which reduced public spending , lowered direct taxes , deregulated and privatized state-run companies , were key in turning britain 's economy around . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former prime minister margaret thatcher 's reforms started great britain on the road to recovery " thatcher 's reforms in great britain in the beginning of the 80s , which were also carried out by tony blair , demanded people either learn a new trade or do community work , " klodt said .
" the german hartz iv reforms started on this path but were not completely implemented , " he added , referring to the spate of controversial welfare and labor market reforms that chancellor gerhard schröder 's government instituted to spur economic growth . in fact , questions on whether the reforms went too far in cutting benefits for the unemployed kept chancellor gerhard schröder from applying all the changes and rebellion within his own ranks ultimately led to his decision to call early elections , klodt added . " now i fear that the spd will slow down labor market reforms that go further in this direction , " he said , referring to the chances that a grand coalition government would be able to enact serious reforms to the labor market .
" schröder was on that path and that is what led to his problems .

suffering from 11 percent unemployment and anemic 1.6 percent growth , germany will need to see substantial economic improvement if it does n't want to break european union debt rules for a fourth time in a row next year .
it is doubtful that will happen , since germany 's 2005 growth rate is forecast at only 0.8 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : could what helped the pound help germany too ?
organizing the budget great britain and sweden once had similar problems of low , sometimes even negative , growth and high unemployment on par with germany today .
both nations started turning themselves around by cutting state expenditures and privatizing state-run companies .
sweden then went on to invest 6 percent of its gdp in education and great britain instituted labor market reforms focused on cutting unemployment . " big eu states like germany , france and italy are struggling with their budgets and are not doing well economically , while smaller states that have a better grip on their budgets , such as great britain , denmark and the new members states in eastern europe , are doing better , " said benjamin scharnagel of the cologne institute for economic research . regardless of whether german politicians ultimately choose to mirror sweden 's , britain 's or another nation 's reform processes , they should note that the first step has always been cutting state spending , which has shown to be an effective way of increasing private investment across europe , scharnagel added . getting out of germany 's dire budgetary situation is an issue the grand coalition parties principally agree on .
that should also please officials in brussels , who are demanding germany meet regulations set out in the eu 's stability and growth pact by bringing the deficit down to less than 3 percent of the gdp by 2007 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a grand coalition will have to focus on cutting spending " a grand coalition could achieve quite a bit when it comes to reorganizing state expenditures , " said carsten seim a spokesperson for the initiative for a new social market economy , a pro-business , pro-economic reform group .
" arguments that the next high deficits are inherited headaches from previous administrations are not possible in a grand coalition , and the reciprocal accusations over unpopular cuts would also not apply . " jobs could bring growth in addition to reigning in public finances , german growth could be stimulated by getting more people into jobs , following a system employed in great britain , according to henning klodt of the kiel institute for world economics . by the 1980s , britain was faced with an unemployment rate of over 11 percent and the country had sunk into an economic malaise .

only the audacity of youth could propel a promising pianist to , at his own cost , import a special piano from italy and rent studio time at a local radio station to record the formidable goldberg variations .

armed with a new album and nation-wide tour , he 's securing a reputation as the star of germany 's classical scene . with his carefully disheveled crop of dark hair , elegant suits and soulful gaze , martin stadtfeld has the kind of heartthrob appeal that helped launch the careers of other young male artists such as america 's josh groban or canada 's michael bublé .
but whereas they 've conquered international pop music charts with their operatic ballads and jazz covers , stadtfeld 's success has been in the realm of classical music . with the release last year of his first cd of bach 's goldberg variations , he established himself as one of the most successful bach interpreters of the younger generation . his age had everything to do with his overnight rise to fame .
only the audacity of youth could propel a promising pianist to , at his own cost , import a special piano from italy and rent studio time at a local radio station to record the formidable goldberg variations .
and only the confidence of a young talent with nothing to lose would see the recording be sent , unsolicited , to the berlin branch of sony music , unfazed by the fact that sony 's catalog already contains glenn gould 's monumental recording . chart-topping success the bosses at sony were suitably impressed with stadtfeld 's recording .
it was n't long before the cd took the number one spot on germany 's classical music charts , and stadtfeld was being toasted as a " sensation " and " the new face of classical music . " sony wanted stadtfeld to do for classical music what josh groban did for opera and michael bublé did for jazz - attract a whole new target group to the genre .
and indeed , a noticeable number of young fans can be seen in the concert halls where stadtfeld appears . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " he 's more accessible than others , he 's completely unreserved , " said the vice president of sony classical in germany , michael brüggemann . spontaneous approach stadtfeld says he 's happy with the way his career is unfolding .
he 's finally getting to play the big venues and festivals he dreamed of as a child , enjoying reaching audiences with his spontaneous approach to great classical works . " it does n't put me under pressure , " stadtfeld said , adding that it 's important to " always play with passion and really go for it . " stadtfeld 's new cd features mozart concertos , though bach is also on the program as stadtfeld opens his german tour on thursday .
he 's being accompanied for the first time by an orchestra , the residentie orkest from the hague .

a penalty from torsten frings saved germany 's blushes at the aol arena . it was germany 's first clean sheet in nine games but it could not disguise some shaky moments with stand-in captain oliver kahn called upon to make two crucial saves against a team ranked 45 places lower in the fifa rankings .

" we have to find a way to break them down but we showed during the confederations cup that we can do that when required . " but despite getting his team back to winning ways , klinsmann faced derision from the home crowd , a reaction the coach said he completely understood .

klinsmann reshuffled the defense with borussia dortmund 's christoph metzelder -lrb- photo , center -rrb- , whose career has been hindered by injuries , making his first appearance since february 2002 . in the opening exchanges metzelder was strolling around as germany made the running and bayern munich midfielder bastian schweinsteiger forced a fine save from li leilei in the 29th minute . china were far from overawed though and spurned two good chances to take the lead shortly before the interval .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.10.2005 greenpeace germany celebrates 25 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : attention-getting protests are still part of greenpeace 's repertoire a handful of environmental activists set out on oct .
13 , 1980 to prevent the kronos titan freighter from dumping poisonous acid into the baltic sea .
their protest was both successful and the start of german greenpeace . one group of activists tied their two life rafts in front of the kronos titan freighter , preventing it from motoring out to sea , and blocked the loading dock for the dilute acid the ship was meant to dump in the north sea .
other activists deposited piles of sick and mutated fish in front of both the bayer plant , which had disposed of its waste in the sea , and the hamburg hydrographic institute , which had approved the disposal method . thus , a new branch of greenpeace , in its ninth year internationally , was founded in germany .
the group did n't attract much attention here until , a year later , two of the environmental activists scaled and occupied a smokestack at the boehringer chemical plant in hamburg . " we climbed the smokestack in protest and attached a banner to it that said , ' only when the last tree is cleared , the last river is polluted , the last fish is caught , you will realize that one ca n't eat money , ' because it contaminated the whole area with highly poisonous chemicals , " explained gerhard wallmeyer , one of greenpeace germany 's founders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protesters tried to stop nuclear waste from being dumped in the gorleben facility in nov .
2004 the activists made headlines and , in subsequent years , the citizens ' initiative became one of the most influential german environmental organizations .
nowadays , greenpeace germany says it has 180 employees and almost 2,700 volunteers , a large number of whom are children and teenagers .
influential in larger scheme in 2004 , the group had around 41.5 million euros -lrb- $ 49.6 million -rrb- to spend on their spectacular protests .
over half a million donors have made greenpeace germany the richest greenpeace branch in the world as well as one of most influential financial backers of the international head office in amsterdam . there greenpeace makes all policy decisions , decides when and where to deploy its ships and coordinates international public relations .
the greenpeace head office devises campaigns focused on particular themes , such as nuclear energy , genetically modified food or the protection of endangered species , and the branches pursue the campaigns in their own countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrating at the eu council building in the 1990s , greenpeace made large strides in its development into a strictly hierarchical , internationally active environmental organization .
but the process did n't go smoothly .
critics complained that greenpeace turned voluntary activists into servants with no influence and that the group gave people who backed them absolution from their bad consciences , a modern form of selling indulgences . but greenpeace countered that its vast number of supporters was proof that the new organizational structure had been accepted and that a clear chain of command was a practical way to ensure efficient decision making and successful action .
from activists to lobbyists the group is now less visible on smokestacks and life rafts , although it does still launch attention-getting campaigns . it was germany 's thilo bode , who headed the national branch in the early 1990s - and the international organization from 1995 to 2000 - who is credited with having pushed greenpeace in a new direction - namely , to take on the world .

13 , 1980 to prevent the kronos titan freighter from dumping poisonous acid into the baltic sea .
their protest was both successful and the start of german greenpeace . one group of activists tied their two life rafts in front of the kronos titan freighter , preventing it from motoring out to sea , and blocked the loading dock for the dilute acid the ship was meant to dump in the north sea .
other activists deposited piles of sick and mutated fish in front of both the bayer plant , which had disposed of its waste in the sea , and the hamburg hydrographic institute , which had approved the disposal method . thus , a new branch of greenpeace , in its ninth year internationally , was founded in germany .
the group did n't attract much attention here until , a year later , two of the environmental activists scaled and occupied a smokestack at the boehringer chemical plant in hamburg . " we climbed the smokestack in protest and attached a banner to it that said , ' only when the last tree is cleared , the last river is polluted , the last fish is caught , you will realize that one ca n't eat money , ' because it contaminated the whole area with highly poisonous chemicals , " explained gerhard wallmeyer , one of greenpeace germany 's founders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protesters tried to stop nuclear waste from being dumped in the gorleben facility in nov .
2004 the activists made headlines and , in subsequent years , the citizens ' initiative became one of the most influential german environmental organizations .
nowadays , greenpeace germany says it has 180 employees and almost 2,700 volunteers , a large number of whom are children and teenagers .
influential in larger scheme in 2004 , the group had around 41.5 million euros -lrb- $ 49.6 million -rrb- to spend on their spectacular protests .
over half a million donors have made greenpeace germany the richest greenpeace branch in the world as well as one of most influential financial backers of the international head office in amsterdam . there greenpeace makes all policy decisions , decides when and where to deploy its ships and coordinates international public relations .
the greenpeace head office devises campaigns focused on particular themes , such as nuclear energy , genetically modified food or the protection of endangered species , and the branches pursue the campaigns in their own countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrating at the eu council building in the 1990s , greenpeace made large strides in its development into a strictly hierarchical , internationally active environmental organization .
but the process did n't go smoothly .
critics complained that greenpeace turned voluntary activists into servants with no influence and that the group gave people who backed them absolution from their bad consciences , a modern form of selling indulgences . but greenpeace countered that its vast number of supporters was proof that the new organizational structure had been accepted and that a clear chain of command was a practical way to ensure efficient decision making and successful action .
from activists to lobbyists the group is now less visible on smokestacks and life rafts , although it does still launch attention-getting campaigns . it was germany 's thilo bode , who headed the national branch in the early 1990s - and the international organization from 1995 to 2000 - who is credited with having pushed greenpeace in a new direction - namely , to take on the world .

13 , 1980 to prevent the kronos titan freighter from dumping poisonous acid into the baltic sea .
their protest was both successful and the start of german greenpeace . one group of activists tied their two life rafts in front of the kronos titan freighter , preventing it from motoring out to sea , and blocked the loading dock for the dilute acid the ship was meant to dump in the north sea .
other activists deposited piles of sick and mutated fish in front of both the bayer plant , which had disposed of its waste in the sea , and the hamburg hydrographic institute , which had approved the disposal method . thus , a new branch of greenpeace , in its ninth year internationally , was founded in germany .
the group did n't attract much attention here until , a year later , two of the environmental activists scaled and occupied a smokestack at the boehringer chemical plant in hamburg . " we climbed the smokestack in protest and attached a banner to it that said , ' only when the last tree is cleared , the last river is polluted , the last fish is caught , you will realize that one ca n't eat money , ' because it contaminated the whole area with highly poisonous chemicals , " explained gerhard wallmeyer , one of greenpeace germany 's founders . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protesters tried to stop nuclear waste from being dumped in the gorleben facility in nov .
2004 the activists made headlines and , in subsequent years , the citizens ' initiative became one of the most influential german environmental organizations .
nowadays , greenpeace germany says it has 180 employees and almost 2,700 volunteers , a large number of whom are children and teenagers .
influential in larger scheme in 2004 , the group had around 41.5 million euros -lrb- $ 49.6 million -rrb- to spend on their spectacular protests .
over half a million donors have made greenpeace germany the richest greenpeace branch in the world as well as one of most influential financial backers of the international head office in amsterdam . there greenpeace makes all policy decisions , decides when and where to deploy its ships and coordinates international public relations .
the greenpeace head office devises campaigns focused on particular themes , such as nuclear energy , genetically modified food or the protection of endangered species , and the branches pursue the campaigns in their own countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrating at the eu council building in the 1990s , greenpeace made large strides in its development into a strictly hierarchical , internationally active environmental organization .
but the process did n't go smoothly .
critics complained that greenpeace turned voluntary activists into servants with no influence and that the group gave people who backed them absolution from their bad consciences , a modern form of selling indulgences . but greenpeace countered that its vast number of supporters was proof that the new organizational structure had been accepted and that a clear chain of command was a practical way to ensure efficient decision making and successful action .
from activists to lobbyists the group is now less visible on smokestacks and life rafts , although it does still launch attention-getting campaigns . it was germany 's thilo bode , who headed the national branch in the early 1990s - and the international organization from 1995 to 2000 - who is credited with having pushed greenpeace in a new direction - namely , to take on the world .
the group started lobbying international bodies , such as the un general assembly and global conferences . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greenpeace protested against wmds in march 2004 at the us embassy in berlin under bode 's command , greenpeace germany also took a new approach by developing technologies to cut emissions .
in 1991 , the group developed a method to bleach paper without employing environmentally harmful chlorine , which has since become standard in every printers shop .
a year later , the german branch presented the world 's first refrigerator that did not emit gases damaging to the environment - which has also become a standard . developing the refrigerator was also a form of protest , and a very effective one , according to wallmeyer . " either you change or we will market -lrb- our development -rrb- , become your competitor and show that one can make a more modern , more environmentally friendly technology , " he said .
" if someone does n't behave in an acceptable fashion - environmentally or socially - he should feel it in his profits and we want to ensure that that 's the case .

the waste products were supposed to have been processed for use only in dog or cat food .
the state of bavaria is planning a recall campaign to pull the meat out of stores , if the products can be identified .
bavaria 's environment minister , werner schnappauf , said while disgusting , the meat did not pose a health hazard , since the waste products had been heated to high temperatures during processing .
shipments of the waste products apparently made their way from germany to italy , switzerland , austria and france .
according to a report in the magazine stern , the meat company under investigation was convicted of fraud in 2003 and had no authorization to trade in food products . dw-world.de polluted feed scare shuts down german farms three german farms have been closed due to a suspicion that their animal feed had been contaminated with cancer-causing chemicals .

it would mark the first time a german daily is sold to foreign investors . several german newspapers reported thursday that british media tycoon david montgomery , a former mirror group chief executive , along with british venture capital company 3i and investment bank veronis , suhler , stevenson , is in exclusive negotiations to take over the berlin-based publisher . the online arm of news magazine spiegel reported that the consortium would have to make a concrete offer to the stuttgart-based media group holtzbrinck , the owner of the berliner zeitung , within the next two weeks .
the web site said that montgomery 's investment fund mecom , along with the two other parties , were expected to bid between 150 and 160 million euros -lrb- $ 180 to $ 192 million -rrb- for the publisher . the companies involved in the deal refused to confirm the reports or comment on the deal . " the most-hated manager " germany 's süddeutsche zeitung said in an article that the three-party consortium wanted to double the annual sales of the publisher , berliner verlag , which are current at 20 million euros .
it has been reported that the consortium would consider selling off its printing press as well as its berlin events magazine tip to reach that goal . in addition , the article reported that the intensive subscription campaign in the west of the city for the group 's flagship newspaper , berliner zeitung , would be stopped . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daily mirror the tough measures would be in line with montgomery 's reputedly no-nonsense style .

" if the consortium did manage to take over the publisher , it would mark the first time that a german newspaper would be sold to foreign investors . however , it would not be the first time that montgomery and 3i have worked together .
the two bought ireland 's local press group together in 2003 and sold it at a profit last month . more changes afoot in berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der tagesspiegel currently , the the holtzbrinck media group is involved in separate negotiations about selling off its second publishing house in the german capital , which publishes another daily , der tagespiegel , spiegel online wrote .

the northern line , which carries 660,400 people every weekday , has been suspended and lu bosses have given no indication when it will re-open .
union bosses called for trains to be withdrawn on wednesday , after one ran through a red light at mill hill east , and its emergency brakes failed .
it was the fifth incident on the line , prompting many drivers to stop work .
passengers trying to get home on wednesday struggled to get onto overcrowded buses , after the gates closed at northern line stations . "
it was a very difficult journey home " commuter clare runacres clare runacres watched eight packed buses pass before one heading in her direction stopped .
she said passengers were " very angry " .
" when i finally got on one , it was a scrum at every stop , the buses were all full beyond capacity .
it was a very difficult journey home , " she told bbc london .
there have been delays on the northern line all week because of safety concerns .
both rail unions , aslef and the rmt , said they would support any members who refuse to work on safety grounds .
up to 60 have so far refused to work , a bbc correspondent said .
aslef has since said it will ballot members over industrial action on thursday if drivers are sent home without pay .
rmt secretary bob crow said : " our members have the legal right to refuse to undertake duties that would put themselves or the travelling public in danger . "
emergency powers steve grant , aslef representative , said : " we are not satisfied that the modifications have got to the root of the problem . "
both unions were due to meet lu representatives on thursday .
a spokesman for lu said : " we are working with our trade unions and staff to reassure them that it is safe to continue to run northern line trains . "
he said the company was working with the private sector firms which maintain the tube to resolve the issue .
lu has used emergency powers to oversee remedial work by tube lines and its subcontractor alstom .

the northern line , which carries 660,400 people every weekday , has been suspended and lu bosses have given no indication when it will re-open .
union bosses called for trains to be withdrawn on wednesday , after one ran through a red light at mill hill east , and its emergency brakes failed .
it was the fifth incident on the line , prompting many drivers to stop work .
passengers trying to get home on wednesday struggled to get onto overcrowded buses , after the gates closed at northern line stations .
it was a very difficult journey home commuter clare runacres clare runacres watched eight packed buses pass before one heading in her direction stopped .
she said passengers were " very angry " .
" when i finally got on one , it was a scrum at every stop , the buses were all full beyond capacity .
it was a very difficult journey home , " she told bbc london .
there have been delays on the northern line all week because of safety concerns .
both rail unions , aslef and the rmt , said they would support any members who refuse to work on safety grounds .
up to 60 have so far refused to work , a bbc correspondent said .
aslef has since said it will ballot members over industrial action on thursday if drivers are sent home without pay .
rmt secretary bob crow said : " our members have the legal right to refuse to undertake duties that would put themselves or the travelling public in danger . "
emergency powers steve grant , aslef representative , said : " we are not satisfied that the modifications have got to the root of the problem . "
both unions were due to meet lu representatives on thursday .
a spokesman for lu said : " we are working with our trade unions and staff to reassure them that it is safe to continue to run northern line trains . "
he said the company was working with the private sector firms which maintain the tube to resolve the issue .
lu has used emergency powers to oversee remedial work by tube lines and its subcontractor alstom .

but instead the eight-year-old springer spaniel is on the front line of london 's fight against terror , in his job sniffing out explosives on the capital 's transport network .
attracting warm smiles from onlookers , the super sleuth leaves no stone unturned as he silently walks through the crowds .
and he does it not for danger money or fame , but for the love of his favourite toy - a yellow tennis ball , which he gets to play with as a reward for his hard work .
during the attempted bombings in london on 21 july , mutley and his handler pc graham smith were called directly into the danger zone after an attempted bomb attack at warren street .
he never used to be bothered about being petted but as a result of the ... increased profile he 's always being stroked and he loves it now pc graham smith " we had just signed on and the call came through that there had been an explosion on the tube , " said pc smith .
" it felt very scary but this is what you train for and you get a buzz from it . "
the constable , mutley and a second team had to ensure the area inside the police cordon was safe .
side-by-side they worked for 12 hours , abandoning the usual regime of working for 30 minutes , then resting for 30 minutes .
the dogs are normally given a break after about half-an-hour so they do not become immune to smells or lose interest but this day proved to be far from normal .
suitcase obsession the bbc news website joined the duo at paddington station , west london , as they patrolled the concourse , heathrow express service and the tube .
once the harness is on , mutley knows it is time to go to work .
as he eyes up the passengers heading for the heathrow express he displays a healthy obsession with suitcases , especially blue ones .
not one person objects as he follows them along the platform , sniffing at their heels , until he is sure all is well .
mutley is trained to freeze and sit down a distance away from whatever he is sniffing , to indicate that something is wrong .
" dogs can pick up the scent of something that could have been there weeks ago and has since been moved so you never quite know , " said pc smith .
blue suitcases are mutley 's favourite describing the one time mutley gave a " positive indication " pc smith said it was not a situation you want to find yourself in .
" we were at luton airport and i saw him go up to a rubbish bin .
then he sat straight down a few feet away from it and the second handler came along and his dog did exactly the same .
" fortunately it turned out to be a false alarm but it was a very scary feeling . "
it quickly becomes evident that mutley is not only an excellent crime deterrent but also a key weapon in the fight to improve public relations .
clearly winning in the popularity stakes , mutley is frequently stopped by people keen to give him a friendly stroke .
increased profile insp garth stinson , who is in charge of the counter-terrorism dogs search unit , said : " it 's a great ice-breaker , especially with young people .
they wo n't talk to us but they will approach the dogs " .
mutley laps up all the attention without any objection but pc smith tells me he is a changed canine .
" he never used to be bothered about people or being petted but as a result of the bombings and the increased profile he 's always being stroked and he loves it now . "
mutley and pc smith transferred from the home counties to the british transport police 's london division in search of a new challenge but mutley 's days of pounding the beat are numbered .
the working life of a police dog usually spans from the age of about 18 months to nine years-old .
safe in the knowledge he has done his bit to keep the streets of london safe he is looking forward to hanging up his harness for a well deserved retirement .

the court was told how he ran a bogus registration service for net addresses .
pretending to be a legitimate agent who could act on behalf of businesses wanting to register a domain name proved a lucrative scam , jurors heard .
but as the net closed on his bogus businesses , he allegedly began threatening police and trading standards staff and it was this that finally landed him in court .
designer clothes the scam allegedly run by mr francis-macrae began with him sending unsolicited spam to thousands of people , offering to register them for the soon-to-be released domain name .eu.
jurors at peterborough crown court heard how he had enjoyed a lifestyle of designer clothes and helicopter lessons as the scam netted him a fortnightly income of around £ 200,000 .
one customer paid £ 5,780 to register a list of addresses .
prosecution lawyer rupert mayo told how the defendant 's website claimed the business was located in a state-of-the-art data centre in canary wharf .
it was actually being run from a terraced house in cambridgeshire , he said .
the second scam saw the defendant posting letters to people with domain names due for expiry , offering to renew it for a fee .
it is believed he got the information from a database published by nominet , the company which runs the .uk registry .
the firm won an injunction in november 2003 to prevent mr francis-macrae from using its whois database .
fertile ground the case puts the world of web addresses under the spotlight at a time when several new domain names are coming online .
the domain name industry is a dynamic one with anyone requiring a net presence having to both register and renew their web address regularly .
it is no surprise then that scammers are finding it a lucrative area for fraud , said jonathan robinson , business development director of netnames , a company which legitimately registers domain names .
the new suffix .eu has been in the pipeline for the last five years and it is partly its slowness to come to market that helped created a window of opportunity for mr francis-macrae , thinks mr robinson .
" it has taken such a long time to get off the ground that it has n't done itself any favours .
it is fertile ground for this sort of thing , " he said .
the .eu domain name , due to be officially registered later this year , is likely to appeal to businesses which want a pan-european presence as well as being taken up both small traders and large corporations which already have a web presence , in a process known as defensive registration .
spamhaus , a firm that identifies the source of junk e-mails , includes mr francis-macrae on its list of professional spammers .
while mr robinson has sympathy for those who might have been duped by such scams , a little bit of thought could prevent them being victims in future .
" consumers and organisations should only engage with professional , reputable and accredited domain name registrars and not instinctively place their trust in anyone just because they have a website , " he said .

fertile ground the case puts the world of web addresses under the spotlight at a time when several new domain names are coming online .
the domain name industry is a dynamic one with anyone requiring a net presence having to both register and renew their web address regularly .
it is no surprise then that scammers are finding it a lucrative area for fraud , said jonathan robinson , business development director of netnames , a company which legitimately registers domain names .
the new suffix .eu has been in the pipeline for the last five years and it is partly its slowness to come to market that helped created a window of opportunity for mr francis-macrae , thinks mr robinson .
" it has taken such a long time to get off the ground that it has n't done itself any favours .
it is fertile ground for this sort of thing , " he said .
the .eu domain name , due to be officially registered later this year , is likely to appeal to businesses which want a pan-european presence as well as being taken up both small traders and large corporations which already have a web presence , in a process known as defensive registration .
spamhaus , a firm that identifies the source of junk e-mails , includes mr francis-macrae on its list of professional spammers .
while mr robinson has sympathy for those who might have been duped by such scams , a little bit of thought could prevent them being victims in future .

peter francis-macrae is currently on trial for alleged death threats , made as police and trading standards moved in on his fraudulent net operation .
the court was told how he ran a bogus registration service for net addresses .
pretending to be a legitimate agent who could act on behalf of businesses wanting to register a domain name proved a lucrative scam , jurors heard .
but as the net closed on his bogus businesses , he allegedly began threatening police and trading standards staff and it was this that finally landed him in court .
designer clothes the scam allegedly run by mr francis-macrae began with him sending unsolicited spam to thousands of people , offering to register them for the soon-to-be released domain name .eu.
jurors at peterborough crown court heard how he had enjoyed a lifestyle of designer clothes and helicopter lessons as the scam netted him a fortnightly income of around £ 200,000 .
one customer paid £ 5,780 to register a list of addresses .
prosecution lawyer rupert mayo told how the defendant 's website claimed the business was located in a state-of-the-art data centre in canary wharf .
it was actually being run from a terraced house in cambridgeshire , he said .
the second scam saw the defendant posting letters to people with domain names due for expiry , offering to renew it for a fee .
