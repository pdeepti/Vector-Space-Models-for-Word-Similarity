this year 's festival is no exception , having provided breakthrough moments for several new homegrown stars . julia jentsch , actress the undisputed new star to emerge from the berlinale is berlin-born actress julia jentsch , 26 .
her convincing portrayal of anti-nazi resistance heroine sophie scholl in the competition film " sophie scholl - the final days " went over well with both critics and audiences alike .
jentsch 's face is now gracing the covers of german magazines , meaning her days of going unrecognized are coming to an end .
jentsch previously appeared in " the edukators , " a film about a group of young people who break into the homes of the wealthy not to steal , but to send them a message about social injustice .
jentsch has been a member of the munich kammerspiel theatre ensemble since 2001 .
at a berlinale press conference , jentsch said she would be returning to the stage and had no plans to make another film .
but that 's likely to change soon - especially if jentsch scoops the silver bear for best actress , as many are already predicting . julia hummer , actress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia hummer another young actress named julia has created a stir at the berlinale - julia hummer , 24 , who stars in christian petzold 's film " ghosts " -lrb- gespenster -rrb- .
festival director dieter kosslick said hummer 's portrayal of a young woman the film 's protagonist believes is her lost daughter could make her " a very big star in europe or worldwide . "
but that will depend very much on which of her ambitions hummer decides to pursue .
she is also a dedicated musician with an album and negotiations with record labels in the works .
hummer 's previous film credits include the coming-of-age story " crazy , " and another film by petzold , " the state i am in " -lrb- die innere sicherheit -rrb- . hannes stöhr , director bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannes stöhr " one day in europe " has been described as " delightful " and " refreshing , " and has earned its director , hannes stöhr , 35 , accolades that are just as positive .
not bad , considering " europe " is only his second feature-length film , following on 2001 's " berlin is in germany . "
the film is made up of four episodes told in four european cities and seven different languages .
the thing that holds them together is a fictional european champions league soccer match played in moscow between spanish and turkish teams .
" soccer , whether you like the game or not , is something that connects all the cultures of europe , " said stöhr , who also wrote the film 's screenplay .
the story was a natural for stöhr , who lives in berlin , but has also spent parts of his life in moscow and istanbul , and who speaks english , german , spanish and french . max riemelt , actor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max riemelt in " napola " from constantin film it does n't get any more official than actually being named a shooting star 2005 , but that 's exactly what happened to young german actor max riemelt , 21 .
his current film , " napola " , in which he plays a working-class student at an elite training academy during the third reich , is not showing at the berlinale , but riemelt was one of 21 young actors from 21 different countries to be awarded the prize at a european film promotion event held alongside the festival .
riemelt first achieved teen-idol fame in germany with the film " mädchen , mädchen ! "
as a prize winner , riemelt will be introduced to countless producers , casting agents , and other actors over the next few days , but his attitude is relaxed .
" it 's cool to be named a shooting star , and of course , a big honor , " riemelt said .
" but as to what comes of that , i 'm just going to see what comes my way .

" america needs europe and europe needs america and by working together we can make the world a better one , " jose manuel barroso , the president of the european commission , said in a statement on friday .
bush was similarly agreeable in an interview he gave to germany 's ard television before his trip .
in his comments , he confirmed europe and germany 's importance in the international community , and their importance to america .
" europe is extremely important for america and germany is extremely important for europe , " he said .
he said washington expects germany to have a role in stabilizing iraq , although " our german friends … must feel good about it . " bush : iran " rumors " not true despite the agreeable tone , bush and the european allies will have some tough issues to work through .

not in dortmund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happier times : dortmund fans celebrate their 2002 championship fans of the dortmund soccer club bvb borrusia are distraught .
the storied team with one of the most loyal followings in the world is on the edge of a financial collapse that threatens its existence . a full 80,000 fans can fit into westfalen stadium , the cavernous temple to the dortmund soccer club bvb borussia 09 - and do so every home game .
the fan bloc , which during games is a sea of black and yellow banners and flags , is made up of 27,000 people each game - all of them standing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's westfalen stadium is one of the sites of the 2006 world cup so when dortmund fans are mad , it 's best to listen .
and they have never been more upset .
the problem " rage , fear and bewilderment , " read a newspaper headline in dortmund this week .
in four years , the bvb would have celebrated its 100th anniversary .
now , there is serious doubt the club can even make it to the next season .
borussia has run up a debt of € 142.1 million -lrb- $ 185.74 million -rrb- over the past few seasons , an equivalent of 79 percent of its capital .
just a few seasons ago , the club made headlines by winning the bundelisga title , competing regularly in european tournaments , and being the first german club to go on the stock exchange .
today , borrusia and its team of highly-paid stars is struggling up the bundesliga table .
the stock has plunged more than 25 percent .
the targets " the anger is massive and the fear is just as big , " one fan told dw-radio .
" i do n't know where it will go from here .

on feb .
12 , 1,000 fans marched in dortmund behind a massive banner that read " not for sale : put an end to the lies and intrigue ! "
they accused meier of mismanagement and spending too much money on players who did n't deliver as promised .
they demanded meier correct the club 's miserable accounting and then resign .
" bvb brought a smile to my face " the anger , and the sheer numbers taking to the streets illustrate the importance of the soccer club to the ruhr valley city .
once a center for steel and coal mining , dortmund 's fortunes have sunk as companies have either gone bankrupt or pulled up stakes to move eastwards , where labor is cheaper .
for many of the workers , the soccer team was their weekend distraction .
for the growing list of unemployed and their families , the team is nowadays their only distraction .

other fans responded with similar stories and feelings and the site was soon covered with messages .
only thing left is hope " i had a difficult time as a youth and i was able to get through it with the bvb , " wrote another fan .
" the bvb brought a smile to my face when i actually should have been crying . "
along with the sadness , there were many messages calling for support and confidence in their beloved soccer club .
dortmund 's mayor said he was sure a proposed restructuring plan that includes deferring rental payments for its € 17 million a year stadium and a drastically-reduced player budget would work .
the team is the " heart and soul of the city , " mayor gerhard langemeyer told the news agency dpa .

this year 's festival is no exception , having provided breakthrough moments for several new homegrown stars . julia jentsch , actress the undisputed new star to emerge from the berlinale is berlin-born actress julia jentsch , 26 .
her convincing portrayal of anti-nazi resistance heroine sophie scholl in the competition film " sophie scholl - the final days " went over well with both critics and audiences alike .
jentsch 's face is now gracing the covers of german magazines , meaning her days of going unrecognized are coming to an end .
jentsch previously appeared in " the edukators , " a film about a group of young people who break into the homes of the wealthy not to steal , but to send them a message about social injustice .
jentsch has been a member of the munich kammerspiel theatre ensemble since 2001 .

festival director dieter kosslick said hummer 's portrayal of a young woman the film 's protagonist believes is her lost daughter could make her " a very big star in europe or worldwide . "
but that will depend very much on which of her ambitions hummer decides to pursue .
she is also a dedicated musician with an album and negotiations with record labels in the works .

not bad , considering " europe " is only his second feature-length film , following on 2001 's " berlin is in germany . "
the film is made up of four episodes told in four european cities and seven different languages .
the thing that holds them together is a fictional european champions league soccer match played in moscow between spanish and turkish teams .
" soccer , whether you like the game or not , is something that connects all the cultures of europe , " said stöhr , who also wrote the film 's screenplay .
the story was a natural for stöhr , who lives in berlin , but has also spent parts of his life in moscow and istanbul , and who speaks english , german , spanish and french . max riemelt , actor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max riemelt in " napola " from constantin film it does n't get any more official than actually being named a shooting star 2005 , but that 's exactly what happened to young german actor max riemelt , 21 .

this year 's festival is no exception , having provided breakthrough moments for several new homegrown stars . julia jentsch , actress the undisputed new star to emerge from the berlinale is berlin-born actress julia jentsch , 26 .
her convincing portrayal of anti-nazi resistance heroine sophie scholl in the competition film " sophie scholl - the final days " went over well with both critics and audiences alike .
jentsch 's face is now gracing the covers of german magazines , meaning her days of going unrecognized are coming to an end .
jentsch previously appeared in " the edukators , " a film about a group of young people who break into the homes of the wealthy not to steal , but to send them a message about social injustice .
jentsch has been a member of the munich kammerspiel theatre ensemble since 2001 .
at a berlinale press conference , jentsch said she would be returning to the stage and had no plans to make another film .
but that 's likely to change soon - especially if jentsch scoops the silver bear for best actress , as many are already predicting . julia hummer , actress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia hummer another young actress named julia has created a stir at the berlinale - julia hummer , 24 , who stars in christian petzold 's film " ghosts " -lrb- gespenster -rrb- .
festival director dieter kosslick said hummer 's portrayal of a young woman the film 's protagonist believes is her lost daughter could make her " a very big star in europe or worldwide . "
but that will depend very much on which of her ambitions hummer decides to pursue .
she is also a dedicated musician with an album and negotiations with record labels in the works .
hummer 's previous film credits include the coming-of-age story " crazy , " and another film by petzold , " the state i am in " -lrb- die innere sicherheit -rrb- . hannes stöhr , director bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannes stöhr " one day in europe " has been described as " delightful " and " refreshing , " and has earned its director , hannes stöhr , 35 , accolades that are just as positive .
not bad , considering " europe " is only his second feature-length film , following on 2001 's " berlin is in germany . "
the film is made up of four episodes told in four european cities and seven different languages .
the thing that holds them together is a fictional european champions league soccer match played in moscow between spanish and turkish teams .
" soccer , whether you like the game or not , is something that connects all the cultures of europe , " said stöhr , who also wrote the film 's screenplay .
the story was a natural for stöhr , who lives in berlin , but has also spent parts of his life in moscow and istanbul , and who speaks english , german , spanish and french . max riemelt , actor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max riemelt in " napola " from constantin film it does n't get any more official than actually being named a shooting star 2005 , but that 's exactly what happened to young german actor max riemelt , 21 .
his current film , " napola " , in which he plays a working-class student at an elite training academy during the third reich , is not showing at the berlinale , but riemelt was one of 21 young actors from 21 different countries to be awarded the prize at a european film promotion event held alongside the festival .
riemelt first achieved teen-idol fame in germany with the film " mädchen , mädchen ! "
as a prize winner , riemelt will be introduced to countless producers , casting agents , and other actors over the next few days , but his attitude is relaxed .
" it 's cool to be named a shooting star , and of course , a big honor , " riemelt said .

the us president seems intent on making amends with europe , and the continent 's leaders are only too happy to . " america needs europe and europe needs america and by working together we can make the world a better one , " jose manuel barroso , the president of the european commission , said in a statement on friday .
bush was similarly agreeable in an interview he gave to germany 's ard television before his trip .
in his comments , he confirmed europe and germany 's importance in the international community , and their importance to america .
" europe is extremely important for america and germany is extremely important for europe , " he said .
he said washington expects germany to have a role in stabilizing iraq , although " our german friends … must feel good about it . " bush : iran " rumors " not true despite the agreeable tone , bush and the european allies will have some tough issues to work through .
on the top of the list is what to do about iran , which is suspected of harboring ambitions to develop nuclear weapons . in her visit ahead of bush , secretary of state condoleezza rice said the united states favored a hard-line against iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technical staff are seen in this photo taken at the isfahan uranium conversion facility in central iran which is nearing completion .
the eu and america are trying to get iran to stop attempting to enrich uranium .
europe , particularly germany , france and great britain have been pushing for a diplomatic solution and some eu politicians have been alarmed by the sabre-rattling out of washington .
but bush rejected fears the u.s. was planning a military action . " i hear these rumors about military attacks and they are simply not true , " bush said in the interview . nato 's role bush will arrive in brussels on sunday , have dinner on monday with french president jacques chirac and visit the headquarters of the european commission tuesday evening after meeting with eu and nato heads of state .
barroso plans to host a dinner with bush , eu foreign policy chief javier solana and luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country is currently holding the european union 's rotating presidency . on wednesday , he makes a visit to mainz , germany to meet up with chancellor gerhard schröder .
the two , who have , by all accounts , made up after a deep rift opened following schröder 's anti-war stance , will discuss the chancellor 's controversial comments on rehauling nato .
schröder suggested earlier this week that nato should no longer be the " primary venue " for the transatlantic dialogue .
" i look forward to reminding gerhard schröder that nato is an active institution , " bush said . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mainz to lock down for bush visit tight security measures are being put into place for george w. bush 's stop in the city of mainz next week during his european tour .

but , how exactly is the money going to be distributed ? emergency aid began pouring in from all corners of the world right after the tidal wave hit on dec .
26 , 2004 and efforts to provide devastated areas with basis supplies are still underway . reconstruction however needs more time .
" it 's not possible to spread € 500 million over five years yet , " stephan bethe of the german federal ministry for economic development and cooperation -lrb- bmz -rrb- said and pointed out that the affected countries and donor nations first have to come to an agreement about what is needed and who is going to provide for it .
" reconstruction is a long process " , bethe said , adding that the right choices have to be made in rebuilding infrastructure like schools , hospitals , streets or energy and water supplies . in addition , the people have to be helped back to a position where they can earn a living on their own again .
where does the extra money go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bmz budget for 2005 amounts to € 3.8 billion , the same as last year . the € 500 million in tsunami aid money pledged by the german government comes on top of the development funds . berlin is also chanelling € 50 million from the tsunami aid funds into a un emergency relief fund .
the remaining € 450 million are meant to aid reconstruction in indonesia and sri lanka , the two worst-hit states in the tsunami . according to the bmz , it 's still difficult to foresee whether the duration of reconstruction there will take five years or less . more specifically , the extra long term aid money is going to be administered by the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- , which receives most of its assignments from the bmz , and the state-owned bank for reconstruction -lrb- kfw -rrb- .
both institutions operate development projects in particular countries and according to bethe they will handle projects in the tsunami-struck region on behalf of the bmz .
local know-how important employees of both the gtz and kfw however depend on local and regional expertise and organization on the ground .
" they can be local councils , non-governmental organizations or companies , " said hans stehling of the gtz .
the cooperation in turn provides employment opportunities for devastated communities .
for instance , the building of new schools or repairing fishing boats is often commissioned out to local carpentry companies .
in sri lanka , emergency relief has already translated into long-term reconstruction .
the gtz was present in the country with various projects long before the indian ocean tragedy struck , thus enabling it to react swiftly to the disaster .
on sunday , german development minster heidemarie wieczorek-zeul is expected in the region .
according to bmz 's bethe , the sri lankan government has already drawn up the first reconstruction plans which are now being approved by the donor nations .
it definitely sounds like more than just empty promises from germany 's government .
" we 've already proposed various projects for reconstruction .
now , we 're waiting for contracts from the bmz , " said stehling .
he 's counting on a quick decision from the ministry .
however , nobody 's talking of concrete dates or funds as yet .
germany 's ministry for economic development and cooperation skirts all questions regarding who is going to do what by saying that it 's dependant on the governments of the affected countries to react to offers of aid .
in indonesia , progress takes a little longer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's government is planing to present its masterplan for reconstruction on march 26 , three months after the tsunami hit the country .
until then , emergency aid in affected regions is going to continue along with german support .
due to the small presence of foreign aid organizations up to now , they can not fall back on existing structures and contacts and thus progress takes longer here .
but transition from measures such as organizing food , medicine or housing to reconstruction is fluid .

the us president seems intent on making amends with europe , and the continent 's leaders are only too happy to . " america needs europe and europe needs america and by working together we can make the world a better one , " jose manuel barroso , the president of the european commission , said in a statement on friday .
bush was similarly agreeable in an interview he gave to germany 's ard television before his trip .
in his comments , he confirmed europe and germany 's importance in the international community , and their importance to america .
" europe is extremely important for america and germany is extremely important for europe , " he said .
he said washington expects germany to have a role in stabilizing iraq , although " our german friends … must feel good about it . " bush : iran " rumors " not true despite the agreeable tone , bush and the european allies will have some tough issues to work through .
on the top of the list is what to do about iran , which is suspected of harboring ambitions to develop nuclear weapons . in her visit ahead of bush , secretary of state condoleezza rice said the united states favored a hard-line against iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technical staff are seen in this photo taken at the isfahan uranium conversion facility in central iran which is nearing completion .
the eu and america are trying to get iran to stop attempting to enrich uranium .
europe , particularly germany , france and great britain have been pushing for a diplomatic solution and some eu politicians have been alarmed by the sabre-rattling out of washington .
but bush rejected fears the u.s. was planning a military action . " i hear these rumors about military attacks and they are simply not true , " bush said in the interview . nato 's role bush will arrive in brussels on sunday , have dinner on monday with french president jacques chirac and visit the headquarters of the european commission tuesday evening after meeting with eu and nato heads of state .
barroso plans to host a dinner with bush , eu foreign policy chief javier solana and luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country is currently holding the european union 's rotating presidency . on wednesday , he makes a visit to mainz , germany to meet up with chancellor gerhard schröder .
the two , who have , by all accounts , made up after a deep rift opened following schröder 's anti-war stance , will discuss the chancellor 's controversial comments on rehauling nato .
schröder suggested earlier this week that nato should no longer be the " primary venue " for the transatlantic dialogue .
" i look forward to reminding gerhard schröder that nato is an active institution , " bush said . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mainz to lock down for bush visit tight security measures are being put into place for george w. bush 's stop in the city of mainz next week during his european tour .

where does the extra money go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bmz budget for 2005 amounts to € 3.8 billion , the same as last year . the € 500 million in tsunami aid money pledged by the german government comes on top of the development funds . berlin is also chanelling € 50 million from the tsunami aid funds into a un emergency relief fund .
the remaining € 450 million are meant to aid reconstruction in indonesia and sri lanka , the two worst-hit states in the tsunami . according to the bmz , it 's still difficult to foresee whether the duration of reconstruction there will take five years or less . more specifically , the extra long term aid money is going to be administered by the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- , which receives most of its assignments from the bmz , and the state-owned bank for reconstruction -lrb- kfw -rrb- .
both institutions operate development projects in particular countries and according to bethe they will handle projects in the tsunami-struck region on behalf of the bmz .

the cooperation in turn provides employment opportunities for devastated communities .
for instance , the building of new schools or repairing fishing boats is often commissioned out to local carpentry companies .

this year 's festival is no exception , having provided breakthrough moments for several new homegrown stars . julia jentsch , actress the undisputed new star to emerge from the berlinale is berlin-born actress julia jentsch , 26 .
her convincing portrayal of anti-nazi resistance heroine sophie scholl in the competition film " sophie scholl - the final days " went over well with both critics and audiences alike .
jentsch 's face is now gracing the covers of german magazines , meaning her days of going unrecognized are coming to an end .
jentsch previously appeared in " the edukators , " a film about a group of young people who break into the homes of the wealthy not to steal , but to send them a message about social injustice .
jentsch has been a member of the munich kammerspiel theatre ensemble since 2001 .
at a berlinale press conference , jentsch said she would be returning to the stage and had no plans to make another film .
but that 's likely to change soon - especially if jentsch scoops the silver bear for best actress , as many are already predicting . julia hummer , actress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia hummer another young actress named julia has created a stir at the berlinale - julia hummer , 24 , who stars in christian petzold 's film " ghosts " -lrb- gespenster -rrb- .
festival director dieter kosslick said hummer 's portrayal of a young woman the film 's protagonist believes is her lost daughter could make her " a very big star in europe or worldwide . "
but that will depend very much on which of her ambitions hummer decides to pursue .
she is also a dedicated musician with an album and negotiations with record labels in the works .
hummer 's previous film credits include the coming-of-age story " crazy , " and another film by petzold , " the state i am in " -lrb- die innere sicherheit -rrb- . hannes stöhr , director bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannes stöhr " one day in europe " has been described as " delightful " and " refreshing , " and has earned its director , hannes stöhr , 35 , accolades that are just as positive .
not bad , considering " europe " is only his second feature-length film , following on 2001 's " berlin is in germany . "
the film is made up of four episodes told in four european cities and seven different languages .
the thing that holds them together is a fictional european champions league soccer match played in moscow between spanish and turkish teams .
" soccer , whether you like the game or not , is something that connects all the cultures of europe , " said stöhr , who also wrote the film 's screenplay .
the story was a natural for stöhr , who lives in berlin , but has also spent parts of his life in moscow and istanbul , and who speaks english , german , spanish and french . max riemelt , actor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max riemelt in " napola " from constantin film it does n't get any more official than actually being named a shooting star 2005 , but that 's exactly what happened to young german actor max riemelt , 21 .
his current film , " napola " , in which he plays a working-class student at an elite training academy during the third reich , is not showing at the berlinale , but riemelt was one of 21 young actors from 21 different countries to be awarded the prize at a european film promotion event held alongside the festival .
riemelt first achieved teen-idol fame in germany with the film " mädchen , mädchen ! "
as a prize winner , riemelt will be introduced to countless producers , casting agents , and other actors over the next few days , but his attitude is relaxed .

not in dortmund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happier times : dortmund fans celebrate their 2002 championship fans of the dortmund soccer club bvb borrusia are distraught .
the storied team with one of the most loyal followings in the world is on the edge of a financial collapse that threatens its existence . a full 80,000 fans can fit into westfalen stadium , the cavernous temple to the dortmund soccer club bvb borussia 09 - and do so every home game .
the fan bloc , which during games is a sea of black and yellow banners and flags , is made up of 27,000 people each game - all of them standing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's westfalen stadium is one of the sites of the 2006 world cup so when dortmund fans are mad , it 's best to listen .
and they have never been more upset .
the problem " rage , fear and bewilderment , " read a newspaper headline in dortmund this week .
in four years , the bvb would have celebrated its 100th anniversary .
now , there is serious doubt the club can even make it to the next season .
borussia has run up a debt of € 142.1 million -lrb- $ 185.74 million -rrb- over the past few seasons , an equivalent of 79 percent of its capital .
just a few seasons ago , the club made headlines by winning the bundelisga title , competing regularly in european tournaments , and being the first german club to go on the stock exchange .
today , borrusia and its team of highly-paid stars is struggling up the bundesliga table .
the stock has plunged more than 25 percent .
the targets " the anger is massive and the fear is just as big , " one fan told dw-radio .
" i do n't know where it will go from here .

12 , 1,000 fans marched in dortmund behind a massive banner that read " not for sale : put an end to the lies and intrigue ! "
they accused meier of mismanagement and spending too much money on players who did n't deliver as promised .
they demanded meier correct the club 's miserable accounting and then resign .
" bvb brought a smile to my face " the anger , and the sheer numbers taking to the streets illustrate the importance of the soccer club to the ruhr valley city .
once a center for steel and coal mining , dortmund 's fortunes have sunk as companies have either gone bankrupt or pulled up stakes to move eastwards , where labor is cheaper .
for many of the workers , the soccer team was their weekend distraction .
for the growing list of unemployed and their families , the team is nowadays their only distraction .
bildunterschrift : fans protest on feb .
12 " the bvb is the only place where i can get away from all the worries and problems of daily life , " wrote one fan on a bvb fan chat room www.schwatzgelb.de.
other fans responded with similar stories and feelings and the site was soon covered with messages .
only thing left is hope " i had a difficult time as a youth and i was able to get through it with the bvb , " wrote another fan .
" the bvb brought a smile to my face when i actually should have been crying . "
along with the sadness , there were many messages calling for support and confidence in their beloved soccer club .
dortmund 's mayor said he was sure a proposed restructuring plan that includes deferring rental payments for its € 17 million a year stadium and a drastically-reduced player budget would work .
the team is the " heart and soul of the city , " mayor gerhard langemeyer told the news agency dpa .

this year 's festival is no exception , having provided breakthrough moments for several new homegrown stars . julia jentsch , actress the undisputed new star to emerge from the berlinale is berlin-born actress julia jentsch , 26 .
her convincing portrayal of anti-nazi resistance heroine sophie scholl in the competition film " sophie scholl - the final days " went over well with both critics and audiences alike .
jentsch 's face is now gracing the covers of german magazines , meaning her days of going unrecognized are coming to an end .
jentsch previously appeared in " the edukators , " a film about a group of young people who break into the homes of the wealthy not to steal , but to send them a message about social injustice .
jentsch has been a member of the munich kammerspiel theatre ensemble since 2001 .
at a berlinale press conference , jentsch said she would be returning to the stage and had no plans to make another film .

festival director dieter kosslick said hummer 's portrayal of a young woman the film 's protagonist believes is her lost daughter could make her " a very big star in europe or worldwide . "
but that will depend very much on which of her ambitions hummer decides to pursue .
she is also a dedicated musician with an album and negotiations with record labels in the works .
hummer 's previous film credits include the coming-of-age story " crazy , " and another film by petzold , " the state i am in " -lrb- die innere sicherheit -rrb- . hannes stöhr , director bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannes stöhr " one day in europe " has been described as " delightful " and " refreshing , " and has earned its director , hannes stöhr , 35 , accolades that are just as positive .
not bad , considering " europe " is only his second feature-length film , following on 2001 's " berlin is in germany . "
the film is made up of four episodes told in four european cities and seven different languages .
the thing that holds them together is a fictional european champions league soccer match played in moscow between spanish and turkish teams .
" soccer , whether you like the game or not , is something that connects all the cultures of europe , " said stöhr , who also wrote the film 's screenplay .
the story was a natural for stöhr , who lives in berlin , but has also spent parts of his life in moscow and istanbul , and who speaks english , german , spanish and french . max riemelt , actor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max riemelt in " napola " from constantin film it does n't get any more official than actually being named a shooting star 2005 , but that 's exactly what happened to young german actor max riemelt , 21 .
his current film , " napola " , in which he plays a working-class student at an elite training academy during the third reich , is not showing at the berlinale , but riemelt was one of 21 young actors from 21 different countries to be awarded the prize at a european film promotion event held alongside the festival .
riemelt first achieved teen-idol fame in germany with the film " mädchen , mädchen ! "

not in dortmund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happier times : dortmund fans celebrate their 2002 championship fans of the dortmund soccer club bvb borrusia are distraught .
the storied team with one of the most loyal followings in the world is on the edge of a financial collapse that threatens its existence . a full 80,000 fans can fit into westfalen stadium , the cavernous temple to the dortmund soccer club bvb borussia 09 - and do so every home game .
the fan bloc , which during games is a sea of black and yellow banners and flags , is made up of 27,000 people each game - all of them standing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's westfalen stadium is one of the sites of the 2006 world cup so when dortmund fans are mad , it 's best to listen .
and they have never been more upset .
the problem " rage , fear and bewilderment , " read a newspaper headline in dortmund this week .
in four years , the bvb would have celebrated its 100th anniversary .
now , there is serious doubt the club can even make it to the next season .
borussia has run up a debt of € 142.1 million -lrb- $ 185.74 million -rrb- over the past few seasons , an equivalent of 79 percent of its capital .
just a few seasons ago , the club made headlines by winning the bundelisga title , competing regularly in european tournaments , and being the first german club to go on the stock exchange .
today , borrusia and its team of highly-paid stars is struggling up the bundesliga table .
the stock has plunged more than 25 percent .
the targets " the anger is massive and the fear is just as big , " one fan told dw-radio .
" i do n't know where it will go from here .
i also do n't think these people will be able to get the club out of danger . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebaum -lrb- l . -rrb- left one week ago - but meier will stay on , despite what fans think " these people " are gerd niebaum and michael meier .
niebaum stepped down one week ago as president of the club .
meier remains in office and has had to face down a battery of cameras and microphones , not to mention irate fans in recent weeks as news of dortmund 's miserable economic situation spread .
on feb .
12 , 1,000 fans marched in dortmund behind a massive banner that read " not for sale : put an end to the lies and intrigue ! "
they accused meier of mismanagement and spending too much money on players who did n't deliver as promised .
they demanded meier correct the club 's miserable accounting and then resign .
" bvb brought a smile to my face " the anger , and the sheer numbers taking to the streets illustrate the importance of the soccer club to the ruhr valley city .
once a center for steel and coal mining , dortmund 's fortunes have sunk as companies have either gone bankrupt or pulled up stakes to move eastwards , where labor is cheaper .
for many of the workers , the soccer team was their weekend distraction .
for the growing list of unemployed and their families , the team is nowadays their only distraction .
bildunterschrift : fans protest on feb .
12 " the bvb is the only place where i can get away from all the worries and problems of daily life , " wrote one fan on a bvb fan chat room www.schwatzgelb.de.

not in dortmund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happier times : dortmund fans celebrate their 2002 championship fans of the dortmund soccer club bvb borrusia are distraught .
the storied team with one of the most loyal followings in the world is on the edge of a financial collapse that threatens its existence . a full 80,000 fans can fit into westfalen stadium , the cavernous temple to the dortmund soccer club bvb borussia 09 - and do so every home game .
the fan bloc , which during games is a sea of black and yellow banners and flags , is made up of 27,000 people each game - all of them standing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's westfalen stadium is one of the sites of the 2006 world cup so when dortmund fans are mad , it 's best to listen .
and they have never been more upset .
the problem " rage , fear and bewilderment , " read a newspaper headline in dortmund this week .
in four years , the bvb would have celebrated its 100th anniversary .
now , there is serious doubt the club can even make it to the next season .
borussia has run up a debt of € 142.1 million -lrb- $ 185.74 million -rrb- over the past few seasons , an equivalent of 79 percent of its capital .
just a few seasons ago , the club made headlines by winning the bundelisga title , competing regularly in european tournaments , and being the first german club to go on the stock exchange .
today , borrusia and its team of highly-paid stars is struggling up the bundesliga table .
the stock has plunged more than 25 percent .
the targets " the anger is massive and the fear is just as big , " one fan told dw-radio .
" i do n't know where it will go from here .
i also do n't think these people will be able to get the club out of danger . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebaum -lrb- l . -rrb- left one week ago - but meier will stay on , despite what fans think " these people " are gerd niebaum and michael meier .
niebaum stepped down one week ago as president of the club .
meier remains in office and has had to face down a battery of cameras and microphones , not to mention irate fans in recent weeks as news of dortmund 's miserable economic situation spread .
on feb .
12 , 1,000 fans marched in dortmund behind a massive banner that read " not for sale : put an end to the lies and intrigue ! "
they accused meier of mismanagement and spending too much money on players who did n't deliver as promised .
they demanded meier correct the club 's miserable accounting and then resign .
" bvb brought a smile to my face " the anger , and the sheer numbers taking to the streets illustrate the importance of the soccer club to the ruhr valley city .
once a center for steel and coal mining , dortmund 's fortunes have sunk as companies have either gone bankrupt or pulled up stakes to move eastwards , where labor is cheaper .
for many of the workers , the soccer team was their weekend distraction .
for the growing list of unemployed and their families , the team is nowadays their only distraction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the asian tsunami : one year after doing better than " business as usual " german tsunami early warning system takes shape german organizations take stock of tsunami relief message at un disaster meeting : be prepared germany -pipe- 19.02.2005 an endeavor that needs time and money großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an indonesian man cleans up the remains of his house the german government has generously pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 653 million -rrb- over the next three to five years for long-term rebuilding in tsunami-ravaged south asia .
but , how exactly is the money going to be distributed ? emergency aid began pouring in from all corners of the world right after the tidal wave hit on dec .
26 , 2004 and efforts to provide devastated areas with basis supplies are still underway . reconstruction however needs more time .
" it 's not possible to spread € 500 million over five years yet , " stephan bethe of the german federal ministry for economic development and cooperation -lrb- bmz -rrb- said and pointed out that the affected countries and donor nations first have to come to an agreement about what is needed and who is going to provide for it .
" reconstruction is a long process " , bethe said , adding that the right choices have to be made in rebuilding infrastructure like schools , hospitals , streets or energy and water supplies . in addition , the people have to be helped back to a position where they can earn a living on their own again .
where does the extra money go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bmz budget for 2005 amounts to € 3.8 billion , the same as last year . the € 500 million in tsunami aid money pledged by the german government comes on top of the development funds . berlin is also chanelling € 50 million from the tsunami aid funds into a un emergency relief fund .
the remaining € 450 million are meant to aid reconstruction in indonesia and sri lanka , the two worst-hit states in the tsunami . according to the bmz , it 's still difficult to foresee whether the duration of reconstruction there will take five years or less . more specifically , the extra long term aid money is going to be administered by the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- , which receives most of its assignments from the bmz , and the state-owned bank for reconstruction -lrb- kfw -rrb- .
both institutions operate development projects in particular countries and according to bethe they will handle projects in the tsunami-struck region on behalf of the bmz .
local know-how important employees of both the gtz and kfw however depend on local and regional expertise and organization on the ground .
" they can be local councils , non-governmental organizations or companies , " said hans stehling of the gtz .
the cooperation in turn provides employment opportunities for devastated communities .
for instance , the building of new schools or repairing fishing boats is often commissioned out to local carpentry companies .
in sri lanka , emergency relief has already translated into long-term reconstruction .
the gtz was present in the country with various projects long before the indian ocean tragedy struck , thus enabling it to react swiftly to the disaster .
on sunday , german development minster heidemarie wieczorek-zeul is expected in the region .
according to bmz 's bethe , the sri lankan government has already drawn up the first reconstruction plans which are now being approved by the donor nations .
it definitely sounds like more than just empty promises from germany 's government .
" we 've already proposed various projects for reconstruction .
now , we 're waiting for contracts from the bmz , " said stehling .
he 's counting on a quick decision from the ministry .
however , nobody 's talking of concrete dates or funds as yet .
germany 's ministry for economic development and cooperation skirts all questions regarding who is going to do what by saying that it 's dependant on the governments of the affected countries to react to offers of aid .
in indonesia , progress takes a little longer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's government is planing to present its masterplan for reconstruction on march 26 , three months after the tsunami hit the country .
until then , emergency aid in affected regions is going to continue along with german support .
due to the small presence of foreign aid organizations up to now , they can not fall back on existing structures and contacts and thus progress takes longer here .
but transition from measures such as organizing food , medicine or housing to reconstruction is fluid .
" especially with a catastrophe of such huge dimensions , reconstruction is a continuing process , " stehling said . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- bm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new alliance appeals for long-term aid the german government has promised € 500 million in aid for countries affected by the tsunami - a good sign that more long-term development aid is possible , say five german organisations who 've launched a joint appeal .

this year 's festival is no exception , having provided breakthrough moments for several new homegrown stars . julia jentsch , actress the undisputed new star to emerge from the berlinale is berlin-born actress julia jentsch , 26 .
her convincing portrayal of anti-nazi resistance heroine sophie scholl in the competition film " sophie scholl - the final days " went over well with both critics and audiences alike .
jentsch 's face is now gracing the covers of german magazines , meaning her days of going unrecognized are coming to an end .
jentsch previously appeared in " the edukators , " a film about a group of young people who break into the homes of the wealthy not to steal , but to send them a message about social injustice .
jentsch has been a member of the munich kammerspiel theatre ensemble since 2001 .
at a berlinale press conference , jentsch said she would be returning to the stage and had no plans to make another film .
but that 's likely to change soon - especially if jentsch scoops the silver bear for best actress , as many are already predicting . julia hummer , actress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia hummer another young actress named julia has created a stir at the berlinale - julia hummer , 24 , who stars in christian petzold 's film " ghosts " -lrb- gespenster -rrb- .
festival director dieter kosslick said hummer 's portrayal of a young woman the film 's protagonist believes is her lost daughter could make her " a very big star in europe or worldwide . "
but that will depend very much on which of her ambitions hummer decides to pursue .
she is also a dedicated musician with an album and negotiations with record labels in the works .
hummer 's previous film credits include the coming-of-age story " crazy , " and another film by petzold , " the state i am in " -lrb- die innere sicherheit -rrb- . hannes stöhr , director bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannes stöhr " one day in europe " has been described as " delightful " and " refreshing , " and has earned its director , hannes stöhr , 35 , accolades that are just as positive .
not bad , considering " europe " is only his second feature-length film , following on 2001 's " berlin is in germany . "
the film is made up of four episodes told in four european cities and seven different languages .
the thing that holds them together is a fictional european champions league soccer match played in moscow between spanish and turkish teams .
" soccer , whether you like the game or not , is something that connects all the cultures of europe , " said stöhr , who also wrote the film 's screenplay .
the story was a natural for stöhr , who lives in berlin , but has also spent parts of his life in moscow and istanbul , and who speaks english , german , spanish and french . max riemelt , actor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max riemelt in " napola " from constantin film it does n't get any more official than actually being named a shooting star 2005 , but that 's exactly what happened to young german actor max riemelt , 21 .
his current film , " napola " , in which he plays a working-class student at an elite training academy during the third reich , is not showing at the berlinale , but riemelt was one of 21 young actors from 21 different countries to be awarded the prize at a european film promotion event held alongside the festival .
riemelt first achieved teen-idol fame in germany with the film " mädchen , mädchen ! "
as a prize winner , riemelt will be introduced to countless producers , casting agents , and other actors over the next few days , but his attitude is relaxed .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bmz budget for 2005 amounts to € 3.8 billion , the same as last year . the € 500 million in tsunami aid money pledged by the german government comes on top of the development funds . berlin is also chanelling € 50 million from the tsunami aid funds into a un emergency relief fund .
the remaining € 450 million are meant to aid reconstruction in indonesia and sri lanka , the two worst-hit states in the tsunami . according to the bmz , it 's still difficult to foresee whether the duration of reconstruction there will take five years or less . more specifically , the extra long term aid money is going to be administered by the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- , which receives most of its assignments from the bmz , and the state-owned bank for reconstruction -lrb- kfw -rrb- .
both institutions operate development projects in particular countries and according to bethe they will handle projects in the tsunami-struck region on behalf of the bmz .
local know-how important employees of both the gtz and kfw however depend on local and regional expertise and organization on the ground .
" they can be local councils , non-governmental organizations or companies , " said hans stehling of the gtz .
the cooperation in turn provides employment opportunities for devastated communities .
for instance , the building of new schools or repairing fishing boats is often commissioned out to local carpentry companies .
in sri lanka , emergency relief has already translated into long-term reconstruction .
the gtz was present in the country with various projects long before the indian ocean tragedy struck , thus enabling it to react swiftly to the disaster .
on sunday , german development minster heidemarie wieczorek-zeul is expected in the region .
according to bmz 's bethe , the sri lankan government has already drawn up the first reconstruction plans which are now being approved by the donor nations .
it definitely sounds like more than just empty promises from germany 's government .
" we 've already proposed various projects for reconstruction .
now , we 're waiting for contracts from the bmz , " said stehling .
he 's counting on a quick decision from the ministry .
however , nobody 's talking of concrete dates or funds as yet .
germany 's ministry for economic development and cooperation skirts all questions regarding who is going to do what by saying that it 's dependant on the governments of the affected countries to react to offers of aid .
in indonesia , progress takes a little longer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's government is planing to present its masterplan for reconstruction on march 26 , three months after the tsunami hit the country .
until then , emergency aid in affected regions is going to continue along with german support .
due to the small presence of foreign aid organizations up to now , they can not fall back on existing structures and contacts and thus progress takes longer here .
but transition from measures such as organizing food , medicine or housing to reconstruction is fluid .
" especially with a catastrophe of such huge dimensions , reconstruction is a continuing process , " stehling said . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- bm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new alliance appeals for long-term aid the german government has promised € 500 million in aid for countries affected by the tsunami - a good sign that more long-term development aid is possible , say five german organisations who 've launched a joint appeal .

this year 's festival is no exception , having provided breakthrough moments for several new homegrown stars . julia jentsch , actress the undisputed new star to emerge from the berlinale is berlin-born actress julia jentsch , 26 .
her convincing portrayal of anti-nazi resistance heroine sophie scholl in the competition film " sophie scholl - the final days " went over well with both critics and audiences alike .
jentsch 's face is now gracing the covers of german magazines , meaning her days of going unrecognized are coming to an end .
jentsch previously appeared in " the edukators , " a film about a group of young people who break into the homes of the wealthy not to steal , but to send them a message about social injustice .
jentsch has been a member of the munich kammerspiel theatre ensemble since 2001 .
at a berlinale press conference , jentsch said she would be returning to the stage and had no plans to make another film .
but that 's likely to change soon - especially if jentsch scoops the silver bear for best actress , as many are already predicting . julia hummer , actress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia hummer another young actress named julia has created a stir at the berlinale - julia hummer , 24 , who stars in christian petzold 's film " ghosts " -lrb- gespenster -rrb- .
festival director dieter kosslick said hummer 's portrayal of a young woman the film 's protagonist believes is her lost daughter could make her " a very big star in europe or worldwide . "
but that will depend very much on which of her ambitions hummer decides to pursue .
she is also a dedicated musician with an album and negotiations with record labels in the works .
hummer 's previous film credits include the coming-of-age story " crazy , " and another film by petzold , " the state i am in " -lrb- die innere sicherheit -rrb- . hannes stöhr , director bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannes stöhr " one day in europe " has been described as " delightful " and " refreshing , " and has earned its director , hannes stöhr , 35 , accolades that are just as positive .
not bad , considering " europe " is only his second feature-length film , following on 2001 's " berlin is in germany . "
the film is made up of four episodes told in four european cities and seven different languages .
the thing that holds them together is a fictional european champions league soccer match played in moscow between spanish and turkish teams .
" soccer , whether you like the game or not , is something that connects all the cultures of europe , " said stöhr , who also wrote the film 's screenplay .
the story was a natural for stöhr , who lives in berlin , but has also spent parts of his life in moscow and istanbul , and who speaks english , german , spanish and french . max riemelt , actor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max riemelt in " napola " from constantin film it does n't get any more official than actually being named a shooting star 2005 , but that 's exactly what happened to young german actor max riemelt , 21 .

riemelt first achieved teen-idol fame in germany with the film " mädchen , mädchen ! "

dortmund 's defense left the dutch striker entirely too much space in the beginning of the game and paid dearly for it .
makaay kept the 53,000 home team fans riveted by scoring a pair of goals himself and assisting in tow more during the game 's first 45 minutes .
in the second half he put in one more to seal a personal hat trick and his team 's highest win of the season .
bayern had something to prove bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hasan salihamidzic , center , celebrates with teammates roy makkay , left , and mehmet scholl , after scoring " after the loss in bielefeld we had some matter to take care of and the team knew it , " said bayern munich trainer felix magath .
" we were lucky that we got a goal early and could pile on another one a little bit later . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the asian tsunami : one year after doing better than " business as usual " german tsunami early warning system takes shape german organizations take stock of tsunami relief message at un disaster meeting : be prepared germany -pipe- 19.02.2005 an endeavor that needs time and money großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an indonesian man cleans up the remains of his house the german government has generously pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 653 million -rrb- over the next three to five years for long-term rebuilding in tsunami-ravaged south asia .
but , how exactly is the money going to be distributed ? emergency aid began pouring in from all corners of the world right after the tidal wave hit on dec .
26 , 2004 and efforts to provide devastated areas with basis supplies are still underway . reconstruction however needs more time .
" it 's not possible to spread € 500 million over five years yet , " stephan bethe of the german federal ministry for economic development and cooperation -lrb- bmz -rrb- said and pointed out that the affected countries and donor nations first have to come to an agreement about what is needed and who is going to provide for it .
" reconstruction is a long process " , bethe said , adding that the right choices have to be made in rebuilding infrastructure like schools , hospitals , streets or energy and water supplies . in addition , the people have to be helped back to a position where they can earn a living on their own again .
where does the extra money go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bmz budget for 2005 amounts to € 3.8 billion , the same as last year . the € 500 million in tsunami aid money pledged by the german government comes on top of the development funds . berlin is also chanelling € 50 million from the tsunami aid funds into a un emergency relief fund .
the remaining € 450 million are meant to aid reconstruction in indonesia and sri lanka , the two worst-hit states in the tsunami . according to the bmz , it 's still difficult to foresee whether the duration of reconstruction there will take five years or less . more specifically , the extra long term aid money is going to be administered by the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- , which receives most of its assignments from the bmz , and the state-owned bank for reconstruction -lrb- kfw -rrb- .
both institutions operate development projects in particular countries and according to bethe they will handle projects in the tsunami-struck region on behalf of the bmz .
local know-how important employees of both the gtz and kfw however depend on local and regional expertise and organization on the ground .
" they can be local councils , non-governmental organizations or companies , " said hans stehling of the gtz .
the cooperation in turn provides employment opportunities for devastated communities .
for instance , the building of new schools or repairing fishing boats is often commissioned out to local carpentry companies .
in sri lanka , emergency relief has already translated into long-term reconstruction .
the gtz was present in the country with various projects long before the indian ocean tragedy struck , thus enabling it to react swiftly to the disaster .
on sunday , german development minster heidemarie wieczorek-zeul is expected in the region .
according to bmz 's bethe , the sri lankan government has already drawn up the first reconstruction plans which are now being approved by the donor nations .
it definitely sounds like more than just empty promises from germany 's government .
" we 've already proposed various projects for reconstruction .
now , we 're waiting for contracts from the bmz , " said stehling .
he 's counting on a quick decision from the ministry .
however , nobody 's talking of concrete dates or funds as yet .
germany 's ministry for economic development and cooperation skirts all questions regarding who is going to do what by saying that it 's dependant on the governments of the affected countries to react to offers of aid .
in indonesia , progress takes a little longer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's government is planing to present its masterplan for reconstruction on march 26 , three months after the tsunami hit the country .
until then , emergency aid in affected regions is going to continue along with german support .
due to the small presence of foreign aid organizations up to now , they can not fall back on existing structures and contacts and thus progress takes longer here .
but transition from measures such as organizing food , medicine or housing to reconstruction is fluid .
" especially with a catastrophe of such huge dimensions , reconstruction is a continuing process , " stehling said . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- bm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new alliance appeals for long-term aid the german government has promised € 500 million in aid for countries affected by the tsunami - a good sign that more long-term development aid is possible , say five german organisations who 've launched a joint appeal .

not in dortmund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happier times : dortmund fans celebrate their 2002 championship fans of the dortmund soccer club bvb borrusia are distraught .
the storied team with one of the most loyal followings in the world is on the edge of a financial collapse that threatens its existence . a full 80,000 fans can fit into westfalen stadium , the cavernous temple to the dortmund soccer club bvb borussia 09 - and do so every home game .
the fan bloc , which during games is a sea of black and yellow banners and flags , is made up of 27,000 people each game - all of them standing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's westfalen stadium is one of the sites of the 2006 world cup so when dortmund fans are mad , it 's best to listen .
and they have never been more upset .
the problem " rage , fear and bewilderment , " read a newspaper headline in dortmund this week .
in four years , the bvb would have celebrated its 100th anniversary .
now , there is serious doubt the club can even make it to the next season .
borussia has run up a debt of € 142.1 million -lrb- $ 185.74 million -rrb- over the past few seasons , an equivalent of 79 percent of its capital .
just a few seasons ago , the club made headlines by winning the bundelisga title , competing regularly in european tournaments , and being the first german club to go on the stock exchange .
today , borrusia and its team of highly-paid stars is struggling up the bundesliga table .
the stock has plunged more than 25 percent .
the targets " the anger is massive and the fear is just as big , " one fan told dw-radio .
" i do n't know where it will go from here .
i also do n't think these people will be able to get the club out of danger . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebaum -lrb- l . -rrb- left one week ago - but meier will stay on , despite what fans think " these people " are gerd niebaum and michael meier .
niebaum stepped down one week ago as president of the club .
meier remains in office and has had to face down a battery of cameras and microphones , not to mention irate fans in recent weeks as news of dortmund 's miserable economic situation spread .
on feb .
12 , 1,000 fans marched in dortmund behind a massive banner that read " not for sale : put an end to the lies and intrigue ! "
they accused meier of mismanagement and spending too much money on players who did n't deliver as promised .
they demanded meier correct the club 's miserable accounting and then resign .
" bvb brought a smile to my face " the anger , and the sheer numbers taking to the streets illustrate the importance of the soccer club to the ruhr valley city .
once a center for steel and coal mining , dortmund 's fortunes have sunk as companies have either gone bankrupt or pulled up stakes to move eastwards , where labor is cheaper .
for many of the workers , the soccer team was their weekend distraction .
for the growing list of unemployed and their families , the team is nowadays their only distraction .
bildunterschrift : fans protest on feb .
12 " the bvb is the only place where i can get away from all the worries and problems of daily life , " wrote one fan on a bvb fan chat room www.schwatzgelb.de.
other fans responded with similar stories and feelings and the site was soon covered with messages .
only thing left is hope " i had a difficult time as a youth and i was able to get through it with the bvb , " wrote another fan .
" the bvb brought a smile to my face when i actually should have been crying . "
along with the sadness , there were many messages calling for support and confidence in their beloved soccer club .
dortmund 's mayor said he was sure a proposed restructuring plan that includes deferring rental payments for its € 17 million a year stadium and a drastically-reduced player budget would work .
the team is the " heart and soul of the city , " mayor gerhard langemeyer told the news agency dpa .
" it 's not possible to imagine this city without the bvb .

there was some dissonance in 2003 and 2004 , especially over iraq .
but we have overcome our differences now .
that 's why i think the decision by president bush and his new secretary of state to choose europe as the place to make their first overseas visits since the new presidential term started is a very positive gesture . there 's a debate currently over what role nato should play in future relations between the europeans and the us .
a whole series of suggestions have been put forward on ways to improve the way we work together .
what is your view on this debate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i believe that everything that contributes toward making transatlantic relations more effective is good . every debate in this direction is positive .
i think that everyone accepts that transatlantic relations are no longer dealt with exclusively within the framework of nato , but to a large degree also within eu institutions .
this was very clearly highlighted by the many hours that secretary condoleezza rice spent at the european union .
and now president bush is coming to exchange views with leading european figures on the problems which exist between the eu and nato .
i believe this is positive and expresses the importance of the role of the european union in transatlantic relations , and the common desire for europeans and americans to work together . despite all the conflicts going on in the world , there have been significant advances made , for example in the middle east .
how realistic is the hope for peace between israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana , left , and peter hansen , commissioner general of the united nations relief and works agency -lrb- unrwa -rrb- , inspect damage of a destroyed kindergarden during their tour in the norther gaza strip town of beit lahiya , wednesday jan .
12 , 2005 .
i have been involved in the middle east peace process for many years , but now for the first time i am very optimistic and i can see great opportunities .
there is a path that both israelis and palestinians must tread together , accompanied by their friends .
both we europeans and the americans are their friends , and i believe we can join them on this path .
but it wo n't be easy .
there will be high and low points , and good times and bad .
the most important thing is that we remain committed and show good will . i think that president abbas is doing a good job , from the way the palestinian election was run to what he 's doing now .
and prime minister sharon has also made good decisions , like relaxing the restrictions on palestinians so that people can enjoy a better standard of life , and the decision to remove settlements from the gaza strip .
but i am well aware of the pitfalls .
we have to keep our eyes open and be clear about our obligations .
as i have said before , we have to be committed to providing help because there will be innumerable difficulties . what can the european union do to help abbas end terrorism and to support the move towards peace ? the best that we can do to help him is to strengthen and train his police force .
and that 's what we 're doing now .
there 's a team already working with the palestinian security forces to help them function in the most efficient and effective way possible .
that 's important , but the political will to end terrorist activities is more important .
president abbas has made very clear statements on this and has acted accordingly . that must be recognized by the international community as well as by israel . the european union is also in negotiations to persuade iran not to build nuclear weapons .
can we expect success there as well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in bushehr , iran , 750 miles -lrb- 1,200 kilometers -rrb- southwest of tehran .
we made considerable progress in the last few months .
iran has signed an additional protocol which allows inspectors from the international atomic energy authority to visit sites across the country without giving prior notification .
that means the iaea can carry out a control function in iran . the negotiations are being conducted on three levels at the same time : we 're dealing with the nuclear arms issue , security aspects for iran , and trade and economic relations between iran and the eu .
we hope that we will continue to make progress . does this mean that these subjects will be decided bilaterally between the iranian government and the europeans , or will the americans have a say in the negotiations ? i think that the united states is not interested in joining the negotiations at this point in time .
they can support them from the sidelines .
as you know , the us has no diplomatic relations with iran , and for this reason it is more difficult for them .
in any case , if all goes well , the results will be seen in vienna at the international atomic energy agency .
any agreement reached with iran will have to be ratified by the iaea board of governors , which is elected by nations in the iaea , who are all members of the united nations , can we now say that relations between the us and europe are close and that there 's been no break in the dialogue with the us ?
is there agreement on how to implement common political strategies ? yes , i think so .
that follows on from what i said about the talks that we have held in the past few months .
and i hope this will be underlined by president bush and the leading political figures of the european union . is there hope of an agreement , for example on the subject of china and the decision by the european union to lift the weapons embargo on beijing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao , left , smiles as former eu commission president romano prodi gestures during a media conference at the eu commission building in brussels , thursday , may 6 , 2004 .
all issues that we are in the process of negotiating are both difficult and delicate .
even so , i 'm convinced that we can reach agreement .
as far as china is concerned , i would like to emphasize that it is not about selling more weapons to china ; rather it concerns the lifting of sanctions that the eu imposed on china during the tiananmen square crisis .
since then , many years have gone by and much has happened .
a new generation is in charge in china now and we want to forge new relations which are not overshadowed by sanctions .
for this reason , the lifting of the weapons embargo will be a political rather than a military gesture . the interview was conducted by gonzalo cáceres send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush , europe set to mend fences ahead of us president george w. bush 's highly-anticipated visit to europe , both sides are all smiles .

the most important thing is that we remain committed and show good will . i think that president abbas is doing a good job , from the way the palestinian election was run to what he 's doing now .
and prime minister sharon has also made good decisions , like relaxing the restrictions on palestinians so that people can enjoy a better standard of life , and the decision to remove settlements from the gaza strip .
but i am well aware of the pitfalls .
we have to keep our eyes open and be clear about our obligations .
as i have said before , we have to be committed to providing help because there will be innumerable difficulties . what can the european union do to help abbas end terrorism and to support the move towards peace ? the best that we can do to help him is to strengthen and train his police force .
and that 's what we 're doing now .
there 's a team already working with the palestinian security forces to help them function in the most efficient and effective way possible .
that 's important , but the political will to end terrorist activities is more important .
president abbas has made very clear statements on this and has acted accordingly . that must be recognized by the international community as well as by israel . the european union is also in negotiations to persuade iran not to build nuclear weapons .
can we expect success there as well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in bushehr , iran , 750 miles -lrb- 1,200 kilometers -rrb- southwest of tehran .
we made considerable progress in the last few months .
iran has signed an additional protocol which allows inspectors from the international atomic energy authority to visit sites across the country without giving prior notification .
that means the iaea can carry out a control function in iran . the negotiations are being conducted on three levels at the same time : we 're dealing with the nuclear arms issue , security aspects for iran , and trade and economic relations between iran and the eu .
we hope that we will continue to make progress . does this mean that these subjects will be decided bilaterally between the iranian government and the europeans , or will the americans have a say in the negotiations ? i think that the united states is not interested in joining the negotiations at this point in time .
they can support them from the sidelines .

all issues that we are in the process of negotiating are both difficult and delicate .
even so , i 'm convinced that we can reach agreement .

what do you think will come of this visit ?
how will the europeans welcome the american president ? javier solana : i think the visit has every prospect of being a success .
i think the current climate and atmosphere are much better than they were a couple of years , or even a couple of months ago .
there was some dissonance in 2003 and 2004 , especially over iraq .
but we have overcome our differences now .
that 's why i think the decision by president bush and his new secretary of state to choose europe as the place to make their first overseas visits since the new presidential term started is a very positive gesture . there 's a debate currently over what role nato should play in future relations between the europeans and the us .
a whole series of suggestions have been put forward on ways to improve the way we work together .
what is your view on this debate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i believe that everything that contributes toward making transatlantic relations more effective is good . every debate in this direction is positive .
i think that everyone accepts that transatlantic relations are no longer dealt with exclusively within the framework of nato , but to a large degree also within eu institutions .
this was very clearly highlighted by the many hours that secretary condoleezza rice spent at the european union .
and now president bush is coming to exchange views with leading european figures on the problems which exist between the eu and nato .
i believe this is positive and expresses the importance of the role of the european union in transatlantic relations , and the common desire for europeans and americans to work together . despite all the conflicts going on in the world , there have been significant advances made , for example in the middle east .
how realistic is the hope for peace between israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana , left , and peter hansen , commissioner general of the united nations relief and works agency -lrb- unrwa -rrb- , inspect damage of a destroyed kindergarden during their tour in the norther gaza strip town of beit lahiya , wednesday jan .
12 , 2005 .
i have been involved in the middle east peace process for many years , but now for the first time i am very optimistic and i can see great opportunities .
there is a path that both israelis and palestinians must tread together , accompanied by their friends .
both we europeans and the americans are their friends , and i believe we can join them on this path .
but it wo n't be easy .
there will be high and low points , and good times and bad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the asian tsunami : one year after doing better than " business as usual " german tsunami early warning system takes shape german organizations take stock of tsunami relief message at un disaster meeting : be prepared germany -pipe- 19.02.2005 an endeavor that needs time and money großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an indonesian man cleans up the remains of his house the german government has generously pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 653 million -rrb- over the next three to five years for long-term rebuilding in tsunami-ravaged south asia .
but , how exactly is the money going to be distributed ? emergency aid began pouring in from all corners of the world right after the tidal wave hit on dec .
26 , 2004 and efforts to provide devastated areas with basis supplies are still underway . reconstruction however needs more time .
" it 's not possible to spread € 500 million over five years yet , " stephan bethe of the german federal ministry for economic development and cooperation -lrb- bmz -rrb- said and pointed out that the affected countries and donor nations first have to come to an agreement about what is needed and who is going to provide for it .
" reconstruction is a long process " , bethe said , adding that the right choices have to be made in rebuilding infrastructure like schools , hospitals , streets or energy and water supplies . in addition , the people have to be helped back to a position where they can earn a living on their own again .
where does the extra money go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bmz budget for 2005 amounts to € 3.8 billion , the same as last year . the € 500 million in tsunami aid money pledged by the german government comes on top of the development funds . berlin is also chanelling € 50 million from the tsunami aid funds into a un emergency relief fund .
the remaining € 450 million are meant to aid reconstruction in indonesia and sri lanka , the two worst-hit states in the tsunami . according to the bmz , it 's still difficult to foresee whether the duration of reconstruction there will take five years or less . more specifically , the extra long term aid money is going to be administered by the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- , which receives most of its assignments from the bmz , and the state-owned bank for reconstruction -lrb- kfw -rrb- .
both institutions operate development projects in particular countries and according to bethe they will handle projects in the tsunami-struck region on behalf of the bmz .
local know-how important employees of both the gtz and kfw however depend on local and regional expertise and organization on the ground .
" they can be local councils , non-governmental organizations or companies , " said hans stehling of the gtz .
the cooperation in turn provides employment opportunities for devastated communities .
for instance , the building of new schools or repairing fishing boats is often commissioned out to local carpentry companies .
in sri lanka , emergency relief has already translated into long-term reconstruction .
the gtz was present in the country with various projects long before the indian ocean tragedy struck , thus enabling it to react swiftly to the disaster .
on sunday , german development minster heidemarie wieczorek-zeul is expected in the region .
according to bmz 's bethe , the sri lankan government has already drawn up the first reconstruction plans which are now being approved by the donor nations .
it definitely sounds like more than just empty promises from germany 's government .
" we 've already proposed various projects for reconstruction .
now , we 're waiting for contracts from the bmz , " said stehling .
he 's counting on a quick decision from the ministry .
however , nobody 's talking of concrete dates or funds as yet .
germany 's ministry for economic development and cooperation skirts all questions regarding who is going to do what by saying that it 's dependant on the governments of the affected countries to react to offers of aid .
in indonesia , progress takes a little longer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's government is planing to present its masterplan for reconstruction on march 26 , three months after the tsunami hit the country .
until then , emergency aid in affected regions is going to continue along with german support .
due to the small presence of foreign aid organizations up to now , they can not fall back on existing structures and contacts and thus progress takes longer here .
but transition from measures such as organizing food , medicine or housing to reconstruction is fluid .
" especially with a catastrophe of such huge dimensions , reconstruction is a continuing process , " stehling said . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- bm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new alliance appeals for long-term aid the german government has promised € 500 million in aid for countries affected by the tsunami - a good sign that more long-term development aid is possible , say five german organisations who 've launched a joint appeal .

dortmund 's defense left the dutch striker entirely too much space in the beginning of the game and paid dearly for it .
makaay kept the 53,000 home team fans riveted by scoring a pair of goals himself and assisting in tow more during the game 's first 45 minutes .
in the second half he put in one more to seal a personal hat trick and his team 's highest win of the season .
bayern had something to prove bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hasan salihamidzic , center , celebrates with teammates roy makkay , left , and mehmet scholl , after scoring " after the loss in bielefeld we had some matter to take care of and the team knew it , " said bayern munich trainer felix magath .
" we were lucky that we got a goal early and could pile on another one a little bit later . "
it was hasan salihamidzic who opened scoring in the fifth minute , and makaay put in his first of three exceptional goals just one minute later .
the two quick goals gave dortmund a shock they never recovered from .
bert van marwijk watched his bvb squad 's defense fall apart time after time while his strikers never worked their way into a truly dangerous position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich flew away with the win at home against dortmund dortmund goalkeeper roman weidenfeller inexplicably allowed makaay 's tame shot to squirm under his body in the game 's 34th minute , but was helpless earlier in the 28th minute when claudio pizarro volleyed home .
even a locker room talk could n't bring dortmund back to life and makaay ended the scoring by putting a shot between dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller 's legs in the 54th minute , giving bayern munich its third home win in a row .
bankruptcy not an excuse for borussia dortmund , the crushing loss moved what until now was only a financial crisis to the playing field .
on thursday the team announced they were on the edge of bankruptcy .
the disastrous defeat thus capped what has already been a distressing week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the brink of bankruptcy , a thrashing in munich added insult to borussia dortmund 's financial injury " we were not confident , " said dortmund coach van marwijk .
" we were not in the game for a moment after falling behind early .
our financial problems are not an alibi . "
the win means bayern will stay in first place atop the bundesliga table , by how many points will remain unclear until 2nd-placed schalke 04 play against borussia mönchengladbach sunday afternoon .
munich started the game without german national team captain michael ballack and also let torsten frings and owen hargreaves have a break before this week 's champions league match against arsenal london .
salihamidzic and martin demichelis took the starters ' places in midfield and , along with mehmet scholl , proved they are capable of playing reliably for the german league 's top team . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de life after soccer ?

" reconstruction is a long process " , bethe said , adding that the right choices have to be made in rebuilding infrastructure like schools , hospitals , streets or energy and water supplies . in addition , the people have to be helped back to a position where they can earn a living on their own again .
where does the extra money go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bmz budget for 2005 amounts to € 3.8 billion , the same as last year . the € 500 million in tsunami aid money pledged by the german government comes on top of the development funds . berlin is also chanelling € 50 million from the tsunami aid funds into a un emergency relief fund .
the remaining € 450 million are meant to aid reconstruction in indonesia and sri lanka , the two worst-hit states in the tsunami . according to the bmz , it 's still difficult to foresee whether the duration of reconstruction there will take five years or less . more specifically , the extra long term aid money is going to be administered by the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- , which receives most of its assignments from the bmz , and the state-owned bank for reconstruction -lrb- kfw -rrb- .
both institutions operate development projects in particular countries and according to bethe they will handle projects in the tsunami-struck region on behalf of the bmz .
local know-how important employees of both the gtz and kfw however depend on local and regional expertise and organization on the ground .
" they can be local councils , non-governmental organizations or companies , " said hans stehling of the gtz .
the cooperation in turn provides employment opportunities for devastated communities .
for instance , the building of new schools or repairing fishing boats is often commissioned out to local carpentry companies .
in sri lanka , emergency relief has already translated into long-term reconstruction .
the gtz was present in the country with various projects long before the indian ocean tragedy struck , thus enabling it to react swiftly to the disaster .
on sunday , german development minster heidemarie wieczorek-zeul is expected in the region .
according to bmz 's bethe , the sri lankan government has already drawn up the first reconstruction plans which are now being approved by the donor nations .
it definitely sounds like more than just empty promises from germany 's government .
" we 've already proposed various projects for reconstruction .
now , we 're waiting for contracts from the bmz , " said stehling .
he 's counting on a quick decision from the ministry .
however , nobody 's talking of concrete dates or funds as yet .
germany 's ministry for economic development and cooperation skirts all questions regarding who is going to do what by saying that it 's dependant on the governments of the affected countries to react to offers of aid .
in indonesia , progress takes a little longer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's government is planing to present its masterplan for reconstruction on march 26 , three months after the tsunami hit the country .
until then , emergency aid in affected regions is going to continue along with german support .
due to the small presence of foreign aid organizations up to now , they can not fall back on existing structures and contacts and thus progress takes longer here .
but transition from measures such as organizing food , medicine or housing to reconstruction is fluid .

dortmund 's defense left the dutch striker entirely too much space in the beginning of the game and paid dearly for it .
makaay kept the 53,000 home team fans riveted by scoring a pair of goals himself and assisting in tow more during the game 's first 45 minutes .
in the second half he put in one more to seal a personal hat trick and his team 's highest win of the season .
bayern had something to prove bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hasan salihamidzic , center , celebrates with teammates roy makkay , left , and mehmet scholl , after scoring " after the loss in bielefeld we had some matter to take care of and the team knew it , " said bayern munich trainer felix magath .
" we were lucky that we got a goal early and could pile on another one a little bit later . "
it was hasan salihamidzic who opened scoring in the fifth minute , and makaay put in his first of three exceptional goals just one minute later .

even a locker room talk could n't bring dortmund back to life and makaay ended the scoring by putting a shot between dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller 's legs in the 54th minute , giving bayern munich its third home win in a row .

the disastrous defeat thus capped what has already been a distressing week .

the win means bayern will stay in first place atop the bundesliga table , by how many points will remain unclear until 2nd-placed schalke 04 play against borussia mönchengladbach sunday afternoon .

dortmund 's defense left the dutch striker entirely too much space in the beginning of the game and paid dearly for it .
makaay kept the 53,000 home team fans riveted by scoring a pair of goals himself and assisting in tow more during the game 's first 45 minutes .
in the second half he put in one more to seal a personal hat trick and his team 's highest win of the season .
bayern had something to prove bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hasan salihamidzic , center , celebrates with teammates roy makkay , left , and mehmet scholl , after scoring " after the loss in bielefeld we had some matter to take care of and the team knew it , " said bayern munich trainer felix magath .
" we were lucky that we got a goal early and could pile on another one a little bit later . "
it was hasan salihamidzic who opened scoring in the fifth minute , and makaay put in his first of three exceptional goals just one minute later .
the two quick goals gave dortmund a shock they never recovered from .
bert van marwijk watched his bvb squad 's defense fall apart time after time while his strikers never worked their way into a truly dangerous position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich flew away with the win at home against dortmund dortmund goalkeeper roman weidenfeller inexplicably allowed makaay 's tame shot to squirm under his body in the game 's 34th minute , but was helpless earlier in the 28th minute when claudio pizarro volleyed home .
even a locker room talk could n't bring dortmund back to life and makaay ended the scoring by putting a shot between dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller 's legs in the 54th minute , giving bayern munich its third home win in a row .
bankruptcy not an excuse for borussia dortmund , the crushing loss moved what until now was only a financial crisis to the playing field .

the win means bayern will stay in first place atop the bundesliga table , by how many points will remain unclear until 2nd-placed schalke 04 play against borussia mönchengladbach sunday afternoon .

the storied team with one of the most loyal followings in the world is on the edge of a financial collapse that threatens its existence . a full 80,000 fans can fit into westfalen stadium , the cavernous temple to the dortmund soccer club bvb borussia 09 - and do so every home game .
the fan bloc , which during games is a sea of black and yellow banners and flags , is made up of 27,000 people each game - all of them standing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's westfalen stadium is one of the sites of the 2006 world cup so when dortmund fans are mad , it 's best to listen .
and they have never been more upset .
the problem " rage , fear and bewilderment , " read a newspaper headline in dortmund this week .
in four years , the bvb would have celebrated its 100th anniversary .
now , there is serious doubt the club can even make it to the next season .
borussia has run up a debt of € 142.1 million -lrb- $ 185.74 million -rrb- over the past few seasons , an equivalent of 79 percent of its capital .
just a few seasons ago , the club made headlines by winning the bundelisga title , competing regularly in european tournaments , and being the first german club to go on the stock exchange .
today , borrusia and its team of highly-paid stars is struggling up the bundesliga table .
the stock has plunged more than 25 percent .

they accused meier of mismanagement and spending too much money on players who did n't deliver as promised .
they demanded meier correct the club 's miserable accounting and then resign .
" bvb brought a smile to my face " the anger , and the sheer numbers taking to the streets illustrate the importance of the soccer club to the ruhr valley city .
once a center for steel and coal mining , dortmund 's fortunes have sunk as companies have either gone bankrupt or pulled up stakes to move eastwards , where labor is cheaper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.02.2005 eu chief keen to seek unity with us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiss and make up : solana , left , was welcoming to condoleeza rice on the eve of president bush 's europe visit , the eu 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , told deutsche welle that the us and europe were ready to bury past rifts and cooperate on divisive issues . deutsche welle : mr. solana , us president george w. bush is traveling to europe this coming week .
what do you think will come of this visit ?
how will the europeans welcome the american president ? javier solana : i think the visit has every prospect of being a success .
i think the current climate and atmosphere are much better than they were a couple of years , or even a couple of months ago .
there was some dissonance in 2003 and 2004 , especially over iraq .
but we have overcome our differences now .
that 's why i think the decision by president bush and his new secretary of state to choose europe as the place to make their first overseas visits since the new presidential term started is a very positive gesture . there 's a debate currently over what role nato should play in future relations between the europeans and the us .
a whole series of suggestions have been put forward on ways to improve the way we work together .
what is your view on this debate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i believe that everything that contributes toward making transatlantic relations more effective is good . every debate in this direction is positive .
i think that everyone accepts that transatlantic relations are no longer dealt with exclusively within the framework of nato , but to a large degree also within eu institutions .
this was very clearly highlighted by the many hours that secretary condoleezza rice spent at the european union .
and now president bush is coming to exchange views with leading european figures on the problems which exist between the eu and nato .
i believe this is positive and expresses the importance of the role of the european union in transatlantic relations , and the common desire for europeans and americans to work together . despite all the conflicts going on in the world , there have been significant advances made , for example in the middle east .
how realistic is the hope for peace between israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana , left , and peter hansen , commissioner general of the united nations relief and works agency -lrb- unrwa -rrb- , inspect damage of a destroyed kindergarden during their tour in the norther gaza strip town of beit lahiya , wednesday jan .
12 , 2005 .
i have been involved in the middle east peace process for many years , but now for the first time i am very optimistic and i can see great opportunities .
there is a path that both israelis and palestinians must tread together , accompanied by their friends .
both we europeans and the americans are their friends , and i believe we can join them on this path .
but it wo n't be easy .
there will be high and low points , and good times and bad .
the most important thing is that we remain committed and show good will . i think that president abbas is doing a good job , from the way the palestinian election was run to what he 's doing now .
and prime minister sharon has also made good decisions , like relaxing the restrictions on palestinians so that people can enjoy a better standard of life , and the decision to remove settlements from the gaza strip .
but i am well aware of the pitfalls .
we have to keep our eyes open and be clear about our obligations .
as i have said before , we have to be committed to providing help because there will be innumerable difficulties . what can the european union do to help abbas end terrorism and to support the move towards peace ? the best that we can do to help him is to strengthen and train his police force .
and that 's what we 're doing now .
there 's a team already working with the palestinian security forces to help them function in the most efficient and effective way possible .
that 's important , but the political will to end terrorist activities is more important .
president abbas has made very clear statements on this and has acted accordingly . that must be recognized by the international community as well as by israel . the european union is also in negotiations to persuade iran not to build nuclear weapons .
can we expect success there as well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in bushehr , iran , 750 miles -lrb- 1,200 kilometers -rrb- southwest of tehran .
we made considerable progress in the last few months .
iran has signed an additional protocol which allows inspectors from the international atomic energy authority to visit sites across the country without giving prior notification .
that means the iaea can carry out a control function in iran . the negotiations are being conducted on three levels at the same time : we 're dealing with the nuclear arms issue , security aspects for iran , and trade and economic relations between iran and the eu .
we hope that we will continue to make progress . does this mean that these subjects will be decided bilaterally between the iranian government and the europeans , or will the americans have a say in the negotiations ? i think that the united states is not interested in joining the negotiations at this point in time .
they can support them from the sidelines .
as you know , the us has no diplomatic relations with iran , and for this reason it is more difficult for them .
in any case , if all goes well , the results will be seen in vienna at the international atomic energy agency .
any agreement reached with iran will have to be ratified by the iaea board of governors , which is elected by nations in the iaea , who are all members of the united nations , can we now say that relations between the us and europe are close and that there 's been no break in the dialogue with the us ?
is there agreement on how to implement common political strategies ? yes , i think so .
that follows on from what i said about the talks that we have held in the past few months .
and i hope this will be underlined by president bush and the leading political figures of the european union . is there hope of an agreement , for example on the subject of china and the decision by the european union to lift the weapons embargo on beijing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao , left , smiles as former eu commission president romano prodi gestures during a media conference at the eu commission building in brussels , thursday , may 6 , 2004 .
all issues that we are in the process of negotiating are both difficult and delicate .
even so , i 'm convinced that we can reach agreement .
as far as china is concerned , i would like to emphasize that it is not about selling more weapons to china ; rather it concerns the lifting of sanctions that the eu imposed on china during the tiananmen square crisis .
since then , many years have gone by and much has happened .
a new generation is in charge in china now and we want to forge new relations which are not overshadowed by sanctions .
for this reason , the lifting of the weapons embargo will be a political rather than a military gesture . the interview was conducted by gonzalo cáceres send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush , europe set to mend fences ahead of us president george w. bush 's highly-anticipated visit to europe , both sides are all smiles .

it ’ s in your body , and simply put , it ’ s the " messenger " that your dna uses to tell proteins how to build your cells .
if dna is the architect , and proteins are the construction team , then rna is like the contractor that mediates between them .
well , just as a bad contractor can ruin a construction project , faulty rna can wreak havoc on your body .
it can cause cancer , degenerative illnesses , and infections .
that ’ s where rna interference technology comes in .
it gets in the way of faulty rna .
you can see it in the picture below : the red stuff is a protein called lamin .
when we add an rna inhibitor and a green dye , like in the bottom left , it stops the lamin from building and the lamin turns green .
bildunterschrift : but how does this fabulous technology work ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.02.2005 eu chief keen to seek unity with us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiss and make up : solana , left , was welcoming to condoleeza rice on the eve of president bush 's europe visit , the eu 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , told deutsche welle that the us and europe were ready to bury past rifts and cooperate on divisive issues . deutsche welle : mr. solana , us president george w. bush is traveling to europe this coming week .
what do you think will come of this visit ?
how will the europeans welcome the american president ? javier solana : i think the visit has every prospect of being a success .
i think the current climate and atmosphere are much better than they were a couple of years , or even a couple of months ago .
there was some dissonance in 2003 and 2004 , especially over iraq .
but we have overcome our differences now .
that 's why i think the decision by president bush and his new secretary of state to choose europe as the place to make their first overseas visits since the new presidential term started is a very positive gesture . there 's a debate currently over what role nato should play in future relations between the europeans and the us .
a whole series of suggestions have been put forward on ways to improve the way we work together .
what is your view on this debate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i believe that everything that contributes toward making transatlantic relations more effective is good . every debate in this direction is positive .
i think that everyone accepts that transatlantic relations are no longer dealt with exclusively within the framework of nato , but to a large degree also within eu institutions .
this was very clearly highlighted by the many hours that secretary condoleezza rice spent at the european union .
and now president bush is coming to exchange views with leading european figures on the problems which exist between the eu and nato .
i believe this is positive and expresses the importance of the role of the european union in transatlantic relations , and the common desire for europeans and americans to work together . despite all the conflicts going on in the world , there have been significant advances made , for example in the middle east .
how realistic is the hope for peace between israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana , left , and peter hansen , commissioner general of the united nations relief and works agency -lrb- unrwa -rrb- , inspect damage of a destroyed kindergarden during their tour in the norther gaza strip town of beit lahiya , wednesday jan .
12 , 2005 .
i have been involved in the middle east peace process for many years , but now for the first time i am very optimistic and i can see great opportunities .
there is a path that both israelis and palestinians must tread together , accompanied by their friends .
both we europeans and the americans are their friends , and i believe we can join them on this path .
but it wo n't be easy .
there will be high and low points , and good times and bad .
the most important thing is that we remain committed and show good will . i think that president abbas is doing a good job , from the way the palestinian election was run to what he 's doing now .
and prime minister sharon has also made good decisions , like relaxing the restrictions on palestinians so that people can enjoy a better standard of life , and the decision to remove settlements from the gaza strip .
but i am well aware of the pitfalls .
we have to keep our eyes open and be clear about our obligations .
as i have said before , we have to be committed to providing help because there will be innumerable difficulties . what can the european union do to help abbas end terrorism and to support the move towards peace ? the best that we can do to help him is to strengthen and train his police force .
and that 's what we 're doing now .
there 's a team already working with the palestinian security forces to help them function in the most efficient and effective way possible .
that 's important , but the political will to end terrorist activities is more important .
president abbas has made very clear statements on this and has acted accordingly . that must be recognized by the international community as well as by israel . the european union is also in negotiations to persuade iran not to build nuclear weapons .
can we expect success there as well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in bushehr , iran , 750 miles -lrb- 1,200 kilometers -rrb- southwest of tehran .
we made considerable progress in the last few months .
iran has signed an additional protocol which allows inspectors from the international atomic energy authority to visit sites across the country without giving prior notification .
that means the iaea can carry out a control function in iran . the negotiations are being conducted on three levels at the same time : we 're dealing with the nuclear arms issue , security aspects for iran , and trade and economic relations between iran and the eu .
we hope that we will continue to make progress . does this mean that these subjects will be decided bilaterally between the iranian government and the europeans , or will the americans have a say in the negotiations ? i think that the united states is not interested in joining the negotiations at this point in time .
they can support them from the sidelines .
as you know , the us has no diplomatic relations with iran , and for this reason it is more difficult for them .
in any case , if all goes well , the results will be seen in vienna at the international atomic energy agency .
any agreement reached with iran will have to be ratified by the iaea board of governors , which is elected by nations in the iaea , who are all members of the united nations , can we now say that relations between the us and europe are close and that there 's been no break in the dialogue with the us ?
is there agreement on how to implement common political strategies ? yes , i think so .
that follows on from what i said about the talks that we have held in the past few months .
and i hope this will be underlined by president bush and the leading political figures of the european union . is there hope of an agreement , for example on the subject of china and the decision by the european union to lift the weapons embargo on beijing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao , left , smiles as former eu commission president romano prodi gestures during a media conference at the eu commission building in brussels , thursday , may 6 , 2004 .
all issues that we are in the process of negotiating are both difficult and delicate .
even so , i 'm convinced that we can reach agreement .
as far as china is concerned , i would like to emphasize that it is not about selling more weapons to china ; rather it concerns the lifting of sanctions that the eu imposed on china during the tiananmen square crisis .
since then , many years have gone by and much has happened .
a new generation is in charge in china now and we want to forge new relations which are not overshadowed by sanctions .
for this reason , the lifting of the weapons embargo will be a political rather than a military gesture . the interview was conducted by gonzalo cáceres send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush , europe set to mend fences ahead of us president george w. bush 's highly-anticipated visit to europe , both sides are all smiles .

what do you think will come of this visit ?
how will the europeans welcome the american president ? javier solana : i think the visit has every prospect of being a success .
i think the current climate and atmosphere are much better than they were a couple of years , or even a couple of months ago .
there was some dissonance in 2003 and 2004 , especially over iraq .
but we have overcome our differences now .
that 's why i think the decision by president bush and his new secretary of state to choose europe as the place to make their first overseas visits since the new presidential term started is a very positive gesture . there 's a debate currently over what role nato should play in future relations between the europeans and the us .
a whole series of suggestions have been put forward on ways to improve the way we work together .
what is your view on this debate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i believe that everything that contributes toward making transatlantic relations more effective is good . every debate in this direction is positive .
i think that everyone accepts that transatlantic relations are no longer dealt with exclusively within the framework of nato , but to a large degree also within eu institutions .
this was very clearly highlighted by the many hours that secretary condoleezza rice spent at the european union .
and now president bush is coming to exchange views with leading european figures on the problems which exist between the eu and nato .
i believe this is positive and expresses the importance of the role of the european union in transatlantic relations , and the common desire for europeans and americans to work together . despite all the conflicts going on in the world , there have been significant advances made , for example in the middle east .
how realistic is the hope for peace between israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana , left , and peter hansen , commissioner general of the united nations relief and works agency -lrb- unrwa -rrb- , inspect damage of a destroyed kindergarden during their tour in the norther gaza strip town of beit lahiya , wednesday jan .
12 , 2005 .
i have been involved in the middle east peace process for many years , but now for the first time i am very optimistic and i can see great opportunities .
there is a path that both israelis and palestinians must tread together , accompanied by their friends .
both we europeans and the americans are their friends , and i believe we can join them on this path .
but it wo n't be easy .
there will be high and low points , and good times and bad .
the most important thing is that we remain committed and show good will . i think that president abbas is doing a good job , from the way the palestinian election was run to what he 's doing now .
and prime minister sharon has also made good decisions , like relaxing the restrictions on palestinians so that people can enjoy a better standard of life , and the decision to remove settlements from the gaza strip .
but i am well aware of the pitfalls .
we have to keep our eyes open and be clear about our obligations .
as i have said before , we have to be committed to providing help because there will be innumerable difficulties . what can the european union do to help abbas end terrorism and to support the move towards peace ? the best that we can do to help him is to strengthen and train his police force .
and that 's what we 're doing now .
there 's a team already working with the palestinian security forces to help them function in the most efficient and effective way possible .
that 's important , but the political will to end terrorist activities is more important .
president abbas has made very clear statements on this and has acted accordingly . that must be recognized by the international community as well as by israel . the european union is also in negotiations to persuade iran not to build nuclear weapons .
can we expect success there as well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in bushehr , iran , 750 miles -lrb- 1,200 kilometers -rrb- southwest of tehran .
we made considerable progress in the last few months .
iran has signed an additional protocol which allows inspectors from the international atomic energy authority to visit sites across the country without giving prior notification .
that means the iaea can carry out a control function in iran . the negotiations are being conducted on three levels at the same time : we 're dealing with the nuclear arms issue , security aspects for iran , and trade and economic relations between iran and the eu .
we hope that we will continue to make progress . does this mean that these subjects will be decided bilaterally between the iranian government and the europeans , or will the americans have a say in the negotiations ? i think that the united states is not interested in joining the negotiations at this point in time .
they can support them from the sidelines .
as you know , the us has no diplomatic relations with iran , and for this reason it is more difficult for them .
in any case , if all goes well , the results will be seen in vienna at the international atomic energy agency .
any agreement reached with iran will have to be ratified by the iaea board of governors , which is elected by nations in the iaea , who are all members of the united nations , can we now say that relations between the us and europe are close and that there 's been no break in the dialogue with the us ?
is there agreement on how to implement common political strategies ? yes , i think so .
that follows on from what i said about the talks that we have held in the past few months .
and i hope this will be underlined by president bush and the leading political figures of the european union . is there hope of an agreement , for example on the subject of china and the decision by the european union to lift the weapons embargo on beijing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao , left , smiles as former eu commission president romano prodi gestures during a media conference at the eu commission building in brussels , thursday , may 6 , 2004 .
all issues that we are in the process of negotiating are both difficult and delicate .
even so , i 'm convinced that we can reach agreement .
as far as china is concerned , i would like to emphasize that it is not about selling more weapons to china ; rather it concerns the lifting of sanctions that the eu imposed on china during the tiananmen square crisis .

i think the current climate and atmosphere are much better than they were a couple of years , or even a couple of months ago .
there was some dissonance in 2003 and 2004 , especially over iraq .
but we have overcome our differences now .
that 's why i think the decision by president bush and his new secretary of state to choose europe as the place to make their first overseas visits since the new presidential term started is a very positive gesture . there 's a debate currently over what role nato should play in future relations between the europeans and the us .
a whole series of suggestions have been put forward on ways to improve the way we work together .
what is your view on this debate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i believe that everything that contributes toward making transatlantic relations more effective is good . every debate in this direction is positive .
i think that everyone accepts that transatlantic relations are no longer dealt with exclusively within the framework of nato , but to a large degree also within eu institutions .
this was very clearly highlighted by the many hours that secretary condoleezza rice spent at the european union .
and now president bush is coming to exchange views with leading european figures on the problems which exist between the eu and nato .
i believe this is positive and expresses the importance of the role of the european union in transatlantic relations , and the common desire for europeans and americans to work together . despite all the conflicts going on in the world , there have been significant advances made , for example in the middle east .
how realistic is the hope for peace between israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana , left , and peter hansen , commissioner general of the united nations relief and works agency -lrb- unrwa -rrb- , inspect damage of a destroyed kindergarden during their tour in the norther gaza strip town of beit lahiya , wednesday jan .
12 , 2005 .
i have been involved in the middle east peace process for many years , but now for the first time i am very optimistic and i can see great opportunities .
there is a path that both israelis and palestinians must tread together , accompanied by their friends .
both we europeans and the americans are their friends , and i believe we can join them on this path .
but it wo n't be easy .
there will be high and low points , and good times and bad .
the most important thing is that we remain committed and show good will . i think that president abbas is doing a good job , from the way the palestinian election was run to what he 's doing now .
and prime minister sharon has also made good decisions , like relaxing the restrictions on palestinians so that people can enjoy a better standard of life , and the decision to remove settlements from the gaza strip .
but i am well aware of the pitfalls .
we have to keep our eyes open and be clear about our obligations .
as i have said before , we have to be committed to providing help because there will be innumerable difficulties . what can the european union do to help abbas end terrorism and to support the move towards peace ? the best that we can do to help him is to strengthen and train his police force .
and that 's what we 're doing now .
there 's a team already working with the palestinian security forces to help them function in the most efficient and effective way possible .
that 's important , but the political will to end terrorist activities is more important .
president abbas has made very clear statements on this and has acted accordingly . that must be recognized by the international community as well as by israel . the european union is also in negotiations to persuade iran not to build nuclear weapons .
can we expect success there as well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in bushehr , iran , 750 miles -lrb- 1,200 kilometers -rrb- southwest of tehran .
we made considerable progress in the last few months .
iran has signed an additional protocol which allows inspectors from the international atomic energy authority to visit sites across the country without giving prior notification .
that means the iaea can carry out a control function in iran . the negotiations are being conducted on three levels at the same time : we 're dealing with the nuclear arms issue , security aspects for iran , and trade and economic relations between iran and the eu .
we hope that we will continue to make progress . does this mean that these subjects will be decided bilaterally between the iranian government and the europeans , or will the americans have a say in the negotiations ? i think that the united states is not interested in joining the negotiations at this point in time .
they can support them from the sidelines .
as you know , the us has no diplomatic relations with iran , and for this reason it is more difficult for them .
in any case , if all goes well , the results will be seen in vienna at the international atomic energy agency .
any agreement reached with iran will have to be ratified by the iaea board of governors , which is elected by nations in the iaea , who are all members of the united nations , can we now say that relations between the us and europe are close and that there 's been no break in the dialogue with the us ?
is there agreement on how to implement common political strategies ? yes , i think so .
that follows on from what i said about the talks that we have held in the past few months .
and i hope this will be underlined by president bush and the leading political figures of the european union . is there hope of an agreement , for example on the subject of china and the decision by the european union to lift the weapons embargo on beijing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao , left , smiles as former eu commission president romano prodi gestures during a media conference at the eu commission building in brussels , thursday , may 6 , 2004 .
all issues that we are in the process of negotiating are both difficult and delicate .
even so , i 'm convinced that we can reach agreement .
as far as china is concerned , i would like to emphasize that it is not about selling more weapons to china ; rather it concerns the lifting of sanctions that the eu imposed on china during the tiananmen square crisis .
since then , many years have gone by and much has happened .
a new generation is in charge in china now and we want to forge new relations which are not overshadowed by sanctions .
for this reason , the lifting of the weapons embargo will be a political rather than a military gesture . the interview was conducted by gonzalo cáceres send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush , europe set to mend fences ahead of us president george w. bush 's highly-anticipated visit to europe , both sides are all smiles .

dortmund 's defense left the dutch striker entirely too much space in the beginning of the game and paid dearly for it .
makaay kept the 53,000 home team fans riveted by scoring a pair of goals himself and assisting in tow more during the game 's first 45 minutes .

" we were lucky that we got a goal early and could pile on another one a little bit later . "

dortmund 's defense left the dutch striker entirely too much space in the beginning of the game and paid dearly for it .
makaay kept the 53,000 home team fans riveted by scoring a pair of goals himself and assisting in tow more during the game 's first 45 minutes .
in the second half he put in one more to seal a personal hat trick and his team 's highest win of the season .
bayern had something to prove bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hasan salihamidzic , center , celebrates with teammates roy makkay , left , and mehmet scholl , after scoring " after the loss in bielefeld we had some matter to take care of and the team knew it , " said bayern munich trainer felix magath .
" we were lucky that we got a goal early and could pile on another one a little bit later . "
it was hasan salihamidzic who opened scoring in the fifth minute , and makaay put in his first of three exceptional goals just one minute later .
the two quick goals gave dortmund a shock they never recovered from .
bert van marwijk watched his bvb squad 's defense fall apart time after time while his strikers never worked their way into a truly dangerous position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich flew away with the win at home against dortmund dortmund goalkeeper roman weidenfeller inexplicably allowed makaay 's tame shot to squirm under his body in the game 's 34th minute , but was helpless earlier in the 28th minute when claudio pizarro volleyed home .
even a locker room talk could n't bring dortmund back to life and makaay ended the scoring by putting a shot between dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller 's legs in the 54th minute , giving bayern munich its third home win in a row .
bankruptcy not an excuse for borussia dortmund , the crushing loss moved what until now was only a financial crisis to the playing field .
on thursday the team announced they were on the edge of bankruptcy .
the disastrous defeat thus capped what has already been a distressing week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the brink of bankruptcy , a thrashing in munich added insult to borussia dortmund 's financial injury " we were not confident , " said dortmund coach van marwijk .
" we were not in the game for a moment after falling behind early .
our financial problems are not an alibi . "
the win means bayern will stay in first place atop the bundesliga table , by how many points will remain unclear until 2nd-placed schalke 04 play against borussia mönchengladbach sunday afternoon .
munich started the game without german national team captain michael ballack and also let torsten frings and owen hargreaves have a break before this week 's champions league match against arsenal london .

what do you think will come of this visit ?
how will the europeans welcome the american president ? javier solana : i think the visit has every prospect of being a success .
i think the current climate and atmosphere are much better than they were a couple of years , or even a couple of months ago .
there was some dissonance in 2003 and 2004 , especially over iraq .
but we have overcome our differences now .
that 's why i think the decision by president bush and his new secretary of state to choose europe as the place to make their first overseas visits since the new presidential term started is a very positive gesture . there 's a debate currently over what role nato should play in future relations between the europeans and the us .
a whole series of suggestions have been put forward on ways to improve the way we work together .
what is your view on this debate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i believe that everything that contributes toward making transatlantic relations more effective is good . every debate in this direction is positive .
i think that everyone accepts that transatlantic relations are no longer dealt with exclusively within the framework of nato , but to a large degree also within eu institutions .
this was very clearly highlighted by the many hours that secretary condoleezza rice spent at the european union .
and now president bush is coming to exchange views with leading european figures on the problems which exist between the eu and nato .
i believe this is positive and expresses the importance of the role of the european union in transatlantic relations , and the common desire for europeans and americans to work together . despite all the conflicts going on in the world , there have been significant advances made , for example in the middle east .
how realistic is the hope for peace between israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana , left , and peter hansen , commissioner general of the united nations relief and works agency -lrb- unrwa -rrb- , inspect damage of a destroyed kindergarden during their tour in the norther gaza strip town of beit lahiya , wednesday jan .
12 , 2005 .
i have been involved in the middle east peace process for many years , but now for the first time i am very optimistic and i can see great opportunities .
there is a path that both israelis and palestinians must tread together , accompanied by their friends .
both we europeans and the americans are their friends , and i believe we can join them on this path .
but it wo n't be easy .
there will be high and low points , and good times and bad .
the most important thing is that we remain committed and show good will . i think that president abbas is doing a good job , from the way the palestinian election was run to what he 's doing now .
and prime minister sharon has also made good decisions , like relaxing the restrictions on palestinians so that people can enjoy a better standard of life , and the decision to remove settlements from the gaza strip .
but i am well aware of the pitfalls .
we have to keep our eyes open and be clear about our obligations .
as i have said before , we have to be committed to providing help because there will be innumerable difficulties . what can the european union do to help abbas end terrorism and to support the move towards peace ? the best that we can do to help him is to strengthen and train his police force .
and that 's what we 're doing now .
there 's a team already working with the palestinian security forces to help them function in the most efficient and effective way possible .
that 's important , but the political will to end terrorist activities is more important .
president abbas has made very clear statements on this and has acted accordingly . that must be recognized by the international community as well as by israel . the european union is also in negotiations to persuade iran not to build nuclear weapons .
can we expect success there as well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in bushehr , iran , 750 miles -lrb- 1,200 kilometers -rrb- southwest of tehran .
we made considerable progress in the last few months .
iran has signed an additional protocol which allows inspectors from the international atomic energy authority to visit sites across the country without giving prior notification .
that means the iaea can carry out a control function in iran . the negotiations are being conducted on three levels at the same time : we 're dealing with the nuclear arms issue , security aspects for iran , and trade and economic relations between iran and the eu .
we hope that we will continue to make progress . does this mean that these subjects will be decided bilaterally between the iranian government and the europeans , or will the americans have a say in the negotiations ? i think that the united states is not interested in joining the negotiations at this point in time .
they can support them from the sidelines .
as you know , the us has no diplomatic relations with iran , and for this reason it is more difficult for them .
in any case , if all goes well , the results will be seen in vienna at the international atomic energy agency .
any agreement reached with iran will have to be ratified by the iaea board of governors , which is elected by nations in the iaea , who are all members of the united nations , can we now say that relations between the us and europe are close and that there 's been no break in the dialogue with the us ?
is there agreement on how to implement common political strategies ? yes , i think so .
that follows on from what i said about the talks that we have held in the past few months .
and i hope this will be underlined by president bush and the leading political figures of the european union . is there hope of an agreement , for example on the subject of china and the decision by the european union to lift the weapons embargo on beijing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao , left , smiles as former eu commission president romano prodi gestures during a media conference at the eu commission building in brussels , thursday , may 6 , 2004 .
all issues that we are in the process of negotiating are both difficult and delicate .
even so , i 'm convinced that we can reach agreement .
as far as china is concerned , i would like to emphasize that it is not about selling more weapons to china ; rather it concerns the lifting of sanctions that the eu imposed on china during the tiananmen square crisis .
since then , many years have gone by and much has happened .
a new generation is in charge in china now and we want to forge new relations which are not overshadowed by sanctions .
for this reason , the lifting of the weapons embargo will be a political rather than a military gesture . the interview was conducted by gonzalo cáceres send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush , europe set to mend fences ahead of us president george w. bush 's highly-anticipated visit to europe , both sides are all smiles .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 19.02.2005 bayern munich rip dortmund apart großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay had three goals to whoop about munich wanted to show their bundesliga critics that last week 's 3-1 loss to arminia bielefeld was a one-time slip , and they did it in convincing style by thrashing financially ailing borussia dortmund 5-0 . roy makaay was bayern 's man of the day in munich 's olympic stadium .
dortmund 's defense left the dutch striker entirely too much space in the beginning of the game and paid dearly for it .
makaay kept the 53,000 home team fans riveted by scoring a pair of goals himself and assisting in tow more during the game 's first 45 minutes .
in the second half he put in one more to seal a personal hat trick and his team 's highest win of the season .
bayern had something to prove bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hasan salihamidzic , center , celebrates with teammates roy makkay , left , and mehmet scholl , after scoring " after the loss in bielefeld we had some matter to take care of and the team knew it , " said bayern munich trainer felix magath .
" we were lucky that we got a goal early and could pile on another one a little bit later . "
it was hasan salihamidzic who opened scoring in the fifth minute , and makaay put in his first of three exceptional goals just one minute later .
the two quick goals gave dortmund a shock they never recovered from .
bert van marwijk watched his bvb squad 's defense fall apart time after time while his strikers never worked their way into a truly dangerous position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich flew away with the win at home against dortmund dortmund goalkeeper roman weidenfeller inexplicably allowed makaay 's tame shot to squirm under his body in the game 's 34th minute , but was helpless earlier in the 28th minute when claudio pizarro volleyed home .
even a locker room talk could n't bring dortmund back to life and makaay ended the scoring by putting a shot between dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller 's legs in the 54th minute , giving bayern munich its third home win in a row .
bankruptcy not an excuse for borussia dortmund , the crushing loss moved what until now was only a financial crisis to the playing field .
on thursday the team announced they were on the edge of bankruptcy .
the disastrous defeat thus capped what has already been a distressing week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the brink of bankruptcy , a thrashing in munich added insult to borussia dortmund 's financial injury " we were not confident , " said dortmund coach van marwijk .
" we were not in the game for a moment after falling behind early .
our financial problems are not an alibi . "
the win means bayern will stay in first place atop the bundesliga table , by how many points will remain unclear until 2nd-placed schalke 04 play against borussia mönchengladbach sunday afternoon .
munich started the game without german national team captain michael ballack and also let torsten frings and owen hargreaves have a break before this week 's champions league match against arsenal london .
salihamidzic and martin demichelis took the starters ' places in midfield and , along with mehmet scholl , proved they are capable of playing reliably for the german league 's top team . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de life after soccer ?

" a kenyan treasury official confirmed the move on saturday , which has underscored donors ' concern on emergence of fresh allegations of sleaze . earlier this month the united states also suspended 200 million shillings -lrb- $ 2.5 million -rrb- anti-graft funding to kenya while the european union - the country 's single largest collective donor - along with japan and canada have warned they may review future aid programs .
the decision follows the resignation on february 7 of kibaki 's chief advisor on corruption , john githongo , who quit saying the government was unwilling to fight the sleaze in the country , where more than half of its 33.3 million people live on less than a dollar a day . more briefs 18.02.2005 -pipe- germans bust sex smuggling ring 18.02.2005 -pipe- german tsunami death toll rises to 80 18.02.2005 -pipe- germany starts ratification of eu treaty 18.02.2005 -pipe- fischer targets opposition in visa scandal 18.02.2005 -pipe- germany bans two egyptian imams 17.02.2005 -pipe- germany may boost afghanistan presence 16.02.2005 -pipe- schröder confident about key eu debates 16.02.2005 -pipe- schröder stands by his nato reform ideas radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 19.02.2005 bayern munich rip dortmund apart großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay had three goals to whoop about munich wanted to show their bundesliga critics that last week 's 3-1 loss to arminia bielefeld was a one-time slip , and they did it in convincing style by thrashing financially ailing borussia dortmund 5-0 . roy makaay was bayern 's man of the day in munich 's olympic stadium .
dortmund 's defense left the dutch striker entirely too much space in the beginning of the game and paid dearly for it .
makaay kept the 53,000 home team fans riveted by scoring a pair of goals himself and assisting in tow more during the game 's first 45 minutes .
in the second half he put in one more to seal a personal hat trick and his team 's highest win of the season .
bayern had something to prove bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hasan salihamidzic , center , celebrates with teammates roy makkay , left , and mehmet scholl , after scoring " after the loss in bielefeld we had some matter to take care of and the team knew it , " said bayern munich trainer felix magath .
" we were lucky that we got a goal early and could pile on another one a little bit later . "
it was hasan salihamidzic who opened scoring in the fifth minute , and makaay put in his first of three exceptional goals just one minute later .
the two quick goals gave dortmund a shock they never recovered from .
bert van marwijk watched his bvb squad 's defense fall apart time after time while his strikers never worked their way into a truly dangerous position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich flew away with the win at home against dortmund dortmund goalkeeper roman weidenfeller inexplicably allowed makaay 's tame shot to squirm under his body in the game 's 34th minute , but was helpless earlier in the 28th minute when claudio pizarro volleyed home .
even a locker room talk could n't bring dortmund back to life and makaay ended the scoring by putting a shot between dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller 's legs in the 54th minute , giving bayern munich its third home win in a row .
bankruptcy not an excuse for borussia dortmund , the crushing loss moved what until now was only a financial crisis to the playing field .
on thursday the team announced they were on the edge of bankruptcy .
the disastrous defeat thus capped what has already been a distressing week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the brink of bankruptcy , a thrashing in munich added insult to borussia dortmund 's financial injury " we were not confident , " said dortmund coach van marwijk .
" we were not in the game for a moment after falling behind early .
our financial problems are not an alibi . "
the win means bayern will stay in first place atop the bundesliga table , by how many points will remain unclear until 2nd-placed schalke 04 play against borussia mönchengladbach sunday afternoon .
munich started the game without german national team captain michael ballack and also let torsten frings and owen hargreaves have a break before this week 's champions league match against arsenal london .
salihamidzic and martin demichelis took the starters ' places in midfield and , along with mehmet scholl , proved they are capable of playing reliably for the german league 's top team . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de life after soccer ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the asian tsunami : one year after doing better than " business as usual " german tsunami early warning system takes shape german organizations take stock of tsunami relief message at un disaster meeting : be prepared germany -pipe- 19.02.2005 an endeavor that needs time and money großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an indonesian man cleans up the remains of his house the german government has generously pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 653 million -rrb- over the next three to five years for long-term rebuilding in tsunami-ravaged south asia .
but , how exactly is the money going to be distributed ? emergency aid began pouring in from all corners of the world right after the tidal wave hit on dec .
26 , 2004 and efforts to provide devastated areas with basis supplies are still underway . reconstruction however needs more time .
" it 's not possible to spread € 500 million over five years yet , " stephan bethe of the german federal ministry for economic development and cooperation -lrb- bmz -rrb- said and pointed out that the affected countries and donor nations first have to come to an agreement about what is needed and who is going to provide for it .
" reconstruction is a long process " , bethe said , adding that the right choices have to be made in rebuilding infrastructure like schools , hospitals , streets or energy and water supplies . in addition , the people have to be helped back to a position where they can earn a living on their own again .
where does the extra money go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bmz budget for 2005 amounts to € 3.8 billion , the same as last year . the € 500 million in tsunami aid money pledged by the german government comes on top of the development funds . berlin is also chanelling € 50 million from the tsunami aid funds into a un emergency relief fund .
the remaining € 450 million are meant to aid reconstruction in indonesia and sri lanka , the two worst-hit states in the tsunami . according to the bmz , it 's still difficult to foresee whether the duration of reconstruction there will take five years or less . more specifically , the extra long term aid money is going to be administered by the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- , which receives most of its assignments from the bmz , and the state-owned bank for reconstruction -lrb- kfw -rrb- .
both institutions operate development projects in particular countries and according to bethe they will handle projects in the tsunami-struck region on behalf of the bmz .
local know-how important employees of both the gtz and kfw however depend on local and regional expertise and organization on the ground .
" they can be local councils , non-governmental organizations or companies , " said hans stehling of the gtz .
the cooperation in turn provides employment opportunities for devastated communities .
for instance , the building of new schools or repairing fishing boats is often commissioned out to local carpentry companies .

both institutions operate development projects in particular countries and according to bethe they will handle projects in the tsunami-struck region on behalf of the bmz .
local know-how important employees of both the gtz and kfw however depend on local and regional expertise and organization on the ground .
" they can be local councils , non-governmental organizations or companies , " said hans stehling of the gtz .
the cooperation in turn provides employment opportunities for devastated communities .
for instance , the building of new schools or repairing fishing boats is often commissioned out to local carpentry companies .
in sri lanka , emergency relief has already translated into long-term reconstruction .
the gtz was present in the country with various projects long before the indian ocean tragedy struck , thus enabling it to react swiftly to the disaster .
on sunday , german development minster heidemarie wieczorek-zeul is expected in the region .
according to bmz 's bethe , the sri lankan government has already drawn up the first reconstruction plans which are now being approved by the donor nations .
it definitely sounds like more than just empty promises from germany 's government .
" we 've already proposed various projects for reconstruction .
now , we 're waiting for contracts from the bmz , " said stehling .
he 's counting on a quick decision from the ministry .
however , nobody 's talking of concrete dates or funds as yet .
germany 's ministry for economic development and cooperation skirts all questions regarding who is going to do what by saying that it 's dependant on the governments of the affected countries to react to offers of aid .
in indonesia , progress takes a little longer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's government is planing to present its masterplan for reconstruction on march 26 , three months after the tsunami hit the country .
until then , emergency aid in affected regions is going to continue along with german support .
due to the small presence of foreign aid organizations up to now , they can not fall back on existing structures and contacts and thus progress takes longer here .
but transition from measures such as organizing food , medicine or housing to reconstruction is fluid .
" especially with a catastrophe of such huge dimensions , reconstruction is a continuing process , " stehling said . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- bm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new alliance appeals for long-term aid the german government has promised € 500 million in aid for countries affected by the tsunami - a good sign that more long-term development aid is possible , say five german organisations who 've launched a joint appeal .

her convincing portrayal of anti-nazi resistance heroine sophie scholl in the competition film " sophie scholl - the final days " went over well with both critics and audiences alike .
jentsch 's face is now gracing the covers of german magazines , meaning her days of going unrecognized are coming to an end .

this year 's festival is no exception , having provided breakthrough moments for several new homegrown stars . julia jentsch , actress the undisputed new star to emerge from the berlinale is berlin-born actress julia jentsch , 26 .
her convincing portrayal of anti-nazi resistance heroine sophie scholl in the competition film " sophie scholl - the final days " went over well with both critics and audiences alike .
jentsch 's face is now gracing the covers of german magazines , meaning her days of going unrecognized are coming to an end .
jentsch previously appeared in " the edukators , " a film about a group of young people who break into the homes of the wealthy not to steal , but to send them a message about social injustice .
jentsch has been a member of the munich kammerspiel theatre ensemble since 2001 .

dortmund 's defense left the dutch striker entirely too much space in the beginning of the game and paid dearly for it .
makaay kept the 53,000 home team fans riveted by scoring a pair of goals himself and assisting in tow more during the game 's first 45 minutes .
in the second half he put in one more to seal a personal hat trick and his team 's highest win of the season .
bayern had something to prove bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hasan salihamidzic , center , celebrates with teammates roy makkay , left , and mehmet scholl , after scoring " after the loss in bielefeld we had some matter to take care of and the team knew it , " said bayern munich trainer felix magath .
" we were lucky that we got a goal early and could pile on another one a little bit later . "
it was hasan salihamidzic who opened scoring in the fifth minute , and makaay put in his first of three exceptional goals just one minute later .
the two quick goals gave dortmund a shock they never recovered from .
bert van marwijk watched his bvb squad 's defense fall apart time after time while his strikers never worked their way into a truly dangerous position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich flew away with the win at home against dortmund dortmund goalkeeper roman weidenfeller inexplicably allowed makaay 's tame shot to squirm under his body in the game 's 34th minute , but was helpless earlier in the 28th minute when claudio pizarro volleyed home .
even a locker room talk could n't bring dortmund back to life and makaay ended the scoring by putting a shot between dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller 's legs in the 54th minute , giving bayern munich its third home win in a row .
bankruptcy not an excuse for borussia dortmund , the crushing loss moved what until now was only a financial crisis to the playing field .
on thursday the team announced they were on the edge of bankruptcy .
the disastrous defeat thus capped what has already been a distressing week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the brink of bankruptcy , a thrashing in munich added insult to borussia dortmund 's financial injury " we were not confident , " said dortmund coach van marwijk .
" we were not in the game for a moment after falling behind early .
our financial problems are not an alibi . "
the win means bayern will stay in first place atop the bundesliga table , by how many points will remain unclear until 2nd-placed schalke 04 play against borussia mönchengladbach sunday afternoon .
munich started the game without german national team captain michael ballack and also let torsten frings and owen hargreaves have a break before this week 's champions league match against arsenal london .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 19.02.2005 bayern munich rip dortmund apart großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay had three goals to whoop about munich wanted to show their bundesliga critics that last week 's 3-1 loss to arminia bielefeld was a one-time slip , and they did it in convincing style by thrashing financially ailing borussia dortmund 5-0 . roy makaay was bayern 's man of the day in munich 's olympic stadium .
dortmund 's defense left the dutch striker entirely too much space in the beginning of the game and paid dearly for it .
makaay kept the 53,000 home team fans riveted by scoring a pair of goals himself and assisting in tow more during the game 's first 45 minutes .
in the second half he put in one more to seal a personal hat trick and his team 's highest win of the season .
bayern had something to prove bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hasan salihamidzic , center , celebrates with teammates roy makkay , left , and mehmet scholl , after scoring " after the loss in bielefeld we had some matter to take care of and the team knew it , " said bayern munich trainer felix magath .
" we were lucky that we got a goal early and could pile on another one a little bit later . "
it was hasan salihamidzic who opened scoring in the fifth minute , and makaay put in his first of three exceptional goals just one minute later .
the two quick goals gave dortmund a shock they never recovered from .
bert van marwijk watched his bvb squad 's defense fall apart time after time while his strikers never worked their way into a truly dangerous position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich flew away with the win at home against dortmund dortmund goalkeeper roman weidenfeller inexplicably allowed makaay 's tame shot to squirm under his body in the game 's 34th minute , but was helpless earlier in the 28th minute when claudio pizarro volleyed home .
even a locker room talk could n't bring dortmund back to life and makaay ended the scoring by putting a shot between dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller 's legs in the 54th minute , giving bayern munich its third home win in a row .
bankruptcy not an excuse for borussia dortmund , the crushing loss moved what until now was only a financial crisis to the playing field .
on thursday the team announced they were on the edge of bankruptcy .
the disastrous defeat thus capped what has already been a distressing week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the brink of bankruptcy , a thrashing in munich added insult to borussia dortmund 's financial injury " we were not confident , " said dortmund coach van marwijk .
" we were not in the game for a moment after falling behind early .
our financial problems are not an alibi . "
the win means bayern will stay in first place atop the bundesliga table , by how many points will remain unclear until 2nd-placed schalke 04 play against borussia mönchengladbach sunday afternoon .
munich started the game without german national team captain michael ballack and also let torsten frings and owen hargreaves have a break before this week 's champions league match against arsenal london .
salihamidzic and martin demichelis took the starters ' places in midfield and , along with mehmet scholl , proved they are capable of playing reliably for the german league 's top team . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de life after soccer ?

not in dortmund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happier times : dortmund fans celebrate their 2002 championship fans of the dortmund soccer club bvb borrusia are distraught .
the storied team with one of the most loyal followings in the world is on the edge of a financial collapse that threatens its existence . a full 80,000 fans can fit into westfalen stadium , the cavernous temple to the dortmund soccer club bvb borussia 09 - and do so every home game .
the fan bloc , which during games is a sea of black and yellow banners and flags , is made up of 27,000 people each game - all of them standing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's westfalen stadium is one of the sites of the 2006 world cup so when dortmund fans are mad , it 's best to listen .
and they have never been more upset .
the problem " rage , fear and bewilderment , " read a newspaper headline in dortmund this week .
in four years , the bvb would have celebrated its 100th anniversary .
now , there is serious doubt the club can even make it to the next season .
borussia has run up a debt of € 142.1 million -lrb- $ 185.74 million -rrb- over the past few seasons , an equivalent of 79 percent of its capital .
just a few seasons ago , the club made headlines by winning the bundelisga title , competing regularly in european tournaments , and being the first german club to go on the stock exchange .
today , borrusia and its team of highly-paid stars is struggling up the bundesliga table .
the stock has plunged more than 25 percent .
the targets " the anger is massive and the fear is just as big , " one fan told dw-radio .
" i do n't know where it will go from here .
i also do n't think these people will be able to get the club out of danger . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebaum -lrb- l . -rrb- left one week ago - but meier will stay on , despite what fans think " these people " are gerd niebaum and michael meier .
niebaum stepped down one week ago as president of the club .
meier remains in office and has had to face down a battery of cameras and microphones , not to mention irate fans in recent weeks as news of dortmund 's miserable economic situation spread .
on feb .
12 , 1,000 fans marched in dortmund behind a massive banner that read " not for sale : put an end to the lies and intrigue ! "
they accused meier of mismanagement and spending too much money on players who did n't deliver as promised .
they demanded meier correct the club 's miserable accounting and then resign .
" bvb brought a smile to my face " the anger , and the sheer numbers taking to the streets illustrate the importance of the soccer club to the ruhr valley city .
once a center for steel and coal mining , dortmund 's fortunes have sunk as companies have either gone bankrupt or pulled up stakes to move eastwards , where labor is cheaper .
for many of the workers , the soccer team was their weekend distraction .
for the growing list of unemployed and their families , the team is nowadays their only distraction .
bildunterschrift : fans protest on feb .
12 " the bvb is the only place where i can get away from all the worries and problems of daily life , " wrote one fan on a bvb fan chat room www.schwatzgelb.de.
other fans responded with similar stories and feelings and the site was soon covered with messages .
only thing left is hope " i had a difficult time as a youth and i was able to get through it with the bvb , " wrote another fan .
" the bvb brought a smile to my face when i actually should have been crying . "
along with the sadness , there were many messages calling for support and confidence in their beloved soccer club .
dortmund 's mayor said he was sure a proposed restructuring plan that includes deferring rental payments for its € 17 million a year stadium and a drastically-reduced player budget would work .
the team is the " heart and soul of the city , " mayor gerhard langemeyer told the news agency dpa .
" it 's not possible to imagine this city without the bvb .

not in dortmund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happier times : dortmund fans celebrate their 2002 championship fans of the dortmund soccer club bvb borrusia are distraught .
the storied team with one of the most loyal followings in the world is on the edge of a financial collapse that threatens its existence . a full 80,000 fans can fit into westfalen stadium , the cavernous temple to the dortmund soccer club bvb borussia 09 - and do so every home game .
the fan bloc , which during games is a sea of black and yellow banners and flags , is made up of 27,000 people each game - all of them standing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's westfalen stadium is one of the sites of the 2006 world cup so when dortmund fans are mad , it 's best to listen .
and they have never been more upset .
the problem " rage , fear and bewilderment , " read a newspaper headline in dortmund this week .
in four years , the bvb would have celebrated its 100th anniversary .
now , there is serious doubt the club can even make it to the next season .
borussia has run up a debt of € 142.1 million -lrb- $ 185.74 million -rrb- over the past few seasons , an equivalent of 79 percent of its capital .
just a few seasons ago , the club made headlines by winning the bundelisga title , competing regularly in european tournaments , and being the first german club to go on the stock exchange .
today , borrusia and its team of highly-paid stars is struggling up the bundesliga table .
the stock has plunged more than 25 percent .
the targets " the anger is massive and the fear is just as big , " one fan told dw-radio .
" i do n't know where it will go from here .
i also do n't think these people will be able to get the club out of danger . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebaum -lrb- l . -rrb- left one week ago - but meier will stay on , despite what fans think " these people " are gerd niebaum and michael meier .

meier remains in office and has had to face down a battery of cameras and microphones , not to mention irate fans in recent weeks as news of dortmund 's miserable economic situation spread .
on feb .
12 , 1,000 fans marched in dortmund behind a massive banner that read " not for sale : put an end to the lies and intrigue ! "
they accused meier of mismanagement and spending too much money on players who did n't deliver as promised .
they demanded meier correct the club 's miserable accounting and then resign .
" bvb brought a smile to my face " the anger , and the sheer numbers taking to the streets illustrate the importance of the soccer club to the ruhr valley city .
once a center for steel and coal mining , dortmund 's fortunes have sunk as companies have either gone bankrupt or pulled up stakes to move eastwards , where labor is cheaper .
for many of the workers , the soccer team was their weekend distraction .
for the growing list of unemployed and their families , the team is nowadays their only distraction .
bildunterschrift : fans protest on feb .
12 " the bvb is the only place where i can get away from all the worries and problems of daily life , " wrote one fan on a bvb fan chat room www.schwatzgelb.de.
other fans responded with similar stories and feelings and the site was soon covered with messages .
only thing left is hope " i had a difficult time as a youth and i was able to get through it with the bvb , " wrote another fan .
" the bvb brought a smile to my face when i actually should have been crying . "
along with the sadness , there were many messages calling for support and confidence in their beloved soccer club .
dortmund 's mayor said he was sure a proposed restructuring plan that includes deferring rental payments for its € 17 million a year stadium and a drastically-reduced player budget would work .
the team is the " heart and soul of the city , " mayor gerhard langemeyer told the news agency dpa .

this year 's festival is no exception , having provided breakthrough moments for several new homegrown stars . julia jentsch , actress the undisputed new star to emerge from the berlinale is berlin-born actress julia jentsch , 26 .
her convincing portrayal of anti-nazi resistance heroine sophie scholl in the competition film " sophie scholl - the final days " went over well with both critics and audiences alike .
jentsch 's face is now gracing the covers of german magazines , meaning her days of going unrecognized are coming to an end .
jentsch previously appeared in " the edukators , " a film about a group of young people who break into the homes of the wealthy not to steal , but to send them a message about social injustice .
jentsch has been a member of the munich kammerspiel theatre ensemble since 2001 .
at a berlinale press conference , jentsch said she would be returning to the stage and had no plans to make another film .
but that 's likely to change soon - especially if jentsch scoops the silver bear for best actress , as many are already predicting . julia hummer , actress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia hummer another young actress named julia has created a stir at the berlinale - julia hummer , 24 , who stars in christian petzold 's film " ghosts " -lrb- gespenster -rrb- .
festival director dieter kosslick said hummer 's portrayal of a young woman the film 's protagonist believes is her lost daughter could make her " a very big star in europe or worldwide . "
but that will depend very much on which of her ambitions hummer decides to pursue .
she is also a dedicated musician with an album and negotiations with record labels in the works .
hummer 's previous film credits include the coming-of-age story " crazy , " and another film by petzold , " the state i am in " -lrb- die innere sicherheit -rrb- . hannes stöhr , director bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannes stöhr " one day in europe " has been described as " delightful " and " refreshing , " and has earned its director , hannes stöhr , 35 , accolades that are just as positive .
not bad , considering " europe " is only his second feature-length film , following on 2001 's " berlin is in germany . "
the film is made up of four episodes told in four european cities and seven different languages .
the thing that holds them together is a fictional european champions league soccer match played in moscow between spanish and turkish teams .
" soccer , whether you like the game or not , is something that connects all the cultures of europe , " said stöhr , who also wrote the film 's screenplay .
the story was a natural for stöhr , who lives in berlin , but has also spent parts of his life in moscow and istanbul , and who speaks english , german , spanish and french . max riemelt , actor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max riemelt in " napola " from constantin film it does n't get any more official than actually being named a shooting star 2005 , but that 's exactly what happened to young german actor max riemelt , 21 .

riemelt first achieved teen-idol fame in germany with the film " mädchen , mädchen ! "

this year 's festival is no exception , having provided breakthrough moments for several new homegrown stars . julia jentsch , actress the undisputed new star to emerge from the berlinale is berlin-born actress julia jentsch , 26 .
her convincing portrayal of anti-nazi resistance heroine sophie scholl in the competition film " sophie scholl - the final days " went over well with both critics and audiences alike .
jentsch 's face is now gracing the covers of german magazines , meaning her days of going unrecognized are coming to an end .
jentsch previously appeared in " the edukators , " a film about a group of young people who break into the homes of the wealthy not to steal , but to send them a message about social injustice .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 19.02.2005 bayern munich rip dortmund apart großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay had three goals to whoop about munich wanted to show their bundesliga critics that last week 's 3-1 loss to arminia bielefeld was a one-time slip , and they did it in convincing style by thrashing financially ailing borussia dortmund 5-0 . roy makaay was bayern 's man of the day in munich 's olympic stadium .
dortmund 's defense left the dutch striker entirely too much space in the beginning of the game and paid dearly for it .
makaay kept the 53,000 home team fans riveted by scoring a pair of goals himself and assisting in tow more during the game 's first 45 minutes .
in the second half he put in one more to seal a personal hat trick and his team 's highest win of the season .
bayern had something to prove bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hasan salihamidzic , center , celebrates with teammates roy makkay , left , and mehmet scholl , after scoring " after the loss in bielefeld we had some matter to take care of and the team knew it , " said bayern munich trainer felix magath .
" we were lucky that we got a goal early and could pile on another one a little bit later . "
it was hasan salihamidzic who opened scoring in the fifth minute , and makaay put in his first of three exceptional goals just one minute later .
the two quick goals gave dortmund a shock they never recovered from .
bert van marwijk watched his bvb squad 's defense fall apart time after time while his strikers never worked their way into a truly dangerous position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich flew away with the win at home against dortmund dortmund goalkeeper roman weidenfeller inexplicably allowed makaay 's tame shot to squirm under his body in the game 's 34th minute , but was helpless earlier in the 28th minute when claudio pizarro volleyed home .
even a locker room talk could n't bring dortmund back to life and makaay ended the scoring by putting a shot between dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller 's legs in the 54th minute , giving bayern munich its third home win in a row .
bankruptcy not an excuse for borussia dortmund , the crushing loss moved what until now was only a financial crisis to the playing field .
on thursday the team announced they were on the edge of bankruptcy .
the disastrous defeat thus capped what has already been a distressing week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the brink of bankruptcy , a thrashing in munich added insult to borussia dortmund 's financial injury " we were not confident , " said dortmund coach van marwijk .
" we were not in the game for a moment after falling behind early .
our financial problems are not an alibi . "
the win means bayern will stay in first place atop the bundesliga table , by how many points will remain unclear until 2nd-placed schalke 04 play against borussia mönchengladbach sunday afternoon .
munich started the game without german national team captain michael ballack and also let torsten frings and owen hargreaves have a break before this week 's champions league match against arsenal london .
salihamidzic and martin demichelis took the starters ' places in midfield and , along with mehmet scholl , proved they are capable of playing reliably for the german league 's top team . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de life after soccer ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the asian tsunami : one year after doing better than " business as usual " german tsunami early warning system takes shape german organizations take stock of tsunami relief message at un disaster meeting : be prepared germany -pipe- 19.02.2005 an endeavor that needs time and money großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an indonesian man cleans up the remains of his house the german government has generously pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 653 million -rrb- over the next three to five years for long-term rebuilding in tsunami-ravaged south asia .
but , how exactly is the money going to be distributed ? emergency aid began pouring in from all corners of the world right after the tidal wave hit on dec .
26 , 2004 and efforts to provide devastated areas with basis supplies are still underway . reconstruction however needs more time .
" it 's not possible to spread € 500 million over five years yet , " stephan bethe of the german federal ministry for economic development and cooperation -lrb- bmz -rrb- said and pointed out that the affected countries and donor nations first have to come to an agreement about what is needed and who is going to provide for it .
" reconstruction is a long process " , bethe said , adding that the right choices have to be made in rebuilding infrastructure like schools , hospitals , streets or energy and water supplies . in addition , the people have to be helped back to a position where they can earn a living on their own again .
where does the extra money go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bmz budget for 2005 amounts to € 3.8 billion , the same as last year . the € 500 million in tsunami aid money pledged by the german government comes on top of the development funds . berlin is also chanelling € 50 million from the tsunami aid funds into a un emergency relief fund .
the remaining € 450 million are meant to aid reconstruction in indonesia and sri lanka , the two worst-hit states in the tsunami . according to the bmz , it 's still difficult to foresee whether the duration of reconstruction there will take five years or less . more specifically , the extra long term aid money is going to be administered by the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- , which receives most of its assignments from the bmz , and the state-owned bank for reconstruction -lrb- kfw -rrb- .
both institutions operate development projects in particular countries and according to bethe they will handle projects in the tsunami-struck region on behalf of the bmz .
local know-how important employees of both the gtz and kfw however depend on local and regional expertise and organization on the ground .
" they can be local councils , non-governmental organizations or companies , " said hans stehling of the gtz .
the cooperation in turn provides employment opportunities for devastated communities .
for instance , the building of new schools or repairing fishing boats is often commissioned out to local carpentry companies .
in sri lanka , emergency relief has already translated into long-term reconstruction .
the gtz was present in the country with various projects long before the indian ocean tragedy struck , thus enabling it to react swiftly to the disaster .
on sunday , german development minster heidemarie wieczorek-zeul is expected in the region .
according to bmz 's bethe , the sri lankan government has already drawn up the first reconstruction plans which are now being approved by the donor nations .
it definitely sounds like more than just empty promises from germany 's government .
" we 've already proposed various projects for reconstruction .
now , we 're waiting for contracts from the bmz , " said stehling .
he 's counting on a quick decision from the ministry .
however , nobody 's talking of concrete dates or funds as yet .
germany 's ministry for economic development and cooperation skirts all questions regarding who is going to do what by saying that it 's dependant on the governments of the affected countries to react to offers of aid .
in indonesia , progress takes a little longer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's government is planing to present its masterplan for reconstruction on march 26 , three months after the tsunami hit the country .
until then , emergency aid in affected regions is going to continue along with german support .
due to the small presence of foreign aid organizations up to now , they can not fall back on existing structures and contacts and thus progress takes longer here .
but transition from measures such as organizing food , medicine or housing to reconstruction is fluid .
" especially with a catastrophe of such huge dimensions , reconstruction is a continuing process , " stehling said . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- bm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new alliance appeals for long-term aid the german government has promised € 500 million in aid for countries affected by the tsunami - a good sign that more long-term development aid is possible , say five german organisations who 've launched a joint appeal .

what do you think will come of this visit ?
how will the europeans welcome the american president ? javier solana : i think the visit has every prospect of being a success .
i think the current climate and atmosphere are much better than they were a couple of years , or even a couple of months ago .
there was some dissonance in 2003 and 2004 , especially over iraq .
but we have overcome our differences now .
that 's why i think the decision by president bush and his new secretary of state to choose europe as the place to make their first overseas visits since the new presidential term started is a very positive gesture . there 's a debate currently over what role nato should play in future relations between the europeans and the us .
a whole series of suggestions have been put forward on ways to improve the way we work together .
what is your view on this debate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i believe that everything that contributes toward making transatlantic relations more effective is good . every debate in this direction is positive .
i think that everyone accepts that transatlantic relations are no longer dealt with exclusively within the framework of nato , but to a large degree also within eu institutions .
this was very clearly highlighted by the many hours that secretary condoleezza rice spent at the european union .
and now president bush is coming to exchange views with leading european figures on the problems which exist between the eu and nato .
i believe this is positive and expresses the importance of the role of the european union in transatlantic relations , and the common desire for europeans and americans to work together . despite all the conflicts going on in the world , there have been significant advances made , for example in the middle east .
how realistic is the hope for peace between israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana , left , and peter hansen , commissioner general of the united nations relief and works agency -lrb- unrwa -rrb- , inspect damage of a destroyed kindergarden during their tour in the norther gaza strip town of beit lahiya , wednesday jan .
12 , 2005 .
i have been involved in the middle east peace process for many years , but now for the first time i am very optimistic and i can see great opportunities .
there is a path that both israelis and palestinians must tread together , accompanied by their friends .
both we europeans and the americans are their friends , and i believe we can join them on this path .
but it wo n't be easy .
there will be high and low points , and good times and bad .
the most important thing is that we remain committed and show good will . i think that president abbas is doing a good job , from the way the palestinian election was run to what he 's doing now .
and prime minister sharon has also made good decisions , like relaxing the restrictions on palestinians so that people can enjoy a better standard of life , and the decision to remove settlements from the gaza strip .
but i am well aware of the pitfalls .
we have to keep our eyes open and be clear about our obligations .
as i have said before , we have to be committed to providing help because there will be innumerable difficulties . what can the european union do to help abbas end terrorism and to support the move towards peace ? the best that we can do to help him is to strengthen and train his police force .
and that 's what we 're doing now .
there 's a team already working with the palestinian security forces to help them function in the most efficient and effective way possible .
that 's important , but the political will to end terrorist activities is more important .
president abbas has made very clear statements on this and has acted accordingly . that must be recognized by the international community as well as by israel . the european union is also in negotiations to persuade iran not to build nuclear weapons .
can we expect success there as well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in bushehr , iran , 750 miles -lrb- 1,200 kilometers -rrb- southwest of tehran .
we made considerable progress in the last few months .
iran has signed an additional protocol which allows inspectors from the international atomic energy authority to visit sites across the country without giving prior notification .
that means the iaea can carry out a control function in iran . the negotiations are being conducted on three levels at the same time : we 're dealing with the nuclear arms issue , security aspects for iran , and trade and economic relations between iran and the eu .
we hope that we will continue to make progress . does this mean that these subjects will be decided bilaterally between the iranian government and the europeans , or will the americans have a say in the negotiations ? i think that the united states is not interested in joining the negotiations at this point in time .
they can support them from the sidelines .
as you know , the us has no diplomatic relations with iran , and for this reason it is more difficult for them .
in any case , if all goes well , the results will be seen in vienna at the international atomic energy agency .
any agreement reached with iran will have to be ratified by the iaea board of governors , which is elected by nations in the iaea , who are all members of the united nations , can we now say that relations between the us and europe are close and that there 's been no break in the dialogue with the us ?
is there agreement on how to implement common political strategies ? yes , i think so .
that follows on from what i said about the talks that we have held in the past few months .
and i hope this will be underlined by president bush and the leading political figures of the european union . is there hope of an agreement , for example on the subject of china and the decision by the european union to lift the weapons embargo on beijing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao , left , smiles as former eu commission president romano prodi gestures during a media conference at the eu commission building in brussels , thursday , may 6 , 2004 .
all issues that we are in the process of negotiating are both difficult and delicate .
even so , i 'm convinced that we can reach agreement .
as far as china is concerned , i would like to emphasize that it is not about selling more weapons to china ; rather it concerns the lifting of sanctions that the eu imposed on china during the tiananmen square crisis .
since then , many years have gone by and much has happened .
a new generation is in charge in china now and we want to forge new relations which are not overshadowed by sanctions .
for this reason , the lifting of the weapons embargo will be a political rather than a military gesture . the interview was conducted by gonzalo cáceres send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush , europe set to mend fences ahead of us president george w. bush 's highly-anticipated visit to europe , both sides are all smiles .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the asian tsunami : one year after doing better than " business as usual " german tsunami early warning system takes shape german organizations take stock of tsunami relief message at un disaster meeting : be prepared germany -pipe- 19.02.2005 an endeavor that needs time and money großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an indonesian man cleans up the remains of his house the german government has generously pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 653 million -rrb- over the next three to five years for long-term rebuilding in tsunami-ravaged south asia .
but , how exactly is the money going to be distributed ? emergency aid began pouring in from all corners of the world right after the tidal wave hit on dec .
26 , 2004 and efforts to provide devastated areas with basis supplies are still underway . reconstruction however needs more time .
" it 's not possible to spread € 500 million over five years yet , " stephan bethe of the german federal ministry for economic development and cooperation -lrb- bmz -rrb- said and pointed out that the affected countries and donor nations first have to come to an agreement about what is needed and who is going to provide for it .
" reconstruction is a long process " , bethe said , adding that the right choices have to be made in rebuilding infrastructure like schools , hospitals , streets or energy and water supplies . in addition , the people have to be helped back to a position where they can earn a living on their own again .
where does the extra money go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bmz budget for 2005 amounts to € 3.8 billion , the same as last year . the € 500 million in tsunami aid money pledged by the german government comes on top of the development funds . berlin is also chanelling € 50 million from the tsunami aid funds into a un emergency relief fund .
the remaining € 450 million are meant to aid reconstruction in indonesia and sri lanka , the two worst-hit states in the tsunami . according to the bmz , it 's still difficult to foresee whether the duration of reconstruction there will take five years or less . more specifically , the extra long term aid money is going to be administered by the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- , which receives most of its assignments from the bmz , and the state-owned bank for reconstruction -lrb- kfw -rrb- .
both institutions operate development projects in particular countries and according to bethe they will handle projects in the tsunami-struck region on behalf of the bmz .
local know-how important employees of both the gtz and kfw however depend on local and regional expertise and organization on the ground .
" they can be local councils , non-governmental organizations or companies , " said hans stehling of the gtz .
the cooperation in turn provides employment opportunities for devastated communities .
for instance , the building of new schools or repairing fishing boats is often commissioned out to local carpentry companies .
in sri lanka , emergency relief has already translated into long-term reconstruction .
the gtz was present in the country with various projects long before the indian ocean tragedy struck , thus enabling it to react swiftly to the disaster .
on sunday , german development minster heidemarie wieczorek-zeul is expected in the region .
according to bmz 's bethe , the sri lankan government has already drawn up the first reconstruction plans which are now being approved by the donor nations .
it definitely sounds like more than just empty promises from germany 's government .
" we 've already proposed various projects for reconstruction .
now , we 're waiting for contracts from the bmz , " said stehling .
he 's counting on a quick decision from the ministry .
however , nobody 's talking of concrete dates or funds as yet .
germany 's ministry for economic development and cooperation skirts all questions regarding who is going to do what by saying that it 's dependant on the governments of the affected countries to react to offers of aid .
in indonesia , progress takes a little longer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's government is planing to present its masterplan for reconstruction on march 26 , three months after the tsunami hit the country .
until then , emergency aid in affected regions is going to continue along with german support .
due to the small presence of foreign aid organizations up to now , they can not fall back on existing structures and contacts and thus progress takes longer here .
but transition from measures such as organizing food , medicine or housing to reconstruction is fluid .
" especially with a catastrophe of such huge dimensions , reconstruction is a continuing process , " stehling said . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- bm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new alliance appeals for long-term aid the german government has promised € 500 million in aid for countries affected by the tsunami - a good sign that more long-term development aid is possible , say five german organisations who 've launched a joint appeal .

what do you think will come of this visit ?
how will the europeans welcome the american president ? javier solana : i think the visit has every prospect of being a success .
i think the current climate and atmosphere are much better than they were a couple of years , or even a couple of months ago .
there was some dissonance in 2003 and 2004 , especially over iraq .
but we have overcome our differences now .
that 's why i think the decision by president bush and his new secretary of state to choose europe as the place to make their first overseas visits since the new presidential term started is a very positive gesture . there 's a debate currently over what role nato should play in future relations between the europeans and the us .
a whole series of suggestions have been put forward on ways to improve the way we work together .
what is your view on this debate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i believe that everything that contributes toward making transatlantic relations more effective is good . every debate in this direction is positive .
i think that everyone accepts that transatlantic relations are no longer dealt with exclusively within the framework of nato , but to a large degree also within eu institutions .
this was very clearly highlighted by the many hours that secretary condoleezza rice spent at the european union .
and now president bush is coming to exchange views with leading european figures on the problems which exist between the eu and nato .
i believe this is positive and expresses the importance of the role of the european union in transatlantic relations , and the common desire for europeans and americans to work together . despite all the conflicts going on in the world , there have been significant advances made , for example in the middle east .
how realistic is the hope for peace between israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana , left , and peter hansen , commissioner general of the united nations relief and works agency -lrb- unrwa -rrb- , inspect damage of a destroyed kindergarden during their tour in the norther gaza strip town of beit lahiya , wednesday jan .
12 , 2005 .
i have been involved in the middle east peace process for many years , but now for the first time i am very optimistic and i can see great opportunities .
there is a path that both israelis and palestinians must tread together , accompanied by their friends .
both we europeans and the americans are their friends , and i believe we can join them on this path .
but it wo n't be easy .
there will be high and low points , and good times and bad .
the most important thing is that we remain committed and show good will . i think that president abbas is doing a good job , from the way the palestinian election was run to what he 's doing now .
and prime minister sharon has also made good decisions , like relaxing the restrictions on palestinians so that people can enjoy a better standard of life , and the decision to remove settlements from the gaza strip .
but i am well aware of the pitfalls .
we have to keep our eyes open and be clear about our obligations .
as i have said before , we have to be committed to providing help because there will be innumerable difficulties . what can the european union do to help abbas end terrorism and to support the move towards peace ? the best that we can do to help him is to strengthen and train his police force .
and that 's what we 're doing now .
there 's a team already working with the palestinian security forces to help them function in the most efficient and effective way possible .
that 's important , but the political will to end terrorist activities is more important .
president abbas has made very clear statements on this and has acted accordingly . that must be recognized by the international community as well as by israel . the european union is also in negotiations to persuade iran not to build nuclear weapons .
can we expect success there as well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in bushehr , iran , 750 miles -lrb- 1,200 kilometers -rrb- southwest of tehran .
we made considerable progress in the last few months .
iran has signed an additional protocol which allows inspectors from the international atomic energy authority to visit sites across the country without giving prior notification .
that means the iaea can carry out a control function in iran . the negotiations are being conducted on three levels at the same time : we 're dealing with the nuclear arms issue , security aspects for iran , and trade and economic relations between iran and the eu .
we hope that we will continue to make progress . does this mean that these subjects will be decided bilaterally between the iranian government and the europeans , or will the americans have a say in the negotiations ? i think that the united states is not interested in joining the negotiations at this point in time .
they can support them from the sidelines .
as you know , the us has no diplomatic relations with iran , and for this reason it is more difficult for them .
in any case , if all goes well , the results will be seen in vienna at the international atomic energy agency .
any agreement reached with iran will have to be ratified by the iaea board of governors , which is elected by nations in the iaea , who are all members of the united nations , can we now say that relations between the us and europe are close and that there 's been no break in the dialogue with the us ?
is there agreement on how to implement common political strategies ? yes , i think so .
that follows on from what i said about the talks that we have held in the past few months .
and i hope this will be underlined by president bush and the leading political figures of the european union . is there hope of an agreement , for example on the subject of china and the decision by the european union to lift the weapons embargo on beijing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao , left , smiles as former eu commission president romano prodi gestures during a media conference at the eu commission building in brussels , thursday , may 6 , 2004 .
all issues that we are in the process of negotiating are both difficult and delicate .
even so , i 'm convinced that we can reach agreement .
as far as china is concerned , i would like to emphasize that it is not about selling more weapons to china ; rather it concerns the lifting of sanctions that the eu imposed on china during the tiananmen square crisis .
since then , many years have gone by and much has happened .
a new generation is in charge in china now and we want to forge new relations which are not overshadowed by sanctions .
for this reason , the lifting of the weapons embargo will be a political rather than a military gesture . the interview was conducted by gonzalo cáceres send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush , europe set to mend fences ahead of us president george w. bush 's highly-anticipated visit to europe , both sides are all smiles .

not in dortmund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happier times : dortmund fans celebrate their 2002 championship fans of the dortmund soccer club bvb borrusia are distraught .

what do you think will come of this visit ?
how will the europeans welcome the american president ? javier solana : i think the visit has every prospect of being a success .
i think the current climate and atmosphere are much better than they were a couple of years , or even a couple of months ago .
there was some dissonance in 2003 and 2004 , especially over iraq .
but we have overcome our differences now .
that 's why i think the decision by president bush and his new secretary of state to choose europe as the place to make their first overseas visits since the new presidential term started is a very positive gesture . there 's a debate currently over what role nato should play in future relations between the europeans and the us .
a whole series of suggestions have been put forward on ways to improve the way we work together .
what is your view on this debate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i believe that everything that contributes toward making transatlantic relations more effective is good . every debate in this direction is positive .
i think that everyone accepts that transatlantic relations are no longer dealt with exclusively within the framework of nato , but to a large degree also within eu institutions .
this was very clearly highlighted by the many hours that secretary condoleezza rice spent at the european union .
and now president bush is coming to exchange views with leading european figures on the problems which exist between the eu and nato .
i believe this is positive and expresses the importance of the role of the european union in transatlantic relations , and the common desire for europeans and americans to work together . despite all the conflicts going on in the world , there have been significant advances made , for example in the middle east .
how realistic is the hope for peace between israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana , left , and peter hansen , commissioner general of the united nations relief and works agency -lrb- unrwa -rrb- , inspect damage of a destroyed kindergarden during their tour in the norther gaza strip town of beit lahiya , wednesday jan .
12 , 2005 .
i have been involved in the middle east peace process for many years , but now for the first time i am very optimistic and i can see great opportunities .
there is a path that both israelis and palestinians must tread together , accompanied by their friends .
both we europeans and the americans are their friends , and i believe we can join them on this path .
but it wo n't be easy .
there will be high and low points , and good times and bad .
the most important thing is that we remain committed and show good will . i think that president abbas is doing a good job , from the way the palestinian election was run to what he 's doing now .
and prime minister sharon has also made good decisions , like relaxing the restrictions on palestinians so that people can enjoy a better standard of life , and the decision to remove settlements from the gaza strip .
but i am well aware of the pitfalls .
we have to keep our eyes open and be clear about our obligations .
as i have said before , we have to be committed to providing help because there will be innumerable difficulties . what can the european union do to help abbas end terrorism and to support the move towards peace ? the best that we can do to help him is to strengthen and train his police force .
and that 's what we 're doing now .
there 's a team already working with the palestinian security forces to help them function in the most efficient and effective way possible .
that 's important , but the political will to end terrorist activities is more important .
president abbas has made very clear statements on this and has acted accordingly . that must be recognized by the international community as well as by israel . the european union is also in negotiations to persuade iran not to build nuclear weapons .
can we expect success there as well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in bushehr , iran , 750 miles -lrb- 1,200 kilometers -rrb- southwest of tehran .
we made considerable progress in the last few months .
iran has signed an additional protocol which allows inspectors from the international atomic energy authority to visit sites across the country without giving prior notification .
that means the iaea can carry out a control function in iran . the negotiations are being conducted on three levels at the same time : we 're dealing with the nuclear arms issue , security aspects for iran , and trade and economic relations between iran and the eu .
we hope that we will continue to make progress . does this mean that these subjects will be decided bilaterally between the iranian government and the europeans , or will the americans have a say in the negotiations ? i think that the united states is not interested in joining the negotiations at this point in time .
they can support them from the sidelines .
as you know , the us has no diplomatic relations with iran , and for this reason it is more difficult for them .
in any case , if all goes well , the results will be seen in vienna at the international atomic energy agency .
any agreement reached with iran will have to be ratified by the iaea board of governors , which is elected by nations in the iaea , who are all members of the united nations , can we now say that relations between the us and europe are close and that there 's been no break in the dialogue with the us ?
is there agreement on how to implement common political strategies ? yes , i think so .
that follows on from what i said about the talks that we have held in the past few months .
and i hope this will be underlined by president bush and the leading political figures of the european union . is there hope of an agreement , for example on the subject of china and the decision by the european union to lift the weapons embargo on beijing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao , left , smiles as former eu commission president romano prodi gestures during a media conference at the eu commission building in brussels , thursday , may 6 , 2004 .
all issues that we are in the process of negotiating are both difficult and delicate .
even so , i 'm convinced that we can reach agreement .
as far as china is concerned , i would like to emphasize that it is not about selling more weapons to china ; rather it concerns the lifting of sanctions that the eu imposed on china during the tiananmen square crisis .
since then , many years have gone by and much has happened .
a new generation is in charge in china now and we want to forge new relations which are not overshadowed by sanctions .
for this reason , the lifting of the weapons embargo will be a political rather than a military gesture . the interview was conducted by gonzalo cáceres send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush , europe set to mend fences ahead of us president george w. bush 's highly-anticipated visit to europe , both sides are all smiles .

it ’ s in your body , and simply put , it ’ s the " messenger " that your dna uses to tell proteins how to build your cells .
if dna is the architect , and proteins are the construction team , then rna is like the contractor that mediates between them .
well , just as a bad contractor can ruin a construction project , faulty rna can wreak havoc on your body .
it can cause cancer , degenerative illnesses , and infections .
that ’ s where rna interference technology comes in .
it gets in the way of faulty rna .
you can see it in the picture below : the red stuff is a protein called lamin .
when we add an rna inhibitor and a green dye , like in the bottom left , it stops the lamin from building and the lamin turns green .
bildunterschrift : but how does this fabulous technology work ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 19.02.2005 bayern munich rip dortmund apart großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay had three goals to whoop about munich wanted to show their bundesliga critics that last week 's 3-1 loss to arminia bielefeld was a one-time slip , and they did it in convincing style by thrashing financially ailing borussia dortmund 5-0 . roy makaay was bayern 's man of the day in munich 's olympic stadium .
dortmund 's defense left the dutch striker entirely too much space in the beginning of the game and paid dearly for it .
makaay kept the 53,000 home team fans riveted by scoring a pair of goals himself and assisting in tow more during the game 's first 45 minutes .
in the second half he put in one more to seal a personal hat trick and his team 's highest win of the season .
bayern had something to prove bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hasan salihamidzic , center , celebrates with teammates roy makkay , left , and mehmet scholl , after scoring " after the loss in bielefeld we had some matter to take care of and the team knew it , " said bayern munich trainer felix magath .
" we were lucky that we got a goal early and could pile on another one a little bit later . "
it was hasan salihamidzic who opened scoring in the fifth minute , and makaay put in his first of three exceptional goals just one minute later .
the two quick goals gave dortmund a shock they never recovered from .
bert van marwijk watched his bvb squad 's defense fall apart time after time while his strikers never worked their way into a truly dangerous position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich flew away with the win at home against dortmund dortmund goalkeeper roman weidenfeller inexplicably allowed makaay 's tame shot to squirm under his body in the game 's 34th minute , but was helpless earlier in the 28th minute when claudio pizarro volleyed home .
even a locker room talk could n't bring dortmund back to life and makaay ended the scoring by putting a shot between dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller 's legs in the 54th minute , giving bayern munich its third home win in a row .
bankruptcy not an excuse for borussia dortmund , the crushing loss moved what until now was only a financial crisis to the playing field .
on thursday the team announced they were on the edge of bankruptcy .
the disastrous defeat thus capped what has already been a distressing week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the brink of bankruptcy , a thrashing in munich added insult to borussia dortmund 's financial injury " we were not confident , " said dortmund coach van marwijk .
" we were not in the game for a moment after falling behind early .
our financial problems are not an alibi . "
the win means bayern will stay in first place atop the bundesliga table , by how many points will remain unclear until 2nd-placed schalke 04 play against borussia mönchengladbach sunday afternoon .
munich started the game without german national team captain michael ballack and also let torsten frings and owen hargreaves have a break before this week 's champions league match against arsenal london .
salihamidzic and martin demichelis took the starters ' places in midfield and , along with mehmet scholl , proved they are capable of playing reliably for the german league 's top team . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de life after soccer ?

what do you think will come of this visit ?
how will the europeans welcome the american president ? javier solana : i think the visit has every prospect of being a success .
i think the current climate and atmosphere are much better than they were a couple of years , or even a couple of months ago .
there was some dissonance in 2003 and 2004 , especially over iraq .
but we have overcome our differences now .
that 's why i think the decision by president bush and his new secretary of state to choose europe as the place to make their first overseas visits since the new presidential term started is a very positive gesture . there 's a debate currently over what role nato should play in future relations between the europeans and the us .
a whole series of suggestions have been put forward on ways to improve the way we work together .
what is your view on this debate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i believe that everything that contributes toward making transatlantic relations more effective is good . every debate in this direction is positive .
i think that everyone accepts that transatlantic relations are no longer dealt with exclusively within the framework of nato , but to a large degree also within eu institutions .
this was very clearly highlighted by the many hours that secretary condoleezza rice spent at the european union .
and now president bush is coming to exchange views with leading european figures on the problems which exist between the eu and nato .
i believe this is positive and expresses the importance of the role of the european union in transatlantic relations , and the common desire for europeans and americans to work together . despite all the conflicts going on in the world , there have been significant advances made , for example in the middle east .
how realistic is the hope for peace between israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana , left , and peter hansen , commissioner general of the united nations relief and works agency -lrb- unrwa -rrb- , inspect damage of a destroyed kindergarden during their tour in the norther gaza strip town of beit lahiya , wednesday jan .
12 , 2005 .
i have been involved in the middle east peace process for many years , but now for the first time i am very optimistic and i can see great opportunities .
there is a path that both israelis and palestinians must tread together , accompanied by their friends .
both we europeans and the americans are their friends , and i believe we can join them on this path .
but it wo n't be easy .
there will be high and low points , and good times and bad .
the most important thing is that we remain committed and show good will . i think that president abbas is doing a good job , from the way the palestinian election was run to what he 's doing now .
and prime minister sharon has also made good decisions , like relaxing the restrictions on palestinians so that people can enjoy a better standard of life , and the decision to remove settlements from the gaza strip .
but i am well aware of the pitfalls .
we have to keep our eyes open and be clear about our obligations .
as i have said before , we have to be committed to providing help because there will be innumerable difficulties . what can the european union do to help abbas end terrorism and to support the move towards peace ? the best that we can do to help him is to strengthen and train his police force .
and that 's what we 're doing now .
there 's a team already working with the palestinian security forces to help them function in the most efficient and effective way possible .
that 's important , but the political will to end terrorist activities is more important .
president abbas has made very clear statements on this and has acted accordingly . that must be recognized by the international community as well as by israel . the european union is also in negotiations to persuade iran not to build nuclear weapons .
can we expect success there as well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in bushehr , iran , 750 miles -lrb- 1,200 kilometers -rrb- southwest of tehran .
we made considerable progress in the last few months .
iran has signed an additional protocol which allows inspectors from the international atomic energy authority to visit sites across the country without giving prior notification .
that means the iaea can carry out a control function in iran . the negotiations are being conducted on three levels at the same time : we 're dealing with the nuclear arms issue , security aspects for iran , and trade and economic relations between iran and the eu .
we hope that we will continue to make progress . does this mean that these subjects will be decided bilaterally between the iranian government and the europeans , or will the americans have a say in the negotiations ? i think that the united states is not interested in joining the negotiations at this point in time .
they can support them from the sidelines .
as you know , the us has no diplomatic relations with iran , and for this reason it is more difficult for them .
in any case , if all goes well , the results will be seen in vienna at the international atomic energy agency .
any agreement reached with iran will have to be ratified by the iaea board of governors , which is elected by nations in the iaea , who are all members of the united nations , can we now say that relations between the us and europe are close and that there 's been no break in the dialogue with the us ?
is there agreement on how to implement common political strategies ? yes , i think so .
that follows on from what i said about the talks that we have held in the past few months .
and i hope this will be underlined by president bush and the leading political figures of the european union . is there hope of an agreement , for example on the subject of china and the decision by the european union to lift the weapons embargo on beijing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao , left , smiles as former eu commission president romano prodi gestures during a media conference at the eu commission building in brussels , thursday , may 6 , 2004 .
all issues that we are in the process of negotiating are both difficult and delicate .
even so , i 'm convinced that we can reach agreement .
as far as china is concerned , i would like to emphasize that it is not about selling more weapons to china ; rather it concerns the lifting of sanctions that the eu imposed on china during the tiananmen square crisis .
since then , many years have gone by and much has happened .
a new generation is in charge in china now and we want to forge new relations which are not overshadowed by sanctions .
for this reason , the lifting of the weapons embargo will be a political rather than a military gesture . the interview was conducted by gonzalo cáceres send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush , europe set to mend fences ahead of us president george w. bush 's highly-anticipated visit to europe , both sides are all smiles .

the us president seems intent on making amends with europe , and the continent 's leaders are only too happy to . " america needs europe and europe needs america and by working together we can make the world a better one , " jose manuel barroso , the president of the european commission , said in a statement on friday .
bush was similarly agreeable in an interview he gave to germany 's ard television before his trip .
in his comments , he confirmed europe and germany 's importance in the international community , and their importance to america .
" europe is extremely important for america and germany is extremely important for europe , " he said .
he said washington expects germany to have a role in stabilizing iraq , although " our german friends … must feel good about it . " bush : iran " rumors " not true despite the agreeable tone , bush and the european allies will have some tough issues to work through .
on the top of the list is what to do about iran , which is suspected of harboring ambitions to develop nuclear weapons . in her visit ahead of bush , secretary of state condoleezza rice said the united states favored a hard-line against iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technical staff are seen in this photo taken at the isfahan uranium conversion facility in central iran which is nearing completion .
the eu and america are trying to get iran to stop attempting to enrich uranium .
europe , particularly germany , france and great britain have been pushing for a diplomatic solution and some eu politicians have been alarmed by the sabre-rattling out of washington .
but bush rejected fears the u.s. was planning a military action . " i hear these rumors about military attacks and they are simply not true , " bush said in the interview . nato 's role bush will arrive in brussels on sunday , have dinner on monday with french president jacques chirac and visit the headquarters of the european commission tuesday evening after meeting with eu and nato heads of state .
barroso plans to host a dinner with bush , eu foreign policy chief javier solana and luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country is currently holding the european union 's rotating presidency . on wednesday , he makes a visit to mainz , germany to meet up with chancellor gerhard schröder .
the two , who have , by all accounts , made up after a deep rift opened following schröder 's anti-war stance , will discuss the chancellor 's controversial comments on rehauling nato .
schröder suggested earlier this week that nato should no longer be the " primary venue " for the transatlantic dialogue .

not in dortmund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happier times : dortmund fans celebrate their 2002 championship fans of the dortmund soccer club bvb borrusia are distraught .
the storied team with one of the most loyal followings in the world is on the edge of a financial collapse that threatens its existence . a full 80,000 fans can fit into westfalen stadium , the cavernous temple to the dortmund soccer club bvb borussia 09 - and do so every home game .
the fan bloc , which during games is a sea of black and yellow banners and flags , is made up of 27,000 people each game - all of them standing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's westfalen stadium is one of the sites of the 2006 world cup so when dortmund fans are mad , it 's best to listen .
and they have never been more upset .
the problem " rage , fear and bewilderment , " read a newspaper headline in dortmund this week .
in four years , the bvb would have celebrated its 100th anniversary .
now , there is serious doubt the club can even make it to the next season .
borussia has run up a debt of € 142.1 million -lrb- $ 185.74 million -rrb- over the past few seasons , an equivalent of 79 percent of its capital .
just a few seasons ago , the club made headlines by winning the bundelisga title , competing regularly in european tournaments , and being the first german club to go on the stock exchange .
today , borrusia and its team of highly-paid stars is struggling up the bundesliga table .
the stock has plunged more than 25 percent .
the targets " the anger is massive and the fear is just as big , " one fan told dw-radio .
" i do n't know where it will go from here .
i also do n't think these people will be able to get the club out of danger . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebaum -lrb- l . -rrb- left one week ago - but meier will stay on , despite what fans think " these people " are gerd niebaum and michael meier .
niebaum stepped down one week ago as president of the club .
meier remains in office and has had to face down a battery of cameras and microphones , not to mention irate fans in recent weeks as news of dortmund 's miserable economic situation spread .
on feb .
12 , 1,000 fans marched in dortmund behind a massive banner that read " not for sale : put an end to the lies and intrigue ! "
they accused meier of mismanagement and spending too much money on players who did n't deliver as promised .
they demanded meier correct the club 's miserable accounting and then resign .
" bvb brought a smile to my face " the anger , and the sheer numbers taking to the streets illustrate the importance of the soccer club to the ruhr valley city .
once a center for steel and coal mining , dortmund 's fortunes have sunk as companies have either gone bankrupt or pulled up stakes to move eastwards , where labor is cheaper .
for many of the workers , the soccer team was their weekend distraction .
for the growing list of unemployed and their families , the team is nowadays their only distraction .
bildunterschrift : fans protest on feb .
12 " the bvb is the only place where i can get away from all the worries and problems of daily life , " wrote one fan on a bvb fan chat room www.schwatzgelb.de.
other fans responded with similar stories and feelings and the site was soon covered with messages .
only thing left is hope " i had a difficult time as a youth and i was able to get through it with the bvb , " wrote another fan .
" the bvb brought a smile to my face when i actually should have been crying . "
along with the sadness , there were many messages calling for support and confidence in their beloved soccer club .
dortmund 's mayor said he was sure a proposed restructuring plan that includes deferring rental payments for its € 17 million a year stadium and a drastically-reduced player budget would work .
the team is the " heart and soul of the city , " mayor gerhard langemeyer told the news agency dpa .

not in dortmund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happier times : dortmund fans celebrate their 2002 championship fans of the dortmund soccer club bvb borrusia are distraught .
the storied team with one of the most loyal followings in the world is on the edge of a financial collapse that threatens its existence . a full 80,000 fans can fit into westfalen stadium , the cavernous temple to the dortmund soccer club bvb borussia 09 - and do so every home game .
the fan bloc , which during games is a sea of black and yellow banners and flags , is made up of 27,000 people each game - all of them standing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's westfalen stadium is one of the sites of the 2006 world cup so when dortmund fans are mad , it 's best to listen .
and they have never been more upset .
the problem " rage , fear and bewilderment , " read a newspaper headline in dortmund this week .
in four years , the bvb would have celebrated its 100th anniversary .
now , there is serious doubt the club can even make it to the next season .
borussia has run up a debt of € 142.1 million -lrb- $ 185.74 million -rrb- over the past few seasons , an equivalent of 79 percent of its capital .
just a few seasons ago , the club made headlines by winning the bundelisga title , competing regularly in european tournaments , and being the first german club to go on the stock exchange .
today , borrusia and its team of highly-paid stars is struggling up the bundesliga table .
the stock has plunged more than 25 percent .
the targets " the anger is massive and the fear is just as big , " one fan told dw-radio .

they accused meier of mismanagement and spending too much money on players who did n't deliver as promised .
they demanded meier correct the club 's miserable accounting and then resign .
" bvb brought a smile to my face " the anger , and the sheer numbers taking to the streets illustrate the importance of the soccer club to the ruhr valley city .
once a center for steel and coal mining , dortmund 's fortunes have sunk as companies have either gone bankrupt or pulled up stakes to move eastwards , where labor is cheaper .
for many of the workers , the soccer team was their weekend distraction .
for the growing list of unemployed and their families , the team is nowadays their only distraction .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bmz budget for 2005 amounts to € 3.8 billion , the same as last year . the € 500 million in tsunami aid money pledged by the german government comes on top of the development funds . berlin is also chanelling € 50 million from the tsunami aid funds into a un emergency relief fund .
the remaining € 450 million are meant to aid reconstruction in indonesia and sri lanka , the two worst-hit states in the tsunami . according to the bmz , it 's still difficult to foresee whether the duration of reconstruction there will take five years or less . more specifically , the extra long term aid money is going to be administered by the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- , which receives most of its assignments from the bmz , and the state-owned bank for reconstruction -lrb- kfw -rrb- .
both institutions operate development projects in particular countries and according to bethe they will handle projects in the tsunami-struck region on behalf of the bmz .
local know-how important employees of both the gtz and kfw however depend on local and regional expertise and organization on the ground .
" they can be local councils , non-governmental organizations or companies , " said hans stehling of the gtz .
the cooperation in turn provides employment opportunities for devastated communities .
for instance , the building of new schools or repairing fishing boats is often commissioned out to local carpentry companies .
in sri lanka , emergency relief has already translated into long-term reconstruction .
the gtz was present in the country with various projects long before the indian ocean tragedy struck , thus enabling it to react swiftly to the disaster .
on sunday , german development minster heidemarie wieczorek-zeul is expected in the region .
according to bmz 's bethe , the sri lankan government has already drawn up the first reconstruction plans which are now being approved by the donor nations .
it definitely sounds like more than just empty promises from germany 's government .
" we 've already proposed various projects for reconstruction .
now , we 're waiting for contracts from the bmz , " said stehling .
he 's counting on a quick decision from the ministry .
however , nobody 's talking of concrete dates or funds as yet .
germany 's ministry for economic development and cooperation skirts all questions regarding who is going to do what by saying that it 's dependant on the governments of the affected countries to react to offers of aid .
in indonesia , progress takes a little longer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's government is planing to present its masterplan for reconstruction on march 26 , three months after the tsunami hit the country .
until then , emergency aid in affected regions is going to continue along with german support .
due to the small presence of foreign aid organizations up to now , they can not fall back on existing structures and contacts and thus progress takes longer here .

but , how exactly is the money going to be distributed ? emergency aid began pouring in from all corners of the world right after the tidal wave hit on dec .
26 , 2004 and efforts to provide devastated areas with basis supplies are still underway . reconstruction however needs more time .
" it 's not possible to spread € 500 million over five years yet , " stephan bethe of the german federal ministry for economic development and cooperation -lrb- bmz -rrb- said and pointed out that the affected countries and donor nations first have to come to an agreement about what is needed and who is going to provide for it .
" reconstruction is a long process " , bethe said , adding that the right choices have to be made in rebuilding infrastructure like schools , hospitals , streets or energy and water supplies . in addition , the people have to be helped back to a position where they can earn a living on their own again .
where does the extra money go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bmz budget for 2005 amounts to € 3.8 billion , the same as last year . the € 500 million in tsunami aid money pledged by the german government comes on top of the development funds . berlin is also chanelling € 50 million from the tsunami aid funds into a un emergency relief fund .
the remaining € 450 million are meant to aid reconstruction in indonesia and sri lanka , the two worst-hit states in the tsunami . according to the bmz , it 's still difficult to foresee whether the duration of reconstruction there will take five years or less . more specifically , the extra long term aid money is going to be administered by the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- , which receives most of its assignments from the bmz , and the state-owned bank for reconstruction -lrb- kfw -rrb- .
both institutions operate development projects in particular countries and according to bethe they will handle projects in the tsunami-struck region on behalf of the bmz .
local know-how important employees of both the gtz and kfw however depend on local and regional expertise and organization on the ground .
" they can be local councils , non-governmental organizations or companies , " said hans stehling of the gtz .
the cooperation in turn provides employment opportunities for devastated communities .
for instance , the building of new schools or repairing fishing boats is often commissioned out to local carpentry companies .
in sri lanka , emergency relief has already translated into long-term reconstruction .
the gtz was present in the country with various projects long before the indian ocean tragedy struck , thus enabling it to react swiftly to the disaster .
on sunday , german development minster heidemarie wieczorek-zeul is expected in the region .
according to bmz 's bethe , the sri lankan government has already drawn up the first reconstruction plans which are now being approved by the donor nations .
it definitely sounds like more than just empty promises from germany 's government .
" we 've already proposed various projects for reconstruction .
now , we 're waiting for contracts from the bmz , " said stehling .
he 's counting on a quick decision from the ministry .
however , nobody 's talking of concrete dates or funds as yet .
germany 's ministry for economic development and cooperation skirts all questions regarding who is going to do what by saying that it 's dependant on the governments of the affected countries to react to offers of aid .
in indonesia , progress takes a little longer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's government is planing to present its masterplan for reconstruction on march 26 , three months after the tsunami hit the country .
until then , emergency aid in affected regions is going to continue along with german support .
due to the small presence of foreign aid organizations up to now , they can not fall back on existing structures and contacts and thus progress takes longer here .
but transition from measures such as organizing food , medicine or housing to reconstruction is fluid .

the us president seems intent on making amends with europe , and the continent 's leaders are only too happy to . " america needs europe and europe needs america and by working together we can make the world a better one , " jose manuel barroso , the president of the european commission , said in a statement on friday .
bush was similarly agreeable in an interview he gave to germany 's ard television before his trip .
in his comments , he confirmed europe and germany 's importance in the international community , and their importance to america .
" europe is extremely important for america and germany is extremely important for europe , " he said .
he said washington expects germany to have a role in stabilizing iraq , although " our german friends … must feel good about it . " bush : iran " rumors " not true despite the agreeable tone , bush and the european allies will have some tough issues to work through .
on the top of the list is what to do about iran , which is suspected of harboring ambitions to develop nuclear weapons . in her visit ahead of bush , secretary of state condoleezza rice said the united states favored a hard-line against iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : technical staff are seen in this photo taken at the isfahan uranium conversion facility in central iran which is nearing completion .
the eu and america are trying to get iran to stop attempting to enrich uranium .
europe , particularly germany , france and great britain have been pushing for a diplomatic solution and some eu politicians have been alarmed by the sabre-rattling out of washington .
but bush rejected fears the u.s. was planning a military action . " i hear these rumors about military attacks and they are simply not true , " bush said in the interview . nato 's role bush will arrive in brussels on sunday , have dinner on monday with french president jacques chirac and visit the headquarters of the european commission tuesday evening after meeting with eu and nato heads of state .
barroso plans to host a dinner with bush , eu foreign policy chief javier solana and luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , whose country is currently holding the european union 's rotating presidency . on wednesday , he makes a visit to mainz , germany to meet up with chancellor gerhard schröder .
the two , who have , by all accounts , made up after a deep rift opened following schröder 's anti-war stance , will discuss the chancellor 's controversial comments on rehauling nato .
schröder suggested earlier this week that nato should no longer be the " primary venue " for the transatlantic dialogue .
" i look forward to reminding gerhard schröder that nato is an active institution , " bush said . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mainz to lock down for bush visit tight security measures are being put into place for george w. bush 's stop in the city of mainz next week during his european tour .

this year 's festival is no exception , having provided breakthrough moments for several new homegrown stars . julia jentsch , actress the undisputed new star to emerge from the berlinale is berlin-born actress julia jentsch , 26 .
her convincing portrayal of anti-nazi resistance heroine sophie scholl in the competition film " sophie scholl - the final days " went over well with both critics and audiences alike .
jentsch 's face is now gracing the covers of german magazines , meaning her days of going unrecognized are coming to an end .
jentsch previously appeared in " the edukators , " a film about a group of young people who break into the homes of the wealthy not to steal , but to send them a message about social injustice .
jentsch has been a member of the munich kammerspiel theatre ensemble since 2001 .

festival director dieter kosslick said hummer 's portrayal of a young woman the film 's protagonist believes is her lost daughter could make her " a very big star in europe or worldwide . "
but that will depend very much on which of her ambitions hummer decides to pursue .
she is also a dedicated musician with an album and negotiations with record labels in the works .
hummer 's previous film credits include the coming-of-age story " crazy , " and another film by petzold , " the state i am in " -lrb- die innere sicherheit -rrb- . hannes stöhr , director bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannes stöhr " one day in europe " has been described as " delightful " and " refreshing , " and has earned its director , hannes stöhr , 35 , accolades that are just as positive .

the film is made up of four episodes told in four european cities and seven different languages .
the thing that holds them together is a fictional european champions league soccer match played in moscow between spanish and turkish teams .
" soccer , whether you like the game or not , is something that connects all the cultures of europe , " said stöhr , who also wrote the film 's screenplay .

this year 's festival is no exception , having provided breakthrough moments for several new homegrown stars . julia jentsch , actress the undisputed new star to emerge from the berlinale is berlin-born actress julia jentsch , 26 .
her convincing portrayal of anti-nazi resistance heroine sophie scholl in the competition film " sophie scholl - the final days " went over well with both critics and audiences alike .
jentsch 's face is now gracing the covers of german magazines , meaning her days of going unrecognized are coming to an end .
jentsch previously appeared in " the edukators , " a film about a group of young people who break into the homes of the wealthy not to steal , but to send them a message about social injustice .
jentsch has been a member of the munich kammerspiel theatre ensemble since 2001 .
at a berlinale press conference , jentsch said she would be returning to the stage and had no plans to make another film .
but that 's likely to change soon - especially if jentsch scoops the silver bear for best actress , as many are already predicting . julia hummer , actress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia hummer another young actress named julia has created a stir at the berlinale - julia hummer , 24 , who stars in christian petzold 's film " ghosts " -lrb- gespenster -rrb- .
festival director dieter kosslick said hummer 's portrayal of a young woman the film 's protagonist believes is her lost daughter could make her " a very big star in europe or worldwide . "
but that will depend very much on which of her ambitions hummer decides to pursue .
she is also a dedicated musician with an album and negotiations with record labels in the works .
hummer 's previous film credits include the coming-of-age story " crazy , " and another film by petzold , " the state i am in " -lrb- die innere sicherheit -rrb- . hannes stöhr , director bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannes stöhr " one day in europe " has been described as " delightful " and " refreshing , " and has earned its director , hannes stöhr , 35 , accolades that are just as positive .
not bad , considering " europe " is only his second feature-length film , following on 2001 's " berlin is in germany . "
the film is made up of four episodes told in four european cities and seven different languages .
the thing that holds them together is a fictional european champions league soccer match played in moscow between spanish and turkish teams .
" soccer , whether you like the game or not , is something that connects all the cultures of europe , " said stöhr , who also wrote the film 's screenplay .
the story was a natural for stöhr , who lives in berlin , but has also spent parts of his life in moscow and istanbul , and who speaks english , german , spanish and french . max riemelt , actor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max riemelt in " napola " from constantin film it does n't get any more official than actually being named a shooting star 2005 , but that 's exactly what happened to young german actor max riemelt , 21 .
his current film , " napola " , in which he plays a working-class student at an elite training academy during the third reich , is not showing at the berlinale , but riemelt was one of 21 young actors from 21 different countries to be awarded the prize at a european film promotion event held alongside the festival .
riemelt first achieved teen-idol fame in germany with the film " mädchen , mädchen ! "
as a prize winner , riemelt will be introduced to countless producers , casting agents , and other actors over the next few days , but his attitude is relaxed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 19.02.2005 bayern munich rip dortmund apart großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay had three goals to whoop about munich wanted to show their bundesliga critics that last week 's 3-1 loss to arminia bielefeld was a one-time slip , and they did it in convincing style by thrashing financially ailing borussia dortmund 5-0 . roy makaay was bayern 's man of the day in munich 's olympic stadium .
dortmund 's defense left the dutch striker entirely too much space in the beginning of the game and paid dearly for it .
makaay kept the 53,000 home team fans riveted by scoring a pair of goals himself and assisting in tow more during the game 's first 45 minutes .
in the second half he put in one more to seal a personal hat trick and his team 's highest win of the season .
bayern had something to prove bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hasan salihamidzic , center , celebrates with teammates roy makkay , left , and mehmet scholl , after scoring " after the loss in bielefeld we had some matter to take care of and the team knew it , " said bayern munich trainer felix magath .
" we were lucky that we got a goal early and could pile on another one a little bit later . "
it was hasan salihamidzic who opened scoring in the fifth minute , and makaay put in his first of three exceptional goals just one minute later .
the two quick goals gave dortmund a shock they never recovered from .
bert van marwijk watched his bvb squad 's defense fall apart time after time while his strikers never worked their way into a truly dangerous position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich flew away with the win at home against dortmund dortmund goalkeeper roman weidenfeller inexplicably allowed makaay 's tame shot to squirm under his body in the game 's 34th minute , but was helpless earlier in the 28th minute when claudio pizarro volleyed home .
even a locker room talk could n't bring dortmund back to life and makaay ended the scoring by putting a shot between dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller 's legs in the 54th minute , giving bayern munich its third home win in a row .
bankruptcy not an excuse for borussia dortmund , the crushing loss moved what until now was only a financial crisis to the playing field .
on thursday the team announced they were on the edge of bankruptcy .
the disastrous defeat thus capped what has already been a distressing week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the brink of bankruptcy , a thrashing in munich added insult to borussia dortmund 's financial injury " we were not confident , " said dortmund coach van marwijk .
" we were not in the game for a moment after falling behind early .
our financial problems are not an alibi . "
the win means bayern will stay in first place atop the bundesliga table , by how many points will remain unclear until 2nd-placed schalke 04 play against borussia mönchengladbach sunday afternoon .
munich started the game without german national team captain michael ballack and also let torsten frings and owen hargreaves have a break before this week 's champions league match against arsenal london .
salihamidzic and martin demichelis took the starters ' places in midfield and , along with mehmet scholl , proved they are capable of playing reliably for the german league 's top team . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de life after soccer ?

dortmund 's defense left the dutch striker entirely too much space in the beginning of the game and paid dearly for it .
makaay kept the 53,000 home team fans riveted by scoring a pair of goals himself and assisting in tow more during the game 's first 45 minutes .
in the second half he put in one more to seal a personal hat trick and his team 's highest win of the season .
bayern had something to prove bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hasan salihamidzic , center , celebrates with teammates roy makkay , left , and mehmet scholl , after scoring " after the loss in bielefeld we had some matter to take care of and the team knew it , " said bayern munich trainer felix magath .
" we were lucky that we got a goal early and could pile on another one a little bit later . "
it was hasan salihamidzic who opened scoring in the fifth minute , and makaay put in his first of three exceptional goals just one minute later .
the two quick goals gave dortmund a shock they never recovered from .
bert van marwijk watched his bvb squad 's defense fall apart time after time while his strikers never worked their way into a truly dangerous position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich flew away with the win at home against dortmund dortmund goalkeeper roman weidenfeller inexplicably allowed makaay 's tame shot to squirm under his body in the game 's 34th minute , but was helpless earlier in the 28th minute when claudio pizarro volleyed home .
even a locker room talk could n't bring dortmund back to life and makaay ended the scoring by putting a shot between dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller 's legs in the 54th minute , giving bayern munich its third home win in a row .
bankruptcy not an excuse for borussia dortmund , the crushing loss moved what until now was only a financial crisis to the playing field .
on thursday the team announced they were on the edge of bankruptcy .
the disastrous defeat thus capped what has already been a distressing week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the brink of bankruptcy , a thrashing in munich added insult to borussia dortmund 's financial injury " we were not confident , " said dortmund coach van marwijk .
" we were not in the game for a moment after falling behind early .
our financial problems are not an alibi . "
the win means bayern will stay in first place atop the bundesliga table , by how many points will remain unclear until 2nd-placed schalke 04 play against borussia mönchengladbach sunday afternoon .
munich started the game without german national team captain michael ballack and also let torsten frings and owen hargreaves have a break before this week 's champions league match against arsenal london .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.02.2005 eu chief keen to seek unity with us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiss and make up : solana , left , was welcoming to condoleeza rice on the eve of president bush 's europe visit , the eu 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , told deutsche welle that the us and europe were ready to bury past rifts and cooperate on divisive issues . deutsche welle : mr. solana , us president george w. bush is traveling to europe this coming week .
what do you think will come of this visit ?
how will the europeans welcome the american president ? javier solana : i think the visit has every prospect of being a success .
i think the current climate and atmosphere are much better than they were a couple of years , or even a couple of months ago .
there was some dissonance in 2003 and 2004 , especially over iraq .
but we have overcome our differences now .
that 's why i think the decision by president bush and his new secretary of state to choose europe as the place to make their first overseas visits since the new presidential term started is a very positive gesture . there 's a debate currently over what role nato should play in future relations between the europeans and the us .
a whole series of suggestions have been put forward on ways to improve the way we work together .
what is your view on this debate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i believe that everything that contributes toward making transatlantic relations more effective is good . every debate in this direction is positive .
i think that everyone accepts that transatlantic relations are no longer dealt with exclusively within the framework of nato , but to a large degree also within eu institutions .
this was very clearly highlighted by the many hours that secretary condoleezza rice spent at the european union .
and now president bush is coming to exchange views with leading european figures on the problems which exist between the eu and nato .
i believe this is positive and expresses the importance of the role of the european union in transatlantic relations , and the common desire for europeans and americans to work together . despite all the conflicts going on in the world , there have been significant advances made , for example in the middle east .
how realistic is the hope for peace between israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana , left , and peter hansen , commissioner general of the united nations relief and works agency -lrb- unrwa -rrb- , inspect damage of a destroyed kindergarden during their tour in the norther gaza strip town of beit lahiya , wednesday jan .
12 , 2005 .
i have been involved in the middle east peace process for many years , but now for the first time i am very optimistic and i can see great opportunities .
there is a path that both israelis and palestinians must tread together , accompanied by their friends .
both we europeans and the americans are their friends , and i believe we can join them on this path .
but it wo n't be easy .
there will be high and low points , and good times and bad .
the most important thing is that we remain committed and show good will . i think that president abbas is doing a good job , from the way the palestinian election was run to what he 's doing now .
and prime minister sharon has also made good decisions , like relaxing the restrictions on palestinians so that people can enjoy a better standard of life , and the decision to remove settlements from the gaza strip .
but i am well aware of the pitfalls .
we have to keep our eyes open and be clear about our obligations .
as i have said before , we have to be committed to providing help because there will be innumerable difficulties . what can the european union do to help abbas end terrorism and to support the move towards peace ? the best that we can do to help him is to strengthen and train his police force .
and that 's what we 're doing now .
there 's a team already working with the palestinian security forces to help them function in the most efficient and effective way possible .
that 's important , but the political will to end terrorist activities is more important .
president abbas has made very clear statements on this and has acted accordingly . that must be recognized by the international community as well as by israel . the european union is also in negotiations to persuade iran not to build nuclear weapons .
can we expect success there as well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in bushehr , iran , 750 miles -lrb- 1,200 kilometers -rrb- southwest of tehran .
we made considerable progress in the last few months .
iran has signed an additional protocol which allows inspectors from the international atomic energy authority to visit sites across the country without giving prior notification .
that means the iaea can carry out a control function in iran . the negotiations are being conducted on three levels at the same time : we 're dealing with the nuclear arms issue , security aspects for iran , and trade and economic relations between iran and the eu .
we hope that we will continue to make progress . does this mean that these subjects will be decided bilaterally between the iranian government and the europeans , or will the americans have a say in the negotiations ? i think that the united states is not interested in joining the negotiations at this point in time .
they can support them from the sidelines .
as you know , the us has no diplomatic relations with iran , and for this reason it is more difficult for them .
in any case , if all goes well , the results will be seen in vienna at the international atomic energy agency .
any agreement reached with iran will have to be ratified by the iaea board of governors , which is elected by nations in the iaea , who are all members of the united nations , can we now say that relations between the us and europe are close and that there 's been no break in the dialogue with the us ?
is there agreement on how to implement common political strategies ? yes , i think so .
that follows on from what i said about the talks that we have held in the past few months .
and i hope this will be underlined by president bush and the leading political figures of the european union . is there hope of an agreement , for example on the subject of china and the decision by the european union to lift the weapons embargo on beijing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao , left , smiles as former eu commission president romano prodi gestures during a media conference at the eu commission building in brussels , thursday , may 6 , 2004 .
all issues that we are in the process of negotiating are both difficult and delicate .
even so , i 'm convinced that we can reach agreement .
as far as china is concerned , i would like to emphasize that it is not about selling more weapons to china ; rather it concerns the lifting of sanctions that the eu imposed on china during the tiananmen square crisis .
since then , many years have gone by and much has happened .
a new generation is in charge in china now and we want to forge new relations which are not overshadowed by sanctions .
for this reason , the lifting of the weapons embargo will be a political rather than a military gesture . the interview was conducted by gonzalo cáceres send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush , europe set to mend fences ahead of us president george w. bush 's highly-anticipated visit to europe , both sides are all smiles .

12 , 2005 .
i have been involved in the middle east peace process for many years , but now for the first time i am very optimistic and i can see great opportunities .
there is a path that both israelis and palestinians must tread together , accompanied by their friends .
both we europeans and the americans are their friends , and i believe we can join them on this path .
but it wo n't be easy .
there will be high and low points , and good times and bad .
the most important thing is that we remain committed and show good will . i think that president abbas is doing a good job , from the way the palestinian election was run to what he 's doing now .
and prime minister sharon has also made good decisions , like relaxing the restrictions on palestinians so that people can enjoy a better standard of life , and the decision to remove settlements from the gaza strip .
but i am well aware of the pitfalls .
we have to keep our eyes open and be clear about our obligations .
as i have said before , we have to be committed to providing help because there will be innumerable difficulties . what can the european union do to help abbas end terrorism and to support the move towards peace ? the best that we can do to help him is to strengthen and train his police force .
and that 's what we 're doing now .
there 's a team already working with the palestinian security forces to help them function in the most efficient and effective way possible .
that 's important , but the political will to end terrorist activities is more important .
president abbas has made very clear statements on this and has acted accordingly . that must be recognized by the international community as well as by israel . the european union is also in negotiations to persuade iran not to build nuclear weapons .
can we expect success there as well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in bushehr , iran , 750 miles -lrb- 1,200 kilometers -rrb- southwest of tehran .
we made considerable progress in the last few months .
iran has signed an additional protocol which allows inspectors from the international atomic energy authority to visit sites across the country without giving prior notification .
that means the iaea can carry out a control function in iran . the negotiations are being conducted on three levels at the same time : we 're dealing with the nuclear arms issue , security aspects for iran , and trade and economic relations between iran and the eu .
we hope that we will continue to make progress . does this mean that these subjects will be decided bilaterally between the iranian government and the europeans , or will the americans have a say in the negotiations ? i think that the united states is not interested in joining the negotiations at this point in time .
they can support them from the sidelines .
as you know , the us has no diplomatic relations with iran , and for this reason it is more difficult for them .
in any case , if all goes well , the results will be seen in vienna at the international atomic energy agency .
any agreement reached with iran will have to be ratified by the iaea board of governors , which is elected by nations in the iaea , who are all members of the united nations , can we now say that relations between the us and europe are close and that there 's been no break in the dialogue with the us ?
is there agreement on how to implement common political strategies ? yes , i think so .
that follows on from what i said about the talks that we have held in the past few months .
and i hope this will be underlined by president bush and the leading political figures of the european union . is there hope of an agreement , for example on the subject of china and the decision by the european union to lift the weapons embargo on beijing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao , left , smiles as former eu commission president romano prodi gestures during a media conference at the eu commission building in brussels , thursday , may 6 , 2004 .
all issues that we are in the process of negotiating are both difficult and delicate .
even so , i 'm convinced that we can reach agreement .
as far as china is concerned , i would like to emphasize that it is not about selling more weapons to china ; rather it concerns the lifting of sanctions that the eu imposed on china during the tiananmen square crisis .
since then , many years have gone by and much has happened .
a new generation is in charge in china now and we want to forge new relations which are not overshadowed by sanctions .
for this reason , the lifting of the weapons embargo will be a political rather than a military gesture . the interview was conducted by gonzalo cáceres send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush , europe set to mend fences ahead of us president george w. bush 's highly-anticipated visit to europe , both sides are all smiles .

what do you think will come of this visit ?
how will the europeans welcome the american president ? javier solana : i think the visit has every prospect of being a success .
i think the current climate and atmosphere are much better than they were a couple of years , or even a couple of months ago .
there was some dissonance in 2003 and 2004 , especially over iraq .
but we have overcome our differences now .
that 's why i think the decision by president bush and his new secretary of state to choose europe as the place to make their first overseas visits since the new presidential term started is a very positive gesture . there 's a debate currently over what role nato should play in future relations between the europeans and the us .
a whole series of suggestions have been put forward on ways to improve the way we work together .
what is your view on this debate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i believe that everything that contributes toward making transatlantic relations more effective is good . every debate in this direction is positive .
i think that everyone accepts that transatlantic relations are no longer dealt with exclusively within the framework of nato , but to a large degree also within eu institutions .

can we expect success there as well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in bushehr , iran , 750 miles -lrb- 1,200 kilometers -rrb- southwest of tehran .
we made considerable progress in the last few months .
iran has signed an additional protocol which allows inspectors from the international atomic energy authority to visit sites across the country without giving prior notification .
that means the iaea can carry out a control function in iran . the negotiations are being conducted on three levels at the same time : we 're dealing with the nuclear arms issue , security aspects for iran , and trade and economic relations between iran and the eu .
we hope that we will continue to make progress . does this mean that these subjects will be decided bilaterally between the iranian government and the europeans , or will the americans have a say in the negotiations ? i think that the united states is not interested in joining the negotiations at this point in time .
they can support them from the sidelines .
as you know , the us has no diplomatic relations with iran , and for this reason it is more difficult for them .
in any case , if all goes well , the results will be seen in vienna at the international atomic energy agency .
any agreement reached with iran will have to be ratified by the iaea board of governors , which is elected by nations in the iaea , who are all members of the united nations , can we now say that relations between the us and europe are close and that there 's been no break in the dialogue with the us ?
is there agreement on how to implement common political strategies ? yes , i think so .
that follows on from what i said about the talks that we have held in the past few months .
and i hope this will be underlined by president bush and the leading political figures of the european union . is there hope of an agreement , for example on the subject of china and the decision by the european union to lift the weapons embargo on beijing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao , left , smiles as former eu commission president romano prodi gestures during a media conference at the eu commission building in brussels , thursday , may 6 , 2004 .
all issues that we are in the process of negotiating are both difficult and delicate .
even so , i 'm convinced that we can reach agreement .
as far as china is concerned , i would like to emphasize that it is not about selling more weapons to china ; rather it concerns the lifting of sanctions that the eu imposed on china during the tiananmen square crisis .
since then , many years have gone by and much has happened .
a new generation is in charge in china now and we want to forge new relations which are not overshadowed by sanctions .
for this reason , the lifting of the weapons embargo will be a political rather than a military gesture . the interview was conducted by gonzalo cáceres send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush , europe set to mend fences ahead of us president george w. bush 's highly-anticipated visit to europe , both sides are all smiles .

this year 's festival is no exception , having provided breakthrough moments for several new homegrown stars . julia jentsch , actress the undisputed new star to emerge from the berlinale is berlin-born actress julia jentsch , 26 .
her convincing portrayal of anti-nazi resistance heroine sophie scholl in the competition film " sophie scholl - the final days " went over well with both critics and audiences alike .
jentsch 's face is now gracing the covers of german magazines , meaning her days of going unrecognized are coming to an end .
jentsch previously appeared in " the edukators , " a film about a group of young people who break into the homes of the wealthy not to steal , but to send them a message about social injustice .

festival director dieter kosslick said hummer 's portrayal of a young woman the film 's protagonist believes is her lost daughter could make her " a very big star in europe or worldwide . "

this year 's festival is no exception , having provided breakthrough moments for several new homegrown stars . julia jentsch , actress the undisputed new star to emerge from the berlinale is berlin-born actress julia jentsch , 26 .
her convincing portrayal of anti-nazi resistance heroine sophie scholl in the competition film " sophie scholl - the final days " went over well with both critics and audiences alike .
jentsch 's face is now gracing the covers of german magazines , meaning her days of going unrecognized are coming to an end .
jentsch previously appeared in " the edukators , " a film about a group of young people who break into the homes of the wealthy not to steal , but to send them a message about social injustice .
jentsch has been a member of the munich kammerspiel theatre ensemble since 2001 .

but , how exactly is the money going to be distributed ? emergency aid began pouring in from all corners of the world right after the tidal wave hit on dec .
26 , 2004 and efforts to provide devastated areas with basis supplies are still underway . reconstruction however needs more time .
" it 's not possible to spread € 500 million over five years yet , " stephan bethe of the german federal ministry for economic development and cooperation -lrb- bmz -rrb- said and pointed out that the affected countries and donor nations first have to come to an agreement about what is needed and who is going to provide for it .
" reconstruction is a long process " , bethe said , adding that the right choices have to be made in rebuilding infrastructure like schools , hospitals , streets or energy and water supplies . in addition , the people have to be helped back to a position where they can earn a living on their own again .
where does the extra money go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bmz budget for 2005 amounts to € 3.8 billion , the same as last year . the € 500 million in tsunami aid money pledged by the german government comes on top of the development funds . berlin is also chanelling € 50 million from the tsunami aid funds into a un emergency relief fund .
the remaining € 450 million are meant to aid reconstruction in indonesia and sri lanka , the two worst-hit states in the tsunami . according to the bmz , it 's still difficult to foresee whether the duration of reconstruction there will take five years or less . more specifically , the extra long term aid money is going to be administered by the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- , which receives most of its assignments from the bmz , and the state-owned bank for reconstruction -lrb- kfw -rrb- .
both institutions operate development projects in particular countries and according to bethe they will handle projects in the tsunami-struck region on behalf of the bmz .
local know-how important employees of both the gtz and kfw however depend on local and regional expertise and organization on the ground .
" they can be local councils , non-governmental organizations or companies , " said hans stehling of the gtz .
the cooperation in turn provides employment opportunities for devastated communities .
for instance , the building of new schools or repairing fishing boats is often commissioned out to local carpentry companies .
in sri lanka , emergency relief has already translated into long-term reconstruction .
the gtz was present in the country with various projects long before the indian ocean tragedy struck , thus enabling it to react swiftly to the disaster .
on sunday , german development minster heidemarie wieczorek-zeul is expected in the region .
according to bmz 's bethe , the sri lankan government has already drawn up the first reconstruction plans which are now being approved by the donor nations .
it definitely sounds like more than just empty promises from germany 's government .
" we 've already proposed various projects for reconstruction .
now , we 're waiting for contracts from the bmz , " said stehling .
he 's counting on a quick decision from the ministry .
however , nobody 's talking of concrete dates or funds as yet .
germany 's ministry for economic development and cooperation skirts all questions regarding who is going to do what by saying that it 's dependant on the governments of the affected countries to react to offers of aid .
in indonesia , progress takes a little longer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's government is planing to present its masterplan for reconstruction on march 26 , three months after the tsunami hit the country .
until then , emergency aid in affected regions is going to continue along with german support .
due to the small presence of foreign aid organizations up to now , they can not fall back on existing structures and contacts and thus progress takes longer here .
but transition from measures such as organizing food , medicine or housing to reconstruction is fluid .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the asian tsunami : one year after doing better than " business as usual " german tsunami early warning system takes shape german organizations take stock of tsunami relief message at un disaster meeting : be prepared germany -pipe- 19.02.2005 an endeavor that needs time and money großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an indonesian man cleans up the remains of his house the german government has generously pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 653 million -rrb- over the next three to five years for long-term rebuilding in tsunami-ravaged south asia .
but , how exactly is the money going to be distributed ? emergency aid began pouring in from all corners of the world right after the tidal wave hit on dec .
26 , 2004 and efforts to provide devastated areas with basis supplies are still underway . reconstruction however needs more time .
" it 's not possible to spread € 500 million over five years yet , " stephan bethe of the german federal ministry for economic development and cooperation -lrb- bmz -rrb- said and pointed out that the affected countries and donor nations first have to come to an agreement about what is needed and who is going to provide for it .
" reconstruction is a long process " , bethe said , adding that the right choices have to be made in rebuilding infrastructure like schools , hospitals , streets or energy and water supplies . in addition , the people have to be helped back to a position where they can earn a living on their own again .
where does the extra money go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bmz budget for 2005 amounts to € 3.8 billion , the same as last year . the € 500 million in tsunami aid money pledged by the german government comes on top of the development funds . berlin is also chanelling € 50 million from the tsunami aid funds into a un emergency relief fund .
the remaining € 450 million are meant to aid reconstruction in indonesia and sri lanka , the two worst-hit states in the tsunami . according to the bmz , it 's still difficult to foresee whether the duration of reconstruction there will take five years or less . more specifically , the extra long term aid money is going to be administered by the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- , which receives most of its assignments from the bmz , and the state-owned bank for reconstruction -lrb- kfw -rrb- .
both institutions operate development projects in particular countries and according to bethe they will handle projects in the tsunami-struck region on behalf of the bmz .
local know-how important employees of both the gtz and kfw however depend on local and regional expertise and organization on the ground .
" they can be local councils , non-governmental organizations or companies , " said hans stehling of the gtz .
the cooperation in turn provides employment opportunities for devastated communities .
for instance , the building of new schools or repairing fishing boats is often commissioned out to local carpentry companies .
in sri lanka , emergency relief has already translated into long-term reconstruction .
the gtz was present in the country with various projects long before the indian ocean tragedy struck , thus enabling it to react swiftly to the disaster .
on sunday , german development minster heidemarie wieczorek-zeul is expected in the region .
according to bmz 's bethe , the sri lankan government has already drawn up the first reconstruction plans which are now being approved by the donor nations .
it definitely sounds like more than just empty promises from germany 's government .
" we 've already proposed various projects for reconstruction .
now , we 're waiting for contracts from the bmz , " said stehling .
he 's counting on a quick decision from the ministry .
however , nobody 's talking of concrete dates or funds as yet .
germany 's ministry for economic development and cooperation skirts all questions regarding who is going to do what by saying that it 's dependant on the governments of the affected countries to react to offers of aid .
in indonesia , progress takes a little longer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's government is planing to present its masterplan for reconstruction on march 26 , three months after the tsunami hit the country .
until then , emergency aid in affected regions is going to continue along with german support .

but , how exactly is the money going to be distributed ? emergency aid began pouring in from all corners of the world right after the tidal wave hit on dec .
26 , 2004 and efforts to provide devastated areas with basis supplies are still underway . reconstruction however needs more time .
" it 's not possible to spread € 500 million over five years yet , " stephan bethe of the german federal ministry for economic development and cooperation -lrb- bmz -rrb- said and pointed out that the affected countries and donor nations first have to come to an agreement about what is needed and who is going to provide for it .
" reconstruction is a long process " , bethe said , adding that the right choices have to be made in rebuilding infrastructure like schools , hospitals , streets or energy and water supplies . in addition , the people have to be helped back to a position where they can earn a living on their own again .
where does the extra money go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bmz budget for 2005 amounts to € 3.8 billion , the same as last year . the € 500 million in tsunami aid money pledged by the german government comes on top of the development funds . berlin is also chanelling € 50 million from the tsunami aid funds into a un emergency relief fund .
the remaining € 450 million are meant to aid reconstruction in indonesia and sri lanka , the two worst-hit states in the tsunami . according to the bmz , it 's still difficult to foresee whether the duration of reconstruction there will take five years or less . more specifically , the extra long term aid money is going to be administered by the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- , which receives most of its assignments from the bmz , and the state-owned bank for reconstruction -lrb- kfw -rrb- .
both institutions operate development projects in particular countries and according to bethe they will handle projects in the tsunami-struck region on behalf of the bmz .
local know-how important employees of both the gtz and kfw however depend on local and regional expertise and organization on the ground .
" they can be local councils , non-governmental organizations or companies , " said hans stehling of the gtz .
the cooperation in turn provides employment opportunities for devastated communities .
for instance , the building of new schools or repairing fishing boats is often commissioned out to local carpentry companies .
in sri lanka , emergency relief has already translated into long-term reconstruction .
the gtz was present in the country with various projects long before the indian ocean tragedy struck , thus enabling it to react swiftly to the disaster .
on sunday , german development minster heidemarie wieczorek-zeul is expected in the region .
according to bmz 's bethe , the sri lankan government has already drawn up the first reconstruction plans which are now being approved by the donor nations .
it definitely sounds like more than just empty promises from germany 's government .
" we 've already proposed various projects for reconstruction .
now , we 're waiting for contracts from the bmz , " said stehling .
he 's counting on a quick decision from the ministry .
however , nobody 's talking of concrete dates or funds as yet .
germany 's ministry for economic development and cooperation skirts all questions regarding who is going to do what by saying that it 's dependant on the governments of the affected countries to react to offers of aid .
in indonesia , progress takes a little longer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's government is planing to present its masterplan for reconstruction on march 26 , three months after the tsunami hit the country .
until then , emergency aid in affected regions is going to continue along with german support .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 19.02.2005 film festival pushes homegrown talent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's newest star : julia jentsch the berlinale is not just as a launch-pad for new films , but also for the " undiscovered " talent behind them .
this year 's festival is no exception , having provided breakthrough moments for several new homegrown stars . julia jentsch , actress the undisputed new star to emerge from the berlinale is berlin-born actress julia jentsch , 26 .
her convincing portrayal of anti-nazi resistance heroine sophie scholl in the competition film " sophie scholl - the final days " went over well with both critics and audiences alike .
jentsch 's face is now gracing the covers of german magazines , meaning her days of going unrecognized are coming to an end .
jentsch previously appeared in " the edukators , " a film about a group of young people who break into the homes of the wealthy not to steal , but to send them a message about social injustice .
jentsch has been a member of the munich kammerspiel theatre ensemble since 2001 .
at a berlinale press conference , jentsch said she would be returning to the stage and had no plans to make another film .
but that 's likely to change soon - especially if jentsch scoops the silver bear for best actress , as many are already predicting . julia hummer , actress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia hummer another young actress named julia has created a stir at the berlinale - julia hummer , 24 , who stars in christian petzold 's film " ghosts " -lrb- gespenster -rrb- .
festival director dieter kosslick said hummer 's portrayal of a young woman the film 's protagonist believes is her lost daughter could make her " a very big star in europe or worldwide . "
but that will depend very much on which of her ambitions hummer decides to pursue .
she is also a dedicated musician with an album and negotiations with record labels in the works .
hummer 's previous film credits include the coming-of-age story " crazy , " and another film by petzold , " the state i am in " -lrb- die innere sicherheit -rrb- . hannes stöhr , director bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannes stöhr " one day in europe " has been described as " delightful " and " refreshing , " and has earned its director , hannes stöhr , 35 , accolades that are just as positive .
not bad , considering " europe " is only his second feature-length film , following on 2001 's " berlin is in germany . "
the film is made up of four episodes told in four european cities and seven different languages .
the thing that holds them together is a fictional european champions league soccer match played in moscow between spanish and turkish teams .
" soccer , whether you like the game or not , is something that connects all the cultures of europe , " said stöhr , who also wrote the film 's screenplay .
the story was a natural for stöhr , who lives in berlin , but has also spent parts of his life in moscow and istanbul , and who speaks english , german , spanish and french . max riemelt , actor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max riemelt in " napola " from constantin film it does n't get any more official than actually being named a shooting star 2005 , but that 's exactly what happened to young german actor max riemelt , 21 .
his current film , " napola " , in which he plays a working-class student at an elite training academy during the third reich , is not showing at the berlinale , but riemelt was one of 21 young actors from 21 different countries to be awarded the prize at a european film promotion event held alongside the festival .
riemelt first achieved teen-idol fame in germany with the film " mädchen , mädchen ! "
as a prize winner , riemelt will be introduced to countless producers , casting agents , and other actors over the next few days , but his attitude is relaxed .
" it 's cool to be named a shooting star , and of course , a big honor , " riemelt said .
" but as to what comes of that , i 'm just going to see what comes my way .

not in dortmund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happier times : dortmund fans celebrate their 2002 championship fans of the dortmund soccer club bvb borrusia are distraught .
the storied team with one of the most loyal followings in the world is on the edge of a financial collapse that threatens its existence . a full 80,000 fans can fit into westfalen stadium , the cavernous temple to the dortmund soccer club bvb borussia 09 - and do so every home game .
the fan bloc , which during games is a sea of black and yellow banners and flags , is made up of 27,000 people each game - all of them standing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's westfalen stadium is one of the sites of the 2006 world cup so when dortmund fans are mad , it 's best to listen .
and they have never been more upset .
the problem " rage , fear and bewilderment , " read a newspaper headline in dortmund this week .
in four years , the bvb would have celebrated its 100th anniversary .
now , there is serious doubt the club can even make it to the next season .
borussia has run up a debt of € 142.1 million -lrb- $ 185.74 million -rrb- over the past few seasons , an equivalent of 79 percent of its capital .
just a few seasons ago , the club made headlines by winning the bundelisga title , competing regularly in european tournaments , and being the first german club to go on the stock exchange .
today , borrusia and its team of highly-paid stars is struggling up the bundesliga table .
the stock has plunged more than 25 percent .
the targets " the anger is massive and the fear is just as big , " one fan told dw-radio .
" i do n't know where it will go from here .

they accused meier of mismanagement and spending too much money on players who did n't deliver as promised .
they demanded meier correct the club 's miserable accounting and then resign .
" bvb brought a smile to my face " the anger , and the sheer numbers taking to the streets illustrate the importance of the soccer club to the ruhr valley city .
once a center for steel and coal mining , dortmund 's fortunes have sunk as companies have either gone bankrupt or pulled up stakes to move eastwards , where labor is cheaper .
for many of the workers , the soccer team was their weekend distraction .
for the growing list of unemployed and their families , the team is nowadays their only distraction .

this year 's festival is no exception , having provided breakthrough moments for several new homegrown stars . julia jentsch , actress the undisputed new star to emerge from the berlinale is berlin-born actress julia jentsch , 26 .
her convincing portrayal of anti-nazi resistance heroine sophie scholl in the competition film " sophie scholl - the final days " went over well with both critics and audiences alike .
jentsch 's face is now gracing the covers of german magazines , meaning her days of going unrecognized are coming to an end .
jentsch previously appeared in " the edukators , " a film about a group of young people who break into the homes of the wealthy not to steal , but to send them a message about social injustice .
jentsch has been a member of the munich kammerspiel theatre ensemble since 2001 .
at a berlinale press conference , jentsch said she would be returning to the stage and had no plans to make another film .
but that 's likely to change soon - especially if jentsch scoops the silver bear for best actress , as many are already predicting . julia hummer , actress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia hummer another young actress named julia has created a stir at the berlinale - julia hummer , 24 , who stars in christian petzold 's film " ghosts " -lrb- gespenster -rrb- .
festival director dieter kosslick said hummer 's portrayal of a young woman the film 's protagonist believes is her lost daughter could make her " a very big star in europe or worldwide . "
but that will depend very much on which of her ambitions hummer decides to pursue .
she is also a dedicated musician with an album and negotiations with record labels in the works .
hummer 's previous film credits include the coming-of-age story " crazy , " and another film by petzold , " the state i am in " -lrb- die innere sicherheit -rrb- . hannes stöhr , director bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannes stöhr " one day in europe " has been described as " delightful " and " refreshing , " and has earned its director , hannes stöhr , 35 , accolades that are just as positive .
not bad , considering " europe " is only his second feature-length film , following on 2001 's " berlin is in germany . "
the film is made up of four episodes told in four european cities and seven different languages .
the thing that holds them together is a fictional european champions league soccer match played in moscow between spanish and turkish teams .
" soccer , whether you like the game or not , is something that connects all the cultures of europe , " said stöhr , who also wrote the film 's screenplay .
the story was a natural for stöhr , who lives in berlin , but has also spent parts of his life in moscow and istanbul , and who speaks english , german , spanish and french . max riemelt , actor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max riemelt in " napola " from constantin film it does n't get any more official than actually being named a shooting star 2005 , but that 's exactly what happened to young german actor max riemelt , 21 .
his current film , " napola " , in which he plays a working-class student at an elite training academy during the third reich , is not showing at the berlinale , but riemelt was one of 21 young actors from 21 different countries to be awarded the prize at a european film promotion event held alongside the festival .
riemelt first achieved teen-idol fame in germany with the film " mädchen , mädchen ! "
as a prize winner , riemelt will be introduced to countless producers , casting agents , and other actors over the next few days , but his attitude is relaxed .
" it 's cool to be named a shooting star , and of course , a big honor , " riemelt said .
" but as to what comes of that , i 'm just going to see what comes my way .

but , how exactly is the money going to be distributed ? emergency aid began pouring in from all corners of the world right after the tidal wave hit on dec .
26 , 2004 and efforts to provide devastated areas with basis supplies are still underway . reconstruction however needs more time .
" it 's not possible to spread € 500 million over five years yet , " stephan bethe of the german federal ministry for economic development and cooperation -lrb- bmz -rrb- said and pointed out that the affected countries and donor nations first have to come to an agreement about what is needed and who is going to provide for it .
" reconstruction is a long process " , bethe said , adding that the right choices have to be made in rebuilding infrastructure like schools , hospitals , streets or energy and water supplies . in addition , the people have to be helped back to a position where they can earn a living on their own again .
where does the extra money go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bmz budget for 2005 amounts to € 3.8 billion , the same as last year . the € 500 million in tsunami aid money pledged by the german government comes on top of the development funds . berlin is also chanelling € 50 million from the tsunami aid funds into a un emergency relief fund .
the remaining € 450 million are meant to aid reconstruction in indonesia and sri lanka , the two worst-hit states in the tsunami . according to the bmz , it 's still difficult to foresee whether the duration of reconstruction there will take five years or less . more specifically , the extra long term aid money is going to be administered by the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- , which receives most of its assignments from the bmz , and the state-owned bank for reconstruction -lrb- kfw -rrb- .
both institutions operate development projects in particular countries and according to bethe they will handle projects in the tsunami-struck region on behalf of the bmz .
local know-how important employees of both the gtz and kfw however depend on local and regional expertise and organization on the ground .
" they can be local councils , non-governmental organizations or companies , " said hans stehling of the gtz .
the cooperation in turn provides employment opportunities for devastated communities .
for instance , the building of new schools or repairing fishing boats is often commissioned out to local carpentry companies .
in sri lanka , emergency relief has already translated into long-term reconstruction .
the gtz was present in the country with various projects long before the indian ocean tragedy struck , thus enabling it to react swiftly to the disaster .
on sunday , german development minster heidemarie wieczorek-zeul is expected in the region .
according to bmz 's bethe , the sri lankan government has already drawn up the first reconstruction plans which are now being approved by the donor nations .
it definitely sounds like more than just empty promises from germany 's government .
" we 've already proposed various projects for reconstruction .
now , we 're waiting for contracts from the bmz , " said stehling .
he 's counting on a quick decision from the ministry .
however , nobody 's talking of concrete dates or funds as yet .
germany 's ministry for economic development and cooperation skirts all questions regarding who is going to do what by saying that it 's dependant on the governments of the affected countries to react to offers of aid .
in indonesia , progress takes a little longer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's government is planing to present its masterplan for reconstruction on march 26 , three months after the tsunami hit the country .
until then , emergency aid in affected regions is going to continue along with german support .
due to the small presence of foreign aid organizations up to now , they can not fall back on existing structures and contacts and thus progress takes longer here .
but transition from measures such as organizing food , medicine or housing to reconstruction is fluid .
" especially with a catastrophe of such huge dimensions , reconstruction is a continuing process , " stehling said . klaudia prevezanos -lrb- bm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new alliance appeals for long-term aid the german government has promised € 500 million in aid for countries affected by the tsunami - a good sign that more long-term development aid is possible , say five german organisations who 've launched a joint appeal .

this year 's festival is no exception , having provided breakthrough moments for several new homegrown stars . julia jentsch , actress the undisputed new star to emerge from the berlinale is berlin-born actress julia jentsch , 26 .
her convincing portrayal of anti-nazi resistance heroine sophie scholl in the competition film " sophie scholl - the final days " went over well with both critics and audiences alike .
jentsch 's face is now gracing the covers of german magazines , meaning her days of going unrecognized are coming to an end .
jentsch previously appeared in " the edukators , " a film about a group of young people who break into the homes of the wealthy not to steal , but to send them a message about social injustice .
jentsch has been a member of the munich kammerspiel theatre ensemble since 2001 .
at a berlinale press conference , jentsch said she would be returning to the stage and had no plans to make another film .

festival director dieter kosslick said hummer 's portrayal of a young woman the film 's protagonist believes is her lost daughter could make her " a very big star in europe or worldwide . "
but that will depend very much on which of her ambitions hummer decides to pursue .
she is also a dedicated musician with an album and negotiations with record labels in the works .
hummer 's previous film credits include the coming-of-age story " crazy , " and another film by petzold , " the state i am in " -lrb- die innere sicherheit -rrb- . hannes stöhr , director bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannes stöhr " one day in europe " has been described as " delightful " and " refreshing , " and has earned its director , hannes stöhr , 35 , accolades that are just as positive .
not bad , considering " europe " is only his second feature-length film , following on 2001 's " berlin is in germany . "
the film is made up of four episodes told in four european cities and seven different languages .
the thing that holds them together is a fictional european champions league soccer match played in moscow between spanish and turkish teams .
" soccer , whether you like the game or not , is something that connects all the cultures of europe , " said stöhr , who also wrote the film 's screenplay .
the story was a natural for stöhr , who lives in berlin , but has also spent parts of his life in moscow and istanbul , and who speaks english , german , spanish and french . max riemelt , actor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max riemelt in " napola " from constantin film it does n't get any more official than actually being named a shooting star 2005 , but that 's exactly what happened to young german actor max riemelt , 21 .

riemelt first achieved teen-idol fame in germany with the film " mädchen , mädchen ! "

the remaining € 450 million are meant to aid reconstruction in indonesia and sri lanka , the two worst-hit states in the tsunami . according to the bmz , it 's still difficult to foresee whether the duration of reconstruction there will take five years or less . more specifically , the extra long term aid money is going to be administered by the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- , which receives most of its assignments from the bmz , and the state-owned bank for reconstruction -lrb- kfw -rrb- .
both institutions operate development projects in particular countries and according to bethe they will handle projects in the tsunami-struck region on behalf of the bmz .
local know-how important employees of both the gtz and kfw however depend on local and regional expertise and organization on the ground .
" they can be local councils , non-governmental organizations or companies , " said hans stehling of the gtz .
the cooperation in turn provides employment opportunities for devastated communities .
for instance , the building of new schools or repairing fishing boats is often commissioned out to local carpentry companies .
in sri lanka , emergency relief has already translated into long-term reconstruction .
the gtz was present in the country with various projects long before the indian ocean tragedy struck , thus enabling it to react swiftly to the disaster .
on sunday , german development minster heidemarie wieczorek-zeul is expected in the region .
according to bmz 's bethe , the sri lankan government has already drawn up the first reconstruction plans which are now being approved by the donor nations .
it definitely sounds like more than just empty promises from germany 's government .
" we 've already proposed various projects for reconstruction .
now , we 're waiting for contracts from the bmz , " said stehling .
he 's counting on a quick decision from the ministry .
however , nobody 's talking of concrete dates or funds as yet .
germany 's ministry for economic development and cooperation skirts all questions regarding who is going to do what by saying that it 's dependant on the governments of the affected countries to react to offers of aid .
in indonesia , progress takes a little longer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's government is planing to present its masterplan for reconstruction on march 26 , three months after the tsunami hit the country .
until then , emergency aid in affected regions is going to continue along with german support .
due to the small presence of foreign aid organizations up to now , they can not fall back on existing structures and contacts and thus progress takes longer here .
but transition from measures such as organizing food , medicine or housing to reconstruction is fluid .

not in dortmund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happier times : dortmund fans celebrate their 2002 championship fans of the dortmund soccer club bvb borrusia are distraught .
the storied team with one of the most loyal followings in the world is on the edge of a financial collapse that threatens its existence . a full 80,000 fans can fit into westfalen stadium , the cavernous temple to the dortmund soccer club bvb borussia 09 - and do so every home game .
the fan bloc , which during games is a sea of black and yellow banners and flags , is made up of 27,000 people each game - all of them standing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's westfalen stadium is one of the sites of the 2006 world cup so when dortmund fans are mad , it 's best to listen .
and they have never been more upset .
the problem " rage , fear and bewilderment , " read a newspaper headline in dortmund this week .
in four years , the bvb would have celebrated its 100th anniversary .
now , there is serious doubt the club can even make it to the next season .
borussia has run up a debt of € 142.1 million -lrb- $ 185.74 million -rrb- over the past few seasons , an equivalent of 79 percent of its capital .
just a few seasons ago , the club made headlines by winning the bundelisga title , competing regularly in european tournaments , and being the first german club to go on the stock exchange .
today , borrusia and its team of highly-paid stars is struggling up the bundesliga table .
the stock has plunged more than 25 percent .
the targets " the anger is massive and the fear is just as big , " one fan told dw-radio .
" i do n't know where it will go from here .
i also do n't think these people will be able to get the club out of danger . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebaum -lrb- l . -rrb- left one week ago - but meier will stay on , despite what fans think " these people " are gerd niebaum and michael meier .
niebaum stepped down one week ago as president of the club .
meier remains in office and has had to face down a battery of cameras and microphones , not to mention irate fans in recent weeks as news of dortmund 's miserable economic situation spread .
on feb .
12 , 1,000 fans marched in dortmund behind a massive banner that read " not for sale : put an end to the lies and intrigue ! "
they accused meier of mismanagement and spending too much money on players who did n't deliver as promised .
they demanded meier correct the club 's miserable accounting and then resign .
" bvb brought a smile to my face " the anger , and the sheer numbers taking to the streets illustrate the importance of the soccer club to the ruhr valley city .
once a center for steel and coal mining , dortmund 's fortunes have sunk as companies have either gone bankrupt or pulled up stakes to move eastwards , where labor is cheaper .
for many of the workers , the soccer team was their weekend distraction .
for the growing list of unemployed and their families , the team is nowadays their only distraction .
bildunterschrift : fans protest on feb .
12 " the bvb is the only place where i can get away from all the worries and problems of daily life , " wrote one fan on a bvb fan chat room www.schwatzgelb.de.
other fans responded with similar stories and feelings and the site was soon covered with messages .
only thing left is hope " i had a difficult time as a youth and i was able to get through it with the bvb , " wrote another fan .
" the bvb brought a smile to my face when i actually should have been crying . "
along with the sadness , there were many messages calling for support and confidence in their beloved soccer club .
dortmund 's mayor said he was sure a proposed restructuring plan that includes deferring rental payments for its € 17 million a year stadium and a drastically-reduced player budget would work .
the team is the " heart and soul of the city , " mayor gerhard langemeyer told the news agency dpa .
" it 's not possible to imagine this city without the bvb .

dortmund 's defense left the dutch striker entirely too much space in the beginning of the game and paid dearly for it .
makaay kept the 53,000 home team fans riveted by scoring a pair of goals himself and assisting in tow more during the game 's first 45 minutes .
in the second half he put in one more to seal a personal hat trick and his team 's highest win of the season .
bayern had something to prove bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hasan salihamidzic , center , celebrates with teammates roy makkay , left , and mehmet scholl , after scoring " after the loss in bielefeld we had some matter to take care of and the team knew it , " said bayern munich trainer felix magath .
" we were lucky that we got a goal early and could pile on another one a little bit later . "
it was hasan salihamidzic who opened scoring in the fifth minute , and makaay put in his first of three exceptional goals just one minute later .

even a locker room talk could n't bring dortmund back to life and makaay ended the scoring by putting a shot between dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller 's legs in the 54th minute , giving bayern munich its third home win in a row .

the disastrous defeat thus capped what has already been a distressing week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the brink of bankruptcy , a thrashing in munich added insult to borussia dortmund 's financial injury " we were not confident , " said dortmund coach van marwijk .

the win means bayern will stay in first place atop the bundesliga table , by how many points will remain unclear until 2nd-placed schalke 04 play against borussia mönchengladbach sunday afternoon .
munich started the game without german national team captain michael ballack and also let torsten frings and owen hargreaves have a break before this week 's champions league match against arsenal london .

what do you think will come of this visit ?
how will the europeans welcome the american president ? javier solana : i think the visit has every prospect of being a success .
i think the current climate and atmosphere are much better than they were a couple of years , or even a couple of months ago .
there was some dissonance in 2003 and 2004 , especially over iraq .
but we have overcome our differences now .
that 's why i think the decision by president bush and his new secretary of state to choose europe as the place to make their first overseas visits since the new presidential term started is a very positive gesture . there 's a debate currently over what role nato should play in future relations between the europeans and the us .
a whole series of suggestions have been put forward on ways to improve the way we work together .
what is your view on this debate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i believe that everything that contributes toward making transatlantic relations more effective is good . every debate in this direction is positive .
i think that everyone accepts that transatlantic relations are no longer dealt with exclusively within the framework of nato , but to a large degree also within eu institutions .
this was very clearly highlighted by the many hours that secretary condoleezza rice spent at the european union .
and now president bush is coming to exchange views with leading european figures on the problems which exist between the eu and nato .
i believe this is positive and expresses the importance of the role of the european union in transatlantic relations , and the common desire for europeans and americans to work together . despite all the conflicts going on in the world , there have been significant advances made , for example in the middle east .
how realistic is the hope for peace between israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana , left , and peter hansen , commissioner general of the united nations relief and works agency -lrb- unrwa -rrb- , inspect damage of a destroyed kindergarden during their tour in the norther gaza strip town of beit lahiya , wednesday jan .
12 , 2005 .
i have been involved in the middle east peace process for many years , but now for the first time i am very optimistic and i can see great opportunities .
there is a path that both israelis and palestinians must tread together , accompanied by their friends .
both we europeans and the americans are their friends , and i believe we can join them on this path .
but it wo n't be easy .
there will be high and low points , and good times and bad .
the most important thing is that we remain committed and show good will . i think that president abbas is doing a good job , from the way the palestinian election was run to what he 's doing now .
and prime minister sharon has also made good decisions , like relaxing the restrictions on palestinians so that people can enjoy a better standard of life , and the decision to remove settlements from the gaza strip .
but i am well aware of the pitfalls .
we have to keep our eyes open and be clear about our obligations .
as i have said before , we have to be committed to providing help because there will be innumerable difficulties . what can the european union do to help abbas end terrorism and to support the move towards peace ? the best that we can do to help him is to strengthen and train his police force .
and that 's what we 're doing now .
there 's a team already working with the palestinian security forces to help them function in the most efficient and effective way possible .
that 's important , but the political will to end terrorist activities is more important .
president abbas has made very clear statements on this and has acted accordingly . that must be recognized by the international community as well as by israel . the european union is also in negotiations to persuade iran not to build nuclear weapons .
can we expect success there as well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in bushehr , iran , 750 miles -lrb- 1,200 kilometers -rrb- southwest of tehran .
we made considerable progress in the last few months .
iran has signed an additional protocol which allows inspectors from the international atomic energy authority to visit sites across the country without giving prior notification .
that means the iaea can carry out a control function in iran . the negotiations are being conducted on three levels at the same time : we 're dealing with the nuclear arms issue , security aspects for iran , and trade and economic relations between iran and the eu .
we hope that we will continue to make progress . does this mean that these subjects will be decided bilaterally between the iranian government and the europeans , or will the americans have a say in the negotiations ? i think that the united states is not interested in joining the negotiations at this point in time .
they can support them from the sidelines .
as you know , the us has no diplomatic relations with iran , and for this reason it is more difficult for them .
in any case , if all goes well , the results will be seen in vienna at the international atomic energy agency .
any agreement reached with iran will have to be ratified by the iaea board of governors , which is elected by nations in the iaea , who are all members of the united nations , can we now say that relations between the us and europe are close and that there 's been no break in the dialogue with the us ?
is there agreement on how to implement common political strategies ? yes , i think so .
that follows on from what i said about the talks that we have held in the past few months .
and i hope this will be underlined by president bush and the leading political figures of the european union . is there hope of an agreement , for example on the subject of china and the decision by the european union to lift the weapons embargo on beijing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao , left , smiles as former eu commission president romano prodi gestures during a media conference at the eu commission building in brussels , thursday , may 6 , 2004 .
all issues that we are in the process of negotiating are both difficult and delicate .
even so , i 'm convinced that we can reach agreement .
as far as china is concerned , i would like to emphasize that it is not about selling more weapons to china ; rather it concerns the lifting of sanctions that the eu imposed on china during the tiananmen square crisis .
since then , many years have gone by and much has happened .
a new generation is in charge in china now and we want to forge new relations which are not overshadowed by sanctions .
for this reason , the lifting of the weapons embargo will be a political rather than a military gesture . the interview was conducted by gonzalo cáceres send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush , europe set to mend fences ahead of us president george w. bush 's highly-anticipated visit to europe , both sides are all smiles .

our financial problems are not an alibi . "
the win means bayern will stay in first place atop the bundesliga table , by how many points will remain unclear until 2nd-placed schalke 04 play against borussia mönchengladbach sunday afternoon .
munich started the game without german national team captain michael ballack and also let torsten frings and owen hargreaves have a break before this week 's champions league match against arsenal london .

what do you think will come of this visit ?
how will the europeans welcome the american president ? javier solana : i think the visit has every prospect of being a success .
i think the current climate and atmosphere are much better than they were a couple of years , or even a couple of months ago .
there was some dissonance in 2003 and 2004 , especially over iraq .
but we have overcome our differences now .
that 's why i think the decision by president bush and his new secretary of state to choose europe as the place to make their first overseas visits since the new presidential term started is a very positive gesture . there 's a debate currently over what role nato should play in future relations between the europeans and the us .
a whole series of suggestions have been put forward on ways to improve the way we work together .
what is your view on this debate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i believe that everything that contributes toward making transatlantic relations more effective is good . every debate in this direction is positive .
i think that everyone accepts that transatlantic relations are no longer dealt with exclusively within the framework of nato , but to a large degree also within eu institutions .
this was very clearly highlighted by the many hours that secretary condoleezza rice spent at the european union .
and now president bush is coming to exchange views with leading european figures on the problems which exist between the eu and nato .
i believe this is positive and expresses the importance of the role of the european union in transatlantic relations , and the common desire for europeans and americans to work together . despite all the conflicts going on in the world , there have been significant advances made , for example in the middle east .
how realistic is the hope for peace between israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana , left , and peter hansen , commissioner general of the united nations relief and works agency -lrb- unrwa -rrb- , inspect damage of a destroyed kindergarden during their tour in the norther gaza strip town of beit lahiya , wednesday jan .
12 , 2005 .
i have been involved in the middle east peace process for many years , but now for the first time i am very optimistic and i can see great opportunities .
there is a path that both israelis and palestinians must tread together , accompanied by their friends .
both we europeans and the americans are their friends , and i believe we can join them on this path .
but it wo n't be easy .
there will be high and low points , and good times and bad .
the most important thing is that we remain committed and show good will . i think that president abbas is doing a good job , from the way the palestinian election was run to what he 's doing now .
and prime minister sharon has also made good decisions , like relaxing the restrictions on palestinians so that people can enjoy a better standard of life , and the decision to remove settlements from the gaza strip .
but i am well aware of the pitfalls .
we have to keep our eyes open and be clear about our obligations .
as i have said before , we have to be committed to providing help because there will be innumerable difficulties . what can the european union do to help abbas end terrorism and to support the move towards peace ? the best that we can do to help him is to strengthen and train his police force .
and that 's what we 're doing now .
there 's a team already working with the palestinian security forces to help them function in the most efficient and effective way possible .
that 's important , but the political will to end terrorist activities is more important .
president abbas has made very clear statements on this and has acted accordingly . that must be recognized by the international community as well as by israel . the european union is also in negotiations to persuade iran not to build nuclear weapons .
can we expect success there as well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in bushehr , iran , 750 miles -lrb- 1,200 kilometers -rrb- southwest of tehran .
we made considerable progress in the last few months .
iran has signed an additional protocol which allows inspectors from the international atomic energy authority to visit sites across the country without giving prior notification .
that means the iaea can carry out a control function in iran . the negotiations are being conducted on three levels at the same time : we 're dealing with the nuclear arms issue , security aspects for iran , and trade and economic relations between iran and the eu .
we hope that we will continue to make progress . does this mean that these subjects will be decided bilaterally between the iranian government and the europeans , or will the americans have a say in the negotiations ? i think that the united states is not interested in joining the negotiations at this point in time .
they can support them from the sidelines .
as you know , the us has no diplomatic relations with iran , and for this reason it is more difficult for them .
in any case , if all goes well , the results will be seen in vienna at the international atomic energy agency .
any agreement reached with iran will have to be ratified by the iaea board of governors , which is elected by nations in the iaea , who are all members of the united nations , can we now say that relations between the us and europe are close and that there 's been no break in the dialogue with the us ?
is there agreement on how to implement common political strategies ? yes , i think so .
that follows on from what i said about the talks that we have held in the past few months .
and i hope this will be underlined by president bush and the leading political figures of the european union . is there hope of an agreement , for example on the subject of china and the decision by the european union to lift the weapons embargo on beijing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao , left , smiles as former eu commission president romano prodi gestures during a media conference at the eu commission building in brussels , thursday , may 6 , 2004 .
all issues that we are in the process of negotiating are both difficult and delicate .
even so , i 'm convinced that we can reach agreement .
as far as china is concerned , i would like to emphasize that it is not about selling more weapons to china ; rather it concerns the lifting of sanctions that the eu imposed on china during the tiananmen square crisis .
since then , many years have gone by and much has happened .
a new generation is in charge in china now and we want to forge new relations which are not overshadowed by sanctions .
for this reason , the lifting of the weapons embargo will be a political rather than a military gesture . the interview was conducted by gonzalo cáceres send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush , europe set to mend fences ahead of us president george w. bush 's highly-anticipated visit to europe , both sides are all smiles .

what do you think will come of this visit ?
how will the europeans welcome the american president ? javier solana : i think the visit has every prospect of being a success .
i think the current climate and atmosphere are much better than they were a couple of years , or even a couple of months ago .
there was some dissonance in 2003 and 2004 , especially over iraq .
but we have overcome our differences now .
that 's why i think the decision by president bush and his new secretary of state to choose europe as the place to make their first overseas visits since the new presidential term started is a very positive gesture . there 's a debate currently over what role nato should play in future relations between the europeans and the us .
a whole series of suggestions have been put forward on ways to improve the way we work together .
what is your view on this debate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i believe that everything that contributes toward making transatlantic relations more effective is good . every debate in this direction is positive .
i think that everyone accepts that transatlantic relations are no longer dealt with exclusively within the framework of nato , but to a large degree also within eu institutions .
this was very clearly highlighted by the many hours that secretary condoleezza rice spent at the european union .
and now president bush is coming to exchange views with leading european figures on the problems which exist between the eu and nato .
i believe this is positive and expresses the importance of the role of the european union in transatlantic relations , and the common desire for europeans and americans to work together . despite all the conflicts going on in the world , there have been significant advances made , for example in the middle east .
how realistic is the hope for peace between israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana , left , and peter hansen , commissioner general of the united nations relief and works agency -lrb- unrwa -rrb- , inspect damage of a destroyed kindergarden during their tour in the norther gaza strip town of beit lahiya , wednesday jan .
12 , 2005 .
i have been involved in the middle east peace process for many years , but now for the first time i am very optimistic and i can see great opportunities .
there is a path that both israelis and palestinians must tread together , accompanied by their friends .
both we europeans and the americans are their friends , and i believe we can join them on this path .
but it wo n't be easy .
there will be high and low points , and good times and bad .
the most important thing is that we remain committed and show good will . i think that president abbas is doing a good job , from the way the palestinian election was run to what he 's doing now .
and prime minister sharon has also made good decisions , like relaxing the restrictions on palestinians so that people can enjoy a better standard of life , and the decision to remove settlements from the gaza strip .
but i am well aware of the pitfalls .
we have to keep our eyes open and be clear about our obligations .
as i have said before , we have to be committed to providing help because there will be innumerable difficulties . what can the european union do to help abbas end terrorism and to support the move towards peace ? the best that we can do to help him is to strengthen and train his police force .
and that 's what we 're doing now .
there 's a team already working with the palestinian security forces to help them function in the most efficient and effective way possible .
that 's important , but the political will to end terrorist activities is more important .
president abbas has made very clear statements on this and has acted accordingly . that must be recognized by the international community as well as by israel . the european union is also in negotiations to persuade iran not to build nuclear weapons .
can we expect success there as well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in bushehr , iran , 750 miles -lrb- 1,200 kilometers -rrb- southwest of tehran .
we made considerable progress in the last few months .
iran has signed an additional protocol which allows inspectors from the international atomic energy authority to visit sites across the country without giving prior notification .
that means the iaea can carry out a control function in iran . the negotiations are being conducted on three levels at the same time : we 're dealing with the nuclear arms issue , security aspects for iran , and trade and economic relations between iran and the eu .
we hope that we will continue to make progress . does this mean that these subjects will be decided bilaterally between the iranian government and the europeans , or will the americans have a say in the negotiations ? i think that the united states is not interested in joining the negotiations at this point in time .
they can support them from the sidelines .
as you know , the us has no diplomatic relations with iran , and for this reason it is more difficult for them .
in any case , if all goes well , the results will be seen in vienna at the international atomic energy agency .
any agreement reached with iran will have to be ratified by the iaea board of governors , which is elected by nations in the iaea , who are all members of the united nations , can we now say that relations between the us and europe are close and that there 's been no break in the dialogue with the us ?
is there agreement on how to implement common political strategies ? yes , i think so .
that follows on from what i said about the talks that we have held in the past few months .
and i hope this will be underlined by president bush and the leading political figures of the european union . is there hope of an agreement , for example on the subject of china and the decision by the european union to lift the weapons embargo on beijing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao , left , smiles as former eu commission president romano prodi gestures during a media conference at the eu commission building in brussels , thursday , may 6 , 2004 .
all issues that we are in the process of negotiating are both difficult and delicate .
even so , i 'm convinced that we can reach agreement .
as far as china is concerned , i would like to emphasize that it is not about selling more weapons to china ; rather it concerns the lifting of sanctions that the eu imposed on china during the tiananmen square crisis .
since then , many years have gone by and much has happened .
a new generation is in charge in china now and we want to forge new relations which are not overshadowed by sanctions .
for this reason , the lifting of the weapons embargo will be a political rather than a military gesture . the interview was conducted by gonzalo cáceres send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush , europe set to mend fences ahead of us president george w. bush 's highly-anticipated visit to europe , both sides are all smiles .

dortmund 's defense left the dutch striker entirely too much space in the beginning of the game and paid dearly for it .
makaay kept the 53,000 home team fans riveted by scoring a pair of goals himself and assisting in tow more during the game 's first 45 minutes .
in the second half he put in one more to seal a personal hat trick and his team 's highest win of the season .
bayern had something to prove bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hasan salihamidzic , center , celebrates with teammates roy makkay , left , and mehmet scholl , after scoring " after the loss in bielefeld we had some matter to take care of and the team knew it , " said bayern munich trainer felix magath .
" we were lucky that we got a goal early and could pile on another one a little bit later . "
it was hasan salihamidzic who opened scoring in the fifth minute , and makaay put in his first of three exceptional goals just one minute later .
the two quick goals gave dortmund a shock they never recovered from .
bert van marwijk watched his bvb squad 's defense fall apart time after time while his strikers never worked their way into a truly dangerous position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich flew away with the win at home against dortmund dortmund goalkeeper roman weidenfeller inexplicably allowed makaay 's tame shot to squirm under his body in the game 's 34th minute , but was helpless earlier in the 28th minute when claudio pizarro volleyed home .
even a locker room talk could n't bring dortmund back to life and makaay ended the scoring by putting a shot between dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller 's legs in the 54th minute , giving bayern munich its third home win in a row .
bankruptcy not an excuse for borussia dortmund , the crushing loss moved what until now was only a financial crisis to the playing field .
on thursday the team announced they were on the edge of bankruptcy .
the disastrous defeat thus capped what has already been a distressing week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the brink of bankruptcy , a thrashing in munich added insult to borussia dortmund 's financial injury " we were not confident , " said dortmund coach van marwijk .
" we were not in the game for a moment after falling behind early .
our financial problems are not an alibi . "
the win means bayern will stay in first place atop the bundesliga table , by how many points will remain unclear until 2nd-placed schalke 04 play against borussia mönchengladbach sunday afternoon .
munich started the game without german national team captain michael ballack and also let torsten frings and owen hargreaves have a break before this week 's champions league match against arsenal london .
salihamidzic and martin demichelis took the starters ' places in midfield and , along with mehmet scholl , proved they are capable of playing reliably for the german league 's top team . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de life after soccer ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.02.2005 eu chief keen to seek unity with us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiss and make up : solana , left , was welcoming to condoleeza rice on the eve of president bush 's europe visit , the eu 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , told deutsche welle that the us and europe were ready to bury past rifts and cooperate on divisive issues . deutsche welle : mr. solana , us president george w. bush is traveling to europe this coming week .
what do you think will come of this visit ?
how will the europeans welcome the american president ? javier solana : i think the visit has every prospect of being a success .
i think the current climate and atmosphere are much better than they were a couple of years , or even a couple of months ago .
there was some dissonance in 2003 and 2004 , especially over iraq .
but we have overcome our differences now .
that 's why i think the decision by president bush and his new secretary of state to choose europe as the place to make their first overseas visits since the new presidential term started is a very positive gesture . there 's a debate currently over what role nato should play in future relations between the europeans and the us .
a whole series of suggestions have been put forward on ways to improve the way we work together .
what is your view on this debate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i believe that everything that contributes toward making transatlantic relations more effective is good . every debate in this direction is positive .
i think that everyone accepts that transatlantic relations are no longer dealt with exclusively within the framework of nato , but to a large degree also within eu institutions .
this was very clearly highlighted by the many hours that secretary condoleezza rice spent at the european union .
and now president bush is coming to exchange views with leading european figures on the problems which exist between the eu and nato .
i believe this is positive and expresses the importance of the role of the european union in transatlantic relations , and the common desire for europeans and americans to work together . despite all the conflicts going on in the world , there have been significant advances made , for example in the middle east .
how realistic is the hope for peace between israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana , left , and peter hansen , commissioner general of the united nations relief and works agency -lrb- unrwa -rrb- , inspect damage of a destroyed kindergarden during their tour in the norther gaza strip town of beit lahiya , wednesday jan .
12 , 2005 .
i have been involved in the middle east peace process for many years , but now for the first time i am very optimistic and i can see great opportunities .
there is a path that both israelis and palestinians must tread together , accompanied by their friends .
both we europeans and the americans are their friends , and i believe we can join them on this path .
but it wo n't be easy .
there will be high and low points , and good times and bad .
the most important thing is that we remain committed and show good will . i think that president abbas is doing a good job , from the way the palestinian election was run to what he 's doing now .
and prime minister sharon has also made good decisions , like relaxing the restrictions on palestinians so that people can enjoy a better standard of life , and the decision to remove settlements from the gaza strip .
but i am well aware of the pitfalls .
we have to keep our eyes open and be clear about our obligations .
as i have said before , we have to be committed to providing help because there will be innumerable difficulties . what can the european union do to help abbas end terrorism and to support the move towards peace ? the best that we can do to help him is to strengthen and train his police force .
and that 's what we 're doing now .
there 's a team already working with the palestinian security forces to help them function in the most efficient and effective way possible .
that 's important , but the political will to end terrorist activities is more important .
president abbas has made very clear statements on this and has acted accordingly . that must be recognized by the international community as well as by israel . the european union is also in negotiations to persuade iran not to build nuclear weapons .
can we expect success there as well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in bushehr , iran , 750 miles -lrb- 1,200 kilometers -rrb- southwest of tehran .
we made considerable progress in the last few months .
iran has signed an additional protocol which allows inspectors from the international atomic energy authority to visit sites across the country without giving prior notification .
that means the iaea can carry out a control function in iran . the negotiations are being conducted on three levels at the same time : we 're dealing with the nuclear arms issue , security aspects for iran , and trade and economic relations between iran and the eu .
we hope that we will continue to make progress . does this mean that these subjects will be decided bilaterally between the iranian government and the europeans , or will the americans have a say in the negotiations ? i think that the united states is not interested in joining the negotiations at this point in time .
they can support them from the sidelines .
as you know , the us has no diplomatic relations with iran , and for this reason it is more difficult for them .
in any case , if all goes well , the results will be seen in vienna at the international atomic energy agency .
any agreement reached with iran will have to be ratified by the iaea board of governors , which is elected by nations in the iaea , who are all members of the united nations , can we now say that relations between the us and europe are close and that there 's been no break in the dialogue with the us ?
is there agreement on how to implement common political strategies ? yes , i think so .
that follows on from what i said about the talks that we have held in the past few months .
and i hope this will be underlined by president bush and the leading political figures of the european union . is there hope of an agreement , for example on the subject of china and the decision by the european union to lift the weapons embargo on beijing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao , left , smiles as former eu commission president romano prodi gestures during a media conference at the eu commission building in brussels , thursday , may 6 , 2004 .
all issues that we are in the process of negotiating are both difficult and delicate .
even so , i 'm convinced that we can reach agreement .
as far as china is concerned , i would like to emphasize that it is not about selling more weapons to china ; rather it concerns the lifting of sanctions that the eu imposed on china during the tiananmen square crisis .
since then , many years have gone by and much has happened .
a new generation is in charge in china now and we want to forge new relations which are not overshadowed by sanctions .
for this reason , the lifting of the weapons embargo will be a political rather than a military gesture . the interview was conducted by gonzalo cáceres send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush , europe set to mend fences ahead of us president george w. bush 's highly-anticipated visit to europe , both sides are all smiles .

dortmund 's defense left the dutch striker entirely too much space in the beginning of the game and paid dearly for it .

but , how exactly is the money going to be distributed ? emergency aid began pouring in from all corners of the world right after the tidal wave hit on dec .
26 , 2004 and efforts to provide devastated areas with basis supplies are still underway . reconstruction however needs more time .
" it 's not possible to spread € 500 million over five years yet , " stephan bethe of the german federal ministry for economic development and cooperation -lrb- bmz -rrb- said and pointed out that the affected countries and donor nations first have to come to an agreement about what is needed and who is going to provide for it .
" reconstruction is a long process " , bethe said , adding that the right choices have to be made in rebuilding infrastructure like schools , hospitals , streets or energy and water supplies . in addition , the people have to be helped back to a position where they can earn a living on their own again .
where does the extra money go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bmz budget for 2005 amounts to € 3.8 billion , the same as last year . the € 500 million in tsunami aid money pledged by the german government comes on top of the development funds . berlin is also chanelling € 50 million from the tsunami aid funds into a un emergency relief fund .
the remaining € 450 million are meant to aid reconstruction in indonesia and sri lanka , the two worst-hit states in the tsunami . according to the bmz , it 's still difficult to foresee whether the duration of reconstruction there will take five years or less . more specifically , the extra long term aid money is going to be administered by the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- , which receives most of its assignments from the bmz , and the state-owned bank for reconstruction -lrb- kfw -rrb- .
both institutions operate development projects in particular countries and according to bethe they will handle projects in the tsunami-struck region on behalf of the bmz .
local know-how important employees of both the gtz and kfw however depend on local and regional expertise and organization on the ground .
" they can be local councils , non-governmental organizations or companies , " said hans stehling of the gtz .
the cooperation in turn provides employment opportunities for devastated communities .
for instance , the building of new schools or repairing fishing boats is often commissioned out to local carpentry companies .
in sri lanka , emergency relief has already translated into long-term reconstruction .
the gtz was present in the country with various projects long before the indian ocean tragedy struck , thus enabling it to react swiftly to the disaster .
on sunday , german development minster heidemarie wieczorek-zeul is expected in the region .
according to bmz 's bethe , the sri lankan government has already drawn up the first reconstruction plans which are now being approved by the donor nations .
it definitely sounds like more than just empty promises from germany 's government .
" we 've already proposed various projects for reconstruction .
now , we 're waiting for contracts from the bmz , " said stehling .
he 's counting on a quick decision from the ministry .
however , nobody 's talking of concrete dates or funds as yet .
germany 's ministry for economic development and cooperation skirts all questions regarding who is going to do what by saying that it 's dependant on the governments of the affected countries to react to offers of aid .
in indonesia , progress takes a little longer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's government is planing to present its masterplan for reconstruction on march 26 , three months after the tsunami hit the country .
until then , emergency aid in affected regions is going to continue along with german support .
due to the small presence of foreign aid organizations up to now , they can not fall back on existing structures and contacts and thus progress takes longer here .
but transition from measures such as organizing food , medicine or housing to reconstruction is fluid .

what do you think will come of this visit ?
how will the europeans welcome the american president ? javier solana : i think the visit has every prospect of being a success .
i think the current climate and atmosphere are much better than they were a couple of years , or even a couple of months ago .
there was some dissonance in 2003 and 2004 , especially over iraq .
but we have overcome our differences now .
that 's why i think the decision by president bush and his new secretary of state to choose europe as the place to make their first overseas visits since the new presidential term started is a very positive gesture . there 's a debate currently over what role nato should play in future relations between the europeans and the us .
a whole series of suggestions have been put forward on ways to improve the way we work together .
what is your view on this debate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i believe that everything that contributes toward making transatlantic relations more effective is good . every debate in this direction is positive .
i think that everyone accepts that transatlantic relations are no longer dealt with exclusively within the framework of nato , but to a large degree also within eu institutions .
this was very clearly highlighted by the many hours that secretary condoleezza rice spent at the european union .
and now president bush is coming to exchange views with leading european figures on the problems which exist between the eu and nato .
i believe this is positive and expresses the importance of the role of the european union in transatlantic relations , and the common desire for europeans and americans to work together . despite all the conflicts going on in the world , there have been significant advances made , for example in the middle east .
how realistic is the hope for peace between israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana , left , and peter hansen , commissioner general of the united nations relief and works agency -lrb- unrwa -rrb- , inspect damage of a destroyed kindergarden during their tour in the norther gaza strip town of beit lahiya , wednesday jan .
12 , 2005 .
i have been involved in the middle east peace process for many years , but now for the first time i am very optimistic and i can see great opportunities .
there is a path that both israelis and palestinians must tread together , accompanied by their friends .
both we europeans and the americans are their friends , and i believe we can join them on this path .
but it wo n't be easy .
there will be high and low points , and good times and bad .
the most important thing is that we remain committed and show good will . i think that president abbas is doing a good job , from the way the palestinian election was run to what he 's doing now .
and prime minister sharon has also made good decisions , like relaxing the restrictions on palestinians so that people can enjoy a better standard of life , and the decision to remove settlements from the gaza strip .
but i am well aware of the pitfalls .
we have to keep our eyes open and be clear about our obligations .
as i have said before , we have to be committed to providing help because there will be innumerable difficulties . what can the european union do to help abbas end terrorism and to support the move towards peace ? the best that we can do to help him is to strengthen and train his police force .
and that 's what we 're doing now .
there 's a team already working with the palestinian security forces to help them function in the most efficient and effective way possible .
that 's important , but the political will to end terrorist activities is more important .
president abbas has made very clear statements on this and has acted accordingly . that must be recognized by the international community as well as by israel . the european union is also in negotiations to persuade iran not to build nuclear weapons .
can we expect success there as well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in bushehr , iran , 750 miles -lrb- 1,200 kilometers -rrb- southwest of tehran .
we made considerable progress in the last few months .
iran has signed an additional protocol which allows inspectors from the international atomic energy authority to visit sites across the country without giving prior notification .
that means the iaea can carry out a control function in iran . the negotiations are being conducted on three levels at the same time : we 're dealing with the nuclear arms issue , security aspects for iran , and trade and economic relations between iran and the eu .
we hope that we will continue to make progress . does this mean that these subjects will be decided bilaterally between the iranian government and the europeans , or will the americans have a say in the negotiations ? i think that the united states is not interested in joining the negotiations at this point in time .
they can support them from the sidelines .
as you know , the us has no diplomatic relations with iran , and for this reason it is more difficult for them .
in any case , if all goes well , the results will be seen in vienna at the international atomic energy agency .
any agreement reached with iran will have to be ratified by the iaea board of governors , which is elected by nations in the iaea , who are all members of the united nations , can we now say that relations between the us and europe are close and that there 's been no break in the dialogue with the us ?
is there agreement on how to implement common political strategies ? yes , i think so .
that follows on from what i said about the talks that we have held in the past few months .
and i hope this will be underlined by president bush and the leading political figures of the european union . is there hope of an agreement , for example on the subject of china and the decision by the european union to lift the weapons embargo on beijing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao , left , smiles as former eu commission president romano prodi gestures during a media conference at the eu commission building in brussels , thursday , may 6 , 2004 .
all issues that we are in the process of negotiating are both difficult and delicate .
even so , i 'm convinced that we can reach agreement .
as far as china is concerned , i would like to emphasize that it is not about selling more weapons to china ; rather it concerns the lifting of sanctions that the eu imposed on china during the tiananmen square crisis .
since then , many years have gone by and much has happened .
a new generation is in charge in china now and we want to forge new relations which are not overshadowed by sanctions .
for this reason , the lifting of the weapons embargo will be a political rather than a military gesture . the interview was conducted by gonzalo cáceres send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush , europe set to mend fences ahead of us president george w. bush 's highly-anticipated visit to europe , both sides are all smiles .

" it 's not possible to spread € 500 million over five years yet , " stephan bethe of the german federal ministry for economic development and cooperation -lrb- bmz -rrb- said and pointed out that the affected countries and donor nations first have to come to an agreement about what is needed and who is going to provide for it .
" reconstruction is a long process " , bethe said , adding that the right choices have to be made in rebuilding infrastructure like schools , hospitals , streets or energy and water supplies . in addition , the people have to be helped back to a position where they can earn a living on their own again .
where does the extra money go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bmz budget for 2005 amounts to € 3.8 billion , the same as last year . the € 500 million in tsunami aid money pledged by the german government comes on top of the development funds . berlin is also chanelling € 50 million from the tsunami aid funds into a un emergency relief fund .
the remaining € 450 million are meant to aid reconstruction in indonesia and sri lanka , the two worst-hit states in the tsunami . according to the bmz , it 's still difficult to foresee whether the duration of reconstruction there will take five years or less . more specifically , the extra long term aid money is going to be administered by the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- , which receives most of its assignments from the bmz , and the state-owned bank for reconstruction -lrb- kfw -rrb- .

" america needs europe and europe needs america and by working together we can make the world a better one , " jose manuel barroso , the president of the european commission , said in a statement on friday .
bush was similarly agreeable in an interview he gave to germany 's ard television before his trip .
in his comments , he confirmed europe and germany 's importance in the international community , and their importance to america .
" europe is extremely important for america and germany is extremely important for europe , " he said .
he said washington expects germany to have a role in stabilizing iraq , although " our german friends … must feel good about it . " bush : iran " rumors " not true despite the agreeable tone , bush and the european allies will have some tough issues to work through .

the two , who have , by all accounts , made up after a deep rift opened following schröder 's anti-war stance , will discuss the chancellor 's controversial comments on rehauling nato .

this year 's festival is no exception , having provided breakthrough moments for several new homegrown stars . julia jentsch , actress the undisputed new star to emerge from the berlinale is berlin-born actress julia jentsch , 26 .
her convincing portrayal of anti-nazi resistance heroine sophie scholl in the competition film " sophie scholl - the final days " went over well with both critics and audiences alike .
jentsch 's face is now gracing the covers of german magazines , meaning her days of going unrecognized are coming to an end .
jentsch previously appeared in " the edukators , " a film about a group of young people who break into the homes of the wealthy not to steal , but to send them a message about social injustice .
jentsch has been a member of the munich kammerspiel theatre ensemble since 2001 .
at a berlinale press conference , jentsch said she would be returning to the stage and had no plans to make another film .
but that 's likely to change soon - especially if jentsch scoops the silver bear for best actress , as many are already predicting . julia hummer , actress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia hummer another young actress named julia has created a stir at the berlinale - julia hummer , 24 , who stars in christian petzold 's film " ghosts " -lrb- gespenster -rrb- .
festival director dieter kosslick said hummer 's portrayal of a young woman the film 's protagonist believes is her lost daughter could make her " a very big star in europe or worldwide . "
but that will depend very much on which of her ambitions hummer decides to pursue .
she is also a dedicated musician with an album and negotiations with record labels in the works .
hummer 's previous film credits include the coming-of-age story " crazy , " and another film by petzold , " the state i am in " -lrb- die innere sicherheit -rrb- . hannes stöhr , director bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannes stöhr " one day in europe " has been described as " delightful " and " refreshing , " and has earned its director , hannes stöhr , 35 , accolades that are just as positive .

the film is made up of four episodes told in four european cities and seven different languages .
the thing that holds them together is a fictional european champions league soccer match played in moscow between spanish and turkish teams .
" soccer , whether you like the game or not , is something that connects all the cultures of europe , " said stöhr , who also wrote the film 's screenplay .
the story was a natural for stöhr , who lives in berlin , but has also spent parts of his life in moscow and istanbul , and who speaks english , german , spanish and french . max riemelt , actor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max riemelt in " napola " from constantin film it does n't get any more official than actually being named a shooting star 2005 , but that 's exactly what happened to young german actor max riemelt , 21 .
his current film , " napola " , in which he plays a working-class student at an elite training academy during the third reich , is not showing at the berlinale , but riemelt was one of 21 young actors from 21 different countries to be awarded the prize at a european film promotion event held alongside the festival .
riemelt first achieved teen-idol fame in germany with the film " mädchen , mädchen ! "
as a prize winner , riemelt will be introduced to countless producers , casting agents , and other actors over the next few days , but his attitude is relaxed .
" it 's cool to be named a shooting star , and of course , a big honor , " riemelt said .

this year 's festival is no exception , having provided breakthrough moments for several new homegrown stars . julia jentsch , actress the undisputed new star to emerge from the berlinale is berlin-born actress julia jentsch , 26 .
her convincing portrayal of anti-nazi resistance heroine sophie scholl in the competition film " sophie scholl - the final days " went over well with both critics and audiences alike .
jentsch 's face is now gracing the covers of german magazines , meaning her days of going unrecognized are coming to an end .
jentsch previously appeared in " the edukators , " a film about a group of young people who break into the homes of the wealthy not to steal , but to send them a message about social injustice .
jentsch has been a member of the munich kammerspiel theatre ensemble since 2001 .
at a berlinale press conference , jentsch said she would be returning to the stage and had no plans to make another film .
but that 's likely to change soon - especially if jentsch scoops the silver bear for best actress , as many are already predicting . julia hummer , actress bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : julia hummer another young actress named julia has created a stir at the berlinale - julia hummer , 24 , who stars in christian petzold 's film " ghosts " -lrb- gespenster -rrb- .
festival director dieter kosslick said hummer 's portrayal of a young woman the film 's protagonist believes is her lost daughter could make her " a very big star in europe or worldwide . "
but that will depend very much on which of her ambitions hummer decides to pursue .
she is also a dedicated musician with an album and negotiations with record labels in the works .
hummer 's previous film credits include the coming-of-age story " crazy , " and another film by petzold , " the state i am in " -lrb- die innere sicherheit -rrb- . hannes stöhr , director bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hannes stöhr " one day in europe " has been described as " delightful " and " refreshing , " and has earned its director , hannes stöhr , 35 , accolades that are just as positive .
not bad , considering " europe " is only his second feature-length film , following on 2001 's " berlin is in germany . "
the film is made up of four episodes told in four european cities and seven different languages .
the thing that holds them together is a fictional european champions league soccer match played in moscow between spanish and turkish teams .
" soccer , whether you like the game or not , is something that connects all the cultures of europe , " said stöhr , who also wrote the film 's screenplay .

what do you think will come of this visit ?
how will the europeans welcome the american president ? javier solana : i think the visit has every prospect of being a success .
i think the current climate and atmosphere are much better than they were a couple of years , or even a couple of months ago .
there was some dissonance in 2003 and 2004 , especially over iraq .
but we have overcome our differences now .
that 's why i think the decision by president bush and his new secretary of state to choose europe as the place to make their first overseas visits since the new presidential term started is a very positive gesture . there 's a debate currently over what role nato should play in future relations between the europeans and the us .
a whole series of suggestions have been put forward on ways to improve the way we work together .
what is your view on this debate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i believe that everything that contributes toward making transatlantic relations more effective is good . every debate in this direction is positive .
i think that everyone accepts that transatlantic relations are no longer dealt with exclusively within the framework of nato , but to a large degree also within eu institutions .
this was very clearly highlighted by the many hours that secretary condoleezza rice spent at the european union .
and now president bush is coming to exchange views with leading european figures on the problems which exist between the eu and nato .
i believe this is positive and expresses the importance of the role of the european union in transatlantic relations , and the common desire for europeans and americans to work together . despite all the conflicts going on in the world , there have been significant advances made , for example in the middle east .
how realistic is the hope for peace between israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana , left , and peter hansen , commissioner general of the united nations relief and works agency -lrb- unrwa -rrb- , inspect damage of a destroyed kindergarden during their tour in the norther gaza strip town of beit lahiya , wednesday jan .
12 , 2005 .
i have been involved in the middle east peace process for many years , but now for the first time i am very optimistic and i can see great opportunities .
there is a path that both israelis and palestinians must tread together , accompanied by their friends .
both we europeans and the americans are their friends , and i believe we can join them on this path .
but it wo n't be easy .
there will be high and low points , and good times and bad .
the most important thing is that we remain committed and show good will . i think that president abbas is doing a good job , from the way the palestinian election was run to what he 's doing now .
and prime minister sharon has also made good decisions , like relaxing the restrictions on palestinians so that people can enjoy a better standard of life , and the decision to remove settlements from the gaza strip .
but i am well aware of the pitfalls .
we have to keep our eyes open and be clear about our obligations .
as i have said before , we have to be committed to providing help because there will be innumerable difficulties . what can the european union do to help abbas end terrorism and to support the move towards peace ? the best that we can do to help him is to strengthen and train his police force .
and that 's what we 're doing now .
there 's a team already working with the palestinian security forces to help them function in the most efficient and effective way possible .
that 's important , but the political will to end terrorist activities is more important .
president abbas has made very clear statements on this and has acted accordingly . that must be recognized by the international community as well as by israel . the european union is also in negotiations to persuade iran not to build nuclear weapons .
can we expect success there as well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in bushehr , iran , 750 miles -lrb- 1,200 kilometers -rrb- southwest of tehran .
we made considerable progress in the last few months .
iran has signed an additional protocol which allows inspectors from the international atomic energy authority to visit sites across the country without giving prior notification .
that means the iaea can carry out a control function in iran . the negotiations are being conducted on three levels at the same time : we 're dealing with the nuclear arms issue , security aspects for iran , and trade and economic relations between iran and the eu .
we hope that we will continue to make progress . does this mean that these subjects will be decided bilaterally between the iranian government and the europeans , or will the americans have a say in the negotiations ? i think that the united states is not interested in joining the negotiations at this point in time .
they can support them from the sidelines .
as you know , the us has no diplomatic relations with iran , and for this reason it is more difficult for them .
in any case , if all goes well , the results will be seen in vienna at the international atomic energy agency .
any agreement reached with iran will have to be ratified by the iaea board of governors , which is elected by nations in the iaea , who are all members of the united nations , can we now say that relations between the us and europe are close and that there 's been no break in the dialogue with the us ?
is there agreement on how to implement common political strategies ? yes , i think so .
that follows on from what i said about the talks that we have held in the past few months .
and i hope this will be underlined by president bush and the leading political figures of the european union . is there hope of an agreement , for example on the subject of china and the decision by the european union to lift the weapons embargo on beijing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao , left , smiles as former eu commission president romano prodi gestures during a media conference at the eu commission building in brussels , thursday , may 6 , 2004 .
all issues that we are in the process of negotiating are both difficult and delicate .
even so , i 'm convinced that we can reach agreement .
as far as china is concerned , i would like to emphasize that it is not about selling more weapons to china ; rather it concerns the lifting of sanctions that the eu imposed on china during the tiananmen square crisis .
since then , many years have gone by and much has happened .
a new generation is in charge in china now and we want to forge new relations which are not overshadowed by sanctions .
for this reason , the lifting of the weapons embargo will be a political rather than a military gesture . the interview was conducted by gonzalo cáceres send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush , europe set to mend fences ahead of us president george w. bush 's highly-anticipated visit to europe , both sides are all smiles .

dortmund 's defense left the dutch striker entirely too much space in the beginning of the game and paid dearly for it .
makaay kept the 53,000 home team fans riveted by scoring a pair of goals himself and assisting in tow more during the game 's first 45 minutes .
in the second half he put in one more to seal a personal hat trick and his team 's highest win of the season .
bayern had something to prove bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hasan salihamidzic , center , celebrates with teammates roy makkay , left , and mehmet scholl , after scoring " after the loss in bielefeld we had some matter to take care of and the team knew it , " said bayern munich trainer felix magath .
" we were lucky that we got a goal early and could pile on another one a little bit later . "
it was hasan salihamidzic who opened scoring in the fifth minute , and makaay put in his first of three exceptional goals just one minute later .
the two quick goals gave dortmund a shock they never recovered from .
bert van marwijk watched his bvb squad 's defense fall apart time after time while his strikers never worked their way into a truly dangerous position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich flew away with the win at home against dortmund dortmund goalkeeper roman weidenfeller inexplicably allowed makaay 's tame shot to squirm under his body in the game 's 34th minute , but was helpless earlier in the 28th minute when claudio pizarro volleyed home .
even a locker room talk could n't bring dortmund back to life and makaay ended the scoring by putting a shot between dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller 's legs in the 54th minute , giving bayern munich its third home win in a row .
bankruptcy not an excuse for borussia dortmund , the crushing loss moved what until now was only a financial crisis to the playing field .
on thursday the team announced they were on the edge of bankruptcy .
the disastrous defeat thus capped what has already been a distressing week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the brink of bankruptcy , a thrashing in munich added insult to borussia dortmund 's financial injury " we were not confident , " said dortmund coach van marwijk .
" we were not in the game for a moment after falling behind early .
our financial problems are not an alibi . "
the win means bayern will stay in first place atop the bundesliga table , by how many points will remain unclear until 2nd-placed schalke 04 play against borussia mönchengladbach sunday afternoon .
munich started the game without german national team captain michael ballack and also let torsten frings and owen hargreaves have a break before this week 's champions league match against arsenal london .

dortmund 's defense left the dutch striker entirely too much space in the beginning of the game and paid dearly for it .
makaay kept the 53,000 home team fans riveted by scoring a pair of goals himself and assisting in tow more during the game 's first 45 minutes .
in the second half he put in one more to seal a personal hat trick and his team 's highest win of the season .
bayern had something to prove bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hasan salihamidzic , center , celebrates with teammates roy makkay , left , and mehmet scholl , after scoring " after the loss in bielefeld we had some matter to take care of and the team knew it , " said bayern munich trainer felix magath .
" we were lucky that we got a goal early and could pile on another one a little bit later . "
it was hasan salihamidzic who opened scoring in the fifth minute , and makaay put in his first of three exceptional goals just one minute later .
the two quick goals gave dortmund a shock they never recovered from .
bert van marwijk watched his bvb squad 's defense fall apart time after time while his strikers never worked their way into a truly dangerous position .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich flew away with the win at home against dortmund dortmund goalkeeper roman weidenfeller inexplicably allowed makaay 's tame shot to squirm under his body in the game 's 34th minute , but was helpless earlier in the 28th minute when claudio pizarro volleyed home .
even a locker room talk could n't bring dortmund back to life and makaay ended the scoring by putting a shot between dortmund keeper roman weidenfeller 's legs in the 54th minute , giving bayern munich its third home win in a row .
bankruptcy not an excuse for borussia dortmund , the crushing loss moved what until now was only a financial crisis to the playing field .
on thursday the team announced they were on the edge of bankruptcy .
the disastrous defeat thus capped what has already been a distressing week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the brink of bankruptcy , a thrashing in munich added insult to borussia dortmund 's financial injury " we were not confident , " said dortmund coach van marwijk .
" we were not in the game for a moment after falling behind early .
our financial problems are not an alibi . "
the win means bayern will stay in first place atop the bundesliga table , by how many points will remain unclear until 2nd-placed schalke 04 play against borussia mönchengladbach sunday afternoon .
munich started the game without german national team captain michael ballack and also let torsten frings and owen hargreaves have a break before this week 's champions league match against arsenal london .
salihamidzic and martin demichelis took the starters ' places in midfield and , along with mehmet scholl , proved they are capable of playing reliably for the german league 's top team . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de life after soccer ?

not in dortmund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happier times : dortmund fans celebrate their 2002 championship fans of the dortmund soccer club bvb borrusia are distraught .
the storied team with one of the most loyal followings in the world is on the edge of a financial collapse that threatens its existence . a full 80,000 fans can fit into westfalen stadium , the cavernous temple to the dortmund soccer club bvb borussia 09 - and do so every home game .
the fan bloc , which during games is a sea of black and yellow banners and flags , is made up of 27,000 people each game - all of them standing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's westfalen stadium is one of the sites of the 2006 world cup so when dortmund fans are mad , it 's best to listen .
and they have never been more upset .
the problem " rage , fear and bewilderment , " read a newspaper headline in dortmund this week .
in four years , the bvb would have celebrated its 100th anniversary .
now , there is serious doubt the club can even make it to the next season .
borussia has run up a debt of € 142.1 million -lrb- $ 185.74 million -rrb- over the past few seasons , an equivalent of 79 percent of its capital .
just a few seasons ago , the club made headlines by winning the bundelisga title , competing regularly in european tournaments , and being the first german club to go on the stock exchange .
today , borrusia and its team of highly-paid stars is struggling up the bundesliga table .
the stock has plunged more than 25 percent .
the targets " the anger is massive and the fear is just as big , " one fan told dw-radio .
" i do n't know where it will go from here .
i also do n't think these people will be able to get the club out of danger . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebaum -lrb- l . -rrb- left one week ago - but meier will stay on , despite what fans think " these people " are gerd niebaum and michael meier .
niebaum stepped down one week ago as president of the club .
meier remains in office and has had to face down a battery of cameras and microphones , not to mention irate fans in recent weeks as news of dortmund 's miserable economic situation spread .
on feb .
12 , 1,000 fans marched in dortmund behind a massive banner that read " not for sale : put an end to the lies and intrigue ! "
they accused meier of mismanagement and spending too much money on players who did n't deliver as promised .
they demanded meier correct the club 's miserable accounting and then resign .
" bvb brought a smile to my face " the anger , and the sheer numbers taking to the streets illustrate the importance of the soccer club to the ruhr valley city .
once a center for steel and coal mining , dortmund 's fortunes have sunk as companies have either gone bankrupt or pulled up stakes to move eastwards , where labor is cheaper .
for many of the workers , the soccer team was their weekend distraction .
for the growing list of unemployed and their families , the team is nowadays their only distraction .
bildunterschrift : fans protest on feb .
12 " the bvb is the only place where i can get away from all the worries and problems of daily life , " wrote one fan on a bvb fan chat room www.schwatzgelb.de.
other fans responded with similar stories and feelings and the site was soon covered with messages .
only thing left is hope " i had a difficult time as a youth and i was able to get through it with the bvb , " wrote another fan .
" the bvb brought a smile to my face when i actually should have been crying . "
along with the sadness , there were many messages calling for support and confidence in their beloved soccer club .
dortmund 's mayor said he was sure a proposed restructuring plan that includes deferring rental payments for its € 17 million a year stadium and a drastically-reduced player budget would work .
the team is the " heart and soul of the city , " mayor gerhard langemeyer told the news agency dpa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.02.2005 eu chief keen to seek unity with us großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiss and make up : solana , left , was welcoming to condoleeza rice on the eve of president bush 's europe visit , the eu 's foreign policy chief , javier solana , told deutsche welle that the us and europe were ready to bury past rifts and cooperate on divisive issues . deutsche welle : mr. solana , us president george w. bush is traveling to europe this coming week .
what do you think will come of this visit ?
how will the europeans welcome the american president ? javier solana : i think the visit has every prospect of being a success .
i think the current climate and atmosphere are much better than they were a couple of years , or even a couple of months ago .
there was some dissonance in 2003 and 2004 , especially over iraq .
but we have overcome our differences now .
that 's why i think the decision by president bush and his new secretary of state to choose europe as the place to make their first overseas visits since the new presidential term started is a very positive gesture . there 's a debate currently over what role nato should play in future relations between the europeans and the us .
a whole series of suggestions have been put forward on ways to improve the way we work together .
what is your view on this debate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i believe that everything that contributes toward making transatlantic relations more effective is good . every debate in this direction is positive .
i think that everyone accepts that transatlantic relations are no longer dealt with exclusively within the framework of nato , but to a large degree also within eu institutions .
this was very clearly highlighted by the many hours that secretary condoleezza rice spent at the european union .
and now president bush is coming to exchange views with leading european figures on the problems which exist between the eu and nato .
i believe this is positive and expresses the importance of the role of the european union in transatlantic relations , and the common desire for europeans and americans to work together . despite all the conflicts going on in the world , there have been significant advances made , for example in the middle east .
how realistic is the hope for peace between israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana , left , and peter hansen , commissioner general of the united nations relief and works agency -lrb- unrwa -rrb- , inspect damage of a destroyed kindergarden during their tour in the norther gaza strip town of beit lahiya , wednesday jan .
12 , 2005 .
i have been involved in the middle east peace process for many years , but now for the first time i am very optimistic and i can see great opportunities .
there is a path that both israelis and palestinians must tread together , accompanied by their friends .
both we europeans and the americans are their friends , and i believe we can join them on this path .
but it wo n't be easy .
there will be high and low points , and good times and bad .
the most important thing is that we remain committed and show good will . i think that president abbas is doing a good job , from the way the palestinian election was run to what he 's doing now .
and prime minister sharon has also made good decisions , like relaxing the restrictions on palestinians so that people can enjoy a better standard of life , and the decision to remove settlements from the gaza strip .
but i am well aware of the pitfalls .
we have to keep our eyes open and be clear about our obligations .
as i have said before , we have to be committed to providing help because there will be innumerable difficulties . what can the european union do to help abbas end terrorism and to support the move towards peace ? the best that we can do to help him is to strengthen and train his police force .
and that 's what we 're doing now .
there 's a team already working with the palestinian security forces to help them function in the most efficient and effective way possible .
that 's important , but the political will to end terrorist activities is more important .
president abbas has made very clear statements on this and has acted accordingly . that must be recognized by the international community as well as by israel . the european union is also in negotiations to persuade iran not to build nuclear weapons .
can we expect success there as well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in bushehr , iran , 750 miles -lrb- 1,200 kilometers -rrb- southwest of tehran .
we made considerable progress in the last few months .
iran has signed an additional protocol which allows inspectors from the international atomic energy authority to visit sites across the country without giving prior notification .
that means the iaea can carry out a control function in iran . the negotiations are being conducted on three levels at the same time : we 're dealing with the nuclear arms issue , security aspects for iran , and trade and economic relations between iran and the eu .
we hope that we will continue to make progress . does this mean that these subjects will be decided bilaterally between the iranian government and the europeans , or will the americans have a say in the negotiations ? i think that the united states is not interested in joining the negotiations at this point in time .
they can support them from the sidelines .
as you know , the us has no diplomatic relations with iran , and for this reason it is more difficult for them .
in any case , if all goes well , the results will be seen in vienna at the international atomic energy agency .
any agreement reached with iran will have to be ratified by the iaea board of governors , which is elected by nations in the iaea , who are all members of the united nations , can we now say that relations between the us and europe are close and that there 's been no break in the dialogue with the us ?
is there agreement on how to implement common political strategies ? yes , i think so .
that follows on from what i said about the talks that we have held in the past few months .
and i hope this will be underlined by president bush and the leading political figures of the european union . is there hope of an agreement , for example on the subject of china and the decision by the european union to lift the weapons embargo on beijing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao , left , smiles as former eu commission president romano prodi gestures during a media conference at the eu commission building in brussels , thursday , may 6 , 2004 .
all issues that we are in the process of negotiating are both difficult and delicate .
even so , i 'm convinced that we can reach agreement .
as far as china is concerned , i would like to emphasize that it is not about selling more weapons to china ; rather it concerns the lifting of sanctions that the eu imposed on china during the tiananmen square crisis .
since then , many years have gone by and much has happened .
a new generation is in charge in china now and we want to forge new relations which are not overshadowed by sanctions .
for this reason , the lifting of the weapons embargo will be a political rather than a military gesture . the interview was conducted by gonzalo cáceres send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush , europe set to mend fences ahead of us president george w. bush 's highly-anticipated visit to europe , both sides are all smiles .

borussia has run up a debt of € 142.1 million -lrb- $ 185.74 million -rrb- over the past few seasons , an equivalent of 79 percent of its capital .
just a few seasons ago , the club made headlines by winning the bundelisga title , competing regularly in european tournaments , and being the first german club to go on the stock exchange .
today , borrusia and its team of highly-paid stars is struggling up the bundesliga table .
the stock has plunged more than 25 percent .

what do you think will come of this visit ?
how will the europeans welcome the american president ? javier solana : i think the visit has every prospect of being a success .
i think the current climate and atmosphere are much better than they were a couple of years , or even a couple of months ago .
there was some dissonance in 2003 and 2004 , especially over iraq .
but we have overcome our differences now .
that 's why i think the decision by president bush and his new secretary of state to choose europe as the place to make their first overseas visits since the new presidential term started is a very positive gesture . there 's a debate currently over what role nato should play in future relations between the europeans and the us .
a whole series of suggestions have been put forward on ways to improve the way we work together .
what is your view on this debate ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : i believe that everything that contributes toward making transatlantic relations more effective is good . every debate in this direction is positive .
i think that everyone accepts that transatlantic relations are no longer dealt with exclusively within the framework of nato , but to a large degree also within eu institutions .
this was very clearly highlighted by the many hours that secretary condoleezza rice spent at the european union .
and now president bush is coming to exchange views with leading european figures on the problems which exist between the eu and nato .
i believe this is positive and expresses the importance of the role of the european union in transatlantic relations , and the common desire for europeans and americans to work together . despite all the conflicts going on in the world , there have been significant advances made , for example in the middle east .
how realistic is the hope for peace between israelis and palestinians ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana , left , and peter hansen , commissioner general of the united nations relief and works agency -lrb- unrwa -rrb- , inspect damage of a destroyed kindergarden during their tour in the norther gaza strip town of beit lahiya , wednesday jan .
12 , 2005 .
i have been involved in the middle east peace process for many years , but now for the first time i am very optimistic and i can see great opportunities .
there is a path that both israelis and palestinians must tread together , accompanied by their friends .
both we europeans and the americans are their friends , and i believe we can join them on this path .
but it wo n't be easy .
there will be high and low points , and good times and bad .
the most important thing is that we remain committed and show good will . i think that president abbas is doing a good job , from the way the palestinian election was run to what he 's doing now .
and prime minister sharon has also made good decisions , like relaxing the restrictions on palestinians so that people can enjoy a better standard of life , and the decision to remove settlements from the gaza strip .
but i am well aware of the pitfalls .
we have to keep our eyes open and be clear about our obligations .
as i have said before , we have to be committed to providing help because there will be innumerable difficulties . what can the european union do to help abbas end terrorism and to support the move towards peace ? the best that we can do to help him is to strengthen and train his police force .
and that 's what we 're doing now .
there 's a team already working with the palestinian security forces to help them function in the most efficient and effective way possible .
that 's important , but the political will to end terrorist activities is more important .
president abbas has made very clear statements on this and has acted accordingly . that must be recognized by the international community as well as by israel . the european union is also in negotiations to persuade iran not to build nuclear weapons .
can we expect success there as well ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushehr nuclear power plant in bushehr , iran , 750 miles -lrb- 1,200 kilometers -rrb- southwest of tehran .
we made considerable progress in the last few months .
iran has signed an additional protocol which allows inspectors from the international atomic energy authority to visit sites across the country without giving prior notification .
that means the iaea can carry out a control function in iran . the negotiations are being conducted on three levels at the same time : we 're dealing with the nuclear arms issue , security aspects for iran , and trade and economic relations between iran and the eu .
we hope that we will continue to make progress . does this mean that these subjects will be decided bilaterally between the iranian government and the europeans , or will the americans have a say in the negotiations ? i think that the united states is not interested in joining the negotiations at this point in time .
they can support them from the sidelines .
as you know , the us has no diplomatic relations with iran , and for this reason it is more difficult for them .
in any case , if all goes well , the results will be seen in vienna at the international atomic energy agency .
any agreement reached with iran will have to be ratified by the iaea board of governors , which is elected by nations in the iaea , who are all members of the united nations , can we now say that relations between the us and europe are close and that there 's been no break in the dialogue with the us ?
is there agreement on how to implement common political strategies ? yes , i think so .
that follows on from what i said about the talks that we have held in the past few months .
and i hope this will be underlined by president bush and the leading political figures of the european union . is there hope of an agreement , for example on the subject of china and the decision by the european union to lift the weapons embargo on beijing ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese prime minister wen jiabao , left , smiles as former eu commission president romano prodi gestures during a media conference at the eu commission building in brussels , thursday , may 6 , 2004 .
all issues that we are in the process of negotiating are both difficult and delicate .
even so , i 'm convinced that we can reach agreement .
as far as china is concerned , i would like to emphasize that it is not about selling more weapons to china ; rather it concerns the lifting of sanctions that the eu imposed on china during the tiananmen square crisis .
since then , many years have gone by and much has happened .
a new generation is in charge in china now and we want to forge new relations which are not overshadowed by sanctions .
for this reason , the lifting of the weapons embargo will be a political rather than a military gesture . the interview was conducted by gonzalo cáceres send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush , europe set to mend fences ahead of us president george w. bush 's highly-anticipated visit to europe , both sides are all smiles .

but , how exactly is the money going to be distributed ? emergency aid began pouring in from all corners of the world right after the tidal wave hit on dec .
26 , 2004 and efforts to provide devastated areas with basis supplies are still underway . reconstruction however needs more time .
" it 's not possible to spread € 500 million over five years yet , " stephan bethe of the german federal ministry for economic development and cooperation -lrb- bmz -rrb- said and pointed out that the affected countries and donor nations first have to come to an agreement about what is needed and who is going to provide for it .
" reconstruction is a long process " , bethe said , adding that the right choices have to be made in rebuilding infrastructure like schools , hospitals , streets or energy and water supplies . in addition , the people have to be helped back to a position where they can earn a living on their own again .
where does the extra money go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bmz budget for 2005 amounts to € 3.8 billion , the same as last year . the € 500 million in tsunami aid money pledged by the german government comes on top of the development funds . berlin is also chanelling € 50 million from the tsunami aid funds into a un emergency relief fund .
the remaining € 450 million are meant to aid reconstruction in indonesia and sri lanka , the two worst-hit states in the tsunami . according to the bmz , it 's still difficult to foresee whether the duration of reconstruction there will take five years or less . more specifically , the extra long term aid money is going to be administered by the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- , which receives most of its assignments from the bmz , and the state-owned bank for reconstruction -lrb- kfw -rrb- .
both institutions operate development projects in particular countries and according to bethe they will handle projects in the tsunami-struck region on behalf of the bmz .
local know-how important employees of both the gtz and kfw however depend on local and regional expertise and organization on the ground .
" they can be local councils , non-governmental organizations or companies , " said hans stehling of the gtz .
the cooperation in turn provides employment opportunities for devastated communities .
for instance , the building of new schools or repairing fishing boats is often commissioned out to local carpentry companies .
in sri lanka , emergency relief has already translated into long-term reconstruction .
the gtz was present in the country with various projects long before the indian ocean tragedy struck , thus enabling it to react swiftly to the disaster .
on sunday , german development minster heidemarie wieczorek-zeul is expected in the region .
according to bmz 's bethe , the sri lankan government has already drawn up the first reconstruction plans which are now being approved by the donor nations .
it definitely sounds like more than just empty promises from germany 's government .
" we 've already proposed various projects for reconstruction .
now , we 're waiting for contracts from the bmz , " said stehling .
he 's counting on a quick decision from the ministry .
however , nobody 's talking of concrete dates or funds as yet .
germany 's ministry for economic development and cooperation skirts all questions regarding who is going to do what by saying that it 's dependant on the governments of the affected countries to react to offers of aid .
in indonesia , progress takes a little longer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : indonesia 's government is planing to present its masterplan for reconstruction on march 26 , three months after the tsunami hit the country .
until then , emergency aid in affected regions is going to continue along with german support .
due to the small presence of foreign aid organizations up to now , they can not fall back on existing structures and contacts and thus progress takes longer here .

not in dortmund großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happier times : dortmund fans celebrate their 2002 championship fans of the dortmund soccer club bvb borrusia are distraught .
the storied team with one of the most loyal followings in the world is on the edge of a financial collapse that threatens its existence . a full 80,000 fans can fit into westfalen stadium , the cavernous temple to the dortmund soccer club bvb borussia 09 - and do so every home game .
the fan bloc , which during games is a sea of black and yellow banners and flags , is made up of 27,000 people each game - all of them standing .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's westfalen stadium is one of the sites of the 2006 world cup so when dortmund fans are mad , it 's best to listen .
and they have never been more upset .
the problem " rage , fear and bewilderment , " read a newspaper headline in dortmund this week .
in four years , the bvb would have celebrated its 100th anniversary .
now , there is serious doubt the club can even make it to the next season .
borussia has run up a debt of € 142.1 million -lrb- $ 185.74 million -rrb- over the past few seasons , an equivalent of 79 percent of its capital .
just a few seasons ago , the club made headlines by winning the bundelisga title , competing regularly in european tournaments , and being the first german club to go on the stock exchange .
today , borrusia and its team of highly-paid stars is struggling up the bundesliga table .
the stock has plunged more than 25 percent .
the targets " the anger is massive and the fear is just as big , " one fan told dw-radio .
" i do n't know where it will go from here .
i also do n't think these people will be able to get the club out of danger . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : niebaum -lrb- l . -rrb- left one week ago - but meier will stay on , despite what fans think " these people " are gerd niebaum and michael meier .
niebaum stepped down one week ago as president of the club .
meier remains in office and has had to face down a battery of cameras and microphones , not to mention irate fans in recent weeks as news of dortmund 's miserable economic situation spread .
on feb .
12 , 1,000 fans marched in dortmund behind a massive banner that read " not for sale : put an end to the lies and intrigue ! "
they accused meier of mismanagement and spending too much money on players who did n't deliver as promised .
they demanded meier correct the club 's miserable accounting and then resign .
" bvb brought a smile to my face " the anger , and the sheer numbers taking to the streets illustrate the importance of the soccer club to the ruhr valley city .
once a center for steel and coal mining , dortmund 's fortunes have sunk as companies have either gone bankrupt or pulled up stakes to move eastwards , where labor is cheaper .
for many of the workers , the soccer team was their weekend distraction .
for the growing list of unemployed and their families , the team is nowadays their only distraction .
bildunterschrift : fans protest on feb .
12 " the bvb is the only place where i can get away from all the worries and problems of daily life , " wrote one fan on a bvb fan chat room www.schwatzgelb.de.
other fans responded with similar stories and feelings and the site was soon covered with messages .
only thing left is hope " i had a difficult time as a youth and i was able to get through it with the bvb , " wrote another fan .
" the bvb brought a smile to my face when i actually should have been crying . "
along with the sadness , there were many messages calling for support and confidence in their beloved soccer club .
dortmund 's mayor said he was sure a proposed restructuring plan that includes deferring rental payments for its € 17 million a year stadium and a drastically-reduced player budget would work .

the device is being used to help young eels make their way from the humber to freshwater areas where they mature .
their journey is often blocked by flood defences and weirs but it is hoped this will be solved by putting in the pipes to bypass the obstruction .
the device , in which the netting enables the eels to climb to safety , is being tried out near the humber .
food for birds neil trudgill of the environment agency came up with the idea after he became worried about the decline in the number of eels over the past 50 years .
" the humber estuary is one of the biggest estuaries in the country and at one time eels not only contributed to a thriving fishing industry but were also vital food for otters , herons and bitterns , " he explained .
" our pass is a simple design which will have freshwater flowing through it so that eels in the estuary 's saltwater can use their onboard navigation system to sense the freshwater and move towards the watercourse and the pass . "
the environment agency said that a study in 2001 showed that of the 60 watercourses discharged into the lower humber only one had no obstructions for eels members of the freshwater eel family are born in the sargasso sea , south of bermuda , and drift with the tide to europe .
once in freshwater the adult eels live for up to 30 years before making their way back to the sargasso to release their eggs and die .

by evan davis bbc economics editor fox hunting in england and wales killed about 25,000 foxes a year .
that might seem a lot - but that is forgetting just how many other animals we kill .
fox hunting in england and wales did kill about 25,000 foxes a year add up the cows , sheep and pigs and you find that we slaughter approximately 25m a year .
and that is not to mention the 850 million chickens and turkeys that are slaughtered .
my point is not that we might be accused of hypocrisy in focusing so much attention on saving foxes .
the real point is that the countryside and its economy depend on farming far more than they ever did on fox hunting .
you do not only have to look at the slaughter statistics to gauge the relative size of farming and hunting .
you can look at the employment statistics as well .
' effects swamped ' approximately 7,000 jobs depended on hunting .
more than 7,000 people had hunting-related jobs , but it was 7,000 full-time equivalent .
yet over 500,000 people work in agriculture .
so a small shift in the fate of our farms swamps any economic effect from a change in the hunting law .
the bulk of jobs in rural areas are not in hunting - they are in services for example , last year the workforce in agriculture grew by about 16,000 .
that modest boost is twice any likely employment loss from a hunting ban .
no wonder that five years ago the burns report looked at hunting , and concluded that in the big picture , the economic effects of a ban would not be substantial .
the bulk of jobs in rural areas are not in hunting , not even farms , they are actually in services - just like everywhere else .
countryside dilemma on this view , the economic destiny of the countryside is to make itself as attractive as possible as a location for new service industries .
maybe serving customers in the cities with industries like tourism or serving the so-called city slickers - people working in the cities but living in country villages .
it is quite possible for rural britain to make money .
but there is a real dilemma if the countryside is to pursue that route .
around 25m cows , sheep and pigs are slaughtered every year can we maintain the character of the countryside if it does develop economically ?
at the moment we preserve our rural areas by restricting what planning permission is given there .
most farmers could make quite a bit of money if they were allowed to sell half their land for development but we do n't let them .
sometimes farmers can barely get permission to turn a barn into a bed-and-breakfast .
urban politicians might get away with telling the countryside not to engage in countryside pursuits like hunting .
but can they simultaneously tell the countryside it has to preserve its rural charm and develop economically ?
