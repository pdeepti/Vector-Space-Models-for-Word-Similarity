31 , club directors were active : bundesliga teams seeking to change their fortunes or improve already good starts hired young brazilians in numbers . abuda , kahe , romulo and rafinha : the names are n't as familiar as ronaldo , ronaldinho or new international superstar striker robinho .
the old brazilian guard in the bundesliga , lucio , marcelinho or ze roberto also may not be so acquainted with the youngsters .
yet a flurry of deals before the aug .
31 transfer deadline has brought a slew of young brazilians , predominantly forwards , to germany .
last year 's league runners-up schalke dug deepest and paid 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6.2 million -rrb- for their latest brazilian player , 19-year-old rafinha .
unlike the other three , marcio rafael ferreira de souza , short rafinha , is a defender .
germany has already faced the 1.72 meter -lrb- 5 foot 10 inch -rrb- back man , but not at the confederations cup , rather at the u-20 world championships in holland .
" rafinha made a very good impression during the tournament , " said schalke general manager rudi assauer .
like bayern munich 's lucio -lrb- photo -rrb- , rafinha is not shy of scoring goals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : similar to bayern munich 's lucio , rafinha likes the joy of scoring a goal " like most brazilian defenders he is strong going forward , " team manager andreas müller added .
" he 's able to switch quickly from defense to attack , exert pressure down the flank and put in good crosses .
he 's also dangerous in front of the goal . "
in 13 matches this season with his previous club coritiba fc , he scored three times .
and his extra-time winner knocked out the u-20 german side in june .
forwards !
borussia mönchengladbach , already home to brazilian striker giovane elber , found it necessary to help out their elder statesman -lrb- 33 -rrb- with the 23-year-old kahe .
the deal with top first-league brazilian club palmeiras sao paolo cost 1.2 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giovane elber during his stint with bayern munich .
he is the bundesliga 's most successful goalscorer from abroad " he is a physically robust , attacking striker , exactly the kind of player that 's been missing in our offense , " said club director peter pander .
indeed kahe 's goal-scoring services are needed .
in three bundesliga matches so far , gladbach have netted a paltry two goals and lie in 16th place in the standings .
questio n marks the other two brazilian newcomers are big question marks , both to the league , and admittedly to team coaches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuda in one of his first practice sessions with wolfsburg adailiton pereira coelho , called abuda , signed a contract until 2008 with wolfsburg .
holger fach called the signing a bit of an unknown quantity .
" but i have full faith in our chief scouts ralph kellermann and ulil mohr , " the wolfsburg coach said .
decisive in the deal for abuda , however , was the advice of former wolfsburg player and brazilian friend fernando baiano .
" wolfsburg is not a foreign word to me , " the 19-year-old striker said .
" my mate baiano only had nice things to say about the club . "
the northern german town may not be foreign to him but many brazilians criticize abuda for being a little foreign in front of the net and wasting too many chances .
mainz is looking to make up for their poor jump out of the starting blocks with romulo .
he 's on loan for the remainder of the season from brazilian second-league side ituano .
there he had scored six times in the current season .
" romulo is comfortable with the ball and has a nose for the goal , " said mainz coach jürgen klopp about the 23-year-old .
bundesliga fans are anxious to see if the new infusion of brazilian blood will add a little bit of samba to german soccer . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de brazil sends soccer world signal brazil steamrolled argentina to win the confederations cup tournament in germany .

as has been the case over the course of jürgen klinsmann 's reign as coach , a porous defense proved to be the downfall .
the offense , unlike the exciting matches at the cup in june , proved to be non-existent .
germany 's playmaker michael ballack offered what was probably one of his poorest matches as an international midfielder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when ballack has an off day , then the team has an off day " when he plays poorly , then the team has no one to turn to , " was the sober assessment of former world cup championship coach and player turned television analyst , franz beckenbauer .
bundesliga talent scores double miroslav karhan , who plays in the bundesliga with vfl wolfsburg , scored both goals , converting a penalty in the 20th minute and chipping over keeper jens lehmann for the second seven minutes before the break .

for germany coach jürgen klinsmann , the match will have raised further concerns over a defense that has been leaking goals since the confederations cup .
after a promising start for germany , the hosts turned the game around and then dominated the first half .
slovakia 's midfielder and goalscoring king last season at nuremberg , marek mintal , came close to putting his side on top when he flashed a shot just wide in the 13th minute after the ball had fallen to him at a corner .
the pressure on the german defense continued until per mertesacker cracked when he needlessly held on to robert vittek to give away the penalty .
an at times very insecure-looking slovakian goalkeeper kamil contofalsky was challenged on numerous occasions but the necessary bit of luck or smart play was missing at key moments .
the second strike came in the 38th minute when mintal hooked over a cross from wide on the left and karhan calmly lifted the ball over lehmann , who did little to back up his claim this week that he deserved to play in the world cup ahead of oliver kahn .
the debut performances of marcell jansen and lukas sinkiewicz were less than memorable as they worked their ways slowly into the squad after entering the game in the second half .
the last 45 minutes were generally better , with energetic confed cup stars lukas podolski and bastian schweinsteiger creating chances that still ended in a goose egg .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when ballack has an off day , then the team has an off day " when he plays poorly , then the team has no one to turn to , " was the sober assessment of former world cup championship coach and player turned television analyst , franz beckenbauer .
bundesliga talent scores double miroslav karhan , who plays in the bundesliga with vfl wolfsburg , scored both goals , converting a penalty in the 20th minute and chipping over keeper jens lehmann for the second seven minutes before the break .
with only six more friendly matches before the world cup starts on june 9 , klinsmann has a true crisis on his hands as the various combinations he has tested in the backfield are proving to be incapable of the high demands of world soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his club kit green here , miroslav karhan scored twice against germany " i 'm very disappointed with the first half , " said klinsmann .
" we made costly individual mistakes and were slow to recover when we lost the ball .
we 've got a lot to work on . "
germany have conceded 10 goals in their last four games , 15 in their last seven , and have kept clean sheets in just two matches in 2005 , against tunisia and slovenia .
slovakia gets boost the victory for slovakia provided a welcome boost ahead of their trip to face latvia on wednesday , a match they must win to stay in the hunt for a world cup place .
slovakia are in second place in group three behind portugal and ahead of russia .
for germany coach jürgen klinsmann , the match will have raised further concerns over a defense that has been leaking goals since the confederations cup .
after a promising start for germany , the hosts turned the game around and then dominated the first half .
slovakia 's midfielder and goalscoring king last season at nuremberg , marek mintal , came close to putting his side on top when he flashed a shot just wide in the 13th minute after the ball had fallen to him at a corner .
the pressure on the german defense continued until per mertesacker cracked when he needlessly held on to robert vittek to give away the penalty .
an at times very insecure-looking slovakian goalkeeper kamil contofalsky was challenged on numerous occasions but the necessary bit of luck or smart play was missing at key moments .
the second strike came in the 38th minute when mintal hooked over a cross from wide on the left and karhan calmly lifted the ball over lehmann , who did little to back up his claim this week that he deserved to play in the world cup ahead of oliver kahn .
the debut performances of marcell jansen and lukas sinkiewicz were less than memorable as they worked their ways slowly into the squad after entering the game in the second half .
the last 45 minutes were generally better , with energetic confed cup stars lukas podolski and bastian schweinsteiger creating chances that still ended in a goose egg .

the pressure on the german defense continued until per mertesacker cracked when he needlessly held on to robert vittek to give away the penalty .
an at times very insecure-looking slovakian goalkeeper kamil contofalsky was challenged on numerous occasions but the necessary bit of luck or smart play was missing at key moments .
the second strike came in the 38th minute when mintal hooked over a cross from wide on the left and karhan calmly lifted the ball over lehmann , who did little to back up his claim this week that he deserved to play in the world cup ahead of oliver kahn .
the debut performances of marcell jansen and lukas sinkiewicz were less than memorable as they worked their ways slowly into the squad after entering the game in the second half .
the last 45 minutes were generally better , with energetic confed cup stars lukas podolski and bastian schweinsteiger creating chances that still ended in a goose egg .

six people were hurt , one seriously , according to german soccer association press spokesman harald stenger .
during the match , the hooligans who presumably received tickets from slovakian acquaintances made their presence felt during the match , shouting " we all have stadium bans , " and " otto , we 're here anyway , " in reference to german interior minister otto schily , who was in attendance and whose ministry is in charge of security at next year 's world cup . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hooligans taint slovenian friendly a " friendly " weekend soccer match between germany and slovenia quickly turned sour as before , during and after the game , german fans participated in racist violence , prompting fears of a revival of hooliganism .

31 , club directors were active : bundesliga teams seeking to change their fortunes or improve already good starts hired young brazilians in numbers . abuda , kahe , romulo and rafinha : the names are n't as familiar as ronaldo , ronaldinho or new international superstar striker robinho .
the old brazilian guard in the bundesliga , lucio , marcelinho or ze roberto also may not be so acquainted with the youngsters .
yet a flurry of deals before the aug .
31 transfer deadline has brought a slew of young brazilians , predominantly forwards , to germany .
last year 's league runners-up schalke dug deepest and paid 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6.2 million -rrb- for their latest brazilian player , 19-year-old rafinha .
unlike the other three , marcio rafael ferreira de souza , short rafinha , is a defender .
germany has already faced the 1.72 meter -lrb- 5 foot 10 inch -rrb- back man , but not at the confederations cup , rather at the u-20 world championships in holland .
" rafinha made a very good impression during the tournament , " said schalke general manager rudi assauer .
like bayern munich 's lucio -lrb- photo -rrb- , rafinha is not shy of scoring goals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : similar to bayern munich 's lucio , rafinha likes the joy of scoring a goal " like most brazilian defenders he is strong going forward , " team manager andreas müller added .
" he 's able to switch quickly from defense to attack , exert pressure down the flank and put in good crosses .
he 's also dangerous in front of the goal . "
in 13 matches this season with his previous club coritiba fc , he scored three times .
and his extra-time winner knocked out the u-20 german side in june .
forwards !
borussia mönchengladbach , already home to brazilian striker giovane elber , found it necessary to help out their elder statesman -lrb- 33 -rrb- with the 23-year-old kahe .
the deal with top first-league brazilian club palmeiras sao paolo cost 1.2 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giovane elber during his stint with bayern munich .
he is the bundesliga 's most successful goalscorer from abroad " he is a physically robust , attacking striker , exactly the kind of player that 's been missing in our offense , " said club director peter pander .
indeed kahe 's goal-scoring services are needed .
in three bundesliga matches so far , gladbach have netted a paltry two goals and lie in 16th place in the standings .
questio n marks the other two brazilian newcomers are big question marks , both to the league , and admittedly to team coaches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuda in one of his first practice sessions with wolfsburg adailiton pereira coelho , called abuda , signed a contract until 2008 with wolfsburg .
holger fach called the signing a bit of an unknown quantity .
" but i have full faith in our chief scouts ralph kellermann and ulil mohr , " the wolfsburg coach said .
decisive in the deal for abuda , however , was the advice of former wolfsburg player and brazilian friend fernando baiano .
" wolfsburg is not a foreign word to me , " the 19-year-old striker said .
" my mate baiano only had nice things to say about the club . "
the northern german town may not be foreign to him but many brazilians criticize abuda for being a little foreign in front of the net and wasting too many chances .
mainz is looking to make up for their poor jump out of the starting blocks with romulo .
he 's on loan for the remainder of the season from brazilian second-league side ituano .
there he had scored six times in the current season .
" romulo is comfortable with the ball and has a nose for the goal , " said mainz coach jürgen klopp about the 23-year-old .

26 , 1960 , for the first time in the us history , a debate between presidential candidates was shown on television .
the candidates were john f. kennedy , a democratic senator of massachusetts , and richard m. nixon , the us vice president .
they met in a chicago studio to discuss us domestic matters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john f. kennedy emerged the winner kennedy emerged the apparent winner from this first of four televised debates .
tanned , telegenic kennedy made a much better visual impression than pale , makeup-free , stubble-chinned nixon , who was recovering from the flu .
it was the first time the power of television in political contests became apparent .
the election was held in november and kennedy won 49.7 percent of the popular vote in one of the closest presidential elections in us history , surpassing by a fraction the 49.6 percent received by his republican opponent .
in the 1992 debates , george bush senior was caught on camera checking his watch during a town hall debate with then-governor bill clinton and businessman ross perot .
the gesture gave viewers the distinct impression that the elder bush would rather have been elsewhere .
the most recent debate controversy was bush 's so-called mystery bulge during the 2004 debates .
a tv image from the miami debate reveals what looked like a large solid object between his shoulder blades as he leaned over the lectern to face the moderator .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush shakes hands with john kerry ahead of the 3rd debate some said the bulge under his jacket was a hidden receiver , picking up transmissions from someone offstage who was feeding the president answers through a hidden earpiece .
speculation burned up internet blog sites .
on a few occasions , the president simply stopped speaking for an uncomfortably long time and stared ahead with an odd expression on his face .
was he listening to someone helping him with his response to a question ?
china tv duels are foreign to chinese television , which is no great surprise for a country which does n't tolerate much by way of political discussion .
live political programming is rare , with those programs which do make it on to air , filled with boring political events in which politicians obediently toe the party line .
real politics happens behind closed doors , away from the prying eye of tv cameras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chinese premier zhao ziyang at the beginning of the 1980s , the so-called third generation of party leaders celebrated their debut in front of the cameras .
during the press conference at the end of the 13th party congress -lrb- of the 13th people 's congress -rrb- the new party head zhao ziyang was relaxed and spontaneous with both chinese and western journalists .
that gave birth to a new generation of television-conscious party leaders , but it did n't last long .
zhao ziyang 's political end was also shown live on television in 1989 when millions viewed him shedding tears for the hunger-striking students marching on the gate of heavenly peace .
ziyang was consequently removed from power and placed under house arrest until his death in 2005 .
1989 saw the televising of an altogether different debate , when the then premier of the state council , li peng , faced the student leader , wuer kaixi .
wearing hospital pajamas and breathing apparatus , kaixi posed provocative questions to media-shy peng .
millions of viewers saw their otherwise sovereign leader in disgrace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jiang zemin talks to a cameraman but not all party functionaries are media-shy .
zhao 's successor , jiang zamin , loved television and presented himself as a multi-talented leader with an unconventional style , and was once seen on tv singing " o sole mio . "
in today 's china , party functionaries know how to use tv images to benefit themselves . party head and technocrat wen jiabao was seen crying on tv after a mine accident and put on an emotional display while talking with a very poor farmer .
brazil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian president inacio lula da silva tv debates began in brazil in 1989 when current president luiz inacio lula da silva first ran for office .
after a first tv debate , lula was well positioned to significantly catch up with his opponent , fernando collor de mello .
indeed , just a few days before the election , collor was just one percentage point ahead of lula in the polls .
in the second debate , the most important brazilian broadcaster , globo tv , declared that collor had outperformed lula and aired part of the debate that was unfavorable to lula .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president fernando collor de mello collor de mello is part of a family in the state of alagoas , which has controlled the globo tv station since 1978 .
the media giant supported the military dictatorship -lrb- 1964-1985 -rrb- and has backed all subsequent governments for decades .
ultimately mello won with a 5-percent lead , but the so-called " collor-phenomenon " did n't last long .
two and a half years later , corruption charges forced president collor to resign .
after the last election in 2002 , lula da silva was elected .
today his government is involved in numerous corruption scandals and he is facing a similar impeachment procedure to the one that drove collor from office .
spanish-speaking countries many spanish-speaking countries hold populist tv debates fashioned from the american mold , but there are some distinctions from country to country .
chile has seen the gradual development of a stabile structure for public debate and tv debates have emerged since the end of the pinochet dictatorship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose maria aznar has been and gone as spain 's premier in spain there has only been one tv debate , namely between the socialist felipe gonzalez and the conservative jose maria aznar in 1996 .
mexico had its first tv debate in 1994 .
in contrast to germany , where tv debates are subject to strict rules , mexico has no such regulations .
rather than structured debate , the objective is to discredit one 's political opponents with accusations and insults .
the arab world american-style tv debates are not a feature of the arab world , and are strictly outlawed by the powers that be .
but those same powers are not unaware of the opportunities television offers them in the name of protecting their patch . one of the first to make use of the power of the media was egyptian politician gamal abd an-nasser who allowed a radio broadcast to transmit his announcement of the nationalization of the suez canal . in 1967 , following the devastating defeat in the arab-israeli six-day war , nasser offered the people his resignation during a spontaneous tv appearance , fully aware that the vast majority would call for him to remain in office .
his successor , sadat , was often filmed with his pipe and cane to portray himself as an authentic and down-to-earth leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egyptian president hosni mubarak by contrast , the current president mubarak is perceived as uncharismatic and boring .
during his speeches , officials and members of the media often fall asleep .
and it does n't help that his speeches are televised on all tv channels , often interrupting programs people really want to watch .
the late palestinian president arafat was known for embracing and kissing his guests in front of the cameras .
in addition , he cultivated simple , but symbolic gestures , eating with common people and kissing the hands of ladies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader moammer gadhafi last but not least are the spectacular appearances of the " media star " of arab politics , libya 's moammar gadhafi .
fleeting poses capture him sleeping in a tent and camel back riding .
russia the russian federation was one of the first eastern bloc states where tv debates were introduced for elections .
the first tv battles were organized shortly after the resignation of gorbachev and the breakup of the soviet union on june 19 , 1991 .
millions of soviet citizens followed these tense political shows with a mixture of euphoria , naive hope and child-like faith .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former russian president boris jelzin the first presidential campaign in russia lasted for two weeks and the tv debate provided each candidate with equal time to receive and answer live questions from the audience and moderators .
many top russian politicians , including ex-president boris yeltsin and the current head of the ultra-nationalistic liberal democrats vladimir shirinovski took part .
boris yeltsin was elected as the first president of russia on june 12 , 1991 .
shirinovski disagreed with the polls claiming that he had won and that the polls had been manipulated .
all subsequent debates on russian television were more of a show than a serious political discussion .
during a tv debate between shirinovski and the ex-faction head of the democratic party sps , boris nemzov , the two rivals doused each other with water .
in another case the debaters started a brawl .
during a debate running up to regional presidential elections in the republic tatarstan in 2001 , the former duma delegate sergei shashurin shelled the then president with swear words and relentless accusations .
the president felt insulted and made shashurin appear in court as a result .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin wo n't debate on television the current russian president putin does n't care much for televised political debates and refused to participate during the last presidential election .
" i already know every word of my competitor , " putin said .
" of course , you can try different tricks .
you can sing and dance .
but the people in our country can still decide with their hearts where the truth is and where lies are hidden . "

german hooligans again created problems for security officials in bratislava . the heady days of the confederations cup in june have turned into an early autumn hangover for the german national squad .
a lucky 2-2 draw against holland on aug .
17 gave way to an embarrassing 2-0 defeat against slovakia .
as has been the case over the course of jürgen klinsmann 's reign as coach , a porous defense proved to be the downfall .
the offense , unlike the exciting matches at the cup in june , proved to be non-existent .
germany 's playmaker michael ballack offered what was probably one of his poorest matches as an international midfielder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when ballack has an off day , then the team has an off day " when he plays poorly , then the team has no one to turn to , " was the sober assessment of former world cup championship coach and player turned television analyst , franz beckenbauer .
bundesliga talent scores double miroslav karhan , who plays in the bundesliga with vfl wolfsburg , scored both goals , converting a penalty in the 20th minute and chipping over keeper jens lehmann for the second seven minutes before the break .
with only six more friendly matches before the world cup starts on june 9 , klinsmann has a true crisis on his hands as the various combinations he has tested in the backfield are proving to be incapable of the high demands of world soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his club kit green here , miroslav karhan scored twice against germany " i 'm very disappointed with the first half , " said klinsmann .
" we made costly individual mistakes and were slow to recover when we lost the ball .
we 've got a lot to work on . "
germany have conceded 10 goals in their last four games , 15 in their last seven , and have kept clean sheets in just two matches in 2005 , against tunisia and slovenia .
slovakia gets boost the victory for slovakia provided a welcome boost ahead of their trip to face latvia on wednesday , a match they must win to stay in the hunt for a world cup place .
slovakia are in second place in group three behind portugal and ahead of russia .
for germany coach jürgen klinsmann , the match will have raised further concerns over a defense that has been leaking goals since the confederations cup .
after a promising start for germany , the hosts turned the game around and then dominated the first half .
slovakia 's midfielder and goalscoring king last season at nuremberg , marek mintal , came close to putting his side on top when he flashed a shot just wide in the 13th minute after the ball had fallen to him at a corner .
the pressure on the german defense continued until per mertesacker cracked when he needlessly held on to robert vittek to give away the penalty .
an at times very insecure-looking slovakian goalkeeper kamil contofalsky was challenged on numerous occasions but the necessary bit of luck or smart play was missing at key moments .
the second strike came in the 38th minute when mintal hooked over a cross from wide on the left and karhan calmly lifted the ball over lehmann , who did little to back up his claim this week that he deserved to play in the world cup ahead of oliver kahn .
the debut performances of marcell jansen and lukas sinkiewicz were less than memorable as they worked their ways slowly into the squad after entering the game in the second half .
the last 45 minutes were generally better , with energetic confed cup stars lukas podolski and bastian schweinsteiger creating chances that still ended in a goose egg .
six hurt in hooligan violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior and sports minister otto schily -lrb- l -rrb- and german soccer legend and head of the organizing comitee for the world cup 2006 franz beckenbauer the sparsely-visited match still managed to attract hooligans who battled with police in the german stands .
six people were hurt , one seriously , according to german soccer association press spokesman harald stenger .
during the match , the hooligans who presumably received tickets from slovakian acquaintances made their presence felt during the match , shouting " we all have stadium bans , " and " otto , we 're here anyway , " in reference to german interior minister otto schily , who was in attendance and whose ministry is in charge of security at next year 's world cup . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hooligans taint slovenian friendly a " friendly " weekend soccer match between germany and slovenia quickly turned sour as before , during and after the game , german fans participated in racist violence , prompting fears of a revival of hooliganism .

german hooligans again created problems for security officials in bratislava . the heady days of the confederations cup in june have turned into an early autumn hangover for the german national squad .
a lucky 2-2 draw against holland on aug .
17 gave way to an embarrassing 2-0 defeat against slovakia .
as has been the case over the course of jürgen klinsmann 's reign as coach , a porous defense proved to be the downfall .
the offense , unlike the exciting matches at the cup in june , proved to be non-existent .
germany 's playmaker michael ballack offered what was probably one of his poorest matches as an international midfielder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when ballack has an off day , then the team has an off day " when he plays poorly , then the team has no one to turn to , " was the sober assessment of former world cup championship coach and player turned television analyst , franz beckenbauer .
bundesliga talent scores double miroslav karhan , who plays in the bundesliga with vfl wolfsburg , scored both goals , converting a penalty in the 20th minute and chipping over keeper jens lehmann for the second seven minutes before the break .
with only six more friendly matches before the world cup starts on june 9 , klinsmann has a true crisis on his hands as the various combinations he has tested in the backfield are proving to be incapable of the high demands of world soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his club kit green here , miroslav karhan scored twice against germany " i 'm very disappointed with the first half , " said klinsmann .
" we made costly individual mistakes and were slow to recover when we lost the ball .
we 've got a lot to work on . "
germany have conceded 10 goals in their last four games , 15 in their last seven , and have kept clean sheets in just two matches in 2005 , against tunisia and slovenia .
slovakia gets boost the victory for slovakia provided a welcome boost ahead of their trip to face latvia on wednesday , a match they must win to stay in the hunt for a world cup place .
slovakia are in second place in group three behind portugal and ahead of russia .
for germany coach jürgen klinsmann , the match will have raised further concerns over a defense that has been leaking goals since the confederations cup .
after a promising start for germany , the hosts turned the game around and then dominated the first half .
slovakia 's midfielder and goalscoring king last season at nuremberg , marek mintal , came close to putting his side on top when he flashed a shot just wide in the 13th minute after the ball had fallen to him at a corner .
the pressure on the german defense continued until per mertesacker cracked when he needlessly held on to robert vittek to give away the penalty .
an at times very insecure-looking slovakian goalkeeper kamil contofalsky was challenged on numerous occasions but the necessary bit of luck or smart play was missing at key moments .
the second strike came in the 38th minute when mintal hooked over a cross from wide on the left and karhan calmly lifted the ball over lehmann , who did little to back up his claim this week that he deserved to play in the world cup ahead of oliver kahn .
the debut performances of marcell jansen and lukas sinkiewicz were less than memorable as they worked their ways slowly into the squad after entering the game in the second half .
the last 45 minutes were generally better , with energetic confed cup stars lukas podolski and bastian schweinsteiger creating chances that still ended in a goose egg .
six hurt in hooligan violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior and sports minister otto schily -lrb- l -rrb- and german soccer legend and head of the organizing comitee for the world cup 2006 franz beckenbauer the sparsely-visited match still managed to attract hooligans who battled with police in the german stands .
six people were hurt , one seriously , according to german soccer association press spokesman harald stenger .
during the match , the hooligans who presumably received tickets from slovakian acquaintances made their presence felt during the match , shouting " we all have stadium bans , " and " otto , we 're here anyway , " in reference to german interior minister otto schily , who was in attendance and whose ministry is in charge of security at next year 's world cup . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hooligans taint slovenian friendly a " friendly " weekend soccer match between germany and slovenia quickly turned sour as before , during and after the game , german fans participated in racist violence , prompting fears of a revival of hooliganism .

26 , 1960 , for the first time in the us history , a debate between presidential candidates was shown on television .
the candidates were john f. kennedy , a democratic senator of massachusetts , and richard m. nixon , the us vice president .
they met in a chicago studio to discuss us domestic matters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john f. kennedy emerged the winner kennedy emerged the apparent winner from this first of four televised debates .
tanned , telegenic kennedy made a much better visual impression than pale , makeup-free , stubble-chinned nixon , who was recovering from the flu .
it was the first time the power of television in political contests became apparent .
the election was held in november and kennedy won 49.7 percent of the popular vote in one of the closest presidential elections in us history , surpassing by a fraction the 49.6 percent received by his republican opponent .
in the 1992 debates , george bush senior was caught on camera checking his watch during a town hall debate with then-governor bill clinton and businessman ross perot .
the gesture gave viewers the distinct impression that the elder bush would rather have been elsewhere .
the most recent debate controversy was bush 's so-called mystery bulge during the 2004 debates .
a tv image from the miami debate reveals what looked like a large solid object between his shoulder blades as he leaned over the lectern to face the moderator .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush shakes hands with john kerry ahead of the 3rd debate some said the bulge under his jacket was a hidden receiver , picking up transmissions from someone offstage who was feeding the president answers through a hidden earpiece .
speculation burned up internet blog sites .
on a few occasions , the president simply stopped speaking for an uncomfortably long time and stared ahead with an odd expression on his face .
was he listening to someone helping him with his response to a question ?
china tv duels are foreign to chinese television , which is no great surprise for a country which does n't tolerate much by way of political discussion .
live political programming is rare , with those programs which do make it on to air , filled with boring political events in which politicians obediently toe the party line .
real politics happens behind closed doors , away from the prying eye of tv cameras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chinese premier zhao ziyang at the beginning of the 1980s , the so-called third generation of party leaders celebrated their debut in front of the cameras .
during the press conference at the end of the 13th party congress -lrb- of the 13th people 's congress -rrb- the new party head zhao ziyang was relaxed and spontaneous with both chinese and western journalists .
that gave birth to a new generation of television-conscious party leaders , but it did n't last long .
zhao ziyang 's political end was also shown live on television in 1989 when millions viewed him shedding tears for the hunger-striking students marching on the gate of heavenly peace .
ziyang was consequently removed from power and placed under house arrest until his death in 2005 .
1989 saw the televising of an altogether different debate , when the then premier of the state council , li peng , faced the student leader , wuer kaixi .
wearing hospital pajamas and breathing apparatus , kaixi posed provocative questions to media-shy peng .
millions of viewers saw their otherwise sovereign leader in disgrace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jiang zemin talks to a cameraman but not all party functionaries are media-shy .
zhao 's successor , jiang zamin , loved television and presented himself as a multi-talented leader with an unconventional style , and was once seen on tv singing " o sole mio . "
in today 's china , party functionaries know how to use tv images to benefit themselves . party head and technocrat wen jiabao was seen crying on tv after a mine accident and put on an emotional display while talking with a very poor farmer .
brazil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian president inacio lula da silva tv debates began in brazil in 1989 when current president luiz inacio lula da silva first ran for office .
after a first tv debate , lula was well positioned to significantly catch up with his opponent , fernando collor de mello .
indeed , just a few days before the election , collor was just one percentage point ahead of lula in the polls .
in the second debate , the most important brazilian broadcaster , globo tv , declared that collor had outperformed lula and aired part of the debate that was unfavorable to lula .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president fernando collor de mello collor de mello is part of a family in the state of alagoas , which has controlled the globo tv station since 1978 .
the media giant supported the military dictatorship -lrb- 1964-1985 -rrb- and has backed all subsequent governments for decades .
ultimately mello won with a 5-percent lead , but the so-called " collor-phenomenon " did n't last long .
two and a half years later , corruption charges forced president collor to resign .
after the last election in 2002 , lula da silva was elected .
today his government is involved in numerous corruption scandals and he is facing a similar impeachment procedure to the one that drove collor from office .
spanish-speaking countries many spanish-speaking countries hold populist tv debates fashioned from the american mold , but there are some distinctions from country to country .
chile has seen the gradual development of a stabile structure for public debate and tv debates have emerged since the end of the pinochet dictatorship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose maria aznar has been and gone as spain 's premier in spain there has only been one tv debate , namely between the socialist felipe gonzalez and the conservative jose maria aznar in 1996 .
mexico had its first tv debate in 1994 .
in contrast to germany , where tv debates are subject to strict rules , mexico has no such regulations .
rather than structured debate , the objective is to discredit one 's political opponents with accusations and insults .
the arab world american-style tv debates are not a feature of the arab world , and are strictly outlawed by the powers that be .
but those same powers are not unaware of the opportunities television offers them in the name of protecting their patch . one of the first to make use of the power of the media was egyptian politician gamal abd an-nasser who allowed a radio broadcast to transmit his announcement of the nationalization of the suez canal . in 1967 , following the devastating defeat in the arab-israeli six-day war , nasser offered the people his resignation during a spontaneous tv appearance , fully aware that the vast majority would call for him to remain in office .
his successor , sadat , was often filmed with his pipe and cane to portray himself as an authentic and down-to-earth leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egyptian president hosni mubarak by contrast , the current president mubarak is perceived as uncharismatic and boring .
during his speeches , officials and members of the media often fall asleep .
and it does n't help that his speeches are televised on all tv channels , often interrupting programs people really want to watch .
the late palestinian president arafat was known for embracing and kissing his guests in front of the cameras .
in addition , he cultivated simple , but symbolic gestures , eating with common people and kissing the hands of ladies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader moammer gadhafi last but not least are the spectacular appearances of the " media star " of arab politics , libya 's moammar gadhafi .
fleeting poses capture him sleeping in a tent and camel back riding .
russia the russian federation was one of the first eastern bloc states where tv debates were introduced for elections .
the first tv battles were organized shortly after the resignation of gorbachev and the breakup of the soviet union on june 19 , 1991 .
millions of soviet citizens followed these tense political shows with a mixture of euphoria , naive hope and child-like faith .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former russian president boris jelzin the first presidential campaign in russia lasted for two weeks and the tv debate provided each candidate with equal time to receive and answer live questions from the audience and moderators .
many top russian politicians , including ex-president boris yeltsin and the current head of the ultra-nationalistic liberal democrats vladimir shirinovski took part .
boris yeltsin was elected as the first president of russia on june 12 , 1991 .
shirinovski disagreed with the polls claiming that he had won and that the polls had been manipulated .
all subsequent debates on russian television were more of a show than a serious political discussion .
during a tv debate between shirinovski and the ex-faction head of the democratic party sps , boris nemzov , the two rivals doused each other with water .
in another case the debaters started a brawl .
during a debate running up to regional presidential elections in the republic tatarstan in 2001 , the former duma delegate sergei shashurin shelled the then president with swear words and relentless accusations .
the president felt insulted and made shashurin appear in court as a result .

26 , 1960 , for the first time in the us history , a debate between presidential candidates was shown on television .
the candidates were john f. kennedy , a democratic senator of massachusetts , and richard m. nixon , the us vice president .
they met in a chicago studio to discuss us domestic matters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john f. kennedy emerged the winner kennedy emerged the apparent winner from this first of four televised debates .
tanned , telegenic kennedy made a much better visual impression than pale , makeup-free , stubble-chinned nixon , who was recovering from the flu .
it was the first time the power of television in political contests became apparent .
the election was held in november and kennedy won 49.7 percent of the popular vote in one of the closest presidential elections in us history , surpassing by a fraction the 49.6 percent received by his republican opponent .
in the 1992 debates , george bush senior was caught on camera checking his watch during a town hall debate with then-governor bill clinton and businessman ross perot .
the gesture gave viewers the distinct impression that the elder bush would rather have been elsewhere .
the most recent debate controversy was bush 's so-called mystery bulge during the 2004 debates .
a tv image from the miami debate reveals what looked like a large solid object between his shoulder blades as he leaned over the lectern to face the moderator .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush shakes hands with john kerry ahead of the 3rd debate some said the bulge under his jacket was a hidden receiver , picking up transmissions from someone offstage who was feeding the president answers through a hidden earpiece .

china tv duels are foreign to chinese television , which is no great surprise for a country which does n't tolerate much by way of political discussion .
live political programming is rare , with those programs which do make it on to air , filled with boring political events in which politicians obediently toe the party line .
real politics happens behind closed doors , away from the prying eye of tv cameras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chinese premier zhao ziyang at the beginning of the 1980s , the so-called third generation of party leaders celebrated their debut in front of the cameras .
during the press conference at the end of the 13th party congress -lrb- of the 13th people 's congress -rrb- the new party head zhao ziyang was relaxed and spontaneous with both chinese and western journalists .
that gave birth to a new generation of television-conscious party leaders , but it did n't last long .
zhao ziyang 's political end was also shown live on television in 1989 when millions viewed him shedding tears for the hunger-striking students marching on the gate of heavenly peace .
ziyang was consequently removed from power and placed under house arrest until his death in 2005 .
1989 saw the televising of an altogether different debate , when the then premier of the state council , li peng , faced the student leader , wuer kaixi .
wearing hospital pajamas and breathing apparatus , kaixi posed provocative questions to media-shy peng .
millions of viewers saw their otherwise sovereign leader in disgrace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jiang zemin talks to a cameraman but not all party functionaries are media-shy .
zhao 's successor , jiang zamin , loved television and presented himself as a multi-talented leader with an unconventional style , and was once seen on tv singing " o sole mio . "
in today 's china , party functionaries know how to use tv images to benefit themselves . party head and technocrat wen jiabao was seen crying on tv after a mine accident and put on an emotional display while talking with a very poor farmer .
brazil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian president inacio lula da silva tv debates began in brazil in 1989 when current president luiz inacio lula da silva first ran for office .
after a first tv debate , lula was well positioned to significantly catch up with his opponent , fernando collor de mello .
indeed , just a few days before the election , collor was just one percentage point ahead of lula in the polls .
in the second debate , the most important brazilian broadcaster , globo tv , declared that collor had outperformed lula and aired part of the debate that was unfavorable to lula .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president fernando collor de mello collor de mello is part of a family in the state of alagoas , which has controlled the globo tv station since 1978 .
the media giant supported the military dictatorship -lrb- 1964-1985 -rrb- and has backed all subsequent governments for decades .
ultimately mello won with a 5-percent lead , but the so-called " collor-phenomenon " did n't last long .
two and a half years later , corruption charges forced president collor to resign .
after the last election in 2002 , lula da silva was elected .
today his government is involved in numerous corruption scandals and he is facing a similar impeachment procedure to the one that drove collor from office .
spanish-speaking countries many spanish-speaking countries hold populist tv debates fashioned from the american mold , but there are some distinctions from country to country .
chile has seen the gradual development of a stabile structure for public debate and tv debates have emerged since the end of the pinochet dictatorship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose maria aznar has been and gone as spain 's premier in spain there has only been one tv debate , namely between the socialist felipe gonzalez and the conservative jose maria aznar in 1996 .
mexico had its first tv debate in 1994 .
in contrast to germany , where tv debates are subject to strict rules , mexico has no such regulations .
rather than structured debate , the objective is to discredit one 's political opponents with accusations and insults .
the arab world american-style tv debates are not a feature of the arab world , and are strictly outlawed by the powers that be .
but those same powers are not unaware of the opportunities television offers them in the name of protecting their patch . one of the first to make use of the power of the media was egyptian politician gamal abd an-nasser who allowed a radio broadcast to transmit his announcement of the nationalization of the suez canal . in 1967 , following the devastating defeat in the arab-israeli six-day war , nasser offered the people his resignation during a spontaneous tv appearance , fully aware that the vast majority would call for him to remain in office .
his successor , sadat , was often filmed with his pipe and cane to portray himself as an authentic and down-to-earth leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egyptian president hosni mubarak by contrast , the current president mubarak is perceived as uncharismatic and boring .
during his speeches , officials and members of the media often fall asleep .
and it does n't help that his speeches are televised on all tv channels , often interrupting programs people really want to watch .
the late palestinian president arafat was known for embracing and kissing his guests in front of the cameras .
in addition , he cultivated simple , but symbolic gestures , eating with common people and kissing the hands of ladies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader moammer gadhafi last but not least are the spectacular appearances of the " media star " of arab politics , libya 's moammar gadhafi .

russia the russian federation was one of the first eastern bloc states where tv debates were introduced for elections .
the first tv battles were organized shortly after the resignation of gorbachev and the breakup of the soviet union on june 19 , 1991 .
millions of soviet citizens followed these tense political shows with a mixture of euphoria , naive hope and child-like faith .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former russian president boris jelzin the first presidential campaign in russia lasted for two weeks and the tv debate provided each candidate with equal time to receive and answer live questions from the audience and moderators .
many top russian politicians , including ex-president boris yeltsin and the current head of the ultra-nationalistic liberal democrats vladimir shirinovski took part .
boris yeltsin was elected as the first president of russia on june 12 , 1991 .
shirinovski disagreed with the polls claiming that he had won and that the polls had been manipulated .
all subsequent debates on russian television were more of a show than a serious political discussion .
during a tv debate between shirinovski and the ex-faction head of the democratic party sps , boris nemzov , the two rivals doused each other with water .
in another case the debaters started a brawl .
during a debate running up to regional presidential elections in the republic tatarstan in 2001 , the former duma delegate sergei shashurin shelled the then president with swear words and relentless accusations .
the president felt insulted and made shashurin appear in court as a result .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin wo n't debate on television the current russian president putin does n't care much for televised political debates and refused to participate during the last presidential election .

two and a half years later , corruption charges forced president collor to resign .
after the last election in 2002 , lula da silva was elected .
today his government is involved in numerous corruption scandals and he is facing a similar impeachment procedure to the one that drove collor from office .
spanish-speaking countries many spanish-speaking countries hold populist tv debates fashioned from the american mold , but there are some distinctions from country to country .
chile has seen the gradual development of a stabile structure for public debate and tv debates have emerged since the end of the pinochet dictatorship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose maria aznar has been and gone as spain 's premier in spain there has only been one tv debate , namely between the socialist felipe gonzalez and the conservative jose maria aznar in 1996 .
mexico had its first tv debate in 1994 .
in contrast to germany , where tv debates are subject to strict rules , mexico has no such regulations .
rather than structured debate , the objective is to discredit one 's political opponents with accusations and insults .
the arab world american-style tv debates are not a feature of the arab world , and are strictly outlawed by the powers that be .
but those same powers are not unaware of the opportunities television offers them in the name of protecting their patch . one of the first to make use of the power of the media was egyptian politician gamal abd an-nasser who allowed a radio broadcast to transmit his announcement of the nationalization of the suez canal . in 1967 , following the devastating defeat in the arab-israeli six-day war , nasser offered the people his resignation during a spontaneous tv appearance , fully aware that the vast majority would call for him to remain in office .
his successor , sadat , was often filmed with his pipe and cane to portray himself as an authentic and down-to-earth leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egyptian president hosni mubarak by contrast , the current president mubarak is perceived as uncharismatic and boring .
during his speeches , officials and members of the media often fall asleep .
and it does n't help that his speeches are televised on all tv channels , often interrupting programs people really want to watch .
the late palestinian president arafat was known for embracing and kissing his guests in front of the cameras .
in addition , he cultivated simple , but symbolic gestures , eating with common people and kissing the hands of ladies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader moammer gadhafi last but not least are the spectacular appearances of the " media star " of arab politics , libya 's moammar gadhafi .
fleeting poses capture him sleeping in a tent and camel back riding .
russia the russian federation was one of the first eastern bloc states where tv debates were introduced for elections .
the first tv battles were organized shortly after the resignation of gorbachev and the breakup of the soviet union on june 19 , 1991 .
millions of soviet citizens followed these tense political shows with a mixture of euphoria , naive hope and child-like faith .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former russian president boris jelzin the first presidential campaign in russia lasted for two weeks and the tv debate provided each candidate with equal time to receive and answer live questions from the audience and moderators .
many top russian politicians , including ex-president boris yeltsin and the current head of the ultra-nationalistic liberal democrats vladimir shirinovski took part .
boris yeltsin was elected as the first president of russia on june 12 , 1991 .
shirinovski disagreed with the polls claiming that he had won and that the polls had been manipulated .
all subsequent debates on russian television were more of a show than a serious political discussion .
during a tv debate between shirinovski and the ex-faction head of the democratic party sps , boris nemzov , the two rivals doused each other with water .
in another case the debaters started a brawl .
during a debate running up to regional presidential elections in the republic tatarstan in 2001 , the former duma delegate sergei shashurin shelled the then president with swear words and relentless accusations .
the president felt insulted and made shashurin appear in court as a result .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin wo n't debate on television the current russian president putin does n't care much for televised political debates and refused to participate during the last presidential election .
" i already know every word of my competitor , " putin said .
" of course , you can try different tricks .
you can sing and dance .
but the people in our country can still decide with their hearts where the truth is and where lies are hidden . "
the tv debate in 2003 took place without putin and was n't aired live , but pre-recorded and edited . dw staff -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany braces for election tv duel while conservative challenger angela merkel is too busy to appear in two tv debates , media-savvy chancellor schröder is even eager to go for a duel with himself .

as has been the case over the course of jürgen klinsmann 's reign as coach , a porous defense proved to be the downfall .

germany 's playmaker michael ballack offered what was probably one of his poorest matches as an international midfielder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when ballack has an off day , then the team has an off day " when he plays poorly , then the team has no one to turn to , " was the sober assessment of former world cup championship coach and player turned television analyst , franz beckenbauer .

with only six more friendly matches before the world cup starts on june 9 , klinsmann has a true crisis on his hands as the various combinations he has tested in the backfield are proving to be incapable of the high demands of world soccer .

slovakia are in second place in group three behind portugal and ahead of russia .
for germany coach jürgen klinsmann , the match will have raised further concerns over a defense that has been leaking goals since the confederations cup .
after a promising start for germany , the hosts turned the game around and then dominated the first half .
slovakia 's midfielder and goalscoring king last season at nuremberg , marek mintal , came close to putting his side on top when he flashed a shot just wide in the 13th minute after the ball had fallen to him at a corner .
the pressure on the german defense continued until per mertesacker cracked when he needlessly held on to robert vittek to give away the penalty .
an at times very insecure-looking slovakian goalkeeper kamil contofalsky was challenged on numerous occasions but the necessary bit of luck or smart play was missing at key moments .
the second strike came in the 38th minute when mintal hooked over a cross from wide on the left and karhan calmly lifted the ball over lehmann , who did little to back up his claim this week that he deserved to play in the world cup ahead of oliver kahn .

26 , 1960 , for the first time in the us history , a debate between presidential candidates was shown on television .
the candidates were john f. kennedy , a democratic senator of massachusetts , and richard m. nixon , the us vice president .
they met in a chicago studio to discuss us domestic matters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john f. kennedy emerged the winner kennedy emerged the apparent winner from this first of four televised debates .
tanned , telegenic kennedy made a much better visual impression than pale , makeup-free , stubble-chinned nixon , who was recovering from the flu .
it was the first time the power of television in political contests became apparent .
the election was held in november and kennedy won 49.7 percent of the popular vote in one of the closest presidential elections in us history , surpassing by a fraction the 49.6 percent received by his republican opponent .
in the 1992 debates , george bush senior was caught on camera checking his watch during a town hall debate with then-governor bill clinton and businessman ross perot .
the gesture gave viewers the distinct impression that the elder bush would rather have been elsewhere .
the most recent debate controversy was bush 's so-called mystery bulge during the 2004 debates .
a tv image from the miami debate reveals what looked like a large solid object between his shoulder blades as he leaned over the lectern to face the moderator .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush shakes hands with john kerry ahead of the 3rd debate some said the bulge under his jacket was a hidden receiver , picking up transmissions from someone offstage who was feeding the president answers through a hidden earpiece .
speculation burned up internet blog sites .
on a few occasions , the president simply stopped speaking for an uncomfortably long time and stared ahead with an odd expression on his face .
was he listening to someone helping him with his response to a question ?
china tv duels are foreign to chinese television , which is no great surprise for a country which does n't tolerate much by way of political discussion .
live political programming is rare , with those programs which do make it on to air , filled with boring political events in which politicians obediently toe the party line .
real politics happens behind closed doors , away from the prying eye of tv cameras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chinese premier zhao ziyang at the beginning of the 1980s , the so-called third generation of party leaders celebrated their debut in front of the cameras .
during the press conference at the end of the 13th party congress -lrb- of the 13th people 's congress -rrb- the new party head zhao ziyang was relaxed and spontaneous with both chinese and western journalists .
that gave birth to a new generation of television-conscious party leaders , but it did n't last long .
zhao ziyang 's political end was also shown live on television in 1989 when millions viewed him shedding tears for the hunger-striking students marching on the gate of heavenly peace .
ziyang was consequently removed from power and placed under house arrest until his death in 2005 .
1989 saw the televising of an altogether different debate , when the then premier of the state council , li peng , faced the student leader , wuer kaixi .
wearing hospital pajamas and breathing apparatus , kaixi posed provocative questions to media-shy peng .
millions of viewers saw their otherwise sovereign leader in disgrace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jiang zemin talks to a cameraman but not all party functionaries are media-shy .
zhao 's successor , jiang zamin , loved television and presented himself as a multi-talented leader with an unconventional style , and was once seen on tv singing " o sole mio . "
in today 's china , party functionaries know how to use tv images to benefit themselves . party head and technocrat wen jiabao was seen crying on tv after a mine accident and put on an emotional display while talking with a very poor farmer .
brazil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian president inacio lula da silva tv debates began in brazil in 1989 when current president luiz inacio lula da silva first ran for office .
after a first tv debate , lula was well positioned to significantly catch up with his opponent , fernando collor de mello .
indeed , just a few days before the election , collor was just one percentage point ahead of lula in the polls .
in the second debate , the most important brazilian broadcaster , globo tv , declared that collor had outperformed lula and aired part of the debate that was unfavorable to lula .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president fernando collor de mello collor de mello is part of a family in the state of alagoas , which has controlled the globo tv station since 1978 .
the media giant supported the military dictatorship -lrb- 1964-1985 -rrb- and has backed all subsequent governments for decades .
ultimately mello won with a 5-percent lead , but the so-called " collor-phenomenon " did n't last long .
two and a half years later , corruption charges forced president collor to resign .
after the last election in 2002 , lula da silva was elected .
today his government is involved in numerous corruption scandals and he is facing a similar impeachment procedure to the one that drove collor from office .
spanish-speaking countries many spanish-speaking countries hold populist tv debates fashioned from the american mold , but there are some distinctions from country to country .
chile has seen the gradual development of a stabile structure for public debate and tv debates have emerged since the end of the pinochet dictatorship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose maria aznar has been and gone as spain 's premier in spain there has only been one tv debate , namely between the socialist felipe gonzalez and the conservative jose maria aznar in 1996 .
mexico had its first tv debate in 1994 .
in contrast to germany , where tv debates are subject to strict rules , mexico has no such regulations .
rather than structured debate , the objective is to discredit one 's political opponents with accusations and insults .
the arab world american-style tv debates are not a feature of the arab world , and are strictly outlawed by the powers that be .
but those same powers are not unaware of the opportunities television offers them in the name of protecting their patch . one of the first to make use of the power of the media was egyptian politician gamal abd an-nasser who allowed a radio broadcast to transmit his announcement of the nationalization of the suez canal . in 1967 , following the devastating defeat in the arab-israeli six-day war , nasser offered the people his resignation during a spontaneous tv appearance , fully aware that the vast majority would call for him to remain in office .
his successor , sadat , was often filmed with his pipe and cane to portray himself as an authentic and down-to-earth leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egyptian president hosni mubarak by contrast , the current president mubarak is perceived as uncharismatic and boring .
during his speeches , officials and members of the media often fall asleep .
and it does n't help that his speeches are televised on all tv channels , often interrupting programs people really want to watch .
the late palestinian president arafat was known for embracing and kissing his guests in front of the cameras .
in addition , he cultivated simple , but symbolic gestures , eating with common people and kissing the hands of ladies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader moammer gadhafi last but not least are the spectacular appearances of the " media star " of arab politics , libya 's moammar gadhafi .
fleeting poses capture him sleeping in a tent and camel back riding .
russia the russian federation was one of the first eastern bloc states where tv debates were introduced for elections .
the first tv battles were organized shortly after the resignation of gorbachev and the breakup of the soviet union on june 19 , 1991 .
millions of soviet citizens followed these tense political shows with a mixture of euphoria , naive hope and child-like faith .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former russian president boris jelzin the first presidential campaign in russia lasted for two weeks and the tv debate provided each candidate with equal time to receive and answer live questions from the audience and moderators .
many top russian politicians , including ex-president boris yeltsin and the current head of the ultra-nationalistic liberal democrats vladimir shirinovski took part .
boris yeltsin was elected as the first president of russia on june 12 , 1991 .
shirinovski disagreed with the polls claiming that he had won and that the polls had been manipulated .
all subsequent debates on russian television were more of a show than a serious political discussion .
during a tv debate between shirinovski and the ex-faction head of the democratic party sps , boris nemzov , the two rivals doused each other with water .
in another case the debaters started a brawl .
during a debate running up to regional presidential elections in the republic tatarstan in 2001 , the former duma delegate sergei shashurin shelled the then president with swear words and relentless accusations .
the president felt insulted and made shashurin appear in court as a result .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin wo n't debate on television the current russian president putin does n't care much for televised political debates and refused to participate during the last presidential election .
" i already know every word of my competitor , " putin said .

26 , 1960 , for the first time in the us history , a debate between presidential candidates was shown on television .
the candidates were john f. kennedy , a democratic senator of massachusetts , and richard m. nixon , the us vice president .
they met in a chicago studio to discuss us domestic matters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john f. kennedy emerged the winner kennedy emerged the apparent winner from this first of four televised debates .
tanned , telegenic kennedy made a much better visual impression than pale , makeup-free , stubble-chinned nixon , who was recovering from the flu .
it was the first time the power of television in political contests became apparent .
the election was held in november and kennedy won 49.7 percent of the popular vote in one of the closest presidential elections in us history , surpassing by a fraction the 49.6 percent received by his republican opponent .
in the 1992 debates , george bush senior was caught on camera checking his watch during a town hall debate with then-governor bill clinton and businessman ross perot .
the gesture gave viewers the distinct impression that the elder bush would rather have been elsewhere .
the most recent debate controversy was bush 's so-called mystery bulge during the 2004 debates .
a tv image from the miami debate reveals what looked like a large solid object between his shoulder blades as he leaned over the lectern to face the moderator .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush shakes hands with john kerry ahead of the 3rd debate some said the bulge under his jacket was a hidden receiver , picking up transmissions from someone offstage who was feeding the president answers through a hidden earpiece .

china tv duels are foreign to chinese television , which is no great surprise for a country which does n't tolerate much by way of political discussion .
live political programming is rare , with those programs which do make it on to air , filled with boring political events in which politicians obediently toe the party line .
real politics happens behind closed doors , away from the prying eye of tv cameras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chinese premier zhao ziyang at the beginning of the 1980s , the so-called third generation of party leaders celebrated their debut in front of the cameras .
during the press conference at the end of the 13th party congress -lrb- of the 13th people 's congress -rrb- the new party head zhao ziyang was relaxed and spontaneous with both chinese and western journalists .
that gave birth to a new generation of television-conscious party leaders , but it did n't last long .
zhao ziyang 's political end was also shown live on television in 1989 when millions viewed him shedding tears for the hunger-striking students marching on the gate of heavenly peace .
ziyang was consequently removed from power and placed under house arrest until his death in 2005 .
1989 saw the televising of an altogether different debate , when the then premier of the state council , li peng , faced the student leader , wuer kaixi .
wearing hospital pajamas and breathing apparatus , kaixi posed provocative questions to media-shy peng .
millions of viewers saw their otherwise sovereign leader in disgrace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jiang zemin talks to a cameraman but not all party functionaries are media-shy .
zhao 's successor , jiang zamin , loved television and presented himself as a multi-talented leader with an unconventional style , and was once seen on tv singing " o sole mio . "
in today 's china , party functionaries know how to use tv images to benefit themselves . party head and technocrat wen jiabao was seen crying on tv after a mine accident and put on an emotional display while talking with a very poor farmer .
brazil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian president inacio lula da silva tv debates began in brazil in 1989 when current president luiz inacio lula da silva first ran for office .
after a first tv debate , lula was well positioned to significantly catch up with his opponent , fernando collor de mello .
indeed , just a few days before the election , collor was just one percentage point ahead of lula in the polls .
in the second debate , the most important brazilian broadcaster , globo tv , declared that collor had outperformed lula and aired part of the debate that was unfavorable to lula .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president fernando collor de mello collor de mello is part of a family in the state of alagoas , which has controlled the globo tv station since 1978 .
the media giant supported the military dictatorship -lrb- 1964-1985 -rrb- and has backed all subsequent governments for decades .
ultimately mello won with a 5-percent lead , but the so-called " collor-phenomenon " did n't last long .
two and a half years later , corruption charges forced president collor to resign .
after the last election in 2002 , lula da silva was elected .
today his government is involved in numerous corruption scandals and he is facing a similar impeachment procedure to the one that drove collor from office .
spanish-speaking countries many spanish-speaking countries hold populist tv debates fashioned from the american mold , but there are some distinctions from country to country .
chile has seen the gradual development of a stabile structure for public debate and tv debates have emerged since the end of the pinochet dictatorship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose maria aznar has been and gone as spain 's premier in spain there has only been one tv debate , namely between the socialist felipe gonzalez and the conservative jose maria aznar in 1996 .
mexico had its first tv debate in 1994 .
in contrast to germany , where tv debates are subject to strict rules , mexico has no such regulations .
rather than structured debate , the objective is to discredit one 's political opponents with accusations and insults .
the arab world american-style tv debates are not a feature of the arab world , and are strictly outlawed by the powers that be .
but those same powers are not unaware of the opportunities television offers them in the name of protecting their patch . one of the first to make use of the power of the media was egyptian politician gamal abd an-nasser who allowed a radio broadcast to transmit his announcement of the nationalization of the suez canal . in 1967 , following the devastating defeat in the arab-israeli six-day war , nasser offered the people his resignation during a spontaneous tv appearance , fully aware that the vast majority would call for him to remain in office .
his successor , sadat , was often filmed with his pipe and cane to portray himself as an authentic and down-to-earth leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egyptian president hosni mubarak by contrast , the current president mubarak is perceived as uncharismatic and boring .
during his speeches , officials and members of the media often fall asleep .
and it does n't help that his speeches are televised on all tv channels , often interrupting programs people really want to watch .
the late palestinian president arafat was known for embracing and kissing his guests in front of the cameras .
in addition , he cultivated simple , but symbolic gestures , eating with common people and kissing the hands of ladies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader moammer gadhafi last but not least are the spectacular appearances of the " media star " of arab politics , libya 's moammar gadhafi .

russia the russian federation was one of the first eastern bloc states where tv debates were introduced for elections .
the first tv battles were organized shortly after the resignation of gorbachev and the breakup of the soviet union on june 19 , 1991 .
millions of soviet citizens followed these tense political shows with a mixture of euphoria , naive hope and child-like faith .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former russian president boris jelzin the first presidential campaign in russia lasted for two weeks and the tv debate provided each candidate with equal time to receive and answer live questions from the audience and moderators .
many top russian politicians , including ex-president boris yeltsin and the current head of the ultra-nationalistic liberal democrats vladimir shirinovski took part .
boris yeltsin was elected as the first president of russia on june 12 , 1991 .
shirinovski disagreed with the polls claiming that he had won and that the polls had been manipulated .
all subsequent debates on russian television were more of a show than a serious political discussion .
during a tv debate between shirinovski and the ex-faction head of the democratic party sps , boris nemzov , the two rivals doused each other with water .
in another case the debaters started a brawl .
during a debate running up to regional presidential elections in the republic tatarstan in 2001 , the former duma delegate sergei shashurin shelled the then president with swear words and relentless accusations .
the president felt insulted and made shashurin appear in court as a result .

brazil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian president inacio lula da silva tv debates began in brazil in 1989 when current president luiz inacio lula da silva first ran for office .
after a first tv debate , lula was well positioned to significantly catch up with his opponent , fernando collor de mello .
indeed , just a few days before the election , collor was just one percentage point ahead of lula in the polls .
in the second debate , the most important brazilian broadcaster , globo tv , declared that collor had outperformed lula and aired part of the debate that was unfavorable to lula .

ultimately mello won with a 5-percent lead , but the so-called " collor-phenomenon " did n't last long .
two and a half years later , corruption charges forced president collor to resign .
after the last election in 2002 , lula da silva was elected .

26 , 1960 , for the first time in the us history , a debate between presidential candidates was shown on television .
the candidates were john f. kennedy , a democratic senator of massachusetts , and richard m. nixon , the us vice president .
they met in a chicago studio to discuss us domestic matters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john f. kennedy emerged the winner kennedy emerged the apparent winner from this first of four televised debates .
tanned , telegenic kennedy made a much better visual impression than pale , makeup-free , stubble-chinned nixon , who was recovering from the flu .
it was the first time the power of television in political contests became apparent .
the election was held in november and kennedy won 49.7 percent of the popular vote in one of the closest presidential elections in us history , surpassing by a fraction the 49.6 percent received by his republican opponent .
in the 1992 debates , george bush senior was caught on camera checking his watch during a town hall debate with then-governor bill clinton and businessman ross perot .
the gesture gave viewers the distinct impression that the elder bush would rather have been elsewhere .
the most recent debate controversy was bush 's so-called mystery bulge during the 2004 debates .
a tv image from the miami debate reveals what looked like a large solid object between his shoulder blades as he leaned over the lectern to face the moderator .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush shakes hands with john kerry ahead of the 3rd debate some said the bulge under his jacket was a hidden receiver , picking up transmissions from someone offstage who was feeding the president answers through a hidden earpiece .
speculation burned up internet blog sites .
on a few occasions , the president simply stopped speaking for an uncomfortably long time and stared ahead with an odd expression on his face .
was he listening to someone helping him with his response to a question ?
china tv duels are foreign to chinese television , which is no great surprise for a country which does n't tolerate much by way of political discussion .
live political programming is rare , with those programs which do make it on to air , filled with boring political events in which politicians obediently toe the party line .
real politics happens behind closed doors , away from the prying eye of tv cameras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chinese premier zhao ziyang at the beginning of the 1980s , the so-called third generation of party leaders celebrated their debut in front of the cameras .
during the press conference at the end of the 13th party congress -lrb- of the 13th people 's congress -rrb- the new party head zhao ziyang was relaxed and spontaneous with both chinese and western journalists .
that gave birth to a new generation of television-conscious party leaders , but it did n't last long .
zhao ziyang 's political end was also shown live on television in 1989 when millions viewed him shedding tears for the hunger-striking students marching on the gate of heavenly peace .
ziyang was consequently removed from power and placed under house arrest until his death in 2005 .
1989 saw the televising of an altogether different debate , when the then premier of the state council , li peng , faced the student leader , wuer kaixi .
wearing hospital pajamas and breathing apparatus , kaixi posed provocative questions to media-shy peng .
millions of viewers saw their otherwise sovereign leader in disgrace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jiang zemin talks to a cameraman but not all party functionaries are media-shy .

german hooligans again created problems for security officials in bratislava . the heady days of the confederations cup in june have turned into an early autumn hangover for the german national squad .
a lucky 2-2 draw against holland on aug .
17 gave way to an embarrassing 2-0 defeat against slovakia .
as has been the case over the course of jürgen klinsmann 's reign as coach , a porous defense proved to be the downfall .
the offense , unlike the exciting matches at the cup in june , proved to be non-existent .
germany 's playmaker michael ballack offered what was probably one of his poorest matches as an international midfielder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when ballack has an off day , then the team has an off day " when he plays poorly , then the team has no one to turn to , " was the sober assessment of former world cup championship coach and player turned television analyst , franz beckenbauer .
bundesliga talent scores double miroslav karhan , who plays in the bundesliga with vfl wolfsburg , scored both goals , converting a penalty in the 20th minute and chipping over keeper jens lehmann for the second seven minutes before the break .
with only six more friendly matches before the world cup starts on june 9 , klinsmann has a true crisis on his hands as the various combinations he has tested in the backfield are proving to be incapable of the high demands of world soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his club kit green here , miroslav karhan scored twice against germany " i 'm very disappointed with the first half , " said klinsmann .
" we made costly individual mistakes and were slow to recover when we lost the ball .
we 've got a lot to work on . "
germany have conceded 10 goals in their last four games , 15 in their last seven , and have kept clean sheets in just two matches in 2005 , against tunisia and slovenia .
slovakia gets boost the victory for slovakia provided a welcome boost ahead of their trip to face latvia on wednesday , a match they must win to stay in the hunt for a world cup place .
slovakia are in second place in group three behind portugal and ahead of russia .
for germany coach jürgen klinsmann , the match will have raised further concerns over a defense that has been leaking goals since the confederations cup .
after a promising start for germany , the hosts turned the game around and then dominated the first half .
slovakia 's midfielder and goalscoring king last season at nuremberg , marek mintal , came close to putting his side on top when he flashed a shot just wide in the 13th minute after the ball had fallen to him at a corner .
the pressure on the german defense continued until per mertesacker cracked when he needlessly held on to robert vittek to give away the penalty .
an at times very insecure-looking slovakian goalkeeper kamil contofalsky was challenged on numerous occasions but the necessary bit of luck or smart play was missing at key moments .
the second strike came in the 38th minute when mintal hooked over a cross from wide on the left and karhan calmly lifted the ball over lehmann , who did little to back up his claim this week that he deserved to play in the world cup ahead of oliver kahn .
the debut performances of marcell jansen and lukas sinkiewicz were less than memorable as they worked their ways slowly into the squad after entering the game in the second half .
the last 45 minutes were generally better , with energetic confed cup stars lukas podolski and bastian schweinsteiger creating chances that still ended in a goose egg .
six hurt in hooligan violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior and sports minister otto schily -lrb- l -rrb- and german soccer legend and head of the organizing comitee for the world cup 2006 franz beckenbauer the sparsely-visited match still managed to attract hooligans who battled with police in the german stands .
six people were hurt , one seriously , according to german soccer association press spokesman harald stenger .
during the match , the hooligans who presumably received tickets from slovakian acquaintances made their presence felt during the match , shouting " we all have stadium bans , " and " otto , we 're here anyway , " in reference to german interior minister otto schily , who was in attendance and whose ministry is in charge of security at next year 's world cup . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hooligans taint slovenian friendly a " friendly " weekend soccer match between germany and slovenia quickly turned sour as before , during and after the game , german fans participated in racist violence , prompting fears of a revival of hooliganism .

31 , club directors were active : bundesliga teams seeking to change their fortunes or improve already good starts hired young brazilians in numbers . abuda , kahe , romulo and rafinha : the names are n't as familiar as ronaldo , ronaldinho or new international superstar striker robinho .
the old brazilian guard in the bundesliga , lucio , marcelinho or ze roberto also may not be so acquainted with the youngsters .
yet a flurry of deals before the aug .
31 transfer deadline has brought a slew of young brazilians , predominantly forwards , to germany .
last year 's league runners-up schalke dug deepest and paid 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6.2 million -rrb- for their latest brazilian player , 19-year-old rafinha .
unlike the other three , marcio rafael ferreira de souza , short rafinha , is a defender .
germany has already faced the 1.72 meter -lrb- 5 foot 10 inch -rrb- back man , but not at the confederations cup , rather at the u-20 world championships in holland .
" rafinha made a very good impression during the tournament , " said schalke general manager rudi assauer .
like bayern munich 's lucio -lrb- photo -rrb- , rafinha is not shy of scoring goals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : similar to bayern munich 's lucio , rafinha likes the joy of scoring a goal " like most brazilian defenders he is strong going forward , " team manager andreas müller added .
" he 's able to switch quickly from defense to attack , exert pressure down the flank and put in good crosses .
he 's also dangerous in front of the goal . "
in 13 matches this season with his previous club coritiba fc , he scored three times .
and his extra-time winner knocked out the u-20 german side in june .
forwards !
borussia mönchengladbach , already home to brazilian striker giovane elber , found it necessary to help out their elder statesman -lrb- 33 -rrb- with the 23-year-old kahe .
the deal with top first-league brazilian club palmeiras sao paolo cost 1.2 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giovane elber during his stint with bayern munich .
he is the bundesliga 's most successful goalscorer from abroad " he is a physically robust , attacking striker , exactly the kind of player that 's been missing in our offense , " said club director peter pander .
indeed kahe 's goal-scoring services are needed .
in three bundesliga matches so far , gladbach have netted a paltry two goals and lie in 16th place in the standings .
questio n marks the other two brazilian newcomers are big question marks , both to the league , and admittedly to team coaches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuda in one of his first practice sessions with wolfsburg adailiton pereira coelho , called abuda , signed a contract until 2008 with wolfsburg .
holger fach called the signing a bit of an unknown quantity .
" but i have full faith in our chief scouts ralph kellermann and ulil mohr , " the wolfsburg coach said .
decisive in the deal for abuda , however , was the advice of former wolfsburg player and brazilian friend fernando baiano .
" wolfsburg is not a foreign word to me , " the 19-year-old striker said .
" my mate baiano only had nice things to say about the club . "
the northern german town may not be foreign to him but many brazilians criticize abuda for being a little foreign in front of the net and wasting too many chances .
mainz is looking to make up for their poor jump out of the starting blocks with romulo .
he 's on loan for the remainder of the season from brazilian second-league side ituano .
there he had scored six times in the current season .
" romulo is comfortable with the ball and has a nose for the goal , " said mainz coach jürgen klopp about the 23-year-old .

26 , 1960 , for the first time in the us history , a debate between presidential candidates was shown on television .
the candidates were john f. kennedy , a democratic senator of massachusetts , and richard m. nixon , the us vice president .
they met in a chicago studio to discuss us domestic matters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john f. kennedy emerged the winner kennedy emerged the apparent winner from this first of four televised debates .
tanned , telegenic kennedy made a much better visual impression than pale , makeup-free , stubble-chinned nixon , who was recovering from the flu .
it was the first time the power of television in political contests became apparent .
the election was held in november and kennedy won 49.7 percent of the popular vote in one of the closest presidential elections in us history , surpassing by a fraction the 49.6 percent received by his republican opponent .
in the 1992 debates , george bush senior was caught on camera checking his watch during a town hall debate with then-governor bill clinton and businessman ross perot .
the gesture gave viewers the distinct impression that the elder bush would rather have been elsewhere .
the most recent debate controversy was bush 's so-called mystery bulge during the 2004 debates .
a tv image from the miami debate reveals what looked like a large solid object between his shoulder blades as he leaned over the lectern to face the moderator .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush shakes hands with john kerry ahead of the 3rd debate some said the bulge under his jacket was a hidden receiver , picking up transmissions from someone offstage who was feeding the president answers through a hidden earpiece .
speculation burned up internet blog sites .
on a few occasions , the president simply stopped speaking for an uncomfortably long time and stared ahead with an odd expression on his face .
was he listening to someone helping him with his response to a question ?
china tv duels are foreign to chinese television , which is no great surprise for a country which does n't tolerate much by way of political discussion .
live political programming is rare , with those programs which do make it on to air , filled with boring political events in which politicians obediently toe the party line .
real politics happens behind closed doors , away from the prying eye of tv cameras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chinese premier zhao ziyang at the beginning of the 1980s , the so-called third generation of party leaders celebrated their debut in front of the cameras .
during the press conference at the end of the 13th party congress -lrb- of the 13th people 's congress -rrb- the new party head zhao ziyang was relaxed and spontaneous with both chinese and western journalists .
that gave birth to a new generation of television-conscious party leaders , but it did n't last long .
zhao ziyang 's political end was also shown live on television in 1989 when millions viewed him shedding tears for the hunger-striking students marching on the gate of heavenly peace .
ziyang was consequently removed from power and placed under house arrest until his death in 2005 .
1989 saw the televising of an altogether different debate , when the then premier of the state council , li peng , faced the student leader , wuer kaixi .
wearing hospital pajamas and breathing apparatus , kaixi posed provocative questions to media-shy peng .
millions of viewers saw their otherwise sovereign leader in disgrace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jiang zemin talks to a cameraman but not all party functionaries are media-shy .
zhao 's successor , jiang zamin , loved television and presented himself as a multi-talented leader with an unconventional style , and was once seen on tv singing " o sole mio . "
in today 's china , party functionaries know how to use tv images to benefit themselves . party head and technocrat wen jiabao was seen crying on tv after a mine accident and put on an emotional display while talking with a very poor farmer .
brazil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian president inacio lula da silva tv debates began in brazil in 1989 when current president luiz inacio lula da silva first ran for office .
after a first tv debate , lula was well positioned to significantly catch up with his opponent , fernando collor de mello .
indeed , just a few days before the election , collor was just one percentage point ahead of lula in the polls .
in the second debate , the most important brazilian broadcaster , globo tv , declared that collor had outperformed lula and aired part of the debate that was unfavorable to lula .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president fernando collor de mello collor de mello is part of a family in the state of alagoas , which has controlled the globo tv station since 1978 .
the media giant supported the military dictatorship -lrb- 1964-1985 -rrb- and has backed all subsequent governments for decades .
ultimately mello won with a 5-percent lead , but the so-called " collor-phenomenon " did n't last long .
two and a half years later , corruption charges forced president collor to resign .
after the last election in 2002 , lula da silva was elected .
today his government is involved in numerous corruption scandals and he is facing a similar impeachment procedure to the one that drove collor from office .
spanish-speaking countries many spanish-speaking countries hold populist tv debates fashioned from the american mold , but there are some distinctions from country to country .
chile has seen the gradual development of a stabile structure for public debate and tv debates have emerged since the end of the pinochet dictatorship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose maria aznar has been and gone as spain 's premier in spain there has only been one tv debate , namely between the socialist felipe gonzalez and the conservative jose maria aznar in 1996 .
mexico had its first tv debate in 1994 .
in contrast to germany , where tv debates are subject to strict rules , mexico has no such regulations .
rather than structured debate , the objective is to discredit one 's political opponents with accusations and insults .
the arab world american-style tv debates are not a feature of the arab world , and are strictly outlawed by the powers that be .
but those same powers are not unaware of the opportunities television offers them in the name of protecting their patch . one of the first to make use of the power of the media was egyptian politician gamal abd an-nasser who allowed a radio broadcast to transmit his announcement of the nationalization of the suez canal . in 1967 , following the devastating defeat in the arab-israeli six-day war , nasser offered the people his resignation during a spontaneous tv appearance , fully aware that the vast majority would call for him to remain in office .
his successor , sadat , was often filmed with his pipe and cane to portray himself as an authentic and down-to-earth leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egyptian president hosni mubarak by contrast , the current president mubarak is perceived as uncharismatic and boring .
during his speeches , officials and members of the media often fall asleep .
and it does n't help that his speeches are televised on all tv channels , often interrupting programs people really want to watch .
the late palestinian president arafat was known for embracing and kissing his guests in front of the cameras .
in addition , he cultivated simple , but symbolic gestures , eating with common people and kissing the hands of ladies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader moammer gadhafi last but not least are the spectacular appearances of the " media star " of arab politics , libya 's moammar gadhafi .
fleeting poses capture him sleeping in a tent and camel back riding .
russia the russian federation was one of the first eastern bloc states where tv debates were introduced for elections .
the first tv battles were organized shortly after the resignation of gorbachev and the breakup of the soviet union on june 19 , 1991 .
millions of soviet citizens followed these tense political shows with a mixture of euphoria , naive hope and child-like faith .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former russian president boris jelzin the first presidential campaign in russia lasted for two weeks and the tv debate provided each candidate with equal time to receive and answer live questions from the audience and moderators .
many top russian politicians , including ex-president boris yeltsin and the current head of the ultra-nationalistic liberal democrats vladimir shirinovski took part .
boris yeltsin was elected as the first president of russia on june 12 , 1991 .
shirinovski disagreed with the polls claiming that he had won and that the polls had been manipulated .
all subsequent debates on russian television were more of a show than a serious political discussion .
during a tv debate between shirinovski and the ex-faction head of the democratic party sps , boris nemzov , the two rivals doused each other with water .
in another case the debaters started a brawl .
during a debate running up to regional presidential elections in the republic tatarstan in 2001 , the former duma delegate sergei shashurin shelled the then president with swear words and relentless accusations .
the president felt insulted and made shashurin appear in court as a result .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin wo n't debate on television the current russian president putin does n't care much for televised political debates and refused to participate during the last presidential election .
" i already know every word of my competitor , " putin said .
" of course , you can try different tricks .
you can sing and dance .
but the people in our country can still decide with their hearts where the truth is and where lies are hidden . "
the tv debate in 2003 took place without putin and was n't aired live , but pre-recorded and edited . dw staff -lrb- mh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany braces for election tv duel while conservative challenger angela merkel is too busy to appear in two tv debates , media-savvy chancellor schröder is even eager to go for a duel with himself .

26 , 1960 , for the first time in the us history , a debate between presidential candidates was shown on television .
the candidates were john f. kennedy , a democratic senator of massachusetts , and richard m. nixon , the us vice president .
they met in a chicago studio to discuss us domestic matters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john f. kennedy emerged the winner kennedy emerged the apparent winner from this first of four televised debates .
tanned , telegenic kennedy made a much better visual impression than pale , makeup-free , stubble-chinned nixon , who was recovering from the flu .
it was the first time the power of television in political contests became apparent .
the election was held in november and kennedy won 49.7 percent of the popular vote in one of the closest presidential elections in us history , surpassing by a fraction the 49.6 percent received by his republican opponent .
in the 1992 debates , george bush senior was caught on camera checking his watch during a town hall debate with then-governor bill clinton and businessman ross perot .
the gesture gave viewers the distinct impression that the elder bush would rather have been elsewhere .
the most recent debate controversy was bush 's so-called mystery bulge during the 2004 debates .
a tv image from the miami debate reveals what looked like a large solid object between his shoulder blades as he leaned over the lectern to face the moderator .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush shakes hands with john kerry ahead of the 3rd debate some said the bulge under his jacket was a hidden receiver , picking up transmissions from someone offstage who was feeding the president answers through a hidden earpiece .
speculation burned up internet blog sites .
on a few occasions , the president simply stopped speaking for an uncomfortably long time and stared ahead with an odd expression on his face .
was he listening to someone helping him with his response to a question ?
china tv duels are foreign to chinese television , which is no great surprise for a country which does n't tolerate much by way of political discussion .
live political programming is rare , with those programs which do make it on to air , filled with boring political events in which politicians obediently toe the party line .
real politics happens behind closed doors , away from the prying eye of tv cameras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chinese premier zhao ziyang at the beginning of the 1980s , the so-called third generation of party leaders celebrated their debut in front of the cameras .
during the press conference at the end of the 13th party congress -lrb- of the 13th people 's congress -rrb- the new party head zhao ziyang was relaxed and spontaneous with both chinese and western journalists .
that gave birth to a new generation of television-conscious party leaders , but it did n't last long .
zhao ziyang 's political end was also shown live on television in 1989 when millions viewed him shedding tears for the hunger-striking students marching on the gate of heavenly peace .
ziyang was consequently removed from power and placed under house arrest until his death in 2005 .
1989 saw the televising of an altogether different debate , when the then premier of the state council , li peng , faced the student leader , wuer kaixi .
wearing hospital pajamas and breathing apparatus , kaixi posed provocative questions to media-shy peng .
millions of viewers saw their otherwise sovereign leader in disgrace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jiang zemin talks to a cameraman but not all party functionaries are media-shy .
zhao 's successor , jiang zamin , loved television and presented himself as a multi-talented leader with an unconventional style , and was once seen on tv singing " o sole mio . "
in today 's china , party functionaries know how to use tv images to benefit themselves . party head and technocrat wen jiabao was seen crying on tv after a mine accident and put on an emotional display while talking with a very poor farmer .
brazil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian president inacio lula da silva tv debates began in brazil in 1989 when current president luiz inacio lula da silva first ran for office .
after a first tv debate , lula was well positioned to significantly catch up with his opponent , fernando collor de mello .
indeed , just a few days before the election , collor was just one percentage point ahead of lula in the polls .
in the second debate , the most important brazilian broadcaster , globo tv , declared that collor had outperformed lula and aired part of the debate that was unfavorable to lula .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president fernando collor de mello collor de mello is part of a family in the state of alagoas , which has controlled the globo tv station since 1978 .
the media giant supported the military dictatorship -lrb- 1964-1985 -rrb- and has backed all subsequent governments for decades .
ultimately mello won with a 5-percent lead , but the so-called " collor-phenomenon " did n't last long .
two and a half years later , corruption charges forced president collor to resign .
after the last election in 2002 , lula da silva was elected .
today his government is involved in numerous corruption scandals and he is facing a similar impeachment procedure to the one that drove collor from office .
spanish-speaking countries many spanish-speaking countries hold populist tv debates fashioned from the american mold , but there are some distinctions from country to country .
chile has seen the gradual development of a stabile structure for public debate and tv debates have emerged since the end of the pinochet dictatorship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose maria aznar has been and gone as spain 's premier in spain there has only been one tv debate , namely between the socialist felipe gonzalez and the conservative jose maria aznar in 1996 .
mexico had its first tv debate in 1994 .
in contrast to germany , where tv debates are subject to strict rules , mexico has no such regulations .
rather than structured debate , the objective is to discredit one 's political opponents with accusations and insults .
the arab world american-style tv debates are not a feature of the arab world , and are strictly outlawed by the powers that be .
but those same powers are not unaware of the opportunities television offers them in the name of protecting their patch . one of the first to make use of the power of the media was egyptian politician gamal abd an-nasser who allowed a radio broadcast to transmit his announcement of the nationalization of the suez canal . in 1967 , following the devastating defeat in the arab-israeli six-day war , nasser offered the people his resignation during a spontaneous tv appearance , fully aware that the vast majority would call for him to remain in office .
his successor , sadat , was often filmed with his pipe and cane to portray himself as an authentic and down-to-earth leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egyptian president hosni mubarak by contrast , the current president mubarak is perceived as uncharismatic and boring .
during his speeches , officials and members of the media often fall asleep .
and it does n't help that his speeches are televised on all tv channels , often interrupting programs people really want to watch .
the late palestinian president arafat was known for embracing and kissing his guests in front of the cameras .
in addition , he cultivated simple , but symbolic gestures , eating with common people and kissing the hands of ladies .

german hooligans again created problems for security officials in bratislava . the heady days of the confederations cup in june have turned into an early autumn hangover for the german national squad .
a lucky 2-2 draw against holland on aug .
17 gave way to an embarrassing 2-0 defeat against slovakia .
as has been the case over the course of jürgen klinsmann 's reign as coach , a porous defense proved to be the downfall .
the offense , unlike the exciting matches at the cup in june , proved to be non-existent .
germany 's playmaker michael ballack offered what was probably one of his poorest matches as an international midfielder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when ballack has an off day , then the team has an off day " when he plays poorly , then the team has no one to turn to , " was the sober assessment of former world cup championship coach and player turned television analyst , franz beckenbauer .
bundesliga talent scores double miroslav karhan , who plays in the bundesliga with vfl wolfsburg , scored both goals , converting a penalty in the 20th minute and chipping over keeper jens lehmann for the second seven minutes before the break .
with only six more friendly matches before the world cup starts on june 9 , klinsmann has a true crisis on his hands as the various combinations he has tested in the backfield are proving to be incapable of the high demands of world soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his club kit green here , miroslav karhan scored twice against germany " i 'm very disappointed with the first half , " said klinsmann .
" we made costly individual mistakes and were slow to recover when we lost the ball .
we 've got a lot to work on . "
germany have conceded 10 goals in their last four games , 15 in their last seven , and have kept clean sheets in just two matches in 2005 , against tunisia and slovenia .
slovakia gets boost the victory for slovakia provided a welcome boost ahead of their trip to face latvia on wednesday , a match they must win to stay in the hunt for a world cup place .
slovakia are in second place in group three behind portugal and ahead of russia .
for germany coach jürgen klinsmann , the match will have raised further concerns over a defense that has been leaking goals since the confederations cup .
after a promising start for germany , the hosts turned the game around and then dominated the first half .
slovakia 's midfielder and goalscoring king last season at nuremberg , marek mintal , came close to putting his side on top when he flashed a shot just wide in the 13th minute after the ball had fallen to him at a corner .
the pressure on the german defense continued until per mertesacker cracked when he needlessly held on to robert vittek to give away the penalty .
an at times very insecure-looking slovakian goalkeeper kamil contofalsky was challenged on numerous occasions but the necessary bit of luck or smart play was missing at key moments .
the second strike came in the 38th minute when mintal hooked over a cross from wide on the left and karhan calmly lifted the ball over lehmann , who did little to back up his claim this week that he deserved to play in the world cup ahead of oliver kahn .
the debut performances of marcell jansen and lukas sinkiewicz were less than memorable as they worked their ways slowly into the squad after entering the game in the second half .
the last 45 minutes were generally better , with energetic confed cup stars lukas podolski and bastian schweinsteiger creating chances that still ended in a goose egg .
six hurt in hooligan violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior and sports minister otto schily -lrb- l -rrb- and german soccer legend and head of the organizing comitee for the world cup 2006 franz beckenbauer the sparsely-visited match still managed to attract hooligans who battled with police in the german stands .
six people were hurt , one seriously , according to german soccer association press spokesman harald stenger .
during the match , the hooligans who presumably received tickets from slovakian acquaintances made their presence felt during the match , shouting " we all have stadium bans , " and " otto , we 're here anyway , " in reference to german interior minister otto schily , who was in attendance and whose ministry is in charge of security at next year 's world cup . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hooligans taint slovenian friendly a " friendly " weekend soccer match between germany and slovenia quickly turned sour as before , during and after the game , german fans participated in racist violence , prompting fears of a revival of hooliganism .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when ballack has an off day , then the team has an off day " when he plays poorly , then the team has no one to turn to , " was the sober assessment of former world cup championship coach and player turned television analyst , franz beckenbauer .

slovakia are in second place in group three behind portugal and ahead of russia .
for germany coach jürgen klinsmann , the match will have raised further concerns over a defense that has been leaking goals since the confederations cup .
after a promising start for germany , the hosts turned the game around and then dominated the first half .
slovakia 's midfielder and goalscoring king last season at nuremberg , marek mintal , came close to putting his side on top when he flashed a shot just wide in the 13th minute after the ball had fallen to him at a corner .
the pressure on the german defense continued until per mertesacker cracked when he needlessly held on to robert vittek to give away the penalty .
an at times very insecure-looking slovakian goalkeeper kamil contofalsky was challenged on numerous occasions but the necessary bit of luck or smart play was missing at key moments .
the second strike came in the 38th minute when mintal hooked over a cross from wide on the left and karhan calmly lifted the ball over lehmann , who did little to back up his claim this week that he deserved to play in the world cup ahead of oliver kahn .
the debut performances of marcell jansen and lukas sinkiewicz were less than memorable as they worked their ways slowly into the squad after entering the game in the second half .
the last 45 minutes were generally better , with energetic confed cup stars lukas podolski and bastian schweinsteiger creating chances that still ended in a goose egg .

six people were hurt , one seriously , according to german soccer association press spokesman harald stenger .
during the match , the hooligans who presumably received tickets from slovakian acquaintances made their presence felt during the match , shouting " we all have stadium bans , " and " otto , we 're here anyway , " in reference to german interior minister otto schily , who was in attendance and whose ministry is in charge of security at next year 's world cup . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hooligans taint slovenian friendly a " friendly " weekend soccer match between germany and slovenia quickly turned sour as before , during and after the game , german fans participated in racist violence , prompting fears of a revival of hooliganism .

26 , 1960 , for the first time in the us history , a debate between presidential candidates was shown on television .
the candidates were john f. kennedy , a democratic senator of massachusetts , and richard m. nixon , the us vice president .
they met in a chicago studio to discuss us domestic matters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john f. kennedy emerged the winner kennedy emerged the apparent winner from this first of four televised debates .
tanned , telegenic kennedy made a much better visual impression than pale , makeup-free , stubble-chinned nixon , who was recovering from the flu .
it was the first time the power of television in political contests became apparent .
the election was held in november and kennedy won 49.7 percent of the popular vote in one of the closest presidential elections in us history , surpassing by a fraction the 49.6 percent received by his republican opponent .
in the 1992 debates , george bush senior was caught on camera checking his watch during a town hall debate with then-governor bill clinton and businessman ross perot .
the gesture gave viewers the distinct impression that the elder bush would rather have been elsewhere .
the most recent debate controversy was bush 's so-called mystery bulge during the 2004 debates .
a tv image from the miami debate reveals what looked like a large solid object between his shoulder blades as he leaned over the lectern to face the moderator .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush shakes hands with john kerry ahead of the 3rd debate some said the bulge under his jacket was a hidden receiver , picking up transmissions from someone offstage who was feeding the president answers through a hidden earpiece .
speculation burned up internet blog sites .
on a few occasions , the president simply stopped speaking for an uncomfortably long time and stared ahead with an odd expression on his face .
was he listening to someone helping him with his response to a question ?
china tv duels are foreign to chinese television , which is no great surprise for a country which does n't tolerate much by way of political discussion .
live political programming is rare , with those programs which do make it on to air , filled with boring political events in which politicians obediently toe the party line .
real politics happens behind closed doors , away from the prying eye of tv cameras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chinese premier zhao ziyang at the beginning of the 1980s , the so-called third generation of party leaders celebrated their debut in front of the cameras .
during the press conference at the end of the 13th party congress -lrb- of the 13th people 's congress -rrb- the new party head zhao ziyang was relaxed and spontaneous with both chinese and western journalists .
that gave birth to a new generation of television-conscious party leaders , but it did n't last long .
zhao ziyang 's political end was also shown live on television in 1989 when millions viewed him shedding tears for the hunger-striking students marching on the gate of heavenly peace .
ziyang was consequently removed from power and placed under house arrest until his death in 2005 .
1989 saw the televising of an altogether different debate , when the then premier of the state council , li peng , faced the student leader , wuer kaixi .
wearing hospital pajamas and breathing apparatus , kaixi posed provocative questions to media-shy peng .
millions of viewers saw their otherwise sovereign leader in disgrace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jiang zemin talks to a cameraman but not all party functionaries are media-shy .
zhao 's successor , jiang zamin , loved television and presented himself as a multi-talented leader with an unconventional style , and was once seen on tv singing " o sole mio . "
in today 's china , party functionaries know how to use tv images to benefit themselves . party head and technocrat wen jiabao was seen crying on tv after a mine accident and put on an emotional display while talking with a very poor farmer .
brazil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian president inacio lula da silva tv debates began in brazil in 1989 when current president luiz inacio lula da silva first ran for office .
after a first tv debate , lula was well positioned to significantly catch up with his opponent , fernando collor de mello .
indeed , just a few days before the election , collor was just one percentage point ahead of lula in the polls .
in the second debate , the most important brazilian broadcaster , globo tv , declared that collor had outperformed lula and aired part of the debate that was unfavorable to lula .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president fernando collor de mello collor de mello is part of a family in the state of alagoas , which has controlled the globo tv station since 1978 .
the media giant supported the military dictatorship -lrb- 1964-1985 -rrb- and has backed all subsequent governments for decades .
ultimately mello won with a 5-percent lead , but the so-called " collor-phenomenon " did n't last long .
two and a half years later , corruption charges forced president collor to resign .
after the last election in 2002 , lula da silva was elected .
today his government is involved in numerous corruption scandals and he is facing a similar impeachment procedure to the one that drove collor from office .
spanish-speaking countries many spanish-speaking countries hold populist tv debates fashioned from the american mold , but there are some distinctions from country to country .
chile has seen the gradual development of a stabile structure for public debate and tv debates have emerged since the end of the pinochet dictatorship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose maria aznar has been and gone as spain 's premier in spain there has only been one tv debate , namely between the socialist felipe gonzalez and the conservative jose maria aznar in 1996 .
mexico had its first tv debate in 1994 .
in contrast to germany , where tv debates are subject to strict rules , mexico has no such regulations .
rather than structured debate , the objective is to discredit one 's political opponents with accusations and insults .
the arab world american-style tv debates are not a feature of the arab world , and are strictly outlawed by the powers that be .
but those same powers are not unaware of the opportunities television offers them in the name of protecting their patch . one of the first to make use of the power of the media was egyptian politician gamal abd an-nasser who allowed a radio broadcast to transmit his announcement of the nationalization of the suez canal . in 1967 , following the devastating defeat in the arab-israeli six-day war , nasser offered the people his resignation during a spontaneous tv appearance , fully aware that the vast majority would call for him to remain in office .
his successor , sadat , was often filmed with his pipe and cane to portray himself as an authentic and down-to-earth leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egyptian president hosni mubarak by contrast , the current president mubarak is perceived as uncharismatic and boring .
during his speeches , officials and members of the media often fall asleep .
and it does n't help that his speeches are televised on all tv channels , often interrupting programs people really want to watch .
the late palestinian president arafat was known for embracing and kissing his guests in front of the cameras .
in addition , he cultivated simple , but symbolic gestures , eating with common people and kissing the hands of ladies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader moammer gadhafi last but not least are the spectacular appearances of the " media star " of arab politics , libya 's moammar gadhafi .
fleeting poses capture him sleeping in a tent and camel back riding .
russia the russian federation was one of the first eastern bloc states where tv debates were introduced for elections .
the first tv battles were organized shortly after the resignation of gorbachev and the breakup of the soviet union on june 19 , 1991 .
millions of soviet citizens followed these tense political shows with a mixture of euphoria , naive hope and child-like faith .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former russian president boris jelzin the first presidential campaign in russia lasted for two weeks and the tv debate provided each candidate with equal time to receive and answer live questions from the audience and moderators .
many top russian politicians , including ex-president boris yeltsin and the current head of the ultra-nationalistic liberal democrats vladimir shirinovski took part .
boris yeltsin was elected as the first president of russia on june 12 , 1991 .
shirinovski disagreed with the polls claiming that he had won and that the polls had been manipulated .
all subsequent debates on russian television were more of a show than a serious political discussion .
during a tv debate between shirinovski and the ex-faction head of the democratic party sps , boris nemzov , the two rivals doused each other with water .
in another case the debaters started a brawl .
during a debate running up to regional presidential elections in the republic tatarstan in 2001 , the former duma delegate sergei shashurin shelled the then president with swear words and relentless accusations .
the president felt insulted and made shashurin appear in court as a result .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin wo n't debate on television the current russian president putin does n't care much for televised political debates and refused to participate during the last presidential election .
" i already know every word of my competitor , " putin said .
" of course , you can try different tricks .
you can sing and dance .
but the people in our country can still decide with their hearts where the truth is and where lies are hidden . "

26 , 1960 , for the first time in the us history , a debate between presidential candidates was shown on television .
the candidates were john f. kennedy , a democratic senator of massachusetts , and richard m. nixon , the us vice president .
they met in a chicago studio to discuss us domestic matters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john f. kennedy emerged the winner kennedy emerged the apparent winner from this first of four televised debates .
tanned , telegenic kennedy made a much better visual impression than pale , makeup-free , stubble-chinned nixon , who was recovering from the flu .
it was the first time the power of television in political contests became apparent .
the election was held in november and kennedy won 49.7 percent of the popular vote in one of the closest presidential elections in us history , surpassing by a fraction the 49.6 percent received by his republican opponent .
in the 1992 debates , george bush senior was caught on camera checking his watch during a town hall debate with then-governor bill clinton and businessman ross perot .
the gesture gave viewers the distinct impression that the elder bush would rather have been elsewhere .
the most recent debate controversy was bush 's so-called mystery bulge during the 2004 debates .
a tv image from the miami debate reveals what looked like a large solid object between his shoulder blades as he leaned over the lectern to face the moderator .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush shakes hands with john kerry ahead of the 3rd debate some said the bulge under his jacket was a hidden receiver , picking up transmissions from someone offstage who was feeding the president answers through a hidden earpiece .
speculation burned up internet blog sites .
on a few occasions , the president simply stopped speaking for an uncomfortably long time and stared ahead with an odd expression on his face .
was he listening to someone helping him with his response to a question ?
china tv duels are foreign to chinese television , which is no great surprise for a country which does n't tolerate much by way of political discussion .
live political programming is rare , with those programs which do make it on to air , filled with boring political events in which politicians obediently toe the party line .
real politics happens behind closed doors , away from the prying eye of tv cameras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chinese premier zhao ziyang at the beginning of the 1980s , the so-called third generation of party leaders celebrated their debut in front of the cameras .
during the press conference at the end of the 13th party congress -lrb- of the 13th people 's congress -rrb- the new party head zhao ziyang was relaxed and spontaneous with both chinese and western journalists .
that gave birth to a new generation of television-conscious party leaders , but it did n't last long .
zhao ziyang 's political end was also shown live on television in 1989 when millions viewed him shedding tears for the hunger-striking students marching on the gate of heavenly peace .
ziyang was consequently removed from power and placed under house arrest until his death in 2005 .
1989 saw the televising of an altogether different debate , when the then premier of the state council , li peng , faced the student leader , wuer kaixi .
wearing hospital pajamas and breathing apparatus , kaixi posed provocative questions to media-shy peng .
millions of viewers saw their otherwise sovereign leader in disgrace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jiang zemin talks to a cameraman but not all party functionaries are media-shy .
zhao 's successor , jiang zamin , loved television and presented himself as a multi-talented leader with an unconventional style , and was once seen on tv singing " o sole mio . "
in today 's china , party functionaries know how to use tv images to benefit themselves . party head and technocrat wen jiabao was seen crying on tv after a mine accident and put on an emotional display while talking with a very poor farmer .
brazil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian president inacio lula da silva tv debates began in brazil in 1989 when current president luiz inacio lula da silva first ran for office .
after a first tv debate , lula was well positioned to significantly catch up with his opponent , fernando collor de mello .
indeed , just a few days before the election , collor was just one percentage point ahead of lula in the polls .
in the second debate , the most important brazilian broadcaster , globo tv , declared that collor had outperformed lula and aired part of the debate that was unfavorable to lula .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president fernando collor de mello collor de mello is part of a family in the state of alagoas , which has controlled the globo tv station since 1978 .
the media giant supported the military dictatorship -lrb- 1964-1985 -rrb- and has backed all subsequent governments for decades .
ultimately mello won with a 5-percent lead , but the so-called " collor-phenomenon " did n't last long .
two and a half years later , corruption charges forced president collor to resign .
after the last election in 2002 , lula da silva was elected .
today his government is involved in numerous corruption scandals and he is facing a similar impeachment procedure to the one that drove collor from office .
spanish-speaking countries many spanish-speaking countries hold populist tv debates fashioned from the american mold , but there are some distinctions from country to country .
chile has seen the gradual development of a stabile structure for public debate and tv debates have emerged since the end of the pinochet dictatorship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose maria aznar has been and gone as spain 's premier in spain there has only been one tv debate , namely between the socialist felipe gonzalez and the conservative jose maria aznar in 1996 .

it was the first time the power of television in political contests became apparent .
the election was held in november and kennedy won 49.7 percent of the popular vote in one of the closest presidential elections in us history , surpassing by a fraction the 49.6 percent received by his republican opponent .
in the 1992 debates , george bush senior was caught on camera checking his watch during a town hall debate with then-governor bill clinton and businessman ross perot .
the gesture gave viewers the distinct impression that the elder bush would rather have been elsewhere .
the most recent debate controversy was bush 's so-called mystery bulge during the 2004 debates .
a tv image from the miami debate reveals what looked like a large solid object between his shoulder blades as he leaned over the lectern to face the moderator .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush shakes hands with john kerry ahead of the 3rd debate some said the bulge under his jacket was a hidden receiver , picking up transmissions from someone offstage who was feeding the president answers through a hidden earpiece .
speculation burned up internet blog sites .
on a few occasions , the president simply stopped speaking for an uncomfortably long time and stared ahead with an odd expression on his face .
was he listening to someone helping him with his response to a question ?
china tv duels are foreign to chinese television , which is no great surprise for a country which does n't tolerate much by way of political discussion .
live political programming is rare , with those programs which do make it on to air , filled with boring political events in which politicians obediently toe the party line .
real politics happens behind closed doors , away from the prying eye of tv cameras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chinese premier zhao ziyang at the beginning of the 1980s , the so-called third generation of party leaders celebrated their debut in front of the cameras .
during the press conference at the end of the 13th party congress -lrb- of the 13th people 's congress -rrb- the new party head zhao ziyang was relaxed and spontaneous with both chinese and western journalists .
that gave birth to a new generation of television-conscious party leaders , but it did n't last long .
zhao ziyang 's political end was also shown live on television in 1989 when millions viewed him shedding tears for the hunger-striking students marching on the gate of heavenly peace .
ziyang was consequently removed from power and placed under house arrest until his death in 2005 .
1989 saw the televising of an altogether different debate , when the then premier of the state council , li peng , faced the student leader , wuer kaixi .
wearing hospital pajamas and breathing apparatus , kaixi posed provocative questions to media-shy peng .
millions of viewers saw their otherwise sovereign leader in disgrace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jiang zemin talks to a cameraman but not all party functionaries are media-shy .
zhao 's successor , jiang zamin , loved television and presented himself as a multi-talented leader with an unconventional style , and was once seen on tv singing " o sole mio . "
in today 's china , party functionaries know how to use tv images to benefit themselves . party head and technocrat wen jiabao was seen crying on tv after a mine accident and put on an emotional display while talking with a very poor farmer .
brazil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian president inacio lula da silva tv debates began in brazil in 1989 when current president luiz inacio lula da silva first ran for office .
after a first tv debate , lula was well positioned to significantly catch up with his opponent , fernando collor de mello .
indeed , just a few days before the election , collor was just one percentage point ahead of lula in the polls .
in the second debate , the most important brazilian broadcaster , globo tv , declared that collor had outperformed lula and aired part of the debate that was unfavorable to lula .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president fernando collor de mello collor de mello is part of a family in the state of alagoas , which has controlled the globo tv station since 1978 .
the media giant supported the military dictatorship -lrb- 1964-1985 -rrb- and has backed all subsequent governments for decades .
ultimately mello won with a 5-percent lead , but the so-called " collor-phenomenon " did n't last long .
two and a half years later , corruption charges forced president collor to resign .
after the last election in 2002 , lula da silva was elected .
today his government is involved in numerous corruption scandals and he is facing a similar impeachment procedure to the one that drove collor from office .
spanish-speaking countries many spanish-speaking countries hold populist tv debates fashioned from the american mold , but there are some distinctions from country to country .
chile has seen the gradual development of a stabile structure for public debate and tv debates have emerged since the end of the pinochet dictatorship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose maria aznar has been and gone as spain 's premier in spain there has only been one tv debate , namely between the socialist felipe gonzalez and the conservative jose maria aznar in 1996 .
mexico had its first tv debate in 1994 .
in contrast to germany , where tv debates are subject to strict rules , mexico has no such regulations .
rather than structured debate , the objective is to discredit one 's political opponents with accusations and insults .
the arab world american-style tv debates are not a feature of the arab world , and are strictly outlawed by the powers that be .
but those same powers are not unaware of the opportunities television offers them in the name of protecting their patch . one of the first to make use of the power of the media was egyptian politician gamal abd an-nasser who allowed a radio broadcast to transmit his announcement of the nationalization of the suez canal . in 1967 , following the devastating defeat in the arab-israeli six-day war , nasser offered the people his resignation during a spontaneous tv appearance , fully aware that the vast majority would call for him to remain in office .
his successor , sadat , was often filmed with his pipe and cane to portray himself as an authentic and down-to-earth leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egyptian president hosni mubarak by contrast , the current president mubarak is perceived as uncharismatic and boring .
during his speeches , officials and members of the media often fall asleep .
and it does n't help that his speeches are televised on all tv channels , often interrupting programs people really want to watch .
the late palestinian president arafat was known for embracing and kissing his guests in front of the cameras .
in addition , he cultivated simple , but symbolic gestures , eating with common people and kissing the hands of ladies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader moammer gadhafi last but not least are the spectacular appearances of the " media star " of arab politics , libya 's moammar gadhafi .

russia the russian federation was one of the first eastern bloc states where tv debates were introduced for elections .
the first tv battles were organized shortly after the resignation of gorbachev and the breakup of the soviet union on june 19 , 1991 .
millions of soviet citizens followed these tense political shows with a mixture of euphoria , naive hope and child-like faith .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former russian president boris jelzin the first presidential campaign in russia lasted for two weeks and the tv debate provided each candidate with equal time to receive and answer live questions from the audience and moderators .
many top russian politicians , including ex-president boris yeltsin and the current head of the ultra-nationalistic liberal democrats vladimir shirinovski took part .
boris yeltsin was elected as the first president of russia on june 12 , 1991 .
shirinovski disagreed with the polls claiming that he had won and that the polls had been manipulated .
all subsequent debates on russian television were more of a show than a serious political discussion .
during a tv debate between shirinovski and the ex-faction head of the democratic party sps , boris nemzov , the two rivals doused each other with water .
in another case the debaters started a brawl .
during a debate running up to regional presidential elections in the republic tatarstan in 2001 , the former duma delegate sergei shashurin shelled the then president with swear words and relentless accusations .
the president felt insulted and made shashurin appear in court as a result .

" the united states currently spends 0.16 percent of its gdp on non-military foreign aid , while last year aid accounted for 0.36 percent of the eu 's 15 old member state 's gdp . washington said it wants to highlight a 2002 consensus that focused on free-market reforms and required governments to improve accountability in exchange for aid and debt relief . the non-aligned movement of developing nations as well as russia also have also proposed a number of changes dealing with human rights , terrorism and un reforms to the summit declaration . this week the un 's top diplomat , secretary-general kofi annan , ended his summer vacation in an attempt to get the camps reconciled before the summit . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de africa needs help , but how ?

31 , club directors were active : bundesliga teams seeking to change their fortunes or improve already good starts hired young brazilians in numbers . abuda , kahe , romulo and rafinha : the names are n't as familiar as ronaldo , ronaldinho or new international superstar striker robinho .
the old brazilian guard in the bundesliga , lucio , marcelinho or ze roberto also may not be so acquainted with the youngsters .
yet a flurry of deals before the aug .
31 transfer deadline has brought a slew of young brazilians , predominantly forwards , to germany .
last year 's league runners-up schalke dug deepest and paid 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6.2 million -rrb- for their latest brazilian player , 19-year-old rafinha .
unlike the other three , marcio rafael ferreira de souza , short rafinha , is a defender .
germany has already faced the 1.72 meter -lrb- 5 foot 10 inch -rrb- back man , but not at the confederations cup , rather at the u-20 world championships in holland .
" rafinha made a very good impression during the tournament , " said schalke general manager rudi assauer .
like bayern munich 's lucio -lrb- photo -rrb- , rafinha is not shy of scoring goals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : similar to bayern munich 's lucio , rafinha likes the joy of scoring a goal " like most brazilian defenders he is strong going forward , " team manager andreas müller added .
" he 's able to switch quickly from defense to attack , exert pressure down the flank and put in good crosses .
he 's also dangerous in front of the goal . "
in 13 matches this season with his previous club coritiba fc , he scored three times .
and his extra-time winner knocked out the u-20 german side in june .
forwards !
borussia mönchengladbach , already home to brazilian striker giovane elber , found it necessary to help out their elder statesman -lrb- 33 -rrb- with the 23-year-old kahe .
the deal with top first-league brazilian club palmeiras sao paolo cost 1.2 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giovane elber during his stint with bayern munich .
he is the bundesliga 's most successful goalscorer from abroad " he is a physically robust , attacking striker , exactly the kind of player that 's been missing in our offense , " said club director peter pander .
indeed kahe 's goal-scoring services are needed .
in three bundesliga matches so far , gladbach have netted a paltry two goals and lie in 16th place in the standings .
questio n marks the other two brazilian newcomers are big question marks , both to the league , and admittedly to team coaches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuda in one of his first practice sessions with wolfsburg adailiton pereira coelho , called abuda , signed a contract until 2008 with wolfsburg .
holger fach called the signing a bit of an unknown quantity .
" but i have full faith in our chief scouts ralph kellermann and ulil mohr , " the wolfsburg coach said .
decisive in the deal for abuda , however , was the advice of former wolfsburg player and brazilian friend fernando baiano .
" wolfsburg is not a foreign word to me , " the 19-year-old striker said .
" my mate baiano only had nice things to say about the club . "
the northern german town may not be foreign to him but many brazilians criticize abuda for being a little foreign in front of the net and wasting too many chances .
mainz is looking to make up for their poor jump out of the starting blocks with romulo .
he 's on loan for the remainder of the season from brazilian second-league side ituano .
there he had scored six times in the current season .
" romulo is comfortable with the ball and has a nose for the goal , " said mainz coach jürgen klopp about the 23-year-old .

german hooligans again created problems for security officials in bratislava . the heady days of the confederations cup in june have turned into an early autumn hangover for the german national squad .
a lucky 2-2 draw against holland on aug .
17 gave way to an embarrassing 2-0 defeat against slovakia .
as has been the case over the course of jürgen klinsmann 's reign as coach , a porous defense proved to be the downfall .
the offense , unlike the exciting matches at the cup in june , proved to be non-existent .
germany 's playmaker michael ballack offered what was probably one of his poorest matches as an international midfielder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when ballack has an off day , then the team has an off day " when he plays poorly , then the team has no one to turn to , " was the sober assessment of former world cup championship coach and player turned television analyst , franz beckenbauer .
bundesliga talent scores double miroslav karhan , who plays in the bundesliga with vfl wolfsburg , scored both goals , converting a penalty in the 20th minute and chipping over keeper jens lehmann for the second seven minutes before the break .
with only six more friendly matches before the world cup starts on june 9 , klinsmann has a true crisis on his hands as the various combinations he has tested in the backfield are proving to be incapable of the high demands of world soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his club kit green here , miroslav karhan scored twice against germany " i 'm very disappointed with the first half , " said klinsmann .
" we made costly individual mistakes and were slow to recover when we lost the ball .
we 've got a lot to work on . "
germany have conceded 10 goals in their last four games , 15 in their last seven , and have kept clean sheets in just two matches in 2005 , against tunisia and slovenia .
slovakia gets boost the victory for slovakia provided a welcome boost ahead of their trip to face latvia on wednesday , a match they must win to stay in the hunt for a world cup place .
slovakia are in second place in group three behind portugal and ahead of russia .
for germany coach jürgen klinsmann , the match will have raised further concerns over a defense that has been leaking goals since the confederations cup .
after a promising start for germany , the hosts turned the game around and then dominated the first half .
slovakia 's midfielder and goalscoring king last season at nuremberg , marek mintal , came close to putting his side on top when he flashed a shot just wide in the 13th minute after the ball had fallen to him at a corner .
the pressure on the german defense continued until per mertesacker cracked when he needlessly held on to robert vittek to give away the penalty .
an at times very insecure-looking slovakian goalkeeper kamil contofalsky was challenged on numerous occasions but the necessary bit of luck or smart play was missing at key moments .
the second strike came in the 38th minute when mintal hooked over a cross from wide on the left and karhan calmly lifted the ball over lehmann , who did little to back up his claim this week that he deserved to play in the world cup ahead of oliver kahn .
the debut performances of marcell jansen and lukas sinkiewicz were less than memorable as they worked their ways slowly into the squad after entering the game in the second half .
the last 45 minutes were generally better , with energetic confed cup stars lukas podolski and bastian schweinsteiger creating chances that still ended in a goose egg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 03.09.2005 tv duels on the international screen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lights , camera , action as german chancellor gerhard schröder and his conservative challenger , angela merkel , prepare to square off in a tv debate sunday , dw-world examines election debate cultures around the world . united states on sept .
26 , 1960 , for the first time in the us history , a debate between presidential candidates was shown on television .
the candidates were john f. kennedy , a democratic senator of massachusetts , and richard m. nixon , the us vice president .
they met in a chicago studio to discuss us domestic matters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john f. kennedy emerged the winner kennedy emerged the apparent winner from this first of four televised debates .
tanned , telegenic kennedy made a much better visual impression than pale , makeup-free , stubble-chinned nixon , who was recovering from the flu .
it was the first time the power of television in political contests became apparent .
the election was held in november and kennedy won 49.7 percent of the popular vote in one of the closest presidential elections in us history , surpassing by a fraction the 49.6 percent received by his republican opponent .
in the 1992 debates , george bush senior was caught on camera checking his watch during a town hall debate with then-governor bill clinton and businessman ross perot .
the gesture gave viewers the distinct impression that the elder bush would rather have been elsewhere .
the most recent debate controversy was bush 's so-called mystery bulge during the 2004 debates .
a tv image from the miami debate reveals what looked like a large solid object between his shoulder blades as he leaned over the lectern to face the moderator .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush shakes hands with john kerry ahead of the 3rd debate some said the bulge under his jacket was a hidden receiver , picking up transmissions from someone offstage who was feeding the president answers through a hidden earpiece .
speculation burned up internet blog sites .
on a few occasions , the president simply stopped speaking for an uncomfortably long time and stared ahead with an odd expression on his face .
was he listening to someone helping him with his response to a question ?
china tv duels are foreign to chinese television , which is no great surprise for a country which does n't tolerate much by way of political discussion .
live political programming is rare , with those programs which do make it on to air , filled with boring political events in which politicians obediently toe the party line .
real politics happens behind closed doors , away from the prying eye of tv cameras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chinese premier zhao ziyang at the beginning of the 1980s , the so-called third generation of party leaders celebrated their debut in front of the cameras .
during the press conference at the end of the 13th party congress -lrb- of the 13th people 's congress -rrb- the new party head zhao ziyang was relaxed and spontaneous with both chinese and western journalists .
that gave birth to a new generation of television-conscious party leaders , but it did n't last long .
zhao ziyang 's political end was also shown live on television in 1989 when millions viewed him shedding tears for the hunger-striking students marching on the gate of heavenly peace .
ziyang was consequently removed from power and placed under house arrest until his death in 2005 .
1989 saw the televising of an altogether different debate , when the then premier of the state council , li peng , faced the student leader , wuer kaixi .
wearing hospital pajamas and breathing apparatus , kaixi posed provocative questions to media-shy peng .
millions of viewers saw their otherwise sovereign leader in disgrace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jiang zemin talks to a cameraman but not all party functionaries are media-shy .
zhao 's successor , jiang zamin , loved television and presented himself as a multi-talented leader with an unconventional style , and was once seen on tv singing " o sole mio . "
in today 's china , party functionaries know how to use tv images to benefit themselves . party head and technocrat wen jiabao was seen crying on tv after a mine accident and put on an emotional display while talking with a very poor farmer .
brazil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian president inacio lula da silva tv debates began in brazil in 1989 when current president luiz inacio lula da silva first ran for office .

26 , 1960 , for the first time in the us history , a debate between presidential candidates was shown on television .
the candidates were john f. kennedy , a democratic senator of massachusetts , and richard m. nixon , the us vice president .
they met in a chicago studio to discuss us domestic matters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john f. kennedy emerged the winner kennedy emerged the apparent winner from this first of four televised debates .
tanned , telegenic kennedy made a much better visual impression than pale , makeup-free , stubble-chinned nixon , who was recovering from the flu .
it was the first time the power of television in political contests became apparent .
the election was held in november and kennedy won 49.7 percent of the popular vote in one of the closest presidential elections in us history , surpassing by a fraction the 49.6 percent received by his republican opponent .
in the 1992 debates , george bush senior was caught on camera checking his watch during a town hall debate with then-governor bill clinton and businessman ross perot .
the gesture gave viewers the distinct impression that the elder bush would rather have been elsewhere .
the most recent debate controversy was bush 's so-called mystery bulge during the 2004 debates .
a tv image from the miami debate reveals what looked like a large solid object between his shoulder blades as he leaned over the lectern to face the moderator .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush shakes hands with john kerry ahead of the 3rd debate some said the bulge under his jacket was a hidden receiver , picking up transmissions from someone offstage who was feeding the president answers through a hidden earpiece .
speculation burned up internet blog sites .
on a few occasions , the president simply stopped speaking for an uncomfortably long time and stared ahead with an odd expression on his face .
was he listening to someone helping him with his response to a question ?
china tv duels are foreign to chinese television , which is no great surprise for a country which does n't tolerate much by way of political discussion .
live political programming is rare , with those programs which do make it on to air , filled with boring political events in which politicians obediently toe the party line .
real politics happens behind closed doors , away from the prying eye of tv cameras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chinese premier zhao ziyang at the beginning of the 1980s , the so-called third generation of party leaders celebrated their debut in front of the cameras .
during the press conference at the end of the 13th party congress -lrb- of the 13th people 's congress -rrb- the new party head zhao ziyang was relaxed and spontaneous with both chinese and western journalists .
that gave birth to a new generation of television-conscious party leaders , but it did n't last long .
zhao ziyang 's political end was also shown live on television in 1989 when millions viewed him shedding tears for the hunger-striking students marching on the gate of heavenly peace .
ziyang was consequently removed from power and placed under house arrest until his death in 2005 .
1989 saw the televising of an altogether different debate , when the then premier of the state council , li peng , faced the student leader , wuer kaixi .
wearing hospital pajamas and breathing apparatus , kaixi posed provocative questions to media-shy peng .
millions of viewers saw their otherwise sovereign leader in disgrace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jiang zemin talks to a cameraman but not all party functionaries are media-shy .
zhao 's successor , jiang zamin , loved television and presented himself as a multi-talented leader with an unconventional style , and was once seen on tv singing " o sole mio . "
in today 's china , party functionaries know how to use tv images to benefit themselves . party head and technocrat wen jiabao was seen crying on tv after a mine accident and put on an emotional display while talking with a very poor farmer .

tanned , telegenic kennedy made a much better visual impression than pale , makeup-free , stubble-chinned nixon , who was recovering from the flu .
it was the first time the power of television in political contests became apparent .
the election was held in november and kennedy won 49.7 percent of the popular vote in one of the closest presidential elections in us history , surpassing by a fraction the 49.6 percent received by his republican opponent .
in the 1992 debates , george bush senior was caught on camera checking his watch during a town hall debate with then-governor bill clinton and businessman ross perot .

during the press conference at the end of the 13th party congress -lrb- of the 13th people 's congress -rrb- the new party head zhao ziyang was relaxed and spontaneous with both chinese and western journalists .
that gave birth to a new generation of television-conscious party leaders , but it did n't last long .
zhao ziyang 's political end was also shown live on television in 1989 when millions viewed him shedding tears for the hunger-striking students marching on the gate of heavenly peace .
ziyang was consequently removed from power and placed under house arrest until his death in 2005 .
1989 saw the televising of an altogether different debate , when the then premier of the state council , li peng , faced the student leader , wuer kaixi .

in today 's china , party functionaries know how to use tv images to benefit themselves . party head and technocrat wen jiabao was seen crying on tv after a mine accident and put on an emotional display while talking with a very poor farmer .
brazil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian president inacio lula da silva tv debates began in brazil in 1989 when current president luiz inacio lula da silva first ran for office .
after a first tv debate , lula was well positioned to significantly catch up with his opponent , fernando collor de mello .
indeed , just a few days before the election , collor was just one percentage point ahead of lula in the polls .
in the second debate , the most important brazilian broadcaster , globo tv , declared that collor had outperformed lula and aired part of the debate that was unfavorable to lula .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president fernando collor de mello collor de mello is part of a family in the state of alagoas , which has controlled the globo tv station since 1978 .
the media giant supported the military dictatorship -lrb- 1964-1985 -rrb- and has backed all subsequent governments for decades .
ultimately mello won with a 5-percent lead , but the so-called " collor-phenomenon " did n't last long .
two and a half years later , corruption charges forced president collor to resign .
after the last election in 2002 , lula da silva was elected .
today his government is involved in numerous corruption scandals and he is facing a similar impeachment procedure to the one that drove collor from office .

mexico had its first tv debate in 1994 .
in contrast to germany , where tv debates are subject to strict rules , mexico has no such regulations .
rather than structured debate , the objective is to discredit one 's political opponents with accusations and insults .
the arab world american-style tv debates are not a feature of the arab world , and are strictly outlawed by the powers that be .
but those same powers are not unaware of the opportunities television offers them in the name of protecting their patch . one of the first to make use of the power of the media was egyptian politician gamal abd an-nasser who allowed a radio broadcast to transmit his announcement of the nationalization of the suez canal . in 1967 , following the devastating defeat in the arab-israeli six-day war , nasser offered the people his resignation during a spontaneous tv appearance , fully aware that the vast majority would call for him to remain in office .
his successor , sadat , was often filmed with his pipe and cane to portray himself as an authentic and down-to-earth leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egyptian president hosni mubarak by contrast , the current president mubarak is perceived as uncharismatic and boring .
during his speeches , officials and members of the media often fall asleep .
and it does n't help that his speeches are televised on all tv channels , often interrupting programs people really want to watch .
the late palestinian president arafat was known for embracing and kissing his guests in front of the cameras .
in addition , he cultivated simple , but symbolic gestures , eating with common people and kissing the hands of ladies .

russia the russian federation was one of the first eastern bloc states where tv debates were introduced for elections .
the first tv battles were organized shortly after the resignation of gorbachev and the breakup of the soviet union on june 19 , 1991 .
millions of soviet citizens followed these tense political shows with a mixture of euphoria , naive hope and child-like faith .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former russian president boris jelzin the first presidential campaign in russia lasted for two weeks and the tv debate provided each candidate with equal time to receive and answer live questions from the audience and moderators .
many top russian politicians , including ex-president boris yeltsin and the current head of the ultra-nationalistic liberal democrats vladimir shirinovski took part .
boris yeltsin was elected as the first president of russia on june 12 , 1991 .
shirinovski disagreed with the polls claiming that he had won and that the polls had been manipulated .
all subsequent debates on russian television were more of a show than a serious political discussion .
during a tv debate between shirinovski and the ex-faction head of the democratic party sps , boris nemzov , the two rivals doused each other with water .
in another case the debaters started a brawl .
during a debate running up to regional presidential elections in the republic tatarstan in 2001 , the former duma delegate sergei shashurin shelled the then president with swear words and relentless accusations .
the president felt insulted and made shashurin appear in court as a result .

26 , 1960 , for the first time in the us history , a debate between presidential candidates was shown on television .
the candidates were john f. kennedy , a democratic senator of massachusetts , and richard m. nixon , the us vice president .
they met in a chicago studio to discuss us domestic matters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john f. kennedy emerged the winner kennedy emerged the apparent winner from this first of four televised debates .
tanned , telegenic kennedy made a much better visual impression than pale , makeup-free , stubble-chinned nixon , who was recovering from the flu .
it was the first time the power of television in political contests became apparent .
the election was held in november and kennedy won 49.7 percent of the popular vote in one of the closest presidential elections in us history , surpassing by a fraction the 49.6 percent received by his republican opponent .
in the 1992 debates , george bush senior was caught on camera checking his watch during a town hall debate with then-governor bill clinton and businessman ross perot .
the gesture gave viewers the distinct impression that the elder bush would rather have been elsewhere .
the most recent debate controversy was bush 's so-called mystery bulge during the 2004 debates .
a tv image from the miami debate reveals what looked like a large solid object between his shoulder blades as he leaned over the lectern to face the moderator .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush shakes hands with john kerry ahead of the 3rd debate some said the bulge under his jacket was a hidden receiver , picking up transmissions from someone offstage who was feeding the president answers through a hidden earpiece .
speculation burned up internet blog sites .
on a few occasions , the president simply stopped speaking for an uncomfortably long time and stared ahead with an odd expression on his face .
was he listening to someone helping him with his response to a question ?
china tv duels are foreign to chinese television , which is no great surprise for a country which does n't tolerate much by way of political discussion .
live political programming is rare , with those programs which do make it on to air , filled with boring political events in which politicians obediently toe the party line .
real politics happens behind closed doors , away from the prying eye of tv cameras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chinese premier zhao ziyang at the beginning of the 1980s , the so-called third generation of party leaders celebrated their debut in front of the cameras .
during the press conference at the end of the 13th party congress -lrb- of the 13th people 's congress -rrb- the new party head zhao ziyang was relaxed and spontaneous with both chinese and western journalists .
that gave birth to a new generation of television-conscious party leaders , but it did n't last long .
zhao ziyang 's political end was also shown live on television in 1989 when millions viewed him shedding tears for the hunger-striking students marching on the gate of heavenly peace .
ziyang was consequently removed from power and placed under house arrest until his death in 2005 .
1989 saw the televising of an altogether different debate , when the then premier of the state council , li peng , faced the student leader , wuer kaixi .
wearing hospital pajamas and breathing apparatus , kaixi posed provocative questions to media-shy peng .
millions of viewers saw their otherwise sovereign leader in disgrace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jiang zemin talks to a cameraman but not all party functionaries are media-shy .
zhao 's successor , jiang zamin , loved television and presented himself as a multi-talented leader with an unconventional style , and was once seen on tv singing " o sole mio . "
in today 's china , party functionaries know how to use tv images to benefit themselves . party head and technocrat wen jiabao was seen crying on tv after a mine accident and put on an emotional display while talking with a very poor farmer .
brazil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian president inacio lula da silva tv debates began in brazil in 1989 when current president luiz inacio lula da silva first ran for office .
after a first tv debate , lula was well positioned to significantly catch up with his opponent , fernando collor de mello .
indeed , just a few days before the election , collor was just one percentage point ahead of lula in the polls .
in the second debate , the most important brazilian broadcaster , globo tv , declared that collor had outperformed lula and aired part of the debate that was unfavorable to lula .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president fernando collor de mello collor de mello is part of a family in the state of alagoas , which has controlled the globo tv station since 1978 .
the media giant supported the military dictatorship -lrb- 1964-1985 -rrb- and has backed all subsequent governments for decades .
ultimately mello won with a 5-percent lead , but the so-called " collor-phenomenon " did n't last long .
two and a half years later , corruption charges forced president collor to resign .
after the last election in 2002 , lula da silva was elected .
today his government is involved in numerous corruption scandals and he is facing a similar impeachment procedure to the one that drove collor from office .
spanish-speaking countries many spanish-speaking countries hold populist tv debates fashioned from the american mold , but there are some distinctions from country to country .
chile has seen the gradual development of a stabile structure for public debate and tv debates have emerged since the end of the pinochet dictatorship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose maria aznar has been and gone as spain 's premier in spain there has only been one tv debate , namely between the socialist felipe gonzalez and the conservative jose maria aznar in 1996 .

a lucky 2-2 draw against holland on aug .
17 gave way to an embarrassing 2-0 defeat against slovakia .
as has been the case over the course of jürgen klinsmann 's reign as coach , a porous defense proved to be the downfall .
the offense , unlike the exciting matches at the cup in june , proved to be non-existent .
germany 's playmaker michael ballack offered what was probably one of his poorest matches as an international midfielder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when ballack has an off day , then the team has an off day " when he plays poorly , then the team has no one to turn to , " was the sober assessment of former world cup championship coach and player turned television analyst , franz beckenbauer .
bundesliga talent scores double miroslav karhan , who plays in the bundesliga with vfl wolfsburg , scored both goals , converting a penalty in the 20th minute and chipping over keeper jens lehmann for the second seven minutes before the break .
with only six more friendly matches before the world cup starts on june 9 , klinsmann has a true crisis on his hands as the various combinations he has tested in the backfield are proving to be incapable of the high demands of world soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his club kit green here , miroslav karhan scored twice against germany " i 'm very disappointed with the first half , " said klinsmann .
" we made costly individual mistakes and were slow to recover when we lost the ball .
we 've got a lot to work on . "
germany have conceded 10 goals in their last four games , 15 in their last seven , and have kept clean sheets in just two matches in 2005 , against tunisia and slovenia .
slovakia gets boost the victory for slovakia provided a welcome boost ahead of their trip to face latvia on wednesday , a match they must win to stay in the hunt for a world cup place .
slovakia are in second place in group three behind portugal and ahead of russia .
for germany coach jürgen klinsmann , the match will have raised further concerns over a defense that has been leaking goals since the confederations cup .
after a promising start for germany , the hosts turned the game around and then dominated the first half .
slovakia 's midfielder and goalscoring king last season at nuremberg , marek mintal , came close to putting his side on top when he flashed a shot just wide in the 13th minute after the ball had fallen to him at a corner .
the pressure on the german defense continued until per mertesacker cracked when he needlessly held on to robert vittek to give away the penalty .
an at times very insecure-looking slovakian goalkeeper kamil contofalsky was challenged on numerous occasions but the necessary bit of luck or smart play was missing at key moments .
the second strike came in the 38th minute when mintal hooked over a cross from wide on the left and karhan calmly lifted the ball over lehmann , who did little to back up his claim this week that he deserved to play in the world cup ahead of oliver kahn .
the debut performances of marcell jansen and lukas sinkiewicz were less than memorable as they worked their ways slowly into the squad after entering the game in the second half .
the last 45 minutes were generally better , with energetic confed cup stars lukas podolski and bastian schweinsteiger creating chances that still ended in a goose egg .

german hooligans again created problems for security officials in bratislava . the heady days of the confederations cup in june have turned into an early autumn hangover for the german national squad .
a lucky 2-2 draw against holland on aug .
17 gave way to an embarrassing 2-0 defeat against slovakia .
as has been the case over the course of jürgen klinsmann 's reign as coach , a porous defense proved to be the downfall .
the offense , unlike the exciting matches at the cup in june , proved to be non-existent .
germany 's playmaker michael ballack offered what was probably one of his poorest matches as an international midfielder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when ballack has an off day , then the team has an off day " when he plays poorly , then the team has no one to turn to , " was the sober assessment of former world cup championship coach and player turned television analyst , franz beckenbauer .
bundesliga talent scores double miroslav karhan , who plays in the bundesliga with vfl wolfsburg , scored both goals , converting a penalty in the 20th minute and chipping over keeper jens lehmann for the second seven minutes before the break .
with only six more friendly matches before the world cup starts on june 9 , klinsmann has a true crisis on his hands as the various combinations he has tested in the backfield are proving to be incapable of the high demands of world soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his club kit green here , miroslav karhan scored twice against germany " i 'm very disappointed with the first half , " said klinsmann .
" we made costly individual mistakes and were slow to recover when we lost the ball .
we 've got a lot to work on . "
germany have conceded 10 goals in their last four games , 15 in their last seven , and have kept clean sheets in just two matches in 2005 , against tunisia and slovenia .
slovakia gets boost the victory for slovakia provided a welcome boost ahead of their trip to face latvia on wednesday , a match they must win to stay in the hunt for a world cup place .
slovakia are in second place in group three behind portugal and ahead of russia .
for germany coach jürgen klinsmann , the match will have raised further concerns over a defense that has been leaking goals since the confederations cup .
after a promising start for germany , the hosts turned the game around and then dominated the first half .
slovakia 's midfielder and goalscoring king last season at nuremberg , marek mintal , came close to putting his side on top when he flashed a shot just wide in the 13th minute after the ball had fallen to him at a corner .
the pressure on the german defense continued until per mertesacker cracked when he needlessly held on to robert vittek to give away the penalty .
an at times very insecure-looking slovakian goalkeeper kamil contofalsky was challenged on numerous occasions but the necessary bit of luck or smart play was missing at key moments .
the second strike came in the 38th minute when mintal hooked over a cross from wide on the left and karhan calmly lifted the ball over lehmann , who did little to back up his claim this week that he deserved to play in the world cup ahead of oliver kahn .
the debut performances of marcell jansen and lukas sinkiewicz were less than memorable as they worked their ways slowly into the squad after entering the game in the second half .
the last 45 minutes were generally better , with energetic confed cup stars lukas podolski and bastian schweinsteiger creating chances that still ended in a goose egg .

as has been the case over the course of jürgen klinsmann 's reign as coach , a porous defense proved to be the downfall .
the offense , unlike the exciting matches at the cup in june , proved to be non-existent .
germany 's playmaker michael ballack offered what was probably one of his poorest matches as an international midfielder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when ballack has an off day , then the team has an off day " when he plays poorly , then the team has no one to turn to , " was the sober assessment of former world cup championship coach and player turned television analyst , franz beckenbauer .
bundesliga talent scores double miroslav karhan , who plays in the bundesliga with vfl wolfsburg , scored both goals , converting a penalty in the 20th minute and chipping over keeper jens lehmann for the second seven minutes before the break .
with only six more friendly matches before the world cup starts on june 9 , klinsmann has a true crisis on his hands as the various combinations he has tested in the backfield are proving to be incapable of the high demands of world soccer .

for germany coach jürgen klinsmann , the match will have raised further concerns over a defense that has been leaking goals since the confederations cup .
after a promising start for germany , the hosts turned the game around and then dominated the first half .
slovakia 's midfielder and goalscoring king last season at nuremberg , marek mintal , came close to putting his side on top when he flashed a shot just wide in the 13th minute after the ball had fallen to him at a corner .
the pressure on the german defense continued until per mertesacker cracked when he needlessly held on to robert vittek to give away the penalty .
an at times very insecure-looking slovakian goalkeeper kamil contofalsky was challenged on numerous occasions but the necessary bit of luck or smart play was missing at key moments .
the second strike came in the 38th minute when mintal hooked over a cross from wide on the left and karhan calmly lifted the ball over lehmann , who did little to back up his claim this week that he deserved to play in the world cup ahead of oliver kahn .
the debut performances of marcell jansen and lukas sinkiewicz were less than memorable as they worked their ways slowly into the squad after entering the game in the second half .

31 , club directors were active : bundesliga teams seeking to change their fortunes or improve already good starts hired young brazilians in numbers . abuda , kahe , romulo and rafinha : the names are n't as familiar as ronaldo , ronaldinho or new international superstar striker robinho .
the old brazilian guard in the bundesliga , lucio , marcelinho or ze roberto also may not be so acquainted with the youngsters .
yet a flurry of deals before the aug .
31 transfer deadline has brought a slew of young brazilians , predominantly forwards , to germany .
last year 's league runners-up schalke dug deepest and paid 5 million euros -lrb- $ 6.2 million -rrb- for their latest brazilian player , 19-year-old rafinha .
unlike the other three , marcio rafael ferreira de souza , short rafinha , is a defender .
germany has already faced the 1.72 meter -lrb- 5 foot 10 inch -rrb- back man , but not at the confederations cup , rather at the u-20 world championships in holland .
" rafinha made a very good impression during the tournament , " said schalke general manager rudi assauer .
like bayern munich 's lucio -lrb- photo -rrb- , rafinha is not shy of scoring goals .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : similar to bayern munich 's lucio , rafinha likes the joy of scoring a goal " like most brazilian defenders he is strong going forward , " team manager andreas müller added .
" he 's able to switch quickly from defense to attack , exert pressure down the flank and put in good crosses .
he 's also dangerous in front of the goal . "
in 13 matches this season with his previous club coritiba fc , he scored three times .
and his extra-time winner knocked out the u-20 german side in june .
forwards !
borussia mönchengladbach , already home to brazilian striker giovane elber , found it necessary to help out their elder statesman -lrb- 33 -rrb- with the 23-year-old kahe .
the deal with top first-league brazilian club palmeiras sao paolo cost 1.2 million euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : giovane elber during his stint with bayern munich .
he is the bundesliga 's most successful goalscorer from abroad " he is a physically robust , attacking striker , exactly the kind of player that 's been missing in our offense , " said club director peter pander .
indeed kahe 's goal-scoring services are needed .
in three bundesliga matches so far , gladbach have netted a paltry two goals and lie in 16th place in the standings .
questio n marks the other two brazilian newcomers are big question marks , both to the league , and admittedly to team coaches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abuda in one of his first practice sessions with wolfsburg adailiton pereira coelho , called abuda , signed a contract until 2008 with wolfsburg .
holger fach called the signing a bit of an unknown quantity .
" but i have full faith in our chief scouts ralph kellermann and ulil mohr , " the wolfsburg coach said .
decisive in the deal for abuda , however , was the advice of former wolfsburg player and brazilian friend fernando baiano .
" wolfsburg is not a foreign word to me , " the 19-year-old striker said .
" my mate baiano only had nice things to say about the club . "
the northern german town may not be foreign to him but many brazilians criticize abuda for being a little foreign in front of the net and wasting too many chances .
mainz is looking to make up for their poor jump out of the starting blocks with romulo .
he 's on loan for the remainder of the season from brazilian second-league side ituano .
there he had scored six times in the current season .
" romulo is comfortable with the ball and has a nose for the goal , " said mainz coach jürgen klopp about the 23-year-old .

26 , 1960 , for the first time in the us history , a debate between presidential candidates was shown on television .
the candidates were john f. kennedy , a democratic senator of massachusetts , and richard m. nixon , the us vice president .
they met in a chicago studio to discuss us domestic matters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john f. kennedy emerged the winner kennedy emerged the apparent winner from this first of four televised debates .
tanned , telegenic kennedy made a much better visual impression than pale , makeup-free , stubble-chinned nixon , who was recovering from the flu .
it was the first time the power of television in political contests became apparent .
the election was held in november and kennedy won 49.7 percent of the popular vote in one of the closest presidential elections in us history , surpassing by a fraction the 49.6 percent received by his republican opponent .
in the 1992 debates , george bush senior was caught on camera checking his watch during a town hall debate with then-governor bill clinton and businessman ross perot .
the gesture gave viewers the distinct impression that the elder bush would rather have been elsewhere .
the most recent debate controversy was bush 's so-called mystery bulge during the 2004 debates .
a tv image from the miami debate reveals what looked like a large solid object between his shoulder blades as he leaned over the lectern to face the moderator .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush shakes hands with john kerry ahead of the 3rd debate some said the bulge under his jacket was a hidden receiver , picking up transmissions from someone offstage who was feeding the president answers through a hidden earpiece .
speculation burned up internet blog sites .
on a few occasions , the president simply stopped speaking for an uncomfortably long time and stared ahead with an odd expression on his face .
was he listening to someone helping him with his response to a question ?
china tv duels are foreign to chinese television , which is no great surprise for a country which does n't tolerate much by way of political discussion .
live political programming is rare , with those programs which do make it on to air , filled with boring political events in which politicians obediently toe the party line .
real politics happens behind closed doors , away from the prying eye of tv cameras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chinese premier zhao ziyang at the beginning of the 1980s , the so-called third generation of party leaders celebrated their debut in front of the cameras .
during the press conference at the end of the 13th party congress -lrb- of the 13th people 's congress -rrb- the new party head zhao ziyang was relaxed and spontaneous with both chinese and western journalists .
that gave birth to a new generation of television-conscious party leaders , but it did n't last long .
zhao ziyang 's political end was also shown live on television in 1989 when millions viewed him shedding tears for the hunger-striking students marching on the gate of heavenly peace .
ziyang was consequently removed from power and placed under house arrest until his death in 2005 .
1989 saw the televising of an altogether different debate , when the then premier of the state council , li peng , faced the student leader , wuer kaixi .
wearing hospital pajamas and breathing apparatus , kaixi posed provocative questions to media-shy peng .
millions of viewers saw their otherwise sovereign leader in disgrace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jiang zemin talks to a cameraman but not all party functionaries are media-shy .
zhao 's successor , jiang zamin , loved television and presented himself as a multi-talented leader with an unconventional style , and was once seen on tv singing " o sole mio . "
in today 's china , party functionaries know how to use tv images to benefit themselves . party head and technocrat wen jiabao was seen crying on tv after a mine accident and put on an emotional display while talking with a very poor farmer .
brazil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian president inacio lula da silva tv debates began in brazil in 1989 when current president luiz inacio lula da silva first ran for office .
after a first tv debate , lula was well positioned to significantly catch up with his opponent , fernando collor de mello .
indeed , just a few days before the election , collor was just one percentage point ahead of lula in the polls .
in the second debate , the most important brazilian broadcaster , globo tv , declared that collor had outperformed lula and aired part of the debate that was unfavorable to lula .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president fernando collor de mello collor de mello is part of a family in the state of alagoas , which has controlled the globo tv station since 1978 .
the media giant supported the military dictatorship -lrb- 1964-1985 -rrb- and has backed all subsequent governments for decades .
ultimately mello won with a 5-percent lead , but the so-called " collor-phenomenon " did n't last long .
two and a half years later , corruption charges forced president collor to resign .
after the last election in 2002 , lula da silva was elected .
today his government is involved in numerous corruption scandals and he is facing a similar impeachment procedure to the one that drove collor from office .
spanish-speaking countries many spanish-speaking countries hold populist tv debates fashioned from the american mold , but there are some distinctions from country to country .
chile has seen the gradual development of a stabile structure for public debate and tv debates have emerged since the end of the pinochet dictatorship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose maria aznar has been and gone as spain 's premier in spain there has only been one tv debate , namely between the socialist felipe gonzalez and the conservative jose maria aznar in 1996 .
mexico had its first tv debate in 1994 .
in contrast to germany , where tv debates are subject to strict rules , mexico has no such regulations .
rather than structured debate , the objective is to discredit one 's political opponents with accusations and insults .
the arab world american-style tv debates are not a feature of the arab world , and are strictly outlawed by the powers that be .
but those same powers are not unaware of the opportunities television offers them in the name of protecting their patch . one of the first to make use of the power of the media was egyptian politician gamal abd an-nasser who allowed a radio broadcast to transmit his announcement of the nationalization of the suez canal . in 1967 , following the devastating defeat in the arab-israeli six-day war , nasser offered the people his resignation during a spontaneous tv appearance , fully aware that the vast majority would call for him to remain in office .
his successor , sadat , was often filmed with his pipe and cane to portray himself as an authentic and down-to-earth leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egyptian president hosni mubarak by contrast , the current president mubarak is perceived as uncharismatic and boring .
during his speeches , officials and members of the media often fall asleep .
and it does n't help that his speeches are televised on all tv channels , often interrupting programs people really want to watch .
the late palestinian president arafat was known for embracing and kissing his guests in front of the cameras .
in addition , he cultivated simple , but symbolic gestures , eating with common people and kissing the hands of ladies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : libyan leader moammer gadhafi last but not least are the spectacular appearances of the " media star " of arab politics , libya 's moammar gadhafi .
fleeting poses capture him sleeping in a tent and camel back riding .
russia the russian federation was one of the first eastern bloc states where tv debates were introduced for elections .
the first tv battles were organized shortly after the resignation of gorbachev and the breakup of the soviet union on june 19 , 1991 .
millions of soviet citizens followed these tense political shows with a mixture of euphoria , naive hope and child-like faith .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former russian president boris jelzin the first presidential campaign in russia lasted for two weeks and the tv debate provided each candidate with equal time to receive and answer live questions from the audience and moderators .
many top russian politicians , including ex-president boris yeltsin and the current head of the ultra-nationalistic liberal democrats vladimir shirinovski took part .
boris yeltsin was elected as the first president of russia on june 12 , 1991 .
shirinovski disagreed with the polls claiming that he had won and that the polls had been manipulated .
all subsequent debates on russian television were more of a show than a serious political discussion .
during a tv debate between shirinovski and the ex-faction head of the democratic party sps , boris nemzov , the two rivals doused each other with water .
in another case the debaters started a brawl .
during a debate running up to regional presidential elections in the republic tatarstan in 2001 , the former duma delegate sergei shashurin shelled the then president with swear words and relentless accusations .
the president felt insulted and made shashurin appear in court as a result .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin wo n't debate on television the current russian president putin does n't care much for televised political debates and refused to participate during the last presidential election .
" i already know every word of my competitor , " putin said .
" of course , you can try different tricks .
you can sing and dance .
but the people in our country can still decide with their hearts where the truth is and where lies are hidden . "

china tv duels are foreign to chinese television , which is no great surprise for a country which does n't tolerate much by way of political discussion .
live political programming is rare , with those programs which do make it on to air , filled with boring political events in which politicians obediently toe the party line .
real politics happens behind closed doors , away from the prying eye of tv cameras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former chinese premier zhao ziyang at the beginning of the 1980s , the so-called third generation of party leaders celebrated their debut in front of the cameras .
during the press conference at the end of the 13th party congress -lrb- of the 13th people 's congress -rrb- the new party head zhao ziyang was relaxed and spontaneous with both chinese and western journalists .
that gave birth to a new generation of television-conscious party leaders , but it did n't last long .
zhao ziyang 's political end was also shown live on television in 1989 when millions viewed him shedding tears for the hunger-striking students marching on the gate of heavenly peace .
ziyang was consequently removed from power and placed under house arrest until his death in 2005 .
1989 saw the televising of an altogether different debate , when the then premier of the state council , li peng , faced the student leader , wuer kaixi .
wearing hospital pajamas and breathing apparatus , kaixi posed provocative questions to media-shy peng .
millions of viewers saw their otherwise sovereign leader in disgrace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jiang zemin talks to a cameraman but not all party functionaries are media-shy .
zhao 's successor , jiang zamin , loved television and presented himself as a multi-talented leader with an unconventional style , and was once seen on tv singing " o sole mio . "
in today 's china , party functionaries know how to use tv images to benefit themselves . party head and technocrat wen jiabao was seen crying on tv after a mine accident and put on an emotional display while talking with a very poor farmer .
brazil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian president inacio lula da silva tv debates began in brazil in 1989 when current president luiz inacio lula da silva first ran for office .
after a first tv debate , lula was well positioned to significantly catch up with his opponent , fernando collor de mello .
indeed , just a few days before the election , collor was just one percentage point ahead of lula in the polls .
in the second debate , the most important brazilian broadcaster , globo tv , declared that collor had outperformed lula and aired part of the debate that was unfavorable to lula .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president fernando collor de mello collor de mello is part of a family in the state of alagoas , which has controlled the globo tv station since 1978 .
the media giant supported the military dictatorship -lrb- 1964-1985 -rrb- and has backed all subsequent governments for decades .
ultimately mello won with a 5-percent lead , but the so-called " collor-phenomenon " did n't last long .
two and a half years later , corruption charges forced president collor to resign .
after the last election in 2002 , lula da silva was elected .
today his government is involved in numerous corruption scandals and he is facing a similar impeachment procedure to the one that drove collor from office .

wearing hospital pajamas and breathing apparatus , kaixi posed provocative questions to media-shy peng .
millions of viewers saw their otherwise sovereign leader in disgrace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jiang zemin talks to a cameraman but not all party functionaries are media-shy .
zhao 's successor , jiang zamin , loved television and presented himself as a multi-talented leader with an unconventional style , and was once seen on tv singing " o sole mio . "
in today 's china , party functionaries know how to use tv images to benefit themselves . party head and technocrat wen jiabao was seen crying on tv after a mine accident and put on an emotional display while talking with a very poor farmer .
brazil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazilian president inacio lula da silva tv debates began in brazil in 1989 when current president luiz inacio lula da silva first ran for office .
after a first tv debate , lula was well positioned to significantly catch up with his opponent , fernando collor de mello .
indeed , just a few days before the election , collor was just one percentage point ahead of lula in the polls .
in the second debate , the most important brazilian broadcaster , globo tv , declared that collor had outperformed lula and aired part of the debate that was unfavorable to lula .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former president fernando collor de mello collor de mello is part of a family in the state of alagoas , which has controlled the globo tv station since 1978 .
the media giant supported the military dictatorship -lrb- 1964-1985 -rrb- and has backed all subsequent governments for decades .
ultimately mello won with a 5-percent lead , but the so-called " collor-phenomenon " did n't last long .
two and a half years later , corruption charges forced president collor to resign .
after the last election in 2002 , lula da silva was elected .
today his government is involved in numerous corruption scandals and he is facing a similar impeachment procedure to the one that drove collor from office .
spanish-speaking countries many spanish-speaking countries hold populist tv debates fashioned from the american mold , but there are some distinctions from country to country .
chile has seen the gradual development of a stabile structure for public debate and tv debates have emerged since the end of the pinochet dictatorship .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose maria aznar has been and gone as spain 's premier in spain there has only been one tv debate , namely between the socialist felipe gonzalez and the conservative jose maria aznar in 1996 .
mexico had its first tv debate in 1994 .
in contrast to germany , where tv debates are subject to strict rules , mexico has no such regulations .
rather than structured debate , the objective is to discredit one 's political opponents with accusations and insults .
the arab world american-style tv debates are not a feature of the arab world , and are strictly outlawed by the powers that be .
but those same powers are not unaware of the opportunities television offers them in the name of protecting their patch . one of the first to make use of the power of the media was egyptian politician gamal abd an-nasser who allowed a radio broadcast to transmit his announcement of the nationalization of the suez canal . in 1967 , following the devastating defeat in the arab-israeli six-day war , nasser offered the people his resignation during a spontaneous tv appearance , fully aware that the vast majority would call for him to remain in office .
his successor , sadat , was often filmed with his pipe and cane to portray himself as an authentic and down-to-earth leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : egyptian president hosni mubarak by contrast , the current president mubarak is perceived as uncharismatic and boring .
during his speeches , officials and members of the media often fall asleep .
and it does n't help that his speeches are televised on all tv channels , often interrupting programs people really want to watch .
the late palestinian president arafat was known for embracing and kissing his guests in front of the cameras .
in addition , he cultivated simple , but symbolic gestures , eating with common people and kissing the hands of ladies .

russia the russian federation was one of the first eastern bloc states where tv debates were introduced for elections .
the first tv battles were organized shortly after the resignation of gorbachev and the breakup of the soviet union on june 19 , 1991 .
millions of soviet citizens followed these tense political shows with a mixture of euphoria , naive hope and child-like faith .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former russian president boris jelzin the first presidential campaign in russia lasted for two weeks and the tv debate provided each candidate with equal time to receive and answer live questions from the audience and moderators .
many top russian politicians , including ex-president boris yeltsin and the current head of the ultra-nationalistic liberal democrats vladimir shirinovski took part .
boris yeltsin was elected as the first president of russia on june 12 , 1991 .
shirinovski disagreed with the polls claiming that he had won and that the polls had been manipulated .
all subsequent debates on russian television were more of a show than a serious political discussion .
during a tv debate between shirinovski and the ex-faction head of the democratic party sps , boris nemzov , the two rivals doused each other with water .
in another case the debaters started a brawl .
during a debate running up to regional presidential elections in the republic tatarstan in 2001 , the former duma delegate sergei shashurin shelled the then president with swear words and relentless accusations .
the president felt insulted and made shashurin appear in court as a result .

german hooligans again created problems for security officials in bratislava . the heady days of the confederations cup in june have turned into an early autumn hangover for the german national squad .
a lucky 2-2 draw against holland on aug .
17 gave way to an embarrassing 2-0 defeat against slovakia .
as has been the case over the course of jürgen klinsmann 's reign as coach , a porous defense proved to be the downfall .
the offense , unlike the exciting matches at the cup in june , proved to be non-existent .
germany 's playmaker michael ballack offered what was probably one of his poorest matches as an international midfielder .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when ballack has an off day , then the team has an off day " when he plays poorly , then the team has no one to turn to , " was the sober assessment of former world cup championship coach and player turned television analyst , franz beckenbauer .
bundesliga talent scores double miroslav karhan , who plays in the bundesliga with vfl wolfsburg , scored both goals , converting a penalty in the 20th minute and chipping over keeper jens lehmann for the second seven minutes before the break .
with only six more friendly matches before the world cup starts on june 9 , klinsmann has a true crisis on his hands as the various combinations he has tested in the backfield are proving to be incapable of the high demands of world soccer .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in his club kit green here , miroslav karhan scored twice against germany " i 'm very disappointed with the first half , " said klinsmann .
" we made costly individual mistakes and were slow to recover when we lost the ball .
we 've got a lot to work on . "
germany have conceded 10 goals in their last four games , 15 in their last seven , and have kept clean sheets in just two matches in 2005 , against tunisia and slovenia .
slovakia gets boost the victory for slovakia provided a welcome boost ahead of their trip to face latvia on wednesday , a match they must win to stay in the hunt for a world cup place .
slovakia are in second place in group three behind portugal and ahead of russia .
for germany coach jürgen klinsmann , the match will have raised further concerns over a defense that has been leaking goals since the confederations cup .
after a promising start for germany , the hosts turned the game around and then dominated the first half .
slovakia 's midfielder and goalscoring king last season at nuremberg , marek mintal , came close to putting his side on top when he flashed a shot just wide in the 13th minute after the ball had fallen to him at a corner .
the pressure on the german defense continued until per mertesacker cracked when he needlessly held on to robert vittek to give away the penalty .
an at times very insecure-looking slovakian goalkeeper kamil contofalsky was challenged on numerous occasions but the necessary bit of luck or smart play was missing at key moments .
the second strike came in the 38th minute when mintal hooked over a cross from wide on the left and karhan calmly lifted the ball over lehmann , who did little to back up his claim this week that he deserved to play in the world cup ahead of oliver kahn .
the debut performances of marcell jansen and lukas sinkiewicz were less than memorable as they worked their ways slowly into the squad after entering the game in the second half .
the last 45 minutes were generally better , with energetic confed cup stars lukas podolski and bastian schweinsteiger creating chances that still ended in a goose egg .
six hurt in hooligan violence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german interior and sports minister otto schily -lrb- l -rrb- and german soccer legend and head of the organizing comitee for the world cup 2006 franz beckenbauer the sparsely-visited match still managed to attract hooligans who battled with police in the german stands .
six people were hurt , one seriously , according to german soccer association press spokesman harald stenger .
during the match , the hooligans who presumably received tickets from slovakian acquaintances made their presence felt during the match , shouting " we all have stadium bans , " and " otto , we 're here anyway , " in reference to german interior minister otto schily , who was in attendance and whose ministry is in charge of security at next year 's world cup . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german hooligans taint slovenian friendly a " friendly " weekend soccer match between germany and slovenia quickly turned sour as before , during and after the game , german fans participated in racist violence , prompting fears of a revival of hooliganism .

london-based rachel gadsden has been awarded a bursary to develop her project about the former north wales hospital at denbigh .
now the hospital site is to be redeveloped for housing and business and community facilities .
some of the artist 's work on the decaying hospital site is on show at denbigh library from saturday .
the project will eventually encompass around 15 to 20 pieces of work , but six of her pieces are included in a larger exhibition called beyond the asylum .
ms gadsden said that this is the second project she has undertaken focussing on an asylum .
my work is really about the fragile nature of our lives and how we can survive rachel gadsden " i go into derelict sites to investigate their history and make paintings about the life that existed , " she said .
" in the way that memories are fragments the paintings give a glimpse of the history of the past . "
first opened in 1842 the hospital finally closed in 1995 .
at its height up to 2,000 patients were cared for there by thousands of staff .
to produce her work ms gadsden has explored the hospital site and investigated the archives .
her works on canvas are embedded with old patients records .
eventually the project will also include a film which will include some of her drawings merged with footage of the derelict site .
she has also spoken to three former psychiatric nurses at the hospital who have told her stories about the way patients were treated , and she has also gained mixed views of the asylum from some former patients .
" my work is really about the fragile nature of our lives and how we can survive , " explained the artist .
the asylum project will be complete in a year 's time the 120-acre site at denbigh is to be developed by a lancashire-based company after planning permission was granted in may .
last year prince charles , visiting the site for his restoration scheme the phoenix trust , said the prime example of victorian asylum architecture , was in danger of being " squandered " .
the asylum project presents a return to wales for ms gadsden who was formerly artist in residence at the old penallta colliery in the rhymney valley .

but west told the audience : " george bush does n't care about black people . "
the comment went out live on the us east coast , but was cut from a taped version seen on the west coast .
west also claimed the us was not set up " to help the poor , the black people , the less well-off as slow as possible " .
he appeared alongside comedian mike myers for a 90-second segment which began with myers speaking of the devastation katrina has caused to southern states of the us .
but to myers ' surprise , west departed from his script and said : " i hate the way they portray us in the media .
if you see a black family , it says they 're looting .
see a white family , it says they 're looking for food . "

the scale of the casualties is not yet known , but tens of thousands of people remain in the devastated city of new orleans while 75,000 people have been forced to take shelter in neighbouring texas .

actresses hilary swank and lindsay lohan also took part in the concert , while new york governor george pataki presented the red cross with a cheque for $ 2.5 million -lrb- £ 1.3m -rrb- with a promise of further assistance .

customers who fall foul of the small print could find they face a bill for hundreds of pounds .
we asked if you have been caught by a late payment charge or a change in terms and conditions , and if you think it fair that a cardholder can lose their 0 % deal if they miss a payment .
this debate has now closed .
a selection of your views are below .
i set up direct debits to pay my 0 % credit cards .
it is simple , all that is involved is signing an extra form .
once the direct debit has been set up , you can never be charged late payment fees as long as the transactions go through .
no more effort checking whether you have received the statement , or making the payment before the deadline each month .
i am surprised that so many people still try to remember everything themselves when there is a system which does it all for you .
andy yu , cambridge i had a 0 % balance transfer and got caught by the late payment hit too .
i had arranged on the 26 june , using the website , to change payments to direct debit .
playing the balance transfer game is usually worth it , but you have to read all the small print and stay very alert !
michael , solihull i naively assumed that this would take care of payments due on 28 july and later .
wrong .
they took nearly six weeks to process the request !
so , i got hit with a £ 25 fee and a month 's interest payment on £ 10,000 .
on complaining , they reduced the interest rate to 6.9 % but that was it .
playing the balance transfer game is usually worth it , but you have to read all the small print and stay very alert !
michael , solihull you ca n't blame the credit card companies for everything .
they are not being underhand in their charges .
remember , there is no such thing as free credit .
a 0 % interest rate has to be paid for somewhere .
if you ca n't be responsible for your own credit card use , pay your cards off with a bank loan and then cut them up !
patrick cartney , hemel hempstead i took out a credit card .
the first statement appeared with a £ 15 late payment penalty on it .
i rang them and there was no problem about taking off the £ 15 , but i had to find two month 's worth of payments at short notice .
this month the statement has come in with the payment and the £ 15 credited back on and a 5p interest charge .
obviously the computer thought that the £ 15 was a purchase !
i do n't know if i should contact them again to prevent this interest being an ongoing and growing problem , or if i should leave well alone .
a. e. thorpe i 'm often amazed when reading about how some people regard credit cards in the uk .
there is no such thing as free credit .
the companies are commercial companies .
if they ca n't make money on the -lrb- introductory -rrb- interest rates , they will make it another way .
in the netherlands we pay a yearly charge for using the card , but you always get a warning first before they can fine you .
the fact that it takes four days - or more - to clear payments is ridiculous sander , netherlands often a monthly direct debit to the full amount is mandatory as well , which does protect you from yourself .
that being said , the fact that it takes four days - or more - to clear payments is ridiculous .
nowadays , it can not be that hard for banks to transfer money , it 's all electronic anyway .
over here , it takes one day between current accounts .
between current and savings account from the same bank is usually immediate if you using internet banking .
hey , it only takes one to two days to transfer money from my german to my dutch bank account .
the euro does have its advantages !
and if our banks can do it , so can yours .
sander , netherlands at last the credit companies are coming to their senses and are realising they are not going to get the money back that they have lent out .
youngsters just think credit cards are like leaves on a tree : when it dies , just pick another one !
mr alexander i pay my balance off in full each month by direct debit , that way i do n't need to worry .
at the beginning of august we were in the process of moving house and i happened to check my bank balance .
i discovered that the money had n't gone out .
when i phoned the credit card company they said that they had accidentally stopped my direct debit and i would need to pay the balance and set up a new direct debit .
i paid the balance on the phone and was told not to use the card for three days as the account was in arrears .
i had been charged £ 18 for their mistake liz taylor , bristol once i had the internet set up i checked my credit card and noticed that i had been charged £ 18 for their mistake !
once again , i was on hold , wasting my time .
they refunded the fee , but with no official apology or compensation for the stress i have gone through .
as a result , i will be leaving them and my bank , as they are the same company .
liz taylor , bristol what a bunch of whingers !
i have no great love for the banks but believe a contract should be honoured .
you sign a contract with them when you take out a credit card .
part of that contract is that you agree you 'll be charged if you miss a payment , and that you confirm that you 've read all the small print .
it is best to avoid missing a payment by paying at least the minimum by direct debit .
after all , if the payment is late then , it 's their fault , not yours , and they ca n't charge you !
eamonn , isle of wight it 's not only fines for late payment , but for going over your limit .
i 've been charged £ 20 for going over my limit .
surely it 's the fault of my credit card company for allowing the transaction to proceed in the first place ?
angus , lincoln i grow quite weary of the tales of the supposedly " hard done by " found on your website .
most of these tales - like the story on money box itself - relate to people who simply did n't bother to make payments on time .
credit card companies are not a charity , they are a business alan line , london the woman on money box who transferred £ 13,000 to a new credit card to take advantage of 0 % interest knew full well - just like the rest of us - that she needed to make monthly payments .
she should have had the sense to check up if she did n't receive a statement .
credit card companies are not a charity .
they are a business .
you know roughly when you should make a payment and should ensure that you do !
alan line , london i use one of cards exclusively overseas as it does n't make a foreign exchange charge .
whilst i can pay a bill in new york and it goes straight onto my account , paying the account itself is a different matter .
i usually draw cash and pay it into a bank branch .
does that pay off the bill ?
no it does n't .
believe it or not they draw a cheque which they then send on to their credit card handler .
so even though i give a bank cash they still say it takes seven days to hit my account , and i 've been charged for making a late payment !
john trayner , st ives i cancelled my credit card after over 20 years of loyalty due to a change in its terms and conditions , in such a way that i feel it is now no better than a cheap rip-off card !
i cancelled my card immediately , but was surprised at how readily they accepted the cancellation david newhouse , southampton why ?
each month i pay the card off in full .
last month i underpaid by £ 20 on a monthly payment of £ 500 by mistake and ended up being charged the full amount of interest on the total amount instead of the outstanding amount .
i was so angry at this cheap trick from a company i had thought to be " on my side " .
who needs enemies ?
i cancelled my card immediately , but was surprised at how readily they accepted the cancellation .
maybe they can afford to lose my custom , or perhaps i 'm just a number to them after all .
david newhouse , southampton i have just had a £ 20 late payment charge levied in respect of an unpaid credit card balance of 94 pence !
i rang my card company which refused to withdraw the charge as it had previously withdrawn another late payment charge when i asked it to .
tamala mcgee , london i have a card with 0 % interest on balance transfers on which i transferred £ 2,000 .
i also set up a direct debit so the minimum balance was collected each month by my bank .
recently , i switched my current account and used the new bank 's account transfer service .
it undertook to take over all existing direct debit instructions and notify all organisations with whom i had set up direct debits .
make sure you do not get stung by hidden charges in the small print praveen thank , solihull however , my card company failed to register the new details and started to charge me £ 25 in returned payment fees plus £ 25 late payment fees and interest .
i complained .
after two months , it agreed to refund all charges and interest and has agreed to put back my 0 % rate .
i am aware the 0 % applies to balance transfers , not purchases , so i have not used this card to purchase any goods or services .
my advice is : read all small prints and yes , take advantage of free credit but make sure you do not get stung by hidden charges in the small print !
praveen thank , solihull my card company suggests you send in your payment five days before the payment date .
i 've been charged in the past even though my payment arrived before the due date , but within the five days before .
it leaves you wondering what is the payment date !
geoff carr , london my card company took ages to set up the account , and then when it did , it gave me a credit limit of £ 475 which , given i wanted to transfer around £ 5,000 from another card coming to the end of its 0 % period , was worse than useless .
i 'll just pay the card off from my savings robert dibley , stroud it claimed it was because i had so much " available credit " , because i still have some cards from previous 0 % deals which i have n't yet closed down .
so i 'm cancelling all those cards , and the first one ?
i 'll just pay the card off from my savings .
luckily i still had a couple of weeks left to pay off the other card before it starts charging me interest .
robert dibley , stroud i applied online for a card to take advantage of the 0 % balance transfer .
the following day , i heard the company was charging 2 % , to a maximum fee of £ 50 , to transfer funds .
i looked again on the website and found the small print of terms and conditions where the charges were detailed .
you really have to be on the ball when dealing with these companies penny keeble , bakewell at no time during my application was my attention brought to the possible cost of transferring .
i immediately applied to a different company , having first checked on the phone that there were no charges , and completed the form .
you really have to be on the ball when dealing with these companies .
penny keeble , bakewell i wo n't be the only one to report that i have been fined £ 20 for a payment that arrived one day late .
i pay my credit card bills monthly via internet banking , and earlier this week received the standard threatening letter announcing the late payment charge and demanding a further payment by a given date .
i was told that failure to comply would result in cancellation of my card .
i have been a customer without fault for over 40 years !
on receiving the demand i immediately checked my bank account and noted that the payment had been deducted from my account some three days before the payment due date .
they sat on it for four days before making an immediate electronic transfer douglas robertson , weybridge i called the company , to be told that the payment had arrived one day late , and that if i wanted to dispute it i should take up the matter with my bank .
i called my bank , to be told that it still took four working days to make the payment .
they sat on it for four days before making an immediate electronic transfer !
i do n't call this service from either my bank or my card company , who on receiving the payment just one day late , should surely not impose a punitive £ 20 penalty ?
douglas robertson , weybridge i missed a credit card payment and was fined £ 25 .
i could n't believe it .
i did n't receive the statement in the post .
i 'd been away and just did n't think of checking .
i 've had a card for several years , i 've usually paid in full and feel that the fine is unreasonable .
i feel it is mean to an old customer .
i was tempted to cancel the card but probably wo n't , and will probably arrange to pay the minimum by direct debit as you suggest .
lesley saltmarsh , london we were away for over a month this summer .
our credit card balance is always fully cleared each month .
it was paid in full before we went away on 5 july .
we rang the company but it was unsympathetic phil and jenny morris , cambridge when we returned we paid the bill for june / july in full online , £ 93.37 on 10 august , which was the due date for payment .
in august , we were surprised to be charged £ 25 for late payment because one it takes four working days for the payment to clear .
this is unreasonable .
we rang the company but it was unsympathetic .
is there no justice ?
we do not really want a credit card but have no choice .
it 's the currency of the day .
we intend to change cards .
phil and jenny morris , cambridge i am having serious financial difficulties at the moment like many people in this country .
i would like to see a cap put on the amount that credit card companies can charge , perhaps a proportion of the minimum payment , not about five times as much .
if you were not up against it , you would pay .
but last month i could not pay , so this month i thought it would be about £ 80 , but when i opened my statement it was £ 108 !
the banking code is the biggest load of rubbish i have ever seen lesley , cardiff these companies are forcing people into debt , and rubbing their hands together when they do it .
in the old days they protected their customers .
maybe they would not let you have money easily , but they played fair with you .
i look forward to the day when i can pay in my money in the morning and it will reach its destination by the afternoon , instead of taking four days .
what is the matter with this country , that the authorities can not get their act together , and stop this ?
the banking code is the biggest load of rubbish i have ever seen .

customers who fall foul of the small print could find they face a bill for hundreds of pounds .
we asked if you have been caught by a late payment charge or a change in terms and conditions , and if you think it fair that a cardholder can lose their 0 % deal if they miss a payment .
this debate has now closed .
a selection of your views are below .
i set up direct debits to pay my 0 % credit cards .
it is simple , all that is involved is signing an extra form .
once the direct debit has been set up , you can never be charged late payment fees as long as the transactions go through .
no more effort checking whether you have received the statement , or making the payment before the deadline each month .
i am surprised that so many people still try to remember everything themselves when there is a system which does it all for you .
andy yu , cambridge i had a 0 % balance transfer and got caught by the late payment hit too .
i had arranged on the 26 june , using the website , to change payments to direct debit .
playing the balance transfer game is usually worth it , but you have to read all the small print and stay very alert !
michael , solihull i naively assumed that this would take care of payments due on 28 july and later .
wrong .
they took nearly six weeks to process the request !
so , i got hit with a £ 25 fee and a month 's interest payment on £ 10,000 .
on complaining , they reduced the interest rate to 6.9 % but that was it .
playing the balance transfer game is usually worth it , but you have to read all the small print and stay very alert !
michael , solihull you ca n't blame the credit card companies for everything .
they are not being underhand in their charges .
remember , there is no such thing as free credit .
a 0 % interest rate has to be paid for somewhere .
if you ca n't be responsible for your own credit card use , pay your cards off with a bank loan and then cut them up !
patrick cartney , hemel hempstead i took out a credit card .
the first statement appeared with a £ 15 late payment penalty on it .
i rang them and there was no problem about taking off the £ 15 , but i had to find two month 's worth of payments at short notice .
this month the statement has come in with the payment and the £ 15 credited back on and a 5p interest charge .
obviously the computer thought that the £ 15 was a purchase !
i do n't know if i should contact them again to prevent this interest being an ongoing and growing problem , or if i should leave well alone .
a. e. thorpe i 'm often amazed when reading about how some people regard credit cards in the uk .
there is no such thing as free credit .
the companies are commercial companies .
if they ca n't make money on the -lrb- introductory -rrb- interest rates , they will make it another way .
in the netherlands we pay a yearly charge for using the card , but you always get a warning first before they can fine you .
the fact that it takes four days - or more - to clear payments is ridiculous sander , netherlands often a monthly direct debit to the full amount is mandatory as well , which does protect you from yourself .
that being said , the fact that it takes four days - or more - to clear payments is ridiculous .
nowadays , it can not be that hard for banks to transfer money , it 's all electronic anyway .
over here , it takes one day between current accounts .
between current and savings account from the same bank is usually immediate if you using internet banking .
hey , it only takes one to two days to transfer money from my german to my dutch bank account .
the euro does have its advantages !
and if our banks can do it , so can yours .
sander , netherlands at last the credit companies are coming to their senses and are realising they are not going to get the money back that they have lent out .
youngsters just think credit cards are like leaves on a tree : when it dies , just pick another one !
mr alexander i pay my balance off in full each month by direct debit , that way i do n't need to worry .
at the beginning of august we were in the process of moving house and i happened to check my bank balance .
i discovered that the money had n't gone out .
when i phoned the credit card company they said that they had accidentally stopped my direct debit and i would need to pay the balance and set up a new direct debit .
i paid the balance on the phone and was told not to use the card for three days as the account was in arrears .
i had been charged £ 18 for their mistake liz taylor , bristol once i had the internet set up i checked my credit card and noticed that i had been charged £ 18 for their mistake !
once again , i was on hold , wasting my time .
they refunded the fee , but with no official apology or compensation for the stress i have gone through .
as a result , i will be leaving them and my bank , as they are the same company .
liz taylor , bristol what a bunch of whingers !
i have no great love for the banks but believe a contract should be honoured .
you sign a contract with them when you take out a credit card .
part of that contract is that you agree you 'll be charged if you miss a payment , and that you confirm that you 've read all the small print .
it is best to avoid missing a payment by paying at least the minimum by direct debit .
after all , if the payment is late then , it 's their fault , not yours , and they ca n't charge you !
eamonn , isle of wight it 's not only fines for late payment , but for going over your limit .
i 've been charged £ 20 for going over my limit .
surely it 's the fault of my credit card company for allowing the transaction to proceed in the first place ?
