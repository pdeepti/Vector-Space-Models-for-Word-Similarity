ahead of a parliamentary budget committee meeting next week , members of the green party are refusing a costly project which would make german participation in the air defense air system meads irreversible . german companies and social democratic defense minister peter struck view meads as being strategically important , as it would be the only nato-commissioned defense project carried out jointly by the united states and european nations , notably germany and italy . according to nato , the medium extended air defense system would replace current hawk and patriot interceptors .
the initiators of meads credit it with the ability to protect forces and fixed installations against attacks by current and next-generation tactical ballistic missiles .
it ’ s been promised that meads as a surface-to-air system will have greater firepower and require less manpower than its predecessors . but do we need it ? but whether a new system is required at all for such a specific purpose remains a highly contested question among german parliamentarians .
meads started as a think-tank project between the us , italy and germany .
the system is meant to be fully operational by 2012 , with the us to provide 58 percent , germany 25 percent and italy 17 percent of the financing , the companies involved - lockheed martin , the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and mbda italy - sense a lucrative business opportunity .

the us and italy have already signed the meads contract and have been waiting for germany to follow suit . greens mps fear that the cost of the project will cause the meager national defense budget to burst at its seams .
but hans-peter bartels , a social democratic defense expert , argues that the cost will be offset by the opportunities that meads offers to german industry . “ germany is supposed to play a major role in the development of the radar system for meads , " bartels said .
" german industry stands to profit considerably from its participation in the project .
the expertise it already has and will gain in this field will no doubt come in handy in similar or follow-up projects . ” eads managers argue that the government in berlin can not afford to opt out of the project .
spokesman alexander reinhardt estimated that at least 450 jobs are at stake .
in the end , the greens , as the government 's junior coalition partner may not be prepared to thwart the project altogether .

amid ever-tighter budgets and a renewed zeal for " back to basics " education , the country has neglected to teach children how to make and appreciate music , the critics argue .
a 1999 study by the nonprofit german music council , an umbrella organization that promotes music in germany , showed that only 20 percent of german schoolchildren are taught by qualified music teachers .

in the era of the cold war and the space race , the focus in education switched from all-around liberal arts to science and technology .

so why are german schools giving music education short shrift ? classical violinist anne-sophie mutter may be one of germany 's best known ambassadors in the field of music , but lately she has rounded out her schedule of concerts , recordings and master classes with unexpected activity : promoting a music curriculum she developed for kindergartens and grade schools .
kids who don ’ t learn to read notes are like musical dyslexics , " mutter recently said in an interview with the german welt am sonntag newspaper .
she hopes her curriculum - a progressive , age based method that brings young children into early contact with music in theory and practice - will help make germany music-literate again .
" it is absurd that we go to the gym regularly to shape our hips but do n't do anything to keep our mind in form .
all infants are rocked and sung to , -lrb- but in school -rrb- music is no longer considered a basic need , " said mutter -lrb- photo -rrb- in the interview .
growing chorus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne-sophie mutter mutter 's voice is one of the most recent additions to the chorus of complaints about how german schools are failing in the area of music education .
amid ever-tighter budgets and a renewed zeal for " back to basics " education , the country has neglected to teach children how to make and appreciate music , the critics argue .
a 1999 study by the nonprofit german music council , an umbrella organization that promotes music in germany , showed that only 20 percent of german schoolchildren are taught by qualified music teachers .
the rest either got no music education or were instructed by unqualified teachers , said the council 's vice president , hans bessler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresdner kreuz choir recent polls have suggested the consequences are dramatic .
surveys have shown that german children sing worse and less frequently than they did a decade ago and they 're ignorant of their cultural patrimony .
fewer germans are music-literate , too .
mozart effect meanwhile , neurological studies - loosely grouped under the heading " mozart effect " - show a clear correlation between exposure to music and brain development , spatial and logical thinking , and academic success .
" the three important constants that the brain uses to absorb information are haptics , acoustics , and analysis , " mutter told welt am sonntag .
" all three are developed through music . ...
music should not be seen as a secondary subject , but as a basis for all other subjects . "
the sputnik effect felicitas liemersdorf , the principal of a cologne primary school , agrees .
" learning music in the school - from a qualified music teacher - is just as important as learning german or math or foreign languages .
unfortunately , society does n't really support this view . "
several decades ago , liemersdorf recalled , primary teachers needed to play an instrument as part of their degree studies .
" that all changed with sputnik , " she said .
in the era of the cold war and the space race , the focus in education switched from all-around liberal arts to science and technology .
finally , in the 1980s , the obligatory music component to education degrees was removed .
since the late 1990s , when germans were shocked by their country 's poor showing in comparative international tests , music education has lost even more ground .
any spare resources tend to be aimed at improving results in " basics , " like reading , math and foreign languages .
wanted : music teachers in fact , bessler of the german music council notes that german schools are meant to follow what he and others say is an " excellent " music curriculum .
but while it looks good on paper , it is almost never carried through - due to the severe shortage of trained music teachers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competitor in the " youth makes music " contest the german music council is making a public push to correct this weakness , bessler said .
it will campaign to attract more music students to the teaching profession , and plans are underway to revamp archaic teacher training , he added .
a lot is riding on their success .
when music in the public schools fails , only wealthier children will have ready access to lessons .
music : key to identity ?
more important than academic benefits , " a good music education helps children understand their own identity .
they learn to understand their own personality , " bessler said .
he cited several music projects , including one recorded in last year 's documentary film " rhythm is it " - about the effects of classical music on impoverished youth in berlin - where music gave hope to people in dire straits .
" where we make music , the social climate changes .
we need this more now than ever , " bessler said .
for anne-sophie mutter , nothing less than german culture is at stake .
" in the short term , a lack of culture can leads us to spiritual and mental poverty .

ahead of a parliamentary budget committee meeting next week , members of the green party are refusing a costly project which would make german participation in the air defense air system meads irreversible . german companies and social democratic defense minister peter struck view meads as being strategically important , as it would be the only nato-commissioned defense project carried out jointly by the united states and european nations , notably germany and italy . according to nato , the medium extended air defense system would replace current hawk and patriot interceptors .
the initiators of meads credit it with the ability to protect forces and fixed installations against attacks by current and next-generation tactical ballistic missiles .
it ’ s been promised that meads as a surface-to-air system will have greater firepower and require less manpower than its predecessors . but do we need it ? but whether a new system is required at all for such a specific purpose remains a highly contested question among german parliamentarians .
meads started as a think-tank project between the us , italy and germany .
the system is meant to be fully operational by 2012 , with the us to provide 58 percent , germany 25 percent and italy 17 percent of the financing , the companies involved - lockheed martin , the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and mbda italy - sense a lucrative business opportunity .

" this goes for both the development of the system and the ensuing purchase of meads launchers by germany .
it seems it ’ s rather a question of not spoiling transatlantic relations again after the iraq war and putting nato in an awkward position . ” waiting on germany defense minister struck has been unable to drum up unanimous support for the project , which he aims to push through during a meeting of the parliamentary budget committee on march 16 .
the us and italy have already signed the meads contract and have been waiting for germany to follow suit . greens mps fear that the cost of the project will cause the meager national defense budget to burst at its seams .
but hans-peter bartels , a social democratic defense expert , argues that the cost will be offset by the opportunities that meads offers to german industry . “ germany is supposed to play a major role in the development of the radar system for meads , " bartels said .
" german industry stands to profit considerably from its participation in the project .
the expertise it already has and will gain in this field will no doubt come in handy in similar or follow-up projects . ” eads managers argue that the government in berlin can not afford to opt out of the project .
spokesman alexander reinhardt estimated that at least 450 jobs are at stake .

ahead of a parliamentary budget committee meeting next week , members of the green party are refusing a costly project which would make german participation in the air defense air system meads irreversible . german companies and social democratic defense minister peter struck view meads as being strategically important , as it would be the only nato-commissioned defense project carried out jointly by the united states and european nations , notably germany and italy . according to nato , the medium extended air defense system would replace current hawk and patriot interceptors .
the initiators of meads credit it with the ability to protect forces and fixed installations against attacks by current and next-generation tactical ballistic missiles .
it ’ s been promised that meads as a surface-to-air system will have greater firepower and require less manpower than its predecessors . but do we need it ? but whether a new system is required at all for such a specific purpose remains a highly contested question among german parliamentarians .
meads started as a think-tank project between the us , italy and germany .
the system is meant to be fully operational by 2012 , with the us to provide 58 percent , germany 25 percent and italy 17 percent of the financing , the companies involved - lockheed martin , the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and mbda italy - sense a lucrative business opportunity .
but german greens parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele said the plan is more about politics than about being a military necessity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele “ i have the impression that the military use of the system is no longer at the heart of those who are pushing meads here , " ströbele -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" this goes for both the development of the system and the ensuing purchase of meads launchers by germany .
it seems it ’ s rather a question of not spoiling transatlantic relations again after the iraq war and putting nato in an awkward position . ” waiting on germany defense minister struck has been unable to drum up unanimous support for the project , which he aims to push through during a meeting of the parliamentary budget committee on march 16 .
the us and italy have already signed the meads contract and have been waiting for germany to follow suit . greens mps fear that the cost of the project will cause the meager national defense budget to burst at its seams .
but hans-peter bartels , a social democratic defense expert , argues that the cost will be offset by the opportunities that meads offers to german industry . “ germany is supposed to play a major role in the development of the radar system for meads , " bartels said .
" german industry stands to profit considerably from its participation in the project .
the expertise it already has and will gain in this field will no doubt come in handy in similar or follow-up projects . ” eads managers argue that the government in berlin can not afford to opt out of the project .
spokesman alexander reinhardt estimated that at least 450 jobs are at stake .
in the end , the greens , as the government 's junior coalition partner may not be prepared to thwart the project altogether .
but they could insist that germany order fewer than the 12 to 24 meads units planned by the defense minister . hardy graupner -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin to spend billion on missile defense germany reportedly plans to spend over € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- on the development of a new transatlantic anti-aircraft system over the next eight years .

soon , when calls are n't bouncing off cell phone towers , they 'll be hurtling through the internet - for less than half the price of a " normal " call . dozens of exhibitors at cebit , the world 's largest it fair , which opened in hanover on thursday , are ready to outfit consumers with headsets , switchboards , phones and answering machines for the day when voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- replaces analog and isdn phone lines . andreas gauger , head of 1 & 1 , germany 's second largest dsl provider , after deutsche telekom , called 2005 " the year that will go down in history for breaking the border between the internet and telephony . " dozens of companies in germany offer private and corporate internet telephony services and the cheaper calls that accompany it . after subscribing to a particular service , users can usually call within that network for free and calls to the german fixed-line network normally costs between one and two cents a minute .
the hamburg internet provider freenet has even done away with those costs for some of its voip packages . germany currently has about six million people using dsl connections to access the internet and 330,000 of them are taking advantage of their high-speed connections to make telephone calls , according to the association of telecommunications providers . " dsl is the technology that made voice over ip possible , " said karsten krug of avm , the producer of the widely popular fritz line of devices used to connect computers to high-speed internet services . telekom joins in voip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile communications providers like o2 are also interested in making voip work for them transferring phone calls to the internet could spell trouble for deutsche telekom , which still keeps the vast majority of germans connected , if people begin to shy away from the former monopoly 's ubiquitous analog and isdn phone systems . " internet telephony is not going to bring a large growth in profits , " said rainer beaujean , head of t-online , the deutsche telekom subsidiary responsible for internet connections .
" but it is important to keep customers . " also important to customers is being able to guarantee a certain quality of service , said carsten lachmann , who manned a t-systems - another deutsche telekom subsidiary - booth at cebit . " there are no guarantees on the internet , " said lachmann , who sets up voip calling for corporate customers .
" anyone who tells you different is lying .
if everyone on the network starts calling or downloading at the same time there are going to be problems . " dsl will keep speeding up a typical voip call requires an upstream data supply of about 100 kbps , while today 's dsl connections offer between 128 kbps and 392 kbps .
deutsche telekom is planning to double download speeds to 6 megabits per second across germany by the middle of this year and speed things up to 25 mbps in some major german cities by 2006 . " voice over ip already has the quality of analog phones , " krug of avm said .
" now , by increasing bandwidth , we are able to improve the quality even more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voip phones look just like their analog counterparts .
voip works by encoding a caller 's voice into digital data then breaking the information into small packets and sending them through the internet to be correctly decoded at the other end by the person receiving the call . new phones for non-tech types along with lower costs , better quality has taken voip from the domain of a few computer geeks when it first emerged about 10 years ago to the general public . at cebit , avm and other telecommunications companies are looking for ways to make internet telephony easier for customers to use .
the new high-tech phones now resemble their analog counterparts in all but the type of cable that is plugged in and the phone bill that comes at the end of the month .
" i do n't notice any difference in quality between voip and an analog phone , " said t-systems lachmann , who uses a dsl connection to make his phone calls .

it 's long been no secret that new economic powerhouses are on the rise in asia .
but are they endangering jobs in " old " economies like germany and japan ?
not necessarily . asia , along with the united states , is quickly on its way to becoming a main pillar of the world economy .
for years , china has been making headlines with blazing growth rates and expanding wealth .
india now appears set on a similar path , as it becomes an important part of international trade and commerce . in the coming years , over 100 million people in those two nations will become a part of the global labor market .
what will that mean for comparably older economies such as japan and germany ?
will world export champ germany soon become the global leader in exporting jobs ?

"
he has been hiding since a warrant for his arrest on multiple counts of pedophilia was issued in august 1996 .
schäfer was convicted of the charges in november 2004 along with 22 other dignidad members . " the arrest of paul schaefer is good news , " fischer said .
" his arrest will allow a comprehensive investigation all the criminal activities in the former colonia dignidad to be carried out and punishments to be handed down . "
argentine police commissioner alejandro dinisio told afp that schäfer carried no identification documents and refused to speak at the time of his arrest .
he added that police had been on his trail for six months . television reporters mobbed schäfer as an agent pushed the elderly suspect on his wheelchair into a provincial police station .
schäfer was shown on television handcuffed and smiling , and holding a bottle of soda . officials said he could be transferred to buenos aires as early as friday . child abuse and cultic practices a former corporal and medic in hitler 's nazi army , schäfer fled germany to chile in 1961 to avoid child sexual abuse charges .
he established the self-sufficient colonia dignidad , also called " villa baviera , " in the mountains near the city of parral , some 350 kilometers -lrb- 218 miles -rrb- south of santiago along with other german immigrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the main gate of " colonia dignidad " in 1988 surrounded by barbed wire and electric fences and protected by barricades , the community , populated largely by germans , adhered to a strict discipline and remained cut off from the rest of chile .
a mixture of cultic practices such as exorcising devils and psychological terror were said to rampant in the sect . in 1996 a number of former residents testified that schäfer systematically abused the colony 's young children , many of whom were taken from the parents at birth .
accusations of forced labor and other forms of maltreatment also surfaced at the time . a torture center and school chilean officials also want schäfer in connection with torture during the 1973-1990 pinochet dictatorship .
the colony apparently served as a torture center for the chilean secret service as well as a torture school where former gestapo and nazi officers gave lessons . investigators say that political prisoners , including former leftist leader alvaro vallejos villagran - arrested by pinochet agents in may 1974 - vanished after being sent to colonia dignidad . a former member of pinochet 's secret police gave testimony stating that he knew vallejos villagran was taken alive to dignidad . schäfer and the colony are believed to have enjoyed pinochet 's protection right until the end of his dictatorship in 1990 . disappearance of professor police also want to question schäfer about the 1985 disappearance of boris weisfeiler , an american jewish mathematics professor of russian origin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators outside " colonia dignidad " investigators believe weisfeiler was picked up by a military border patrol while he was backpacking in the region on suspicion of being a spy and dropped off at dignidad . weisfeiler 's sister olga said there were reports by dignidad residents of seeing him alive up to two years later . schäfer 's arrest on thursday sparked relief among the present residents of the colony .
about 300 people , mainly germans , still live there . " i believe , we 're all happy here today .
i definitely am - we had to suffer too much , " one of them told chilean television . to accelerate schäfer 's departure , the chilean interior minister asked his argentine counterpart to kick him out of argentina and avoid going to court to ask for an extradition , which could delay the case with appeals . officials praised the joint action on thursday by argentine and chilean police which led to schäfer 's arrest . " we are proud of this arrest , " said a justice spokesman in santiago de chile .

the protesters refused to leave the craft , but shortly after the incident started they allowed other passengers and crew to get off without incident . at an early stage in the standoff a correspondent for zdf german television who spoke with one of the passengers by telephone said he had been told that no arms were aboard the plane and that no hostages were being held . the remaining passengers " all have passports from the european union , " but " they say they are of iranian origin , " cleemput said earlier . a young iranian , who spoke to reporters at brussels airport on behalf of the passengers , said the action had been under preparation for five months by a london-based iranian monarchist group , " azarakhsh .

" as the night wore on , the plane was moved from its parking gate in preparation for an " administrative " arrest of those on board , police said . peaceful resolution it was at this point that the protesters decided to give themselves up .

"
he has been hiding since a warrant for his arrest on multiple counts of pedophilia was issued in august 1996 .
schäfer was convicted of the charges in november 2004 along with 22 other dignidad members . " the arrest of paul schaefer is good news , " fischer said .
" his arrest will allow a comprehensive investigation all the criminal activities in the former colonia dignidad to be carried out and punishments to be handed down . "
argentine police commissioner alejandro dinisio told afp that schäfer carried no identification documents and refused to speak at the time of his arrest .
he added that police had been on his trail for six months . television reporters mobbed schäfer as an agent pushed the elderly suspect on his wheelchair into a provincial police station .
schäfer was shown on television handcuffed and smiling , and holding a bottle of soda . officials said he could be transferred to buenos aires as early as friday . child abuse and cultic practices a former corporal and medic in hitler 's nazi army , schäfer fled germany to chile in 1961 to avoid child sexual abuse charges .

a mixture of cultic practices such as exorcising devils and psychological terror were said to rampant in the sect . in 1996 a number of former residents testified that schäfer systematically abused the colony 's young children , many of whom were taken from the parents at birth .
accusations of forced labor and other forms of maltreatment also surfaced at the time . a torture center and school chilean officials also want schäfer in connection with torture during the 1973-1990 pinochet dictatorship .
the colony apparently served as a torture center for the chilean secret service as well as a torture school where former gestapo and nazi officers gave lessons . investigators say that political prisoners , including former leftist leader alvaro vallejos villagran - arrested by pinochet agents in may 1974 - vanished after being sent to colonia dignidad . a former member of pinochet 's secret police gave testimony stating that he knew vallejos villagran was taken alive to dignidad . schäfer and the colony are believed to have enjoyed pinochet 's protection right until the end of his dictatorship in 1990 . disappearance of professor police also want to question schäfer about the 1985 disappearance of boris weisfeiler , an american jewish mathematics professor of russian origin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators outside " colonia dignidad " investigators believe weisfeiler was picked up by a military border patrol while he was backpacking in the region on suspicion of being a spy and dropped off at dignidad . weisfeiler 's sister olga said there were reports by dignidad residents of seeing him alive up to two years later . schäfer 's arrest on thursday sparked relief among the present residents of the colony .
about 300 people , mainly germans , still live there . " i believe , we 're all happy here today .
i definitely am - we had to suffer too much , " one of them told chilean television . to accelerate schäfer 's departure , the chilean interior minister asked his argentine counterpart to kick him out of argentina and avoid going to court to ask for an extradition , which could delay the case with appeals . officials praised the joint action on thursday by argentine and chilean police which led to schäfer 's arrest . " we are proud of this arrest , " said a justice spokesman in santiago de chile .

the eu is negotiating with the islamic state 's government , notably offering the prospect of a trade agreement in exchange for guarantees about its nuclear program . the plane had arrived from frankfurt on thursday afternoon .
the protesters refused to leave the craft , but shortly after the incident started they allowed other passengers and crew to get off without incident . at an early stage in the standoff a correspondent for zdf german television who spoke with one of the passengers by telephone said he had been told that no arms were aboard the plane and that no hostages were being held . the remaining passengers " all have passports from the european union , " but " they say they are of iranian origin , " cleemput said earlier . a young iranian , who spoke to reporters at brussels airport on behalf of the passengers , said the action had been under preparation for five months by a london-based iranian monarchist group , " azarakhsh . " " we all ask the leaders of the european union -lrb- not to -rrb- support the regime in iran .
we do n't ask nobody , no country , nor any power in the world to help us to change the regime .
we can do it ourselves , " said the man who identified himself as ramin . the rtl-tvi television station said the group 's demands were " political demands " linked notably to the european union 's policies with regard to iran . the german magazine der spiegel said it had received a letter from the group , which described itself as representing iranian men and women protesting against a tehran regime responsible for " torture and terror . " as the night wore on , the plane was moved from its parking gate in preparation for an " administrative " arrest of those on board , police said . peaceful resolution it was at this point that the protesters decided to give themselves up .
" we always said to the activists that they would have no problems if they decided to leave the plane , " said cleemput . in berlin , a lufthansa spokesman said the protest " had nothing to do with our company .

the topic had been debated for years in germany , but took on a new urgency in the past few weeks after germany came under increased pressure to rein in its emboldened right-wing extremists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large neo-nazi demonstrations in dresden -lrb- photo -rrb- during the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of the city last month and further planned far-right marches at the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , had turned up the heat on policy makers .
in addition to sharpening the right of assembly , friday 's vote also approved changing the country 's criminal code to include a passage calling for up to three years in jail or a fine for glorification of the nazis , or justifying or downplaying the atrocities of the third reich .
" to think of right-wing extremist groups demonstrating in front of memorials for the victims of nazi crimes , either endorsing , denying , or playing down these crimes against humanity , is unbearable , " german interior minister otto schily said last month .
the bundesrat or the upper house of parliament is expected to ratify the changes within the next week .
a threat to democracy most parties on friday hailed the vote as a boost to democracy .
" we 'll have a few additional possibilities in the future to prevent nazi mischief on our streets and squares , " said dieter wiefelspütz , spd domestic policy expert .

27 , 2005 .
" a broad majority of the bundestag has given the victims of the nazi regime a clear signal : germany will remain alert even 60 years after auschwitz , " said silke stokar von neuforn of the green party .
however , germany 's opposition liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- on friday , voted against the planned beefing up of the right of assembly , saying it had doubts whether the move would work to curb far-right groups .
max stadler , domestic policy expert of the fdp , said that freedom of expression and assembly were fundamental to a democracy and that a tightening of the law was the wrong way to deal with far-right extremists .
stadler criticized that the bundestag was worrying showing itself to be increasingly prepared to violate basic rights .
he added it was probably okay in a one-off case , but simply went too far on the whole .
doubts remain over effectiveness despite the relief among most mainstream parties at friday 's decision , questions still remain over how effective the proposed sharpening of the law will prove in limiting neo-nazi groups .
many politicians were annoyed that the changes disregarded a cdu demand to include the brandenburg gate in the demonstration-free zone around the german reichstag .

bavarian interior minister günther beckstein criticized that the new law was " rushed and in parts half-hearted , " though it did go in the right direction .
both beckstein and german interior minister otto schily said they had doubts whether the spiking of the law could prevent the yearly neo-nazi march to the grave of rudolf hess , hitler 's deputy , in wunsiedel .
others voiced doubts over whether the changes were in line with the constitution .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the cdu parliamentary group , said there was no guarantee that the new law was in step with the constitution .
" we ca n't guarantee what decision the german constitutional court could possibly come to one day , " bosbach said .
" we 're only doing what we can to give the authorities instruments to prevent demonstrations more easily . "
earlier , fdp head guido westerwelle called the law " dilettantish " and said that neo-nazi groups could easily challenge the curbs on their right to demonstrate and had " a very good chance of success " at the constitutional court . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de seeking common ground to curb neo-nazis both the government and opposition agree that the right of assembly needs tightening to prevent neo-nazi marches at historic landmarks such as the brandenburg gate in berlin .

it 's long been no secret that new economic powerhouses are on the rise in asia .
but are they endangering jobs in " old " economies like germany and japan ?
not necessarily . asia , along with the united states , is quickly on its way to becoming a main pillar of the world economy .
for years , china has been making headlines with blazing growth rates and expanding wealth .
india now appears set on a similar path , as it becomes an important part of international trade and commerce . in the coming years , over 100 million people in those two nations will become a part of the global labor market .
what will that mean for comparably older economies such as japan and germany ?
will world export champ germany soon become the global leader in exporting jobs ?
is cutting wages and working longer the answer to the new challenge from asia ? quality exports when markus taube , director of the east asia institute at the university of duisburg , gives a speech about china , he essentially only needs to carry one chart with him .
regardless of what he 's talking about - foreign investment , exports , imports or gross domestic product - the graph for china points skyward .
he believes that 's evidence enough that the country far more advanced than is generally known . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tourist walks past a chinese sign as skyscrapers tower into clouds as background in shanghai .
taube uses the example of china 's exports , which are no longer confined to labor-intensive products , to make his point .
" the technological sophistication of chinese exports is much higher than most us can imagine , " he said .
" and it is effectively also much higher than many eastern european states . " in china , capitalism has been compatible with marx and lenin since 1992 .
the country even joined the world trade organization in 2001 and last year , private ownership was given equal status with that of the state in the chinese constitution .
all of that has helped push china to the pinnacle the world economy in a matter of years .
it is now the world 's fourth biggest exporter after germany , the usa and japan . taube said prospects for stable and continuous growth for years to come will ensure china is not simply the world 's sweatshop for cheap , mass-made products .
and as inexpensive labor meets high-tech , quality german goods will face ever more competition on world markets . and experts agree germany can not compete simply by lowering its labor costs .
whereas hourly wages for manufactured goods in china cost a mere $ 0.80 -lrb- € 0.60 -rrb- , in the united states its $ 21 and in germany over $ 30 . india awakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's ascent has been expected for years , but only recently , another asian giant has awakened : india .
seeing its neighbor sprint ahead as it continued to flounder , india was spurned on to undertake economy reforms recently .
in only a short time , the country has become a global player in the outsourcing and high-tech industries . " india has undergone a phenomenal opening since 2003 , " said peter von guretzky-cornitz , a regional analyst for hypovereinsbank . but he thinks the changes in india present more of an opportunity than a challenge to germany .
after talking about improving the country 's infrastructure for 20 years , indian officials are finally doing something about it .
and that 's good for german business . " you can see that germany will benefit as asia general decides to put a greater emphasis on quality , " von guretzky-cornitz said .
" an indian or chinese who drives a bmw privately now wants a backhoe or a crane or a cement mixer that ’ s from switzerland , germany or austria instead of a copy of a european machine from korea . " good for germany that 's obviously good for german exporters , but what about german investment in booming asian economies ?
as the money goes , wo n't that also move jobs abroad ?
not according to von guretzky-cornitz , who said much of what is produced in asia is meant for those markets alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael finger , an economist at the wto in geneva , even said growth in asia was like " manna from heaven " as german firm profit from those expanding markets .
" i see strong advantages for capital goods from germany , " he said . but all the experts agreed germany will have to concentrate on future-oriented fields and areas of expertise if it wants to keep pace with the changing global economy .
simply trying to lower costs to go toe-to-toe with cheap producers such as china and india , however , would be a disaster . " that simply wo n't work , " said china expert taube . rolf wenkel -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hung -lrb- a -rrb- ry for german investment germany is hungary 's largest trading partner and has invested heavily in the country since the fall of the iron curtain .

the protesters refused to leave the craft , but shortly after the incident started they allowed other passengers and crew to get off without incident . at an early stage in the standoff a correspondent for zdf german television who spoke with one of the passengers by telephone said he had been told that no arms were aboard the plane and that no hostages were being held . the remaining passengers " all have passports from the european union , " but " they say they are of iranian origin , " cleemput said earlier . a young iranian , who spoke to reporters at brussels airport on behalf of the passengers , said the action had been under preparation for five months by a london-based iranian monarchist group , " azarakhsh .

we do n't ask nobody , no country , nor any power in the world to help us to change the regime .
we can do it ourselves , " said the man who identified himself as ramin . the rtl-tvi television station said the group 's demands were " political demands " linked notably to the european union 's policies with regard to iran . the german magazine der spiegel said it had received a letter from the group , which described itself as representing iranian men and women protesting against a tehran regime responsible for " torture and terror . " as the night wore on , the plane was moved from its parking gate in preparation for an " administrative " arrest of those on board , police said . peaceful resolution it was at this point that the protesters decided to give themselves up .
" we always said to the activists that they would have no problems if they decided to leave the plane , " said cleemput . in berlin , a lufthansa spokesman said the protest " had nothing to do with our company . " " they have chosen without a doubt a strange place to demonstrate , " said the spokesman , thomas ellerbeck . he said the plane was carrying 120 passengers when it left frankfurt .

so why are german schools giving music education short shrift ? classical violinist anne-sophie mutter may be one of germany 's best known ambassadors in the field of music , but lately she has rounded out her schedule of concerts , recordings and master classes with unexpected activity : promoting a music curriculum she developed for kindergartens and grade schools .
kids who don ’ t learn to read notes are like musical dyslexics , " mutter recently said in an interview with the german welt am sonntag newspaper .
she hopes her curriculum - a progressive , age based method that brings young children into early contact with music in theory and practice - will help make germany music-literate again .
" it is absurd that we go to the gym regularly to shape our hips but do n't do anything to keep our mind in form .

amid ever-tighter budgets and a renewed zeal for " back to basics " education , the country has neglected to teach children how to make and appreciate music , the critics argue .
a 1999 study by the nonprofit german music council , an umbrella organization that promotes music in germany , showed that only 20 percent of german schoolchildren are taught by qualified music teachers .
the rest either got no music education or were instructed by unqualified teachers , said the council 's vice president , hans bessler .

" learning music in the school - from a qualified music teacher - is just as important as learning german or math or foreign languages .
unfortunately , society does n't really support this view . "
several decades ago , liemersdorf recalled , primary teachers needed to play an instrument as part of their degree studies .
" that all changed with sputnik , " she said .
in the era of the cold war and the space race , the focus in education switched from all-around liberal arts to science and technology .
finally , in the 1980s , the obligatory music component to education degrees was removed .
since the late 1990s , when germans were shocked by their country 's poor showing in comparative international tests , music education has lost even more ground .

ahead of a parliamentary budget committee meeting next week , members of the green party are refusing a costly project which would make german participation in the air defense air system meads irreversible . german companies and social democratic defense minister peter struck view meads as being strategically important , as it would be the only nato-commissioned defense project carried out jointly by the united states and european nations , notably germany and italy . according to nato , the medium extended air defense system would replace current hawk and patriot interceptors .
the initiators of meads credit it with the ability to protect forces and fixed installations against attacks by current and next-generation tactical ballistic missiles .
it ’ s been promised that meads as a surface-to-air system will have greater firepower and require less manpower than its predecessors . but do we need it ? but whether a new system is required at all for such a specific purpose remains a highly contested question among german parliamentarians .
meads started as a think-tank project between the us , italy and germany .
the system is meant to be fully operational by 2012 , with the us to provide 58 percent , germany 25 percent and italy 17 percent of the financing , the companies involved - lockheed martin , the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and mbda italy - sense a lucrative business opportunity .
but german greens parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele said the plan is more about politics than about being a military necessity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele “ i have the impression that the military use of the system is no longer at the heart of those who are pushing meads here , " ströbele -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" this goes for both the development of the system and the ensuing purchase of meads launchers by germany .
it seems it ’ s rather a question of not spoiling transatlantic relations again after the iraq war and putting nato in an awkward position . ” waiting on germany defense minister struck has been unable to drum up unanimous support for the project , which he aims to push through during a meeting of the parliamentary budget committee on march 16 .
the us and italy have already signed the meads contract and have been waiting for germany to follow suit . greens mps fear that the cost of the project will cause the meager national defense budget to burst at its seams .
but hans-peter bartels , a social democratic defense expert , argues that the cost will be offset by the opportunities that meads offers to german industry . “ germany is supposed to play a major role in the development of the radar system for meads , " bartels said .
" german industry stands to profit considerably from its participation in the project .
the expertise it already has and will gain in this field will no doubt come in handy in similar or follow-up projects . ” eads managers argue that the government in berlin can not afford to opt out of the project .
spokesman alexander reinhardt estimated that at least 450 jobs are at stake .
in the end , the greens , as the government 's junior coalition partner may not be prepared to thwart the project altogether .
but they could insist that germany order fewer than the 12 to 24 meads units planned by the defense minister . hardy graupner -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin to spend billion on missile defense germany reportedly plans to spend over € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- on the development of a new transatlantic anti-aircraft system over the next eight years .

ahead of a parliamentary budget committee meeting next week , members of the green party are refusing a costly project which would make german participation in the air defense air system meads irreversible . german companies and social democratic defense minister peter struck view meads as being strategically important , as it would be the only nato-commissioned defense project carried out jointly by the united states and european nations , notably germany and italy . according to nato , the medium extended air defense system would replace current hawk and patriot interceptors .
the initiators of meads credit it with the ability to protect forces and fixed installations against attacks by current and next-generation tactical ballistic missiles .
it ’ s been promised that meads as a surface-to-air system will have greater firepower and require less manpower than its predecessors . but do we need it ? but whether a new system is required at all for such a specific purpose remains a highly contested question among german parliamentarians .
meads started as a think-tank project between the us , italy and germany .

so why are german schools giving music education short shrift ? classical violinist anne-sophie mutter may be one of germany 's best known ambassadors in the field of music , but lately she has rounded out her schedule of concerts , recordings and master classes with unexpected activity : promoting a music curriculum she developed for kindergartens and grade schools .
kids who don ’ t learn to read notes are like musical dyslexics , " mutter recently said in an interview with the german welt am sonntag newspaper .
she hopes her curriculum - a progressive , age based method that brings young children into early contact with music in theory and practice - will help make germany music-literate again .
" it is absurd that we go to the gym regularly to shape our hips but do n't do anything to keep our mind in form .
all infants are rocked and sung to , -lrb- but in school -rrb- music is no longer considered a basic need , " said mutter -lrb- photo -rrb- in the interview .
growing chorus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne-sophie mutter mutter 's voice is one of the most recent additions to the chorus of complaints about how german schools are failing in the area of music education .
amid ever-tighter budgets and a renewed zeal for " back to basics " education , the country has neglected to teach children how to make and appreciate music , the critics argue .
a 1999 study by the nonprofit german music council , an umbrella organization that promotes music in germany , showed that only 20 percent of german schoolchildren are taught by qualified music teachers .
the rest either got no music education or were instructed by unqualified teachers , said the council 's vice president , hans bessler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresdner kreuz choir recent polls have suggested the consequences are dramatic .
surveys have shown that german children sing worse and less frequently than they did a decade ago and they 're ignorant of their cultural patrimony .
fewer germans are music-literate , too .
mozart effect meanwhile , neurological studies - loosely grouped under the heading " mozart effect " - show a clear correlation between exposure to music and brain development , spatial and logical thinking , and academic success .
" the three important constants that the brain uses to absorb information are haptics , acoustics , and analysis , " mutter told welt am sonntag .
" all three are developed through music . ...
music should not be seen as a secondary subject , but as a basis for all other subjects . "
the sputnik effect felicitas liemersdorf , the principal of a cologne primary school , agrees .
" learning music in the school - from a qualified music teacher - is just as important as learning german or math or foreign languages .
unfortunately , society does n't really support this view . "
several decades ago , liemersdorf recalled , primary teachers needed to play an instrument as part of their degree studies .

it 's long been no secret that new economic powerhouses are on the rise in asia .
but are they endangering jobs in " old " economies like germany and japan ?
not necessarily . asia , along with the united states , is quickly on its way to becoming a main pillar of the world economy .
for years , china has been making headlines with blazing growth rates and expanding wealth .
india now appears set on a similar path , as it becomes an important part of international trade and commerce . in the coming years , over 100 million people in those two nations will become a part of the global labor market .
what will that mean for comparably older economies such as japan and germany ?
will world export champ germany soon become the global leader in exporting jobs ?
is cutting wages and working longer the answer to the new challenge from asia ? quality exports when markus taube , director of the east asia institute at the university of duisburg , gives a speech about china , he essentially only needs to carry one chart with him .
regardless of what he 's talking about - foreign investment , exports , imports or gross domestic product - the graph for china points skyward .
he believes that 's evidence enough that the country far more advanced than is generally known . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tourist walks past a chinese sign as skyscrapers tower into clouds as background in shanghai .
taube uses the example of china 's exports , which are no longer confined to labor-intensive products , to make his point .
" the technological sophistication of chinese exports is much higher than most us can imagine , " he said .
" and it is effectively also much higher than many eastern european states . " in china , capitalism has been compatible with marx and lenin since 1992 .
the country even joined the world trade organization in 2001 and last year , private ownership was given equal status with that of the state in the chinese constitution .
all of that has helped push china to the pinnacle the world economy in a matter of years .

it 's long been no secret that new economic powerhouses are on the rise in asia .

not necessarily . asia , along with the united states , is quickly on its way to becoming a main pillar of the world economy .
for years , china has been making headlines with blazing growth rates and expanding wealth .
india now appears set on a similar path , as it becomes an important part of international trade and commerce . in the coming years , over 100 million people in those two nations will become a part of the global labor market .
what will that mean for comparably older economies such as japan and germany ?
will world export champ germany soon become the global leader in exporting jobs ?
is cutting wages and working longer the answer to the new challenge from asia ? quality exports when markus taube , director of the east asia institute at the university of duisburg , gives a speech about china , he essentially only needs to carry one chart with him .
regardless of what he 's talking about - foreign investment , exports , imports or gross domestic product - the graph for china points skyward .
he believes that 's evidence enough that the country far more advanced than is generally known . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tourist walks past a chinese sign as skyscrapers tower into clouds as background in shanghai .
taube uses the example of china 's exports , which are no longer confined to labor-intensive products , to make his point .
" the technological sophistication of chinese exports is much higher than most us can imagine , " he said .
" and it is effectively also much higher than many eastern european states . " in china , capitalism has been compatible with marx and lenin since 1992 .
the country even joined the world trade organization in 2001 and last year , private ownership was given equal status with that of the state in the chinese constitution .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 11.03.2005 making germany music-literate again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playing and learning are one and the same when it comes to music numerous studies have shown a strong correlation between music and intellectual development .
so why are german schools giving music education short shrift ? classical violinist anne-sophie mutter may be one of germany 's best known ambassadors in the field of music , but lately she has rounded out her schedule of concerts , recordings and master classes with unexpected activity : promoting a music curriculum she developed for kindergartens and grade schools .
kids who don ’ t learn to read notes are like musical dyslexics , " mutter recently said in an interview with the german welt am sonntag newspaper .
she hopes her curriculum - a progressive , age based method that brings young children into early contact with music in theory and practice - will help make germany music-literate again .
" it is absurd that we go to the gym regularly to shape our hips but do n't do anything to keep our mind in form .
all infants are rocked and sung to , -lrb- but in school -rrb- music is no longer considered a basic need , " said mutter -lrb- photo -rrb- in the interview .
growing chorus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne-sophie mutter mutter 's voice is one of the most recent additions to the chorus of complaints about how german schools are failing in the area of music education .
amid ever-tighter budgets and a renewed zeal for " back to basics " education , the country has neglected to teach children how to make and appreciate music , the critics argue .
a 1999 study by the nonprofit german music council , an umbrella organization that promotes music in germany , showed that only 20 percent of german schoolchildren are taught by qualified music teachers .
the rest either got no music education or were instructed by unqualified teachers , said the council 's vice president , hans bessler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresdner kreuz choir recent polls have suggested the consequences are dramatic .
surveys have shown that german children sing worse and less frequently than they did a decade ago and they 're ignorant of their cultural patrimony .
fewer germans are music-literate , too .
mozart effect meanwhile , neurological studies - loosely grouped under the heading " mozart effect " - show a clear correlation between exposure to music and brain development , spatial and logical thinking , and academic success .
" the three important constants that the brain uses to absorb information are haptics , acoustics , and analysis , " mutter told welt am sonntag .
" all three are developed through music . ...
music should not be seen as a secondary subject , but as a basis for all other subjects . "
the sputnik effect felicitas liemersdorf , the principal of a cologne primary school , agrees .
" learning music in the school - from a qualified music teacher - is just as important as learning german or math or foreign languages .
unfortunately , society does n't really support this view . "
several decades ago , liemersdorf recalled , primary teachers needed to play an instrument as part of their degree studies .
" that all changed with sputnik , " she said .
in the era of the cold war and the space race , the focus in education switched from all-around liberal arts to science and technology .
finally , in the 1980s , the obligatory music component to education degrees was removed .
since the late 1990s , when germans were shocked by their country 's poor showing in comparative international tests , music education has lost even more ground .
any spare resources tend to be aimed at improving results in " basics , " like reading , math and foreign languages .
wanted : music teachers in fact , bessler of the german music council notes that german schools are meant to follow what he and others say is an " excellent " music curriculum .
but while it looks good on paper , it is almost never carried through - due to the severe shortage of trained music teachers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competitor in the " youth makes music " contest the german music council is making a public push to correct this weakness , bessler said .
it will campaign to attract more music students to the teaching profession , and plans are underway to revamp archaic teacher training , he added .
a lot is riding on their success .
when music in the public schools fails , only wealthier children will have ready access to lessons .
music : key to identity ?
more important than academic benefits , " a good music education helps children understand their own identity .
they learn to understand their own personality , " bessler said .
he cited several music projects , including one recorded in last year 's documentary film " rhythm is it " - about the effects of classical music on impoverished youth in berlin - where music gave hope to people in dire straits .
" where we make music , the social climate changes .
we need this more now than ever , " bessler said .
for anne-sophie mutter , nothing less than german culture is at stake .
" in the short term , a lack of culture can leads us to spiritual and mental poverty .
in the long term , it can make a nation stupid , " mutter told welt am sonntag .
" we have to ask ourselves if a country that wo n't fund good music education for its youth is the kind of country we want to have .

" dozens of companies in germany offer private and corporate internet telephony services and the cheaper calls that accompany it . after subscribing to a particular service , users can usually call within that network for free and calls to the german fixed-line network normally costs between one and two cents a minute .
the hamburg internet provider freenet has even done away with those costs for some of its voip packages . germany currently has about six million people using dsl connections to access the internet and 330,000 of them are taking advantage of their high-speed connections to make telephone calls , according to the association of telecommunications providers . " dsl is the technology that made voice over ip possible , " said karsten krug of avm , the producer of the widely popular fritz line of devices used to connect computers to high-speed internet services . telekom joins in voip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile communications providers like o2 are also interested in making voip work for them transferring phone calls to the internet could spell trouble for deutsche telekom , which still keeps the vast majority of germans connected , if people begin to shy away from the former monopoly 's ubiquitous analog and isdn phone systems . " internet telephony is not going to bring a large growth in profits , " said rainer beaujean , head of t-online , the deutsche telekom subsidiary responsible for internet connections .
" but it is important to keep customers . " also important to customers is being able to guarantee a certain quality of service , said carsten lachmann , who manned a t-systems - another deutsche telekom subsidiary - booth at cebit .

" anyone who tells you different is lying .

deutsche telekom is planning to double download speeds to 6 megabits per second across germany by the middle of this year and speed things up to 25 mbps in some major german cities by 2006 . " voice over ip already has the quality of analog phones , " krug of avm said .
" now , by increasing bandwidth , we are able to improve the quality even more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voip phones look just like their analog counterparts .
voip works by encoding a caller 's voice into digital data then breaking the information into small packets and sending them through the internet to be correctly decoded at the other end by the person receiving the call . new phones for non-tech types along with lower costs , better quality has taken voip from the domain of a few computer geeks when it first emerged about 10 years ago to the general public . at cebit , avm and other telecommunications companies are looking for ways to make internet telephony easier for customers to use .
the new high-tech phones now resemble their analog counterparts in all but the type of cable that is plugged in and the phone bill that comes at the end of the month .

the topic had been debated for years in germany , but took on a new urgency in the past few weeks after germany came under increased pressure to rein in its emboldened right-wing extremists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large neo-nazi demonstrations in dresden -lrb- photo -rrb- during the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of the city last month and further planned far-right marches at the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , had turned up the heat on policy makers .
in addition to sharpening the right of assembly , friday 's vote also approved changing the country 's criminal code to include a passage calling for up to three years in jail or a fine for glorification of the nazis , or justifying or downplaying the atrocities of the third reich .
" to think of right-wing extremist groups demonstrating in front of memorials for the victims of nazi crimes , either endorsing , denying , or playing down these crimes against humanity , is unbearable , " german interior minister otto schily said last month .
the bundesrat or the upper house of parliament is expected to ratify the changes within the next week .
a threat to democracy most parties on friday hailed the vote as a boost to democracy .
" we 'll have a few additional possibilities in the future to prevent nazi mischief on our streets and squares , " said dieter wiefelspütz , spd domestic policy expert .

" a broad majority of the bundestag has given the victims of the nazi regime a clear signal : germany will remain alert even 60 years after auschwitz , " said silke stokar von neuforn of the green party .
however , germany 's opposition liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- on friday , voted against the planned beefing up of the right of assembly , saying it had doubts whether the move would work to curb far-right groups .
max stadler , domestic policy expert of the fdp , said that freedom of expression and assembly were fundamental to a democracy and that a tightening of the law was the wrong way to deal with far-right extremists .
stadler criticized that the bundestag was worrying showing itself to be increasingly prepared to violate basic rights .
he added it was probably okay in a one-off case , but simply went too far on the whole .
doubts remain over effectiveness despite the relief among most mainstream parties at friday 's decision , questions still remain over how effective the proposed sharpening of the law will prove in limiting neo-nazi groups .
many politicians were annoyed that the changes disregarded a cdu demand to include the brandenburg gate in the demonstration-free zone around the german reichstag .

both beckstein and german interior minister otto schily said they had doubts whether the spiking of the law could prevent the yearly neo-nazi march to the grave of rudolf hess , hitler 's deputy , in wunsiedel .
others voiced doubts over whether the changes were in line with the constitution .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the cdu parliamentary group , said there was no guarantee that the new law was in step with the constitution .
" we ca n't guarantee what decision the german constitutional court could possibly come to one day , " bosbach said .
" we 're only doing what we can to give the authorities instruments to prevent demonstrations more easily . "

it 's long been no secret that new economic powerhouses are on the rise in asia .
but are they endangering jobs in " old " economies like germany and japan ?
not necessarily . asia , along with the united states , is quickly on its way to becoming a main pillar of the world economy .
for years , china has been making headlines with blazing growth rates and expanding wealth .
india now appears set on a similar path , as it becomes an important part of international trade and commerce . in the coming years , over 100 million people in those two nations will become a part of the global labor market .
what will that mean for comparably older economies such as japan and germany ?
will world export champ germany soon become the global leader in exporting jobs ?
is cutting wages and working longer the answer to the new challenge from asia ? quality exports when markus taube , director of the east asia institute at the university of duisburg , gives a speech about china , he essentially only needs to carry one chart with him .
regardless of what he 's talking about - foreign investment , exports , imports or gross domestic product - the graph for china points skyward .
he believes that 's evidence enough that the country far more advanced than is generally known . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tourist walks past a chinese sign as skyscrapers tower into clouds as background in shanghai .
taube uses the example of china 's exports , which are no longer confined to labor-intensive products , to make his point .
" the technological sophistication of chinese exports is much higher than most us can imagine , " he said .
" and it is effectively also much higher than many eastern european states . " in china , capitalism has been compatible with marx and lenin since 1992 .
the country even joined the world trade organization in 2001 and last year , private ownership was given equal status with that of the state in the chinese constitution .
all of that has helped push china to the pinnacle the world economy in a matter of years .
it is now the world 's fourth biggest exporter after germany , the usa and japan . taube said prospects for stable and continuous growth for years to come will ensure china is not simply the world 's sweatshop for cheap , mass-made products .
and as inexpensive labor meets high-tech , quality german goods will face ever more competition on world markets . and experts agree germany can not compete simply by lowering its labor costs .
whereas hourly wages for manufactured goods in china cost a mere $ 0.80 -lrb- € 0.60 -rrb- , in the united states its $ 21 and in germany over $ 30 . india awakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's ascent has been expected for years , but only recently , another asian giant has awakened : india .
seeing its neighbor sprint ahead as it continued to flounder , india was spurned on to undertake economy reforms recently .
in only a short time , the country has become a global player in the outsourcing and high-tech industries . " india has undergone a phenomenal opening since 2003 , " said peter von guretzky-cornitz , a regional analyst for hypovereinsbank . but he thinks the changes in india present more of an opportunity than a challenge to germany .
after talking about improving the country 's infrastructure for 20 years , indian officials are finally doing something about it .
and that 's good for german business . " you can see that germany will benefit as asia general decides to put a greater emphasis on quality , " von guretzky-cornitz said .
" an indian or chinese who drives a bmw privately now wants a backhoe or a crane or a cement mixer that ’ s from switzerland , germany or austria instead of a copy of a european machine from korea . " good for germany that 's obviously good for german exporters , but what about german investment in booming asian economies ?
as the money goes , wo n't that also move jobs abroad ?
not according to von guretzky-cornitz , who said much of what is produced in asia is meant for those markets alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael finger , an economist at the wto in geneva , even said growth in asia was like " manna from heaven " as german firm profit from those expanding markets .
" i see strong advantages for capital goods from germany , " he said . but all the experts agreed germany will have to concentrate on future-oriented fields and areas of expertise if it wants to keep pace with the changing global economy .
simply trying to lower costs to go toe-to-toe with cheap producers such as china and india , however , would be a disaster . " that simply wo n't work , " said china expert taube . rolf wenkel -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hung -lrb- a -rrb- ry for german investment germany is hungary 's largest trading partner and has invested heavily in the country since the fall of the iron curtain .

the topic had been debated for years in germany , but took on a new urgency in the past few weeks after germany came under increased pressure to rein in its emboldened right-wing extremists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large neo-nazi demonstrations in dresden -lrb- photo -rrb- during the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of the city last month and further planned far-right marches at the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , had turned up the heat on policy makers .
in addition to sharpening the right of assembly , friday 's vote also approved changing the country 's criminal code to include a passage calling for up to three years in jail or a fine for glorification of the nazis , or justifying or downplaying the atrocities of the third reich .
" to think of right-wing extremist groups demonstrating in front of memorials for the victims of nazi crimes , either endorsing , denying , or playing down these crimes against humanity , is unbearable , " german interior minister otto schily said last month .
the bundesrat or the upper house of parliament is expected to ratify the changes within the next week .
a threat to democracy most parties on friday hailed the vote as a boost to democracy .
" we 'll have a few additional possibilities in the future to prevent nazi mischief on our streets and squares , " said dieter wiefelspütz , spd domestic policy expert .

27 , 2005 .
" a broad majority of the bundestag has given the victims of the nazi regime a clear signal : germany will remain alert even 60 years after auschwitz , " said silke stokar von neuforn of the green party .
however , germany 's opposition liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- on friday , voted against the planned beefing up of the right of assembly , saying it had doubts whether the move would work to curb far-right groups .
max stadler , domestic policy expert of the fdp , said that freedom of expression and assembly were fundamental to a democracy and that a tightening of the law was the wrong way to deal with far-right extremists .
stadler criticized that the bundestag was worrying showing itself to be increasingly prepared to violate basic rights .
he added it was probably okay in a one-off case , but simply went too far on the whole .
doubts remain over effectiveness despite the relief among most mainstream parties at friday 's decision , questions still remain over how effective the proposed sharpening of the law will prove in limiting neo-nazi groups .
many politicians were annoyed that the changes disregarded a cdu demand to include the brandenburg gate in the demonstration-free zone around the german reichstag .

bavarian interior minister günther beckstein criticized that the new law was " rushed and in parts half-hearted , " though it did go in the right direction .
both beckstein and german interior minister otto schily said they had doubts whether the spiking of the law could prevent the yearly neo-nazi march to the grave of rudolf hess , hitler 's deputy , in wunsiedel .
others voiced doubts over whether the changes were in line with the constitution .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the cdu parliamentary group , said there was no guarantee that the new law was in step with the constitution .
" we ca n't guarantee what decision the german constitutional court could possibly come to one day , " bosbach said .
" we 're only doing what we can to give the authorities instruments to prevent demonstrations more easily . "
earlier , fdp head guido westerwelle called the law " dilettantish " and said that neo-nazi groups could easily challenge the curbs on their right to demonstrate and had " a very good chance of success " at the constitutional court . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de seeking common ground to curb neo-nazis both the government and opposition agree that the right of assembly needs tightening to prevent neo-nazi marches at historic landmarks such as the brandenburg gate in berlin .

the topic had been debated for years in germany , but took on a new urgency in the past few weeks after germany came under increased pressure to rein in its emboldened right-wing extremists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large neo-nazi demonstrations in dresden -lrb- photo -rrb- during the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of the city last month and further planned far-right marches at the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , had turned up the heat on policy makers .
in addition to sharpening the right of assembly , friday 's vote also approved changing the country 's criminal code to include a passage calling for up to three years in jail or a fine for glorification of the nazis , or justifying or downplaying the atrocities of the third reich .
" to think of right-wing extremist groups demonstrating in front of memorials for the victims of nazi crimes , either endorsing , denying , or playing down these crimes against humanity , is unbearable , " german interior minister otto schily said last month .
the bundesrat or the upper house of parliament is expected to ratify the changes within the next week .
a threat to democracy most parties on friday hailed the vote as a boost to democracy .
" we 'll have a few additional possibilities in the future to prevent nazi mischief on our streets and squares , " said dieter wiefelspütz , spd domestic policy expert .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de dw-radio -pipe- 11.03.2005 german science weekly highlight-18 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reprogramming stem cell research stem cell research has , as you probably know , been filled with ethical controversy .
until now , it ’ s involved destroying a human embryo – a small one , of course , just a few hundred cells . but in nine months , that embryo could be a healthy human baby . not everybody is going to agree that a scientist should be allowed to do that , even if it helps us develop treatments for cancer , paralysis , and heart disease .
but now scientists are finding a way to skirt the ethical question – and keep going with their research in a way to which few would object . instead of pulling the stem cell out of an embryo , they ’ re finding ways to take single stem cells from adults – a perfectly safe procedure – and then “ reprogramming ” them so they have all the flexibility that a stem cell has , if it came from an embryo .
here ’ s how it works . some stem cells , as you may know , are useful because they can produce any cell in the body .
the right kind of stem cell – one which is “ potent ” enough – can become a blood cell , a bone cell , a nerve cell , or whatever it is you need to repair , or regrow , inside a patient ’ s body .
stem cells have different degrees of potency – that means , they have the potential to produce more or fewer different kinds of cells . the most potent kind of stem cell is called “ totipotent ” – they can grow into an entire organism , like a healthy , smiling baby . the second most potent is called “ pluripotent ” – they can become just about any kind of cell , but they can ’ t grow into a whole organism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.03.2005 germany moves to curb neo-nazi protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's still unclear whether the new law will prevent scenes like this germany 's lower house of parliament friday voted by a large majority to tighten the right of assembly , thus making it easier in future to ban neo-nazi demonstrations at historic landmarks . after weeks of heated debate , members of germany 's ruling government coalition of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens as well as the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- on friday voted overwhelmingly in favor of tightening the right of assembly and making changes to the existing criminal code . the clamp-down is designed to curtail far-right demonstrations and rallies by far-right groups at historic landmarks such as the former nazi concentration camps , holocaust monuments and other memorials that remember victims of nazi terror and violence .
the topic had been debated for years in germany , but took on a new urgency in the past few weeks after germany came under increased pressure to rein in its emboldened right-wing extremists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large neo-nazi demonstrations in dresden -lrb- photo -rrb- during the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of the city last month and further planned far-right marches at the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , had turned up the heat on policy makers .
in addition to sharpening the right of assembly , friday 's vote also approved changing the country 's criminal code to include a passage calling for up to three years in jail or a fine for glorification of the nazis , or justifying or downplaying the atrocities of the third reich .
" to think of right-wing extremist groups demonstrating in front of memorials for the victims of nazi crimes , either endorsing , denying , or playing down these crimes against humanity , is unbearable , " german interior minister otto schily said last month .
the bundesrat or the upper house of parliament is expected to ratify the changes within the next week .
a threat to democracy most parties on friday hailed the vote as a boost to democracy .
" we 'll have a few additional possibilities in the future to prevent nazi mischief on our streets and squares , " said dieter wiefelspütz , spd domestic policy expert .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler bows in front of a memorial for the victims of the auschwitz death camp on jan .
27 , 2005 .
" a broad majority of the bundestag has given the victims of the nazi regime a clear signal : germany will remain alert even 60 years after auschwitz , " said silke stokar von neuforn of the green party .
however , germany 's opposition liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- on friday , voted against the planned beefing up of the right of assembly , saying it had doubts whether the move would work to curb far-right groups .
max stadler , domestic policy expert of the fdp , said that freedom of expression and assembly were fundamental to a democracy and that a tightening of the law was the wrong way to deal with far-right extremists .
stadler criticized that the bundestag was worrying showing itself to be increasingly prepared to violate basic rights .
he added it was probably okay in a one-off case , but simply went too far on the whole .
doubts remain over effectiveness despite the relief among most mainstream parties at friday 's decision , questions still remain over how effective the proposed sharpening of the law will prove in limiting neo-nazi groups .
many politicians were annoyed that the changes disregarded a cdu demand to include the brandenburg gate in the demonstration-free zone around the german reichstag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neonazis march to the grave of rudolf hess in wunsiedel in aug .
2004 .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein criticized that the new law was " rushed and in parts half-hearted , " though it did go in the right direction .
both beckstein and german interior minister otto schily said they had doubts whether the spiking of the law could prevent the yearly neo-nazi march to the grave of rudolf hess , hitler 's deputy , in wunsiedel .
others voiced doubts over whether the changes were in line with the constitution .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the cdu parliamentary group , said there was no guarantee that the new law was in step with the constitution .
" we ca n't guarantee what decision the german constitutional court could possibly come to one day , " bosbach said .
" we 're only doing what we can to give the authorities instruments to prevent demonstrations more easily . "
earlier , fdp head guido westerwelle called the law " dilettantish " and said that neo-nazi groups could easily challenge the curbs on their right to demonstrate and had " a very good chance of success " at the constitutional court . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de seeking common ground to curb neo-nazis both the government and opposition agree that the right of assembly needs tightening to prevent neo-nazi marches at historic landmarks such as the brandenburg gate in berlin .

the eu is negotiating with the islamic state 's government , notably offering the prospect of a trade agreement in exchange for guarantees about its nuclear program . the plane had arrived from frankfurt on thursday afternoon .
the protesters refused to leave the craft , but shortly after the incident started they allowed other passengers and crew to get off without incident . at an early stage in the standoff a correspondent for zdf german television who spoke with one of the passengers by telephone said he had been told that no arms were aboard the plane and that no hostages were being held . the remaining passengers " all have passports from the european union , " but " they say they are of iranian origin , " cleemput said earlier . a young iranian , who spoke to reporters at brussels airport on behalf of the passengers , said the action had been under preparation for five months by a london-based iranian monarchist group , " azarakhsh . " " we all ask the leaders of the european union -lrb- not to -rrb- support the regime in iran .
we do n't ask nobody , no country , nor any power in the world to help us to change the regime .
we can do it ourselves , " said the man who identified himself as ramin . the rtl-tvi television station said the group 's demands were " political demands " linked notably to the european union 's policies with regard to iran . the german magazine der spiegel said it had received a letter from the group , which described itself as representing iranian men and women protesting against a tehran regime responsible for " torture and terror . " as the night wore on , the plane was moved from its parking gate in preparation for an " administrative " arrest of those on board , police said . peaceful resolution it was at this point that the protesters decided to give themselves up .
" we always said to the activists that they would have no problems if they decided to leave the plane , " said cleemput . in berlin , a lufthansa spokesman said the protest " had nothing to do with our company . " " they have chosen without a doubt a strange place to demonstrate , " said the spokesman , thomas ellerbeck . he said the plane was carrying 120 passengers when it left frankfurt .

it 's long been no secret that new economic powerhouses are on the rise in asia .
but are they endangering jobs in " old " economies like germany and japan ?
not necessarily . asia , along with the united states , is quickly on its way to becoming a main pillar of the world economy .
for years , china has been making headlines with blazing growth rates and expanding wealth .
india now appears set on a similar path , as it becomes an important part of international trade and commerce . in the coming years , over 100 million people in those two nations will become a part of the global labor market .
what will that mean for comparably older economies such as japan and germany ?
will world export champ germany soon become the global leader in exporting jobs ?
is cutting wages and working longer the answer to the new challenge from asia ? quality exports when markus taube , director of the east asia institute at the university of duisburg , gives a speech about china , he essentially only needs to carry one chart with him .
regardless of what he 's talking about - foreign investment , exports , imports or gross domestic product - the graph for china points skyward .
he believes that 's evidence enough that the country far more advanced than is generally known . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tourist walks past a chinese sign as skyscrapers tower into clouds as background in shanghai .
taube uses the example of china 's exports , which are no longer confined to labor-intensive products , to make his point .
" the technological sophistication of chinese exports is much higher than most us can imagine , " he said .
" and it is effectively also much higher than many eastern european states . " in china , capitalism has been compatible with marx and lenin since 1992 .
the country even joined the world trade organization in 2001 and last year , private ownership was given equal status with that of the state in the chinese constitution .
all of that has helped push china to the pinnacle the world economy in a matter of years .
it is now the world 's fourth biggest exporter after germany , the usa and japan . taube said prospects for stable and continuous growth for years to come will ensure china is not simply the world 's sweatshop for cheap , mass-made products .
and as inexpensive labor meets high-tech , quality german goods will face ever more competition on world markets . and experts agree germany can not compete simply by lowering its labor costs .
whereas hourly wages for manufactured goods in china cost a mere $ 0.80 -lrb- € 0.60 -rrb- , in the united states its $ 21 and in germany over $ 30 . india awakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's ascent has been expected for years , but only recently , another asian giant has awakened : india .
seeing its neighbor sprint ahead as it continued to flounder , india was spurned on to undertake economy reforms recently .
in only a short time , the country has become a global player in the outsourcing and high-tech industries . " india has undergone a phenomenal opening since 2003 , " said peter von guretzky-cornitz , a regional analyst for hypovereinsbank . but he thinks the changes in india present more of an opportunity than a challenge to germany .
after talking about improving the country 's infrastructure for 20 years , indian officials are finally doing something about it .
and that 's good for german business . " you can see that germany will benefit as asia general decides to put a greater emphasis on quality , " von guretzky-cornitz said .
" an indian or chinese who drives a bmw privately now wants a backhoe or a crane or a cement mixer that ’ s from switzerland , germany or austria instead of a copy of a european machine from korea . " good for germany that 's obviously good for german exporters , but what about german investment in booming asian economies ?
as the money goes , wo n't that also move jobs abroad ?
not according to von guretzky-cornitz , who said much of what is produced in asia is meant for those markets alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael finger , an economist at the wto in geneva , even said growth in asia was like " manna from heaven " as german firm profit from those expanding markets .
" i see strong advantages for capital goods from germany , " he said . but all the experts agreed germany will have to concentrate on future-oriented fields and areas of expertise if it wants to keep pace with the changing global economy .
simply trying to lower costs to go toe-to-toe with cheap producers such as china and india , however , would be a disaster . " that simply wo n't work , " said china expert taube . rolf wenkel -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hung -lrb- a -rrb- ry for german investment germany is hungary 's largest trading partner and has invested heavily in the country since the fall of the iron curtain .
but hungary wants more investment , since competition with lower-wage countries is getting tougher .

others say germany ’ s not out of the woods yet .

until now , it ’ s involved destroying a human embryo – a small one , of course , just a few hundred cells . but in nine months , that embryo could be a healthy human baby . not everybody is going to agree that a scientist should be allowed to do that , even if it helps us develop treatments for cancer , paralysis , and heart disease .
but now scientists are finding a way to skirt the ethical question – and keep going with their research in a way to which few would object . instead of pulling the stem cell out of an embryo , they ’ re finding ways to take single stem cells from adults – a perfectly safe procedure – and then “ reprogramming ” them so they have all the flexibility that a stem cell has , if it came from an embryo .
here ’ s how it works . some stem cells , as you may know , are useful because they can produce any cell in the body .
the right kind of stem cell – one which is “ potent ” enough – can become a blood cell , a bone cell , a nerve cell , or whatever it is you need to repair , or regrow , inside a patient ’ s body .
stem cells have different degrees of potency – that means , they have the potential to produce more or fewer different kinds of cells . the most potent kind of stem cell is called “ totipotent ” – they can grow into an entire organism , like a healthy , smiling baby . the second most potent is called “ pluripotent ” – they can become just about any kind of cell , but they can ’ t grow into a whole organism .
even less potent ones are called “ multipotent ” , “ oligopotent ” , and “ unipotent ” – they can only become one , or some kinds of cells .
cells develop along a “ programme ” – that is , as you grow up , your cells become less and less potent . at least it seemed that way to scientists ; they had always thought that as an adult , your skin cells , for example , can only produce new skin cells , and not , say , suddenly become liver cells . -lrb- otherwise , you might just start growing a liver on your arm . -rrb- but just a few years ago , a group of scientists took the right nutrients and growth factors and managed to make neuron stem cells out of adult blood stem cells – which only stayed that way for a few days . since then , scientists have been doing everything they can to figure out how this reprogramming works .
now , at the max planck institute for molecular biomedicine in munster , germany , scientists have isolated the part of the cell where the reprogramming takes place . it ’ s in the nucleus , where the genetic material is . dr. hans schöler is going to tell us now how they found it , and how that brings us a step closer to reprogramming the way we do stem cell research . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german science weekly highlight-17 a happy catastrophe in the baltic sea german science weekly highlight-16 getting in the way of faulty rna german science weekly highlight-15 hope for genetically defective hearts german science weekly highlight-14 dropping atoms from the tower of pisa german science weekly highlight-13 under the earth that 's under the ocean german science weekly highlight-12 how a nose from mainz sniffed out water on mars german science weekly highlight -11 seeing your cells in multicolour german science weekly highlight - 10 how mice choose partners by their smell .

"
he has been hiding since a warrant for his arrest on multiple counts of pedophilia was issued in august 1996 .
schäfer was convicted of the charges in november 2004 along with 22 other dignidad members . " the arrest of paul schaefer is good news , " fischer said .
" his arrest will allow a comprehensive investigation all the criminal activities in the former colonia dignidad to be carried out and punishments to be handed down . "
argentine police commissioner alejandro dinisio told afp that schäfer carried no identification documents and refused to speak at the time of his arrest .
he added that police had been on his trail for six months . television reporters mobbed schäfer as an agent pushed the elderly suspect on his wheelchair into a provincial police station .
schäfer was shown on television handcuffed and smiling , and holding a bottle of soda . officials said he could be transferred to buenos aires as early as friday . child abuse and cultic practices a former corporal and medic in hitler 's nazi army , schäfer fled germany to chile in 1961 to avoid child sexual abuse charges .
he established the self-sufficient colonia dignidad , also called " villa baviera , " in the mountains near the city of parral , some 350 kilometers -lrb- 218 miles -rrb- south of santiago along with other german immigrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the main gate of " colonia dignidad " in 1988 surrounded by barbed wire and electric fences and protected by barricades , the community , populated largely by germans , adhered to a strict discipline and remained cut off from the rest of chile .
a mixture of cultic practices such as exorcising devils and psychological terror were said to rampant in the sect . in 1996 a number of former residents testified that schäfer systematically abused the colony 's young children , many of whom were taken from the parents at birth .
accusations of forced labor and other forms of maltreatment also surfaced at the time . a torture center and school chilean officials also want schäfer in connection with torture during the 1973-1990 pinochet dictatorship .
the colony apparently served as a torture center for the chilean secret service as well as a torture school where former gestapo and nazi officers gave lessons . investigators say that political prisoners , including former leftist leader alvaro vallejos villagran - arrested by pinochet agents in may 1974 - vanished after being sent to colonia dignidad . a former member of pinochet 's secret police gave testimony stating that he knew vallejos villagran was taken alive to dignidad . schäfer and the colony are believed to have enjoyed pinochet 's protection right until the end of his dictatorship in 1990 . disappearance of professor police also want to question schäfer about the 1985 disappearance of boris weisfeiler , an american jewish mathematics professor of russian origin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators outside " colonia dignidad " investigators believe weisfeiler was picked up by a military border patrol while he was backpacking in the region on suspicion of being a spy and dropped off at dignidad . weisfeiler 's sister olga said there were reports by dignidad residents of seeing him alive up to two years later . schäfer 's arrest on thursday sparked relief among the present residents of the colony .
about 300 people , mainly germans , still live there . " i believe , we 're all happy here today .
i definitely am - we had to suffer too much , " one of them told chilean television . to accelerate schäfer 's departure , the chilean interior minister asked his argentine counterpart to kick him out of argentina and avoid going to court to ask for an extradition , which could delay the case with appeals . officials praised the joint action on thursday by argentine and chilean police which led to schäfer 's arrest . " we are proud of this arrest , " said a justice spokesman in santiago de chile .
" we expect that paul schäfer will have to face two charges as soon as possible : one for sodomy against a child and the other for the disappearance of alvaro vallejos villagran .

" as the night wore on , the plane was moved from its parking gate in preparation for an " administrative " arrest of those on board , police said . peaceful resolution it was at this point that the protesters decided to give themselves up .
" we always said to the activists that they would have no problems if they decided to leave the plane , " said cleemput . in berlin , a lufthansa spokesman said the protest " had nothing to do with our company . " " they have chosen without a doubt a strange place to demonstrate , " said the spokesman , thomas ellerbeck . he said the plane was carrying 120 passengers when it left frankfurt .

ahead of a parliamentary budget committee meeting next week , members of the green party are refusing a costly project which would make german participation in the air defense air system meads irreversible . german companies and social democratic defense minister peter struck view meads as being strategically important , as it would be the only nato-commissioned defense project carried out jointly by the united states and european nations , notably germany and italy . according to nato , the medium extended air defense system would replace current hawk and patriot interceptors .
the initiators of meads credit it with the ability to protect forces and fixed installations against attacks by current and next-generation tactical ballistic missiles .
it ’ s been promised that meads as a surface-to-air system will have greater firepower and require less manpower than its predecessors . but do we need it ? but whether a new system is required at all for such a specific purpose remains a highly contested question among german parliamentarians .
meads started as a think-tank project between the us , italy and germany .
the system is meant to be fully operational by 2012 , with the us to provide 58 percent , germany 25 percent and italy 17 percent of the financing , the companies involved - lockheed martin , the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and mbda italy - sense a lucrative business opportunity .
but german greens parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele said the plan is more about politics than about being a military necessity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele “ i have the impression that the military use of the system is no longer at the heart of those who are pushing meads here , " ströbele -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" this goes for both the development of the system and the ensuing purchase of meads launchers by germany .
it seems it ’ s rather a question of not spoiling transatlantic relations again after the iraq war and putting nato in an awkward position . ” waiting on germany defense minister struck has been unable to drum up unanimous support for the project , which he aims to push through during a meeting of the parliamentary budget committee on march 16 .
the us and italy have already signed the meads contract and have been waiting for germany to follow suit . greens mps fear that the cost of the project will cause the meager national defense budget to burst at its seams .
but hans-peter bartels , a social democratic defense expert , argues that the cost will be offset by the opportunities that meads offers to german industry . “ germany is supposed to play a major role in the development of the radar system for meads , " bartels said .
" german industry stands to profit considerably from its participation in the project .
the expertise it already has and will gain in this field will no doubt come in handy in similar or follow-up projects . ” eads managers argue that the government in berlin can not afford to opt out of the project .
spokesman alexander reinhardt estimated that at least 450 jobs are at stake .
in the end , the greens , as the government 's junior coalition partner may not be prepared to thwart the project altogether .
but they could insist that germany order fewer than the 12 to 24 meads units planned by the defense minister . hardy graupner -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin to spend billion on missile defense germany reportedly plans to spend over € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- on the development of a new transatlantic anti-aircraft system over the next eight years .

ahead of a parliamentary budget committee meeting next week , members of the green party are refusing a costly project which would make german participation in the air defense air system meads irreversible . german companies and social democratic defense minister peter struck view meads as being strategically important , as it would be the only nato-commissioned defense project carried out jointly by the united states and european nations , notably germany and italy . according to nato , the medium extended air defense system would replace current hawk and patriot interceptors .
the initiators of meads credit it with the ability to protect forces and fixed installations against attacks by current and next-generation tactical ballistic missiles .
it ’ s been promised that meads as a surface-to-air system will have greater firepower and require less manpower than its predecessors . but do we need it ? but whether a new system is required at all for such a specific purpose remains a highly contested question among german parliamentarians .
meads started as a think-tank project between the us , italy and germany .
the system is meant to be fully operational by 2012 , with the us to provide 58 percent , germany 25 percent and italy 17 percent of the financing , the companies involved - lockheed martin , the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and mbda italy - sense a lucrative business opportunity .

the us and italy have already signed the meads contract and have been waiting for germany to follow suit . greens mps fear that the cost of the project will cause the meager national defense budget to burst at its seams .
but hans-peter bartels , a social democratic defense expert , argues that the cost will be offset by the opportunities that meads offers to german industry . “ germany is supposed to play a major role in the development of the radar system for meads , " bartels said .
" german industry stands to profit considerably from its participation in the project .
the expertise it already has and will gain in this field will no doubt come in handy in similar or follow-up projects . ” eads managers argue that the government in berlin can not afford to opt out of the project .
spokesman alexander reinhardt estimated that at least 450 jobs are at stake .

the city worked hard to restore its historic city center , left intact after the war , to its former glory , and for that reason , has become a tourist magnet in eastern germany . but beauty aside , the town has been hit hard by the unemployment , westward migration and high vacancy rates seen throughout the eastern states .
city officials are counting on the title of culture capital to dispel some of the gloom . " we were both anxious and hopeful , " said kai grebasch , spokesman for the city 's culture capital office .

and in this , essen and görlitz came out ahead of the other candidates braunschweig , bremen , halle , karlsruhe , kassel , lübeck , potsdam and regensburg . germany is expected to pass on the recommendations to brüssels in the fall , where the final decision will be made in 2006 . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de görlitz : a tale of two cities görlitz and zgorzelec are separated by the neisse river , and the history that created the german-polish border .

until now , it ’ s involved destroying a human embryo – a small one , of course , just a few hundred cells . but in nine months , that embryo could be a healthy human baby . not everybody is going to agree that a scientist should be allowed to do that , even if it helps us develop treatments for cancer , paralysis , and heart disease .
but now scientists are finding a way to skirt the ethical question – and keep going with their research in a way to which few would object . instead of pulling the stem cell out of an embryo , they ’ re finding ways to take single stem cells from adults – a perfectly safe procedure – and then “ reprogramming ” them so they have all the flexibility that a stem cell has , if it came from an embryo .
here ’ s how it works . some stem cells , as you may know , are useful because they can produce any cell in the body .
the right kind of stem cell – one which is “ potent ” enough – can become a blood cell , a bone cell , a nerve cell , or whatever it is you need to repair , or regrow , inside a patient ’ s body .
stem cells have different degrees of potency – that means , they have the potential to produce more or fewer different kinds of cells . the most potent kind of stem cell is called “ totipotent ” – they can grow into an entire organism , like a healthy , smiling baby . the second most potent is called “ pluripotent ” – they can become just about any kind of cell , but they can ’ t grow into a whole organism .
even less potent ones are called “ multipotent ” , “ oligopotent ” , and “ unipotent ” – they can only become one , or some kinds of cells .
cells develop along a “ programme ” – that is , as you grow up , your cells become less and less potent . at least it seemed that way to scientists ; they had always thought that as an adult , your skin cells , for example , can only produce new skin cells , and not , say , suddenly become liver cells . -lrb- otherwise , you might just start growing a liver on your arm . -rrb- but just a few years ago , a group of scientists took the right nutrients and growth factors and managed to make neuron stem cells out of adult blood stem cells – which only stayed that way for a few days . since then , scientists have been doing everything they can to figure out how this reprogramming works .
now , at the max planck institute for molecular biomedicine in munster , germany , scientists have isolated the part of the cell where the reprogramming takes place . it ’ s in the nucleus , where the genetic material is . dr. hans schöler is going to tell us now how they found it , and how that brings us a step closer to reprogramming the way we do stem cell research . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german science weekly highlight-17 a happy catastrophe in the baltic sea german science weekly highlight-16 getting in the way of faulty rna german science weekly highlight-15 hope for genetically defective hearts german science weekly highlight-14 dropping atoms from the tower of pisa german science weekly highlight-13 under the earth that 's under the ocean german science weekly highlight-12 how a nose from mainz sniffed out water on mars german science weekly highlight -11 seeing your cells in multicolour german science weekly highlight - 10 how mice choose partners by their smell .

until now , it ’ s involved destroying a human embryo – a small one , of course , just a few hundred cells . but in nine months , that embryo could be a healthy human baby . not everybody is going to agree that a scientist should be allowed to do that , even if it helps us develop treatments for cancer , paralysis , and heart disease .
but now scientists are finding a way to skirt the ethical question – and keep going with their research in a way to which few would object . instead of pulling the stem cell out of an embryo , they ’ re finding ways to take single stem cells from adults – a perfectly safe procedure – and then “ reprogramming ” them so they have all the flexibility that a stem cell has , if it came from an embryo .
here ’ s how it works . some stem cells , as you may know , are useful because they can produce any cell in the body .
the right kind of stem cell – one which is “ potent ” enough – can become a blood cell , a bone cell , a nerve cell , or whatever it is you need to repair , or regrow , inside a patient ’ s body .
stem cells have different degrees of potency – that means , they have the potential to produce more or fewer different kinds of cells . the most potent kind of stem cell is called “ totipotent ” – they can grow into an entire organism , like a healthy , smiling baby . the second most potent is called “ pluripotent ” – they can become just about any kind of cell , but they can ’ t grow into a whole organism .
even less potent ones are called “ multipotent ” , “ oligopotent ” , and “ unipotent ” – they can only become one , or some kinds of cells .
cells develop along a “ programme ” – that is , as you grow up , your cells become less and less potent . at least it seemed that way to scientists ; they had always thought that as an adult , your skin cells , for example , can only produce new skin cells , and not , say , suddenly become liver cells . -lrb- otherwise , you might just start growing a liver on your arm . -rrb- but just a few years ago , a group of scientists took the right nutrients and growth factors and managed to make neuron stem cells out of adult blood stem cells – which only stayed that way for a few days . since then , scientists have been doing everything they can to figure out how this reprogramming works .
now , at the max planck institute for molecular biomedicine in munster , germany , scientists have isolated the part of the cell where the reprogramming takes place . it ’ s in the nucleus , where the genetic material is . dr. hans schöler is going to tell us now how they found it , and how that brings us a step closer to reprogramming the way we do stem cell research . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german science weekly highlight-17 a happy catastrophe in the baltic sea german science weekly highlight-16 getting in the way of faulty rna german science weekly highlight-15 hope for genetically defective hearts german science weekly highlight-14 dropping atoms from the tower of pisa german science weekly highlight-13 under the earth that 's under the ocean german science weekly highlight-12 how a nose from mainz sniffed out water on mars german science weekly highlight -11 seeing your cells in multicolour german science weekly highlight - 10 how mice choose partners by their smell .

"
he has been hiding since a warrant for his arrest on multiple counts of pedophilia was issued in august 1996 .
schäfer was convicted of the charges in november 2004 along with 22 other dignidad members . " the arrest of paul schaefer is good news , " fischer said .
" his arrest will allow a comprehensive investigation all the criminal activities in the former colonia dignidad to be carried out and punishments to be handed down . "
argentine police commissioner alejandro dinisio told afp that schäfer carried no identification documents and refused to speak at the time of his arrest .
he added that police had been on his trail for six months . television reporters mobbed schäfer as an agent pushed the elderly suspect on his wheelchair into a provincial police station .
schäfer was shown on television handcuffed and smiling , and holding a bottle of soda . officials said he could be transferred to buenos aires as early as friday . child abuse and cultic practices a former corporal and medic in hitler 's nazi army , schäfer fled germany to chile in 1961 to avoid child sexual abuse charges .
he established the self-sufficient colonia dignidad , also called " villa baviera , " in the mountains near the city of parral , some 350 kilometers -lrb- 218 miles -rrb- south of santiago along with other german immigrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the main gate of " colonia dignidad " in 1988 surrounded by barbed wire and electric fences and protected by barricades , the community , populated largely by germans , adhered to a strict discipline and remained cut off from the rest of chile .
a mixture of cultic practices such as exorcising devils and psychological terror were said to rampant in the sect . in 1996 a number of former residents testified that schäfer systematically abused the colony 's young children , many of whom were taken from the parents at birth .
accusations of forced labor and other forms of maltreatment also surfaced at the time . a torture center and school chilean officials also want schäfer in connection with torture during the 1973-1990 pinochet dictatorship .
the colony apparently served as a torture center for the chilean secret service as well as a torture school where former gestapo and nazi officers gave lessons . investigators say that political prisoners , including former leftist leader alvaro vallejos villagran - arrested by pinochet agents in may 1974 - vanished after being sent to colonia dignidad . a former member of pinochet 's secret police gave testimony stating that he knew vallejos villagran was taken alive to dignidad . schäfer and the colony are believed to have enjoyed pinochet 's protection right until the end of his dictatorship in 1990 . disappearance of professor police also want to question schäfer about the 1985 disappearance of boris weisfeiler , an american jewish mathematics professor of russian origin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators outside " colonia dignidad " investigators believe weisfeiler was picked up by a military border patrol while he was backpacking in the region on suspicion of being a spy and dropped off at dignidad . weisfeiler 's sister olga said there were reports by dignidad residents of seeing him alive up to two years later . schäfer 's arrest on thursday sparked relief among the present residents of the colony .
about 300 people , mainly germans , still live there . " i believe , we 're all happy here today .
i definitely am - we had to suffer too much , " one of them told chilean television . to accelerate schäfer 's departure , the chilean interior minister asked his argentine counterpart to kick him out of argentina and avoid going to court to ask for an extradition , which could delay the case with appeals . officials praised the joint action on thursday by argentine and chilean police which led to schäfer 's arrest . " we are proud of this arrest , " said a justice spokesman in santiago de chile .

" we 're in support of what the europeans are doing , but we had to find a way to demonstrate it , " a senior american official told the new york times about the pending announcement .
" this is our way of making clear that we will join the europeans in giving iran positive reasons to give up its program . " modest incentives the new york times said the us incentives - support for iran 's entry into the world trade organization and selling iran spare parts for its ageing commercial airliners - would go into effect only if iran agreed to permanently halt uranium enrichment at its nuclear plants . senior administration officials , quoted but not identified by both us dailies , told the times that the united states does not plan to join the talks with iran directly , leaving that to the europeans . britain , france and germany are trying to convince iran to halt its work on the nuclear fuel cycle - including the sensitive process of enriching uranium - in return for a package of incentives covering trade , security and technology . a new round of talks , the fifth since december , is to be held later this month , possibly in a capital of one of the three states negotiating for the european union . the united states maintains that iran is trying to covertly develop nuclear weapons , while tehran insists that its program is purely meant to meet civilian energy needs . citing an " unusual and extraordinary threat " from tehran , us president george w. bush on thursday renewed sanctions that bar us firms and citizens from oil dealings with iran . afp / dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's top nuclear official strikes defiant note iran 's hassan rowhani saturday warned the us and europe of an oil crisis if tehran is sent before the un security council over its nuclear program , rejecting outright their demands to halt uranium enrichment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.03.2005 germany moves to curb neo-nazi protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's still unclear whether the new law will prevent scenes like this germany 's lower house of parliament friday voted by a large majority to tighten the right of assembly , thus making it easier in future to ban neo-nazi demonstrations at historic landmarks . after weeks of heated debate , members of germany 's ruling government coalition of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens as well as the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- on friday voted overwhelmingly in favor of tightening the right of assembly and making changes to the existing criminal code . the clamp-down is designed to curtail far-right demonstrations and rallies by far-right groups at historic landmarks such as the former nazi concentration camps , holocaust monuments and other memorials that remember victims of nazi terror and violence .
the topic had been debated for years in germany , but took on a new urgency in the past few weeks after germany came under increased pressure to rein in its emboldened right-wing extremists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large neo-nazi demonstrations in dresden -lrb- photo -rrb- during the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of the city last month and further planned far-right marches at the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , had turned up the heat on policy makers .
in addition to sharpening the right of assembly , friday 's vote also approved changing the country 's criminal code to include a passage calling for up to three years in jail or a fine for glorification of the nazis , or justifying or downplaying the atrocities of the third reich .
" to think of right-wing extremist groups demonstrating in front of memorials for the victims of nazi crimes , either endorsing , denying , or playing down these crimes against humanity , is unbearable , " german interior minister otto schily said last month .
the bundesrat or the upper house of parliament is expected to ratify the changes within the next week .
a threat to democracy most parties on friday hailed the vote as a boost to democracy .
" we 'll have a few additional possibilities in the future to prevent nazi mischief on our streets and squares , " said dieter wiefelspütz , spd domestic policy expert .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler bows in front of a memorial for the victims of the auschwitz death camp on jan .
27 , 2005 .
" a broad majority of the bundestag has given the victims of the nazi regime a clear signal : germany will remain alert even 60 years after auschwitz , " said silke stokar von neuforn of the green party .
however , germany 's opposition liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- on friday , voted against the planned beefing up of the right of assembly , saying it had doubts whether the move would work to curb far-right groups .
max stadler , domestic policy expert of the fdp , said that freedom of expression and assembly were fundamental to a democracy and that a tightening of the law was the wrong way to deal with far-right extremists .
stadler criticized that the bundestag was worrying showing itself to be increasingly prepared to violate basic rights .
he added it was probably okay in a one-off case , but simply went too far on the whole .
doubts remain over effectiveness despite the relief among most mainstream parties at friday 's decision , questions still remain over how effective the proposed sharpening of the law will prove in limiting neo-nazi groups .
many politicians were annoyed that the changes disregarded a cdu demand to include the brandenburg gate in the demonstration-free zone around the german reichstag .

2004 .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein criticized that the new law was " rushed and in parts half-hearted , " though it did go in the right direction .
both beckstein and german interior minister otto schily said they had doubts whether the spiking of the law could prevent the yearly neo-nazi march to the grave of rudolf hess , hitler 's deputy , in wunsiedel .
others voiced doubts over whether the changes were in line with the constitution .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the cdu parliamentary group , said there was no guarantee that the new law was in step with the constitution .
" we ca n't guarantee what decision the german constitutional court could possibly come to one day , " bosbach said .
" we 're only doing what we can to give the authorities instruments to prevent demonstrations more easily . "
earlier , fdp head guido westerwelle called the law " dilettantish " and said that neo-nazi groups could easily challenge the curbs on their right to demonstrate and had " a very good chance of success " at the constitutional court . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de seeking common ground to curb neo-nazis both the government and opposition agree that the right of assembly needs tightening to prevent neo-nazi marches at historic landmarks such as the brandenburg gate in berlin .

the topic had been debated for years in germany , but took on a new urgency in the past few weeks after germany came under increased pressure to rein in its emboldened right-wing extremists .

in addition to sharpening the right of assembly , friday 's vote also approved changing the country 's criminal code to include a passage calling for up to three years in jail or a fine for glorification of the nazis , or justifying or downplaying the atrocities of the third reich .
" to think of right-wing extremist groups demonstrating in front of memorials for the victims of nazi crimes , either endorsing , denying , or playing down these crimes against humanity , is unbearable , " german interior minister otto schily said last month .
the bundesrat or the upper house of parliament is expected to ratify the changes within the next week .
a threat to democracy most parties on friday hailed the vote as a boost to democracy .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large neo-nazi demonstrations in dresden -lrb- photo -rrb- during the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of the city last month and further planned far-right marches at the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , had turned up the heat on policy makers .
in addition to sharpening the right of assembly , friday 's vote also approved changing the country 's criminal code to include a passage calling for up to three years in jail or a fine for glorification of the nazis , or justifying or downplaying the atrocities of the third reich .
" to think of right-wing extremist groups demonstrating in front of memorials for the victims of nazi crimes , either endorsing , denying , or playing down these crimes against humanity , is unbearable , " german interior minister otto schily said last month .
the bundesrat or the upper house of parliament is expected to ratify the changes within the next week .
a threat to democracy most parties on friday hailed the vote as a boost to democracy .
" we 'll have a few additional possibilities in the future to prevent nazi mischief on our streets and squares , " said dieter wiefelspütz , spd domestic policy expert .

" a broad majority of the bundestag has given the victims of the nazi regime a clear signal : germany will remain alert even 60 years after auschwitz , " said silke stokar von neuforn of the green party .
however , germany 's opposition liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- on friday , voted against the planned beefing up of the right of assembly , saying it had doubts whether the move would work to curb far-right groups .
max stadler , domestic policy expert of the fdp , said that freedom of expression and assembly were fundamental to a democracy and that a tightening of the law was the wrong way to deal with far-right extremists .
stadler criticized that the bundestag was worrying showing itself to be increasingly prepared to violate basic rights .
he added it was probably okay in a one-off case , but simply went too far on the whole .
doubts remain over effectiveness despite the relief among most mainstream parties at friday 's decision , questions still remain over how effective the proposed sharpening of the law will prove in limiting neo-nazi groups .
many politicians were annoyed that the changes disregarded a cdu demand to include the brandenburg gate in the demonstration-free zone around the german reichstag .

both beckstein and german interior minister otto schily said they had doubts whether the spiking of the law could prevent the yearly neo-nazi march to the grave of rudolf hess , hitler 's deputy , in wunsiedel .
others voiced doubts over whether the changes were in line with the constitution .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the cdu parliamentary group , said there was no guarantee that the new law was in step with the constitution .
" we ca n't guarantee what decision the german constitutional court could possibly come to one day , " bosbach said .
" we 're only doing what we can to give the authorities instruments to prevent demonstrations more easily . "

soon , when calls are n't bouncing off cell phone towers , they 'll be hurtling through the internet - for less than half the price of a " normal " call . dozens of exhibitors at cebit , the world 's largest it fair , which opened in hanover on thursday , are ready to outfit consumers with headsets , switchboards , phones and answering machines for the day when voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- replaces analog and isdn phone lines . andreas gauger , head of 1 & 1 , germany 's second largest dsl provider , after deutsche telekom , called 2005 " the year that will go down in history for breaking the border between the internet and telephony . " dozens of companies in germany offer private and corporate internet telephony services and the cheaper calls that accompany it . after subscribing to a particular service , users can usually call within that network for free and calls to the german fixed-line network normally costs between one and two cents a minute .
the hamburg internet provider freenet has even done away with those costs for some of its voip packages . germany currently has about six million people using dsl connections to access the internet and 330,000 of them are taking advantage of their high-speed connections to make telephone calls , according to the association of telecommunications providers . " dsl is the technology that made voice over ip possible , " said karsten krug of avm , the producer of the widely popular fritz line of devices used to connect computers to high-speed internet services . telekom joins in voip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile communications providers like o2 are also interested in making voip work for them transferring phone calls to the internet could spell trouble for deutsche telekom , which still keeps the vast majority of germans connected , if people begin to shy away from the former monopoly 's ubiquitous analog and isdn phone systems . " internet telephony is not going to bring a large growth in profits , " said rainer beaujean , head of t-online , the deutsche telekom subsidiary responsible for internet connections .
" but it is important to keep customers . " also important to customers is being able to guarantee a certain quality of service , said carsten lachmann , who manned a t-systems - another deutsche telekom subsidiary - booth at cebit . " there are no guarantees on the internet , " said lachmann , who sets up voip calling for corporate customers .
" anyone who tells you different is lying .
if everyone on the network starts calling or downloading at the same time there are going to be problems . " dsl will keep speeding up a typical voip call requires an upstream data supply of about 100 kbps , while today 's dsl connections offer between 128 kbps and 392 kbps .
deutsche telekom is planning to double download speeds to 6 megabits per second across germany by the middle of this year and speed things up to 25 mbps in some major german cities by 2006 . " voice over ip already has the quality of analog phones , " krug of avm said .
" now , by increasing bandwidth , we are able to improve the quality even more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voip phones look just like their analog counterparts .
voip works by encoding a caller 's voice into digital data then breaking the information into small packets and sending them through the internet to be correctly decoded at the other end by the person receiving the call . new phones for non-tech types along with lower costs , better quality has taken voip from the domain of a few computer geeks when it first emerged about 10 years ago to the general public . at cebit , avm and other telecommunications companies are looking for ways to make internet telephony easier for customers to use .
the new high-tech phones now resemble their analog counterparts in all but the type of cable that is plugged in and the phone bill that comes at the end of the month .
" i do n't notice any difference in quality between voip and an analog phone , " said t-systems lachmann , who uses a dsl connection to make his phone calls .
" except , of course , that my phone bill is a lot lower .

the city worked hard to restore its historic city center , left intact after the war , to its former glory , and for that reason , has become a tourist magnet in eastern germany . but beauty aside , the town has been hit hard by the unemployment , westward migration and high vacancy rates seen throughout the eastern states .

ahead of a parliamentary budget committee meeting next week , members of the green party are refusing a costly project which would make german participation in the air defense air system meads irreversible . german companies and social democratic defense minister peter struck view meads as being strategically important , as it would be the only nato-commissioned defense project carried out jointly by the united states and european nations , notably germany and italy . according to nato , the medium extended air defense system would replace current hawk and patriot interceptors .
the initiators of meads credit it with the ability to protect forces and fixed installations against attacks by current and next-generation tactical ballistic missiles .
it ’ s been promised that meads as a surface-to-air system will have greater firepower and require less manpower than its predecessors . but do we need it ? but whether a new system is required at all for such a specific purpose remains a highly contested question among german parliamentarians .
meads started as a think-tank project between the us , italy and germany .
the system is meant to be fully operational by 2012 , with the us to provide 58 percent , germany 25 percent and italy 17 percent of the financing , the companies involved - lockheed martin , the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and mbda italy - sense a lucrative business opportunity .

the us and italy have already signed the meads contract and have been waiting for germany to follow suit . greens mps fear that the cost of the project will cause the meager national defense budget to burst at its seams .
but hans-peter bartels , a social democratic defense expert , argues that the cost will be offset by the opportunities that meads offers to german industry . “ germany is supposed to play a major role in the development of the radar system for meads , " bartels said .
" german industry stands to profit considerably from its participation in the project .
the expertise it already has and will gain in this field will no doubt come in handy in similar or follow-up projects . ” eads managers argue that the government in berlin can not afford to opt out of the project .

so why are german schools giving music education short shrift ? classical violinist anne-sophie mutter may be one of germany 's best known ambassadors in the field of music , but lately she has rounded out her schedule of concerts , recordings and master classes with unexpected activity : promoting a music curriculum she developed for kindergartens and grade schools .
kids who don ’ t learn to read notes are like musical dyslexics , " mutter recently said in an interview with the german welt am sonntag newspaper .
she hopes her curriculum - a progressive , age based method that brings young children into early contact with music in theory and practice - will help make germany music-literate again .
" it is absurd that we go to the gym regularly to shape our hips but do n't do anything to keep our mind in form .
all infants are rocked and sung to , -lrb- but in school -rrb- music is no longer considered a basic need , " said mutter -lrb- photo -rrb- in the interview .
growing chorus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne-sophie mutter mutter 's voice is one of the most recent additions to the chorus of complaints about how german schools are failing in the area of music education .
amid ever-tighter budgets and a renewed zeal for " back to basics " education , the country has neglected to teach children how to make and appreciate music , the critics argue .
a 1999 study by the nonprofit german music council , an umbrella organization that promotes music in germany , showed that only 20 percent of german schoolchildren are taught by qualified music teachers .
the rest either got no music education or were instructed by unqualified teachers , said the council 's vice president , hans bessler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresdner kreuz choir recent polls have suggested the consequences are dramatic .
surveys have shown that german children sing worse and less frequently than they did a decade ago and they 're ignorant of their cultural patrimony .
fewer germans are music-literate , too .
mozart effect meanwhile , neurological studies - loosely grouped under the heading " mozart effect " - show a clear correlation between exposure to music and brain development , spatial and logical thinking , and academic success .
" the three important constants that the brain uses to absorb information are haptics , acoustics , and analysis , " mutter told welt am sonntag .
" all three are developed through music . ...
music should not be seen as a secondary subject , but as a basis for all other subjects . "
the sputnik effect felicitas liemersdorf , the principal of a cologne primary school , agrees .
" learning music in the school - from a qualified music teacher - is just as important as learning german or math or foreign languages .
unfortunately , society does n't really support this view . "
several decades ago , liemersdorf recalled , primary teachers needed to play an instrument as part of their degree studies .
" that all changed with sputnik , " she said .
in the era of the cold war and the space race , the focus in education switched from all-around liberal arts to science and technology .
finally , in the 1980s , the obligatory music component to education degrees was removed .
since the late 1990s , when germans were shocked by their country 's poor showing in comparative international tests , music education has lost even more ground .
any spare resources tend to be aimed at improving results in " basics , " like reading , math and foreign languages .
wanted : music teachers in fact , bessler of the german music council notes that german schools are meant to follow what he and others say is an " excellent " music curriculum .

ahead of a parliamentary budget committee meeting next week , members of the green party are refusing a costly project which would make german participation in the air defense air system meads irreversible . german companies and social democratic defense minister peter struck view meads as being strategically important , as it would be the only nato-commissioned defense project carried out jointly by the united states and european nations , notably germany and italy . according to nato , the medium extended air defense system would replace current hawk and patriot interceptors .
the initiators of meads credit it with the ability to protect forces and fixed installations against attacks by current and next-generation tactical ballistic missiles .
it ’ s been promised that meads as a surface-to-air system will have greater firepower and require less manpower than its predecessors . but do we need it ? but whether a new system is required at all for such a specific purpose remains a highly contested question among german parliamentarians .
meads started as a think-tank project between the us , italy and germany .
the system is meant to be fully operational by 2012 , with the us to provide 58 percent , germany 25 percent and italy 17 percent of the financing , the companies involved - lockheed martin , the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and mbda italy - sense a lucrative business opportunity .
but german greens parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele said the plan is more about politics than about being a military necessity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele “ i have the impression that the military use of the system is no longer at the heart of those who are pushing meads here , " ströbele -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" this goes for both the development of the system and the ensuing purchase of meads launchers by germany .
it seems it ’ s rather a question of not spoiling transatlantic relations again after the iraq war and putting nato in an awkward position . ” waiting on germany defense minister struck has been unable to drum up unanimous support for the project , which he aims to push through during a meeting of the parliamentary budget committee on march 16 .
the us and italy have already signed the meads contract and have been waiting for germany to follow suit . greens mps fear that the cost of the project will cause the meager national defense budget to burst at its seams .
but hans-peter bartels , a social democratic defense expert , argues that the cost will be offset by the opportunities that meads offers to german industry . “ germany is supposed to play a major role in the development of the radar system for meads , " bartels said .
" german industry stands to profit considerably from its participation in the project .
the expertise it already has and will gain in this field will no doubt come in handy in similar or follow-up projects . ” eads managers argue that the government in berlin can not afford to opt out of the project .
spokesman alexander reinhardt estimated that at least 450 jobs are at stake .
in the end , the greens , as the government 's junior coalition partner may not be prepared to thwart the project altogether .
but they could insist that germany order fewer than the 12 to 24 meads units planned by the defense minister . hardy graupner -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin to spend billion on missile defense germany reportedly plans to spend over € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- on the development of a new transatlantic anti-aircraft system over the next eight years .

" as the night wore on , the plane was moved from its parking gate in preparation for an " administrative " arrest of those on board , police said . peaceful resolution it was at this point that the protesters decided to give themselves up .

the protesters refused to leave the craft , but shortly after the incident started they allowed other passengers and crew to get off without incident . at an early stage in the standoff a correspondent for zdf german television who spoke with one of the passengers by telephone said he had been told that no arms were aboard the plane and that no hostages were being held . the remaining passengers " all have passports from the european union , " but " they say they are of iranian origin , " cleemput said earlier . a young iranian , who spoke to reporters at brussels airport on behalf of the passengers , said the action had been under preparation for five months by a london-based iranian monarchist group , " azarakhsh .

the topic had been debated for years in germany , but took on a new urgency in the past few weeks after germany came under increased pressure to rein in its emboldened right-wing extremists .

in addition to sharpening the right of assembly , friday 's vote also approved changing the country 's criminal code to include a passage calling for up to three years in jail or a fine for glorification of the nazis , or justifying or downplaying the atrocities of the third reich .
" to think of right-wing extremist groups demonstrating in front of memorials for the victims of nazi crimes , either endorsing , denying , or playing down these crimes against humanity , is unbearable , " german interior minister otto schily said last month .

ahead of a parliamentary budget committee meeting next week , members of the green party are refusing a costly project which would make german participation in the air defense air system meads irreversible . german companies and social democratic defense minister peter struck view meads as being strategically important , as it would be the only nato-commissioned defense project carried out jointly by the united states and european nations , notably germany and italy . according to nato , the medium extended air defense system would replace current hawk and patriot interceptors .
the initiators of meads credit it with the ability to protect forces and fixed installations against attacks by current and next-generation tactical ballistic missiles .
it ’ s been promised that meads as a surface-to-air system will have greater firepower and require less manpower than its predecessors . but do we need it ? but whether a new system is required at all for such a specific purpose remains a highly contested question among german parliamentarians .
meads started as a think-tank project between the us , italy and germany .
the system is meant to be fully operational by 2012 , with the us to provide 58 percent , germany 25 percent and italy 17 percent of the financing , the companies involved - lockheed martin , the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and mbda italy - sense a lucrative business opportunity .

it seems it ’ s rather a question of not spoiling transatlantic relations again after the iraq war and putting nato in an awkward position . ” waiting on germany defense minister struck has been unable to drum up unanimous support for the project , which he aims to push through during a meeting of the parliamentary budget committee on march 16 .
the us and italy have already signed the meads contract and have been waiting for germany to follow suit . greens mps fear that the cost of the project will cause the meager national defense budget to burst at its seams .
but hans-peter bartels , a social democratic defense expert , argues that the cost will be offset by the opportunities that meads offers to german industry . “ germany is supposed to play a major role in the development of the radar system for meads , " bartels said .
" german industry stands to profit considerably from its participation in the project .
the expertise it already has and will gain in this field will no doubt come in handy in similar or follow-up projects . ” eads managers argue that the government in berlin can not afford to opt out of the project .
spokesman alexander reinhardt estimated that at least 450 jobs are at stake .
in the end , the greens , as the government 's junior coalition partner may not be prepared to thwart the project altogether .

but hans-peter bartels , a social democratic defense expert , argues that the cost will be offset by the opportunities that meads offers to german industry . “ germany is supposed to play a major role in the development of the radar system for meads , " bartels said .
" german industry stands to profit considerably from its participation in the project .
the expertise it already has and will gain in this field will no doubt come in handy in similar or follow-up projects . ” eads managers argue that the government in berlin can not afford to opt out of the project .
spokesman alexander reinhardt estimated that at least 450 jobs are at stake .
in the end , the greens , as the government 's junior coalition partner may not be prepared to thwart the project altogether .
but they could insist that germany order fewer than the 12 to 24 meads units planned by the defense minister . hardy graupner -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin to spend billion on missile defense germany reportedly plans to spend over € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- on the development of a new transatlantic anti-aircraft system over the next eight years .

soon , when calls are n't bouncing off cell phone towers , they 'll be hurtling through the internet - for less than half the price of a " normal " call . dozens of exhibitors at cebit , the world 's largest it fair , which opened in hanover on thursday , are ready to outfit consumers with headsets , switchboards , phones and answering machines for the day when voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- replaces analog and isdn phone lines . andreas gauger , head of 1 & 1 , germany 's second largest dsl provider , after deutsche telekom , called 2005 " the year that will go down in history for breaking the border between the internet and telephony . " dozens of companies in germany offer private and corporate internet telephony services and the cheaper calls that accompany it . after subscribing to a particular service , users can usually call within that network for free and calls to the german fixed-line network normally costs between one and two cents a minute .
the hamburg internet provider freenet has even done away with those costs for some of its voip packages . germany currently has about six million people using dsl connections to access the internet and 330,000 of them are taking advantage of their high-speed connections to make telephone calls , according to the association of telecommunications providers . " dsl is the technology that made voice over ip possible , " said karsten krug of avm , the producer of the widely popular fritz line of devices used to connect computers to high-speed internet services . telekom joins in voip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile communications providers like o2 are also interested in making voip work for them transferring phone calls to the internet could spell trouble for deutsche telekom , which still keeps the vast majority of germans connected , if people begin to shy away from the former monopoly 's ubiquitous analog and isdn phone systems . " internet telephony is not going to bring a large growth in profits , " said rainer beaujean , head of t-online , the deutsche telekom subsidiary responsible for internet connections .
" but it is important to keep customers . " also important to customers is being able to guarantee a certain quality of service , said carsten lachmann , who manned a t-systems - another deutsche telekom subsidiary - booth at cebit . " there are no guarantees on the internet , " said lachmann , who sets up voip calling for corporate customers .
" anyone who tells you different is lying .
if everyone on the network starts calling or downloading at the same time there are going to be problems . " dsl will keep speeding up a typical voip call requires an upstream data supply of about 100 kbps , while today 's dsl connections offer between 128 kbps and 392 kbps .
deutsche telekom is planning to double download speeds to 6 megabits per second across germany by the middle of this year and speed things up to 25 mbps in some major german cities by 2006 . " voice over ip already has the quality of analog phones , " krug of avm said .
" now , by increasing bandwidth , we are able to improve the quality even more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voip phones look just like their analog counterparts .
voip works by encoding a caller 's voice into digital data then breaking the information into small packets and sending them through the internet to be correctly decoded at the other end by the person receiving the call . new phones for non-tech types along with lower costs , better quality has taken voip from the domain of a few computer geeks when it first emerged about 10 years ago to the general public . at cebit , avm and other telecommunications companies are looking for ways to make internet telephony easier for customers to use .
the new high-tech phones now resemble their analog counterparts in all but the type of cable that is plugged in and the phone bill that comes at the end of the month .
" i do n't notice any difference in quality between voip and an analog phone , " said t-systems lachmann , who uses a dsl connection to make his phone calls .

ahead of a parliamentary budget committee meeting next week , members of the green party are refusing a costly project which would make german participation in the air defense air system meads irreversible . german companies and social democratic defense minister peter struck view meads as being strategically important , as it would be the only nato-commissioned defense project carried out jointly by the united states and european nations , notably germany and italy . according to nato , the medium extended air defense system would replace current hawk and patriot interceptors .
the initiators of meads credit it with the ability to protect forces and fixed installations against attacks by current and next-generation tactical ballistic missiles .
it ’ s been promised that meads as a surface-to-air system will have greater firepower and require less manpower than its predecessors . but do we need it ? but whether a new system is required at all for such a specific purpose remains a highly contested question among german parliamentarians .
meads started as a think-tank project between the us , italy and germany .
the system is meant to be fully operational by 2012 , with the us to provide 58 percent , germany 25 percent and italy 17 percent of the financing , the companies involved - lockheed martin , the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and mbda italy - sense a lucrative business opportunity .
but german greens parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele said the plan is more about politics than about being a military necessity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele “ i have the impression that the military use of the system is no longer at the heart of those who are pushing meads here , " ströbele -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" this goes for both the development of the system and the ensuing purchase of meads launchers by germany .
it seems it ’ s rather a question of not spoiling transatlantic relations again after the iraq war and putting nato in an awkward position . ” waiting on germany defense minister struck has been unable to drum up unanimous support for the project , which he aims to push through during a meeting of the parliamentary budget committee on march 16 .

until now , it ’ s involved destroying a human embryo – a small one , of course , just a few hundred cells . but in nine months , that embryo could be a healthy human baby . not everybody is going to agree that a scientist should be allowed to do that , even if it helps us develop treatments for cancer , paralysis , and heart disease .
but now scientists are finding a way to skirt the ethical question – and keep going with their research in a way to which few would object . instead of pulling the stem cell out of an embryo , they ’ re finding ways to take single stem cells from adults – a perfectly safe procedure – and then “ reprogramming ” them so they have all the flexibility that a stem cell has , if it came from an embryo .
here ’ s how it works . some stem cells , as you may know , are useful because they can produce any cell in the body .
the right kind of stem cell – one which is “ potent ” enough – can become a blood cell , a bone cell , a nerve cell , or whatever it is you need to repair , or regrow , inside a patient ’ s body .
stem cells have different degrees of potency – that means , they have the potential to produce more or fewer different kinds of cells . the most potent kind of stem cell is called “ totipotent ” – they can grow into an entire organism , like a healthy , smiling baby . the second most potent is called “ pluripotent ” – they can become just about any kind of cell , but they can ’ t grow into a whole organism .
even less potent ones are called “ multipotent ” , “ oligopotent ” , and “ unipotent ” – they can only become one , or some kinds of cells .
cells develop along a “ programme ” – that is , as you grow up , your cells become less and less potent . at least it seemed that way to scientists ; they had always thought that as an adult , your skin cells , for example , can only produce new skin cells , and not , say , suddenly become liver cells . -lrb- otherwise , you might just start growing a liver on your arm . -rrb- but just a few years ago , a group of scientists took the right nutrients and growth factors and managed to make neuron stem cells out of adult blood stem cells – which only stayed that way for a few days . since then , scientists have been doing everything they can to figure out how this reprogramming works .
now , at the max planck institute for molecular biomedicine in munster , germany , scientists have isolated the part of the cell where the reprogramming takes place . it ’ s in the nucleus , where the genetic material is . dr. hans schöler is going to tell us now how they found it , and how that brings us a step closer to reprogramming the way we do stem cell research . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german science weekly highlight-17 a happy catastrophe in the baltic sea german science weekly highlight-16 getting in the way of faulty rna german science weekly highlight-15 hope for genetically defective hearts german science weekly highlight-14 dropping atoms from the tower of pisa german science weekly highlight-13 under the earth that 's under the ocean german science weekly highlight-12 how a nose from mainz sniffed out water on mars german science weekly highlight -11 seeing your cells in multicolour german science weekly highlight - 10 how mice choose partners by their smell .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.03.2005 germany moves to curb neo-nazi protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's still unclear whether the new law will prevent scenes like this germany 's lower house of parliament friday voted by a large majority to tighten the right of assembly , thus making it easier in future to ban neo-nazi demonstrations at historic landmarks . after weeks of heated debate , members of germany 's ruling government coalition of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens as well as the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- on friday voted overwhelmingly in favor of tightening the right of assembly and making changes to the existing criminal code . the clamp-down is designed to curtail far-right demonstrations and rallies by far-right groups at historic landmarks such as the former nazi concentration camps , holocaust monuments and other memorials that remember victims of nazi terror and violence .
the topic had been debated for years in germany , but took on a new urgency in the past few weeks after germany came under increased pressure to rein in its emboldened right-wing extremists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large neo-nazi demonstrations in dresden -lrb- photo -rrb- during the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of the city last month and further planned far-right marches at the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , had turned up the heat on policy makers .
in addition to sharpening the right of assembly , friday 's vote also approved changing the country 's criminal code to include a passage calling for up to three years in jail or a fine for glorification of the nazis , or justifying or downplaying the atrocities of the third reich .
" to think of right-wing extremist groups demonstrating in front of memorials for the victims of nazi crimes , either endorsing , denying , or playing down these crimes against humanity , is unbearable , " german interior minister otto schily said last month .
the bundesrat or the upper house of parliament is expected to ratify the changes within the next week .
a threat to democracy most parties on friday hailed the vote as a boost to democracy .
" we 'll have a few additional possibilities in the future to prevent nazi mischief on our streets and squares , " said dieter wiefelspütz , spd domestic policy expert .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler bows in front of a memorial for the victims of the auschwitz death camp on jan .
27 , 2005 .
" a broad majority of the bundestag has given the victims of the nazi regime a clear signal : germany will remain alert even 60 years after auschwitz , " said silke stokar von neuforn of the green party .
however , germany 's opposition liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- on friday , voted against the planned beefing up of the right of assembly , saying it had doubts whether the move would work to curb far-right groups .
max stadler , domestic policy expert of the fdp , said that freedom of expression and assembly were fundamental to a democracy and that a tightening of the law was the wrong way to deal with far-right extremists .
stadler criticized that the bundestag was worrying showing itself to be increasingly prepared to violate basic rights .
he added it was probably okay in a one-off case , but simply went too far on the whole .
doubts remain over effectiveness despite the relief among most mainstream parties at friday 's decision , questions still remain over how effective the proposed sharpening of the law will prove in limiting neo-nazi groups .
many politicians were annoyed that the changes disregarded a cdu demand to include the brandenburg gate in the demonstration-free zone around the german reichstag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neonazis march to the grave of rudolf hess in wunsiedel in aug .
2004 .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein criticized that the new law was " rushed and in parts half-hearted , " though it did go in the right direction .
both beckstein and german interior minister otto schily said they had doubts whether the spiking of the law could prevent the yearly neo-nazi march to the grave of rudolf hess , hitler 's deputy , in wunsiedel .
others voiced doubts over whether the changes were in line with the constitution .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the cdu parliamentary group , said there was no guarantee that the new law was in step with the constitution .
" we ca n't guarantee what decision the german constitutional court could possibly come to one day , " bosbach said .
" we 're only doing what we can to give the authorities instruments to prevent demonstrations more easily . "
earlier , fdp head guido westerwelle called the law " dilettantish " and said that neo-nazi groups could easily challenge the curbs on their right to demonstrate and had " a very good chance of success " at the constitutional court . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de seeking common ground to curb neo-nazis both the government and opposition agree that the right of assembly needs tightening to prevent neo-nazi marches at historic landmarks such as the brandenburg gate in berlin .

the eu is negotiating with the islamic state 's government , notably offering the prospect of a trade agreement in exchange for guarantees about its nuclear program . the plane had arrived from frankfurt on thursday afternoon .
the protesters refused to leave the craft , but shortly after the incident started they allowed other passengers and crew to get off without incident . at an early stage in the standoff a correspondent for zdf german television who spoke with one of the passengers by telephone said he had been told that no arms were aboard the plane and that no hostages were being held . the remaining passengers " all have passports from the european union , " but " they say they are of iranian origin , " cleemput said earlier . a young iranian , who spoke to reporters at brussels airport on behalf of the passengers , said the action had been under preparation for five months by a london-based iranian monarchist group , " azarakhsh . " " we all ask the leaders of the european union -lrb- not to -rrb- support the regime in iran .
we do n't ask nobody , no country , nor any power in the world to help us to change the regime .
we can do it ourselves , " said the man who identified himself as ramin . the rtl-tvi television station said the group 's demands were " political demands " linked notably to the european union 's policies with regard to iran . the german magazine der spiegel said it had received a letter from the group , which described itself as representing iranian men and women protesting against a tehran regime responsible for " torture and terror . " as the night wore on , the plane was moved from its parking gate in preparation for an " administrative " arrest of those on board , police said . peaceful resolution it was at this point that the protesters decided to give themselves up .
" we always said to the activists that they would have no problems if they decided to leave the plane , " said cleemput . in berlin , a lufthansa spokesman said the protest " had nothing to do with our company . " " they have chosen without a doubt a strange place to demonstrate , " said the spokesman , thomas ellerbeck . he said the plane was carrying 120 passengers when it left frankfurt .

until now , it ’ s involved destroying a human embryo – a small one , of course , just a few hundred cells . but in nine months , that embryo could be a healthy human baby . not everybody is going to agree that a scientist should be allowed to do that , even if it helps us develop treatments for cancer , paralysis , and heart disease .
but now scientists are finding a way to skirt the ethical question – and keep going with their research in a way to which few would object . instead of pulling the stem cell out of an embryo , they ’ re finding ways to take single stem cells from adults – a perfectly safe procedure – and then “ reprogramming ” them so they have all the flexibility that a stem cell has , if it came from an embryo .
here ’ s how it works . some stem cells , as you may know , are useful because they can produce any cell in the body .
the right kind of stem cell – one which is “ potent ” enough – can become a blood cell , a bone cell , a nerve cell , or whatever it is you need to repair , or regrow , inside a patient ’ s body .
stem cells have different degrees of potency – that means , they have the potential to produce more or fewer different kinds of cells . the most potent kind of stem cell is called “ totipotent ” – they can grow into an entire organism , like a healthy , smiling baby . the second most potent is called “ pluripotent ” – they can become just about any kind of cell , but they can ’ t grow into a whole organism .
even less potent ones are called “ multipotent ” , “ oligopotent ” , and “ unipotent ” – they can only become one , or some kinds of cells .
cells develop along a “ programme ” – that is , as you grow up , your cells become less and less potent . at least it seemed that way to scientists ; they had always thought that as an adult , your skin cells , for example , can only produce new skin cells , and not , say , suddenly become liver cells . -lrb- otherwise , you might just start growing a liver on your arm . -rrb- but just a few years ago , a group of scientists took the right nutrients and growth factors and managed to make neuron stem cells out of adult blood stem cells – which only stayed that way for a few days . since then , scientists have been doing everything they can to figure out how this reprogramming works .
now , at the max planck institute for molecular biomedicine in munster , germany , scientists have isolated the part of the cell where the reprogramming takes place . it ’ s in the nucleus , where the genetic material is . dr. hans schöler is going to tell us now how they found it , and how that brings us a step closer to reprogramming the way we do stem cell research . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german science weekly highlight-17 a happy catastrophe in the baltic sea german science weekly highlight-16 getting in the way of faulty rna german science weekly highlight-15 hope for genetically defective hearts german science weekly highlight-14 dropping atoms from the tower of pisa german science weekly highlight-13 under the earth that 's under the ocean german science weekly highlight-12 how a nose from mainz sniffed out water on mars german science weekly highlight -11 seeing your cells in multicolour german science weekly highlight - 10 how mice choose partners by their smell .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.03.2005 germany moves to curb neo-nazi protests großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's still unclear whether the new law will prevent scenes like this germany 's lower house of parliament friday voted by a large majority to tighten the right of assembly , thus making it easier in future to ban neo-nazi demonstrations at historic landmarks . after weeks of heated debate , members of germany 's ruling government coalition of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens as well as the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- on friday voted overwhelmingly in favor of tightening the right of assembly and making changes to the existing criminal code . the clamp-down is designed to curtail far-right demonstrations and rallies by far-right groups at historic landmarks such as the former nazi concentration camps , holocaust monuments and other memorials that remember victims of nazi terror and violence .
the topic had been debated for years in germany , but took on a new urgency in the past few weeks after germany came under increased pressure to rein in its emboldened right-wing extremists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large neo-nazi demonstrations in dresden -lrb- photo -rrb- during the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of the city last month and further planned far-right marches at the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , had turned up the heat on policy makers .
in addition to sharpening the right of assembly , friday 's vote also approved changing the country 's criminal code to include a passage calling for up to three years in jail or a fine for glorification of the nazis , or justifying or downplaying the atrocities of the third reich .
" to think of right-wing extremist groups demonstrating in front of memorials for the victims of nazi crimes , either endorsing , denying , or playing down these crimes against humanity , is unbearable , " german interior minister otto schily said last month .
the bundesrat or the upper house of parliament is expected to ratify the changes within the next week .
a threat to democracy most parties on friday hailed the vote as a boost to democracy .
" we 'll have a few additional possibilities in the future to prevent nazi mischief on our streets and squares , " said dieter wiefelspütz , spd domestic policy expert .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler bows in front of a memorial for the victims of the auschwitz death camp on jan .
27 , 2005 .
" a broad majority of the bundestag has given the victims of the nazi regime a clear signal : germany will remain alert even 60 years after auschwitz , " said silke stokar von neuforn of the green party .
however , germany 's opposition liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- on friday , voted against the planned beefing up of the right of assembly , saying it had doubts whether the move would work to curb far-right groups .
max stadler , domestic policy expert of the fdp , said that freedom of expression and assembly were fundamental to a democracy and that a tightening of the law was the wrong way to deal with far-right extremists .
stadler criticized that the bundestag was worrying showing itself to be increasingly prepared to violate basic rights .
he added it was probably okay in a one-off case , but simply went too far on the whole .
doubts remain over effectiveness despite the relief among most mainstream parties at friday 's decision , questions still remain over how effective the proposed sharpening of the law will prove in limiting neo-nazi groups .
many politicians were annoyed that the changes disregarded a cdu demand to include the brandenburg gate in the demonstration-free zone around the german reichstag .

2004 .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein criticized that the new law was " rushed and in parts half-hearted , " though it did go in the right direction .
both beckstein and german interior minister otto schily said they had doubts whether the spiking of the law could prevent the yearly neo-nazi march to the grave of rudolf hess , hitler 's deputy , in wunsiedel .
others voiced doubts over whether the changes were in line with the constitution .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the cdu parliamentary group , said there was no guarantee that the new law was in step with the constitution .
" we ca n't guarantee what decision the german constitutional court could possibly come to one day , " bosbach said .
" we 're only doing what we can to give the authorities instruments to prevent demonstrations more easily . "
earlier , fdp head guido westerwelle called the law " dilettantish " and said that neo-nazi groups could easily challenge the curbs on their right to demonstrate and had " a very good chance of success " at the constitutional court . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de seeking common ground to curb neo-nazis both the government and opposition agree that the right of assembly needs tightening to prevent neo-nazi marches at historic landmarks such as the brandenburg gate in berlin .

soon , when calls are n't bouncing off cell phone towers , they 'll be hurtling through the internet - for less than half the price of a " normal " call . dozens of exhibitors at cebit , the world 's largest it fair , which opened in hanover on thursday , are ready to outfit consumers with headsets , switchboards , phones and answering machines for the day when voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- replaces analog and isdn phone lines . andreas gauger , head of 1 & 1 , germany 's second largest dsl provider , after deutsche telekom , called 2005 " the year that will go down in history for breaking the border between the internet and telephony . " dozens of companies in germany offer private and corporate internet telephony services and the cheaper calls that accompany it . after subscribing to a particular service , users can usually call within that network for free and calls to the german fixed-line network normally costs between one and two cents a minute .
the hamburg internet provider freenet has even done away with those costs for some of its voip packages . germany currently has about six million people using dsl connections to access the internet and 330,000 of them are taking advantage of their high-speed connections to make telephone calls , according to the association of telecommunications providers . " dsl is the technology that made voice over ip possible , " said karsten krug of avm , the producer of the widely popular fritz line of devices used to connect computers to high-speed internet services . telekom joins in voip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile communications providers like o2 are also interested in making voip work for them transferring phone calls to the internet could spell trouble for deutsche telekom , which still keeps the vast majority of germans connected , if people begin to shy away from the former monopoly 's ubiquitous analog and isdn phone systems . " internet telephony is not going to bring a large growth in profits , " said rainer beaujean , head of t-online , the deutsche telekom subsidiary responsible for internet connections .
" but it is important to keep customers . " also important to customers is being able to guarantee a certain quality of service , said carsten lachmann , who manned a t-systems - another deutsche telekom subsidiary - booth at cebit . " there are no guarantees on the internet , " said lachmann , who sets up voip calling for corporate customers .
" anyone who tells you different is lying .

deutsche telekom is planning to double download speeds to 6 megabits per second across germany by the middle of this year and speed things up to 25 mbps in some major german cities by 2006 . " voice over ip already has the quality of analog phones , " krug of avm said .
" now , by increasing bandwidth , we are able to improve the quality even more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voip phones look just like their analog counterparts .
voip works by encoding a caller 's voice into digital data then breaking the information into small packets and sending them through the internet to be correctly decoded at the other end by the person receiving the call . new phones for non-tech types along with lower costs , better quality has taken voip from the domain of a few computer geeks when it first emerged about 10 years ago to the general public . at cebit , avm and other telecommunications companies are looking for ways to make internet telephony easier for customers to use .
the new high-tech phones now resemble their analog counterparts in all but the type of cable that is plugged in and the phone bill that comes at the end of the month .

until now , it ’ s involved destroying a human embryo – a small one , of course , just a few hundred cells . but in nine months , that embryo could be a healthy human baby . not everybody is going to agree that a scientist should be allowed to do that , even if it helps us develop treatments for cancer , paralysis , and heart disease .
but now scientists are finding a way to skirt the ethical question – and keep going with their research in a way to which few would object . instead of pulling the stem cell out of an embryo , they ’ re finding ways to take single stem cells from adults – a perfectly safe procedure – and then “ reprogramming ” them so they have all the flexibility that a stem cell has , if it came from an embryo .
here ’ s how it works . some stem cells , as you may know , are useful because they can produce any cell in the body .
the right kind of stem cell – one which is “ potent ” enough – can become a blood cell , a bone cell , a nerve cell , or whatever it is you need to repair , or regrow , inside a patient ’ s body .
stem cells have different degrees of potency – that means , they have the potential to produce more or fewer different kinds of cells . the most potent kind of stem cell is called “ totipotent ” – they can grow into an entire organism , like a healthy , smiling baby . the second most potent is called “ pluripotent ” – they can become just about any kind of cell , but they can ’ t grow into a whole organism .
even less potent ones are called “ multipotent ” , “ oligopotent ” , and “ unipotent ” – they can only become one , or some kinds of cells .
cells develop along a “ programme ” – that is , as you grow up , your cells become less and less potent . at least it seemed that way to scientists ; they had always thought that as an adult , your skin cells , for example , can only produce new skin cells , and not , say , suddenly become liver cells . -lrb- otherwise , you might just start growing a liver on your arm . -rrb- but just a few years ago , a group of scientists took the right nutrients and growth factors and managed to make neuron stem cells out of adult blood stem cells – which only stayed that way for a few days . since then , scientists have been doing everything they can to figure out how this reprogramming works .
now , at the max planck institute for molecular biomedicine in munster , germany , scientists have isolated the part of the cell where the reprogramming takes place . it ’ s in the nucleus , where the genetic material is . dr. hans schöler is going to tell us now how they found it , and how that brings us a step closer to reprogramming the way we do stem cell research . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german science weekly highlight-17 a happy catastrophe in the baltic sea german science weekly highlight-16 getting in the way of faulty rna german science weekly highlight-15 hope for genetically defective hearts german science weekly highlight-14 dropping atoms from the tower of pisa german science weekly highlight-13 under the earth that 's under the ocean german science weekly highlight-12 how a nose from mainz sniffed out water on mars german science weekly highlight -11 seeing your cells in multicolour german science weekly highlight - 10 how mice choose partners by their smell .

"
he has been hiding since a warrant for his arrest on multiple counts of pedophilia was issued in august 1996 .
schäfer was convicted of the charges in november 2004 along with 22 other dignidad members . " the arrest of paul schaefer is good news , " fischer said .
" his arrest will allow a comprehensive investigation all the criminal activities in the former colonia dignidad to be carried out and punishments to be handed down . "
argentine police commissioner alejandro dinisio told afp that schäfer carried no identification documents and refused to speak at the time of his arrest .
he added that police had been on his trail for six months . television reporters mobbed schäfer as an agent pushed the elderly suspect on his wheelchair into a provincial police station .
schäfer was shown on television handcuffed and smiling , and holding a bottle of soda . officials said he could be transferred to buenos aires as early as friday . child abuse and cultic practices a former corporal and medic in hitler 's nazi army , schäfer fled germany to chile in 1961 to avoid child sexual abuse charges .

a mixture of cultic practices such as exorcising devils and psychological terror were said to rampant in the sect . in 1996 a number of former residents testified that schäfer systematically abused the colony 's young children , many of whom were taken from the parents at birth .
accusations of forced labor and other forms of maltreatment also surfaced at the time . a torture center and school chilean officials also want schäfer in connection with torture during the 1973-1990 pinochet dictatorship .
the colony apparently served as a torture center for the chilean secret service as well as a torture school where former gestapo and nazi officers gave lessons . investigators say that political prisoners , including former leftist leader alvaro vallejos villagran - arrested by pinochet agents in may 1974 - vanished after being sent to colonia dignidad . a former member of pinochet 's secret police gave testimony stating that he knew vallejos villagran was taken alive to dignidad . schäfer and the colony are believed to have enjoyed pinochet 's protection right until the end of his dictatorship in 1990 . disappearance of professor police also want to question schäfer about the 1985 disappearance of boris weisfeiler , an american jewish mathematics professor of russian origin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators outside " colonia dignidad " investigators believe weisfeiler was picked up by a military border patrol while he was backpacking in the region on suspicion of being a spy and dropped off at dignidad . weisfeiler 's sister olga said there were reports by dignidad residents of seeing him alive up to two years later . schäfer 's arrest on thursday sparked relief among the present residents of the colony .
about 300 people , mainly germans , still live there . " i believe , we 're all happy here today .
i definitely am - we had to suffer too much , " one of them told chilean television . to accelerate schäfer 's departure , the chilean interior minister asked his argentine counterpart to kick him out of argentina and avoid going to court to ask for an extradition , which could delay the case with appeals . officials praised the joint action on thursday by argentine and chilean police which led to schäfer 's arrest .

"
he has been hiding since a warrant for his arrest on multiple counts of pedophilia was issued in august 1996 .
schäfer was convicted of the charges in november 2004 along with 22 other dignidad members . " the arrest of paul schaefer is good news , " fischer said .
" his arrest will allow a comprehensive investigation all the criminal activities in the former colonia dignidad to be carried out and punishments to be handed down . "
argentine police commissioner alejandro dinisio told afp that schäfer carried no identification documents and refused to speak at the time of his arrest .
he added that police had been on his trail for six months . television reporters mobbed schäfer as an agent pushed the elderly suspect on his wheelchair into a provincial police station .
schäfer was shown on television handcuffed and smiling , and holding a bottle of soda . officials said he could be transferred to buenos aires as early as friday . child abuse and cultic practices a former corporal and medic in hitler 's nazi army , schäfer fled germany to chile in 1961 to avoid child sexual abuse charges .
he established the self-sufficient colonia dignidad , also called " villa baviera , " in the mountains near the city of parral , some 350 kilometers -lrb- 218 miles -rrb- south of santiago along with other german immigrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the main gate of " colonia dignidad " in 1988 surrounded by barbed wire and electric fences and protected by barricades , the community , populated largely by germans , adhered to a strict discipline and remained cut off from the rest of chile .
a mixture of cultic practices such as exorcising devils and psychological terror were said to rampant in the sect . in 1996 a number of former residents testified that schäfer systematically abused the colony 's young children , many of whom were taken from the parents at birth .
accusations of forced labor and other forms of maltreatment also surfaced at the time . a torture center and school chilean officials also want schäfer in connection with torture during the 1973-1990 pinochet dictatorship .
the colony apparently served as a torture center for the chilean secret service as well as a torture school where former gestapo and nazi officers gave lessons . investigators say that political prisoners , including former leftist leader alvaro vallejos villagran - arrested by pinochet agents in may 1974 - vanished after being sent to colonia dignidad . a former member of pinochet 's secret police gave testimony stating that he knew vallejos villagran was taken alive to dignidad . schäfer and the colony are believed to have enjoyed pinochet 's protection right until the end of his dictatorship in 1990 . disappearance of professor police also want to question schäfer about the 1985 disappearance of boris weisfeiler , an american jewish mathematics professor of russian origin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators outside " colonia dignidad " investigators believe weisfeiler was picked up by a military border patrol while he was backpacking in the region on suspicion of being a spy and dropped off at dignidad . weisfeiler 's sister olga said there were reports by dignidad residents of seeing him alive up to two years later . schäfer 's arrest on thursday sparked relief among the present residents of the colony .
about 300 people , mainly germans , still live there . " i believe , we 're all happy here today .
i definitely am - we had to suffer too much , " one of them told chilean television . to accelerate schäfer 's departure , the chilean interior minister asked his argentine counterpart to kick him out of argentina and avoid going to court to ask for an extradition , which could delay the case with appeals . officials praised the joint action on thursday by argentine and chilean police which led to schäfer 's arrest . " we are proud of this arrest , " said a justice spokesman in santiago de chile .
" we expect that paul schäfer will have to face two charges as soon as possible : one for sodomy against a child and the other for the disappearance of alvaro vallejos villagran .

the hamburg internet provider freenet has even done away with those costs for some of its voip packages . germany currently has about six million people using dsl connections to access the internet and 330,000 of them are taking advantage of their high-speed connections to make telephone calls , according to the association of telecommunications providers .

ahead of a parliamentary budget committee meeting next week , members of the green party are refusing a costly project which would make german participation in the air defense air system meads irreversible . german companies and social democratic defense minister peter struck view meads as being strategically important , as it would be the only nato-commissioned defense project carried out jointly by the united states and european nations , notably germany and italy . according to nato , the medium extended air defense system would replace current hawk and patriot interceptors .
the initiators of meads credit it with the ability to protect forces and fixed installations against attacks by current and next-generation tactical ballistic missiles .
it ’ s been promised that meads as a surface-to-air system will have greater firepower and require less manpower than its predecessors . but do we need it ? but whether a new system is required at all for such a specific purpose remains a highly contested question among german parliamentarians .
meads started as a think-tank project between the us , italy and germany .
the system is meant to be fully operational by 2012 , with the us to provide 58 percent , germany 25 percent and italy 17 percent of the financing , the companies involved - lockheed martin , the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and mbda italy - sense a lucrative business opportunity .
but german greens parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele said the plan is more about politics than about being a military necessity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele “ i have the impression that the military use of the system is no longer at the heart of those who are pushing meads here , " ströbele -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" this goes for both the development of the system and the ensuing purchase of meads launchers by germany .
it seems it ’ s rather a question of not spoiling transatlantic relations again after the iraq war and putting nato in an awkward position . ” waiting on germany defense minister struck has been unable to drum up unanimous support for the project , which he aims to push through during a meeting of the parliamentary budget committee on march 16 .
the us and italy have already signed the meads contract and have been waiting for germany to follow suit . greens mps fear that the cost of the project will cause the meager national defense budget to burst at its seams .
but hans-peter bartels , a social democratic defense expert , argues that the cost will be offset by the opportunities that meads offers to german industry . “ germany is supposed to play a major role in the development of the radar system for meads , " bartels said .
" german industry stands to profit considerably from its participation in the project .
the expertise it already has and will gain in this field will no doubt come in handy in similar or follow-up projects . ” eads managers argue that the government in berlin can not afford to opt out of the project .
spokesman alexander reinhardt estimated that at least 450 jobs are at stake .
in the end , the greens , as the government 's junior coalition partner may not be prepared to thwart the project altogether .

the city worked hard to restore its historic city center , left intact after the war , to its former glory , and for that reason , has become a tourist magnet in eastern germany . but beauty aside , the town has been hit hard by the unemployment , westward migration and high vacancy rates seen throughout the eastern states .
city officials are counting on the title of culture capital to dispel some of the gloom . " we were both anxious and hopeful , " said kai grebasch , spokesman for the city 's culture capital office .

soon , when calls are n't bouncing off cell phone towers , they 'll be hurtling through the internet - for less than half the price of a " normal " call . dozens of exhibitors at cebit , the world 's largest it fair , which opened in hanover on thursday , are ready to outfit consumers with headsets , switchboards , phones and answering machines for the day when voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- replaces analog and isdn phone lines . andreas gauger , head of 1 & 1 , germany 's second largest dsl provider , after deutsche telekom , called 2005 " the year that will go down in history for breaking the border between the internet and telephony . " dozens of companies in germany offer private and corporate internet telephony services and the cheaper calls that accompany it . after subscribing to a particular service , users can usually call within that network for free and calls to the german fixed-line network normally costs between one and two cents a minute .
the hamburg internet provider freenet has even done away with those costs for some of its voip packages . germany currently has about six million people using dsl connections to access the internet and 330,000 of them are taking advantage of their high-speed connections to make telephone calls , according to the association of telecommunications providers . " dsl is the technology that made voice over ip possible , " said karsten krug of avm , the producer of the widely popular fritz line of devices used to connect computers to high-speed internet services . telekom joins in voip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile communications providers like o2 are also interested in making voip work for them transferring phone calls to the internet could spell trouble for deutsche telekom , which still keeps the vast majority of germans connected , if people begin to shy away from the former monopoly 's ubiquitous analog and isdn phone systems . " internet telephony is not going to bring a large growth in profits , " said rainer beaujean , head of t-online , the deutsche telekom subsidiary responsible for internet connections .
" but it is important to keep customers . " also important to customers is being able to guarantee a certain quality of service , said carsten lachmann , who manned a t-systems - another deutsche telekom subsidiary - booth at cebit . " there are no guarantees on the internet , " said lachmann , who sets up voip calling for corporate customers .
" anyone who tells you different is lying .
if everyone on the network starts calling or downloading at the same time there are going to be problems . " dsl will keep speeding up a typical voip call requires an upstream data supply of about 100 kbps , while today 's dsl connections offer between 128 kbps and 392 kbps .
deutsche telekom is planning to double download speeds to 6 megabits per second across germany by the middle of this year and speed things up to 25 mbps in some major german cities by 2006 . " voice over ip already has the quality of analog phones , " krug of avm said .
" now , by increasing bandwidth , we are able to improve the quality even more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voip phones look just like their analog counterparts .
voip works by encoding a caller 's voice into digital data then breaking the information into small packets and sending them through the internet to be correctly decoded at the other end by the person receiving the call . new phones for non-tech types along with lower costs , better quality has taken voip from the domain of a few computer geeks when it first emerged about 10 years ago to the general public . at cebit , avm and other telecommunications companies are looking for ways to make internet telephony easier for customers to use .
the new high-tech phones now resemble their analog counterparts in all but the type of cable that is plugged in and the phone bill that comes at the end of the month .
" i do n't notice any difference in quality between voip and an analog phone , " said t-systems lachmann , who uses a dsl connection to make his phone calls .
" except , of course , that my phone bill is a lot lower .

the protesters refused to leave the craft , but shortly after the incident started they allowed other passengers and crew to get off without incident . at an early stage in the standoff a correspondent for zdf german television who spoke with one of the passengers by telephone said he had been told that no arms were aboard the plane and that no hostages were being held . the remaining passengers " all have passports from the european union , " but " they say they are of iranian origin , " cleemput said earlier . a young iranian , who spoke to reporters at brussels airport on behalf of the passengers , said the action had been under preparation for five months by a london-based iranian monarchist group , " azarakhsh .

we can do it ourselves , " said the man who identified himself as ramin . the rtl-tvi television station said the group 's demands were " political demands " linked notably to the european union 's policies with regard to iran . the german magazine der spiegel said it had received a letter from the group , which described itself as representing iranian men and women protesting against a tehran regime responsible for " torture and terror . " as the night wore on , the plane was moved from its parking gate in preparation for an " administrative " arrest of those on board , police said . peaceful resolution it was at this point that the protesters decided to give themselves up .
" we always said to the activists that they would have no problems if they decided to leave the plane , " said cleemput . in berlin , a lufthansa spokesman said the protest " had nothing to do with our company . " " they have chosen without a doubt a strange place to demonstrate , " said the spokesman , thomas ellerbeck . he said the plane was carrying 120 passengers when it left frankfurt .

" we 're in support of what the europeans are doing , but we had to find a way to demonstrate it , " a senior american official told the new york times about the pending announcement .
" this is our way of making clear that we will join the europeans in giving iran positive reasons to give up its program . " modest incentives the new york times said the us incentives - support for iran 's entry into the world trade organization and selling iran spare parts for its ageing commercial airliners - would go into effect only if iran agreed to permanently halt uranium enrichment at its nuclear plants . senior administration officials , quoted but not identified by both us dailies , told the times that the united states does not plan to join the talks with iran directly , leaving that to the europeans . britain , france and germany are trying to convince iran to halt its work on the nuclear fuel cycle - including the sensitive process of enriching uranium - in return for a package of incentives covering trade , security and technology . a new round of talks , the fifth since december , is to be held later this month , possibly in a capital of one of the three states negotiating for the european union . the united states maintains that iran is trying to covertly develop nuclear weapons , while tehran insists that its program is purely meant to meet civilian energy needs . citing an " unusual and extraordinary threat " from tehran , us president george w. bush on thursday renewed sanctions that bar us firms and citizens from oil dealings with iran . afp / dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's top nuclear official strikes defiant note iran 's hassan rowhani saturday warned the us and europe of an oil crisis if tehran is sent before the un security council over its nuclear program , rejecting outright their demands to halt uranium enrichment .

"
he has been hiding since a warrant for his arrest on multiple counts of pedophilia was issued in august 1996 .
schäfer was convicted of the charges in november 2004 along with 22 other dignidad members . " the arrest of paul schaefer is good news , " fischer said .
" his arrest will allow a comprehensive investigation all the criminal activities in the former colonia dignidad to be carried out and punishments to be handed down . "
argentine police commissioner alejandro dinisio told afp that schäfer carried no identification documents and refused to speak at the time of his arrest .
he added that police had been on his trail for six months . television reporters mobbed schäfer as an agent pushed the elderly suspect on his wheelchair into a provincial police station .
schäfer was shown on television handcuffed and smiling , and holding a bottle of soda . officials said he could be transferred to buenos aires as early as friday . child abuse and cultic practices a former corporal and medic in hitler 's nazi army , schäfer fled germany to chile in 1961 to avoid child sexual abuse charges .

the topic had been debated for years in germany , but took on a new urgency in the past few weeks after germany came under increased pressure to rein in its emboldened right-wing extremists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large neo-nazi demonstrations in dresden -lrb- photo -rrb- during the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of the city last month and further planned far-right marches at the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , had turned up the heat on policy makers .
in addition to sharpening the right of assembly , friday 's vote also approved changing the country 's criminal code to include a passage calling for up to three years in jail or a fine for glorification of the nazis , or justifying or downplaying the atrocities of the third reich .
" to think of right-wing extremist groups demonstrating in front of memorials for the victims of nazi crimes , either endorsing , denying , or playing down these crimes against humanity , is unbearable , " german interior minister otto schily said last month .
the bundesrat or the upper house of parliament is expected to ratify the changes within the next week .
a threat to democracy most parties on friday hailed the vote as a boost to democracy .
" we 'll have a few additional possibilities in the future to prevent nazi mischief on our streets and squares , " said dieter wiefelspütz , spd domestic policy expert .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler bows in front of a memorial for the victims of the auschwitz death camp on jan .
27 , 2005 .
" a broad majority of the bundestag has given the victims of the nazi regime a clear signal : germany will remain alert even 60 years after auschwitz , " said silke stokar von neuforn of the green party .
however , germany 's opposition liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- on friday , voted against the planned beefing up of the right of assembly , saying it had doubts whether the move would work to curb far-right groups .
max stadler , domestic policy expert of the fdp , said that freedom of expression and assembly were fundamental to a democracy and that a tightening of the law was the wrong way to deal with far-right extremists .
stadler criticized that the bundestag was worrying showing itself to be increasingly prepared to violate basic rights .
he added it was probably okay in a one-off case , but simply went too far on the whole .
doubts remain over effectiveness despite the relief among most mainstream parties at friday 's decision , questions still remain over how effective the proposed sharpening of the law will prove in limiting neo-nazi groups .
many politicians were annoyed that the changes disregarded a cdu demand to include the brandenburg gate in the demonstration-free zone around the german reichstag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neonazis march to the grave of rudolf hess in wunsiedel in aug .
2004 .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein criticized that the new law was " rushed and in parts half-hearted , " though it did go in the right direction .
both beckstein and german interior minister otto schily said they had doubts whether the spiking of the law could prevent the yearly neo-nazi march to the grave of rudolf hess , hitler 's deputy , in wunsiedel .
others voiced doubts over whether the changes were in line with the constitution .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the cdu parliamentary group , said there was no guarantee that the new law was in step with the constitution .
" we ca n't guarantee what decision the german constitutional court could possibly come to one day , " bosbach said .
" we 're only doing what we can to give the authorities instruments to prevent demonstrations more easily . "
earlier , fdp head guido westerwelle called the law " dilettantish " and said that neo-nazi groups could easily challenge the curbs on their right to demonstrate and had " a very good chance of success " at the constitutional court . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de seeking common ground to curb neo-nazis both the government and opposition agree that the right of assembly needs tightening to prevent neo-nazi marches at historic landmarks such as the brandenburg gate in berlin .

until now , it ’ s involved destroying a human embryo – a small one , of course , just a few hundred cells . but in nine months , that embryo could be a healthy human baby . not everybody is going to agree that a scientist should be allowed to do that , even if it helps us develop treatments for cancer , paralysis , and heart disease .
but now scientists are finding a way to skirt the ethical question – and keep going with their research in a way to which few would object . instead of pulling the stem cell out of an embryo , they ’ re finding ways to take single stem cells from adults – a perfectly safe procedure – and then “ reprogramming ” them so they have all the flexibility that a stem cell has , if it came from an embryo .
here ’ s how it works . some stem cells , as you may know , are useful because they can produce any cell in the body .
the right kind of stem cell – one which is “ potent ” enough – can become a blood cell , a bone cell , a nerve cell , or whatever it is you need to repair , or regrow , inside a patient ’ s body .
stem cells have different degrees of potency – that means , they have the potential to produce more or fewer different kinds of cells . the most potent kind of stem cell is called “ totipotent ” – they can grow into an entire organism , like a healthy , smiling baby . the second most potent is called “ pluripotent ” – they can become just about any kind of cell , but they can ’ t grow into a whole organism .
even less potent ones are called “ multipotent ” , “ oligopotent ” , and “ unipotent ” – they can only become one , or some kinds of cells .
cells develop along a “ programme ” – that is , as you grow up , your cells become less and less potent . at least it seemed that way to scientists ; they had always thought that as an adult , your skin cells , for example , can only produce new skin cells , and not , say , suddenly become liver cells . -lrb- otherwise , you might just start growing a liver on your arm . -rrb- but just a few years ago , a group of scientists took the right nutrients and growth factors and managed to make neuron stem cells out of adult blood stem cells – which only stayed that way for a few days . since then , scientists have been doing everything they can to figure out how this reprogramming works .
now , at the max planck institute for molecular biomedicine in munster , germany , scientists have isolated the part of the cell where the reprogramming takes place . it ’ s in the nucleus , where the genetic material is . dr. hans schöler is going to tell us now how they found it , and how that brings us a step closer to reprogramming the way we do stem cell research . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german science weekly highlight-17 a happy catastrophe in the baltic sea german science weekly highlight-16 getting in the way of faulty rna german science weekly highlight-15 hope for genetically defective hearts german science weekly highlight-14 dropping atoms from the tower of pisa german science weekly highlight-13 under the earth that 's under the ocean german science weekly highlight-12 how a nose from mainz sniffed out water on mars german science weekly highlight -11 seeing your cells in multicolour german science weekly highlight - 10 how mice choose partners by their smell .

the topic had been debated for years in germany , but took on a new urgency in the past few weeks after germany came under increased pressure to rein in its emboldened right-wing extremists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large neo-nazi demonstrations in dresden -lrb- photo -rrb- during the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of the city last month and further planned far-right marches at the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , had turned up the heat on policy makers .
in addition to sharpening the right of assembly , friday 's vote also approved changing the country 's criminal code to include a passage calling for up to three years in jail or a fine for glorification of the nazis , or justifying or downplaying the atrocities of the third reich .
" to think of right-wing extremist groups demonstrating in front of memorials for the victims of nazi crimes , either endorsing , denying , or playing down these crimes against humanity , is unbearable , " german interior minister otto schily said last month .
the bundesrat or the upper house of parliament is expected to ratify the changes within the next week .
a threat to democracy most parties on friday hailed the vote as a boost to democracy .
" we 'll have a few additional possibilities in the future to prevent nazi mischief on our streets and squares , " said dieter wiefelspütz , spd domestic policy expert .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler bows in front of a memorial for the victims of the auschwitz death camp on jan .
27 , 2005 .
" a broad majority of the bundestag has given the victims of the nazi regime a clear signal : germany will remain alert even 60 years after auschwitz , " said silke stokar von neuforn of the green party .
however , germany 's opposition liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- on friday , voted against the planned beefing up of the right of assembly , saying it had doubts whether the move would work to curb far-right groups .
max stadler , domestic policy expert of the fdp , said that freedom of expression and assembly were fundamental to a democracy and that a tightening of the law was the wrong way to deal with far-right extremists .
stadler criticized that the bundestag was worrying showing itself to be increasingly prepared to violate basic rights .
he added it was probably okay in a one-off case , but simply went too far on the whole .
doubts remain over effectiveness despite the relief among most mainstream parties at friday 's decision , questions still remain over how effective the proposed sharpening of the law will prove in limiting neo-nazi groups .
many politicians were annoyed that the changes disregarded a cdu demand to include the brandenburg gate in the demonstration-free zone around the german reichstag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neonazis march to the grave of rudolf hess in wunsiedel in aug .
2004 .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein criticized that the new law was " rushed and in parts half-hearted , " though it did go in the right direction .
both beckstein and german interior minister otto schily said they had doubts whether the spiking of the law could prevent the yearly neo-nazi march to the grave of rudolf hess , hitler 's deputy , in wunsiedel .
others voiced doubts over whether the changes were in line with the constitution .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the cdu parliamentary group , said there was no guarantee that the new law was in step with the constitution .
" we ca n't guarantee what decision the german constitutional court could possibly come to one day , " bosbach said .
" we 're only doing what we can to give the authorities instruments to prevent demonstrations more easily . "
earlier , fdp head guido westerwelle called the law " dilettantish " and said that neo-nazi groups could easily challenge the curbs on their right to demonstrate and had " a very good chance of success " at the constitutional court . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de seeking common ground to curb neo-nazis both the government and opposition agree that the right of assembly needs tightening to prevent neo-nazi marches at historic landmarks such as the brandenburg gate in berlin .

until now , it ’ s involved destroying a human embryo – a small one , of course , just a few hundred cells . but in nine months , that embryo could be a healthy human baby . not everybody is going to agree that a scientist should be allowed to do that , even if it helps us develop treatments for cancer , paralysis , and heart disease .
but now scientists are finding a way to skirt the ethical question – and keep going with their research in a way to which few would object . instead of pulling the stem cell out of an embryo , they ’ re finding ways to take single stem cells from adults – a perfectly safe procedure – and then “ reprogramming ” them so they have all the flexibility that a stem cell has , if it came from an embryo .
here ’ s how it works . some stem cells , as you may know , are useful because they can produce any cell in the body .
the right kind of stem cell – one which is “ potent ” enough – can become a blood cell , a bone cell , a nerve cell , or whatever it is you need to repair , or regrow , inside a patient ’ s body .
stem cells have different degrees of potency – that means , they have the potential to produce more or fewer different kinds of cells . the most potent kind of stem cell is called “ totipotent ” – they can grow into an entire organism , like a healthy , smiling baby . the second most potent is called “ pluripotent ” – they can become just about any kind of cell , but they can ’ t grow into a whole organism .
even less potent ones are called “ multipotent ” , “ oligopotent ” , and “ unipotent ” – they can only become one , or some kinds of cells .
cells develop along a “ programme ” – that is , as you grow up , your cells become less and less potent . at least it seemed that way to scientists ; they had always thought that as an adult , your skin cells , for example , can only produce new skin cells , and not , say , suddenly become liver cells . -lrb- otherwise , you might just start growing a liver on your arm . -rrb- but just a few years ago , a group of scientists took the right nutrients and growth factors and managed to make neuron stem cells out of adult blood stem cells – which only stayed that way for a few days . since then , scientists have been doing everything they can to figure out how this reprogramming works .
now , at the max planck institute for molecular biomedicine in munster , germany , scientists have isolated the part of the cell where the reprogramming takes place . it ’ s in the nucleus , where the genetic material is . dr. hans schöler is going to tell us now how they found it , and how that brings us a step closer to reprogramming the way we do stem cell research . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german science weekly highlight-17 a happy catastrophe in the baltic sea german science weekly highlight-16 getting in the way of faulty rna german science weekly highlight-15 hope for genetically defective hearts german science weekly highlight-14 dropping atoms from the tower of pisa german science weekly highlight-13 under the earth that 's under the ocean german science weekly highlight-12 how a nose from mainz sniffed out water on mars german science weekly highlight -11 seeing your cells in multicolour german science weekly highlight - 10 how mice choose partners by their smell .

until now , it ’ s involved destroying a human embryo – a small one , of course , just a few hundred cells . but in nine months , that embryo could be a healthy human baby . not everybody is going to agree that a scientist should be allowed to do that , even if it helps us develop treatments for cancer , paralysis , and heart disease .
but now scientists are finding a way to skirt the ethical question – and keep going with their research in a way to which few would object . instead of pulling the stem cell out of an embryo , they ’ re finding ways to take single stem cells from adults – a perfectly safe procedure – and then “ reprogramming ” them so they have all the flexibility that a stem cell has , if it came from an embryo .
here ’ s how it works . some stem cells , as you may know , are useful because they can produce any cell in the body .
the right kind of stem cell – one which is “ potent ” enough – can become a blood cell , a bone cell , a nerve cell , or whatever it is you need to repair , or regrow , inside a patient ’ s body .
stem cells have different degrees of potency – that means , they have the potential to produce more or fewer different kinds of cells . the most potent kind of stem cell is called “ totipotent ” – they can grow into an entire organism , like a healthy , smiling baby . the second most potent is called “ pluripotent ” – they can become just about any kind of cell , but they can ’ t grow into a whole organism .
even less potent ones are called “ multipotent ” , “ oligopotent ” , and “ unipotent ” – they can only become one , or some kinds of cells .
cells develop along a “ programme ” – that is , as you grow up , your cells become less and less potent . at least it seemed that way to scientists ; they had always thought that as an adult , your skin cells , for example , can only produce new skin cells , and not , say , suddenly become liver cells . -lrb- otherwise , you might just start growing a liver on your arm . -rrb- but just a few years ago , a group of scientists took the right nutrients and growth factors and managed to make neuron stem cells out of adult blood stem cells – which only stayed that way for a few days . since then , scientists have been doing everything they can to figure out how this reprogramming works .
now , at the max planck institute for molecular biomedicine in munster , germany , scientists have isolated the part of the cell where the reprogramming takes place . it ’ s in the nucleus , where the genetic material is . dr. hans schöler is going to tell us now how they found it , and how that brings us a step closer to reprogramming the way we do stem cell research . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german science weekly highlight-17 a happy catastrophe in the baltic sea german science weekly highlight-16 getting in the way of faulty rna german science weekly highlight-15 hope for genetically defective hearts german science weekly highlight-14 dropping atoms from the tower of pisa german science weekly highlight-13 under the earth that 's under the ocean german science weekly highlight-12 how a nose from mainz sniffed out water on mars german science weekly highlight -11 seeing your cells in multicolour german science weekly highlight - 10 how mice choose partners by their smell .

" we 're in support of what the europeans are doing , but we had to find a way to demonstrate it , " a senior american official told the new york times about the pending announcement .
" this is our way of making clear that we will join the europeans in giving iran positive reasons to give up its program . " modest incentives the new york times said the us incentives - support for iran 's entry into the world trade organization and selling iran spare parts for its ageing commercial airliners - would go into effect only if iran agreed to permanently halt uranium enrichment at its nuclear plants . senior administration officials , quoted but not identified by both us dailies , told the times that the united states does not plan to join the talks with iran directly , leaving that to the europeans . britain , france and germany are trying to convince iran to halt its work on the nuclear fuel cycle - including the sensitive process of enriching uranium - in return for a package of incentives covering trade , security and technology . a new round of talks , the fifth since december , is to be held later this month , possibly in a capital of one of the three states negotiating for the european union . the united states maintains that iran is trying to covertly develop nuclear weapons , while tehran insists that its program is purely meant to meet civilian energy needs . citing an " unusual and extraordinary threat " from tehran , us president george w. bush on thursday renewed sanctions that bar us firms and citizens from oil dealings with iran . afp / dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's top nuclear official strikes defiant note iran 's hassan rowhani saturday warned the us and europe of an oil crisis if tehran is sent before the un security council over its nuclear program , rejecting outright their demands to halt uranium enrichment .

he believes that 's evidence enough that the country far more advanced than is generally known . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tourist walks past a chinese sign as skyscrapers tower into clouds as background in shanghai .
taube uses the example of china 's exports , which are no longer confined to labor-intensive products , to make his point .
" the technological sophistication of chinese exports is much higher than most us can imagine , " he said .
" and it is effectively also much higher than many eastern european states . " in china , capitalism has been compatible with marx and lenin since 1992 .
the country even joined the world trade organization in 2001 and last year , private ownership was given equal status with that of the state in the chinese constitution .
all of that has helped push china to the pinnacle the world economy in a matter of years .
it is now the world 's fourth biggest exporter after germany , the usa and japan . taube said prospects for stable and continuous growth for years to come will ensure china is not simply the world 's sweatshop for cheap , mass-made products .
and as inexpensive labor meets high-tech , quality german goods will face ever more competition on world markets . and experts agree germany can not compete simply by lowering its labor costs .

it 's long been no secret that new economic powerhouses are on the rise in asia .
but are they endangering jobs in " old " economies like germany and japan ?
not necessarily . asia , along with the united states , is quickly on its way to becoming a main pillar of the world economy .
for years , china has been making headlines with blazing growth rates and expanding wealth .
india now appears set on a similar path , as it becomes an important part of international trade and commerce . in the coming years , over 100 million people in those two nations will become a part of the global labor market .
what will that mean for comparably older economies such as japan and germany ?
will world export champ germany soon become the global leader in exporting jobs ?
is cutting wages and working longer the answer to the new challenge from asia ? quality exports when markus taube , director of the east asia institute at the university of duisburg , gives a speech about china , he essentially only needs to carry one chart with him .
regardless of what he 's talking about - foreign investment , exports , imports or gross domestic product - the graph for china points skyward .
he believes that 's evidence enough that the country far more advanced than is generally known . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tourist walks past a chinese sign as skyscrapers tower into clouds as background in shanghai .
taube uses the example of china 's exports , which are no longer confined to labor-intensive products , to make his point .
" the technological sophistication of chinese exports is much higher than most us can imagine , " he said .
" and it is effectively also much higher than many eastern european states . " in china , capitalism has been compatible with marx and lenin since 1992 .
the country even joined the world trade organization in 2001 and last year , private ownership was given equal status with that of the state in the chinese constitution .
all of that has helped push china to the pinnacle the world economy in a matter of years .
it is now the world 's fourth biggest exporter after germany , the usa and japan . taube said prospects for stable and continuous growth for years to come will ensure china is not simply the world 's sweatshop for cheap , mass-made products .
and as inexpensive labor meets high-tech , quality german goods will face ever more competition on world markets . and experts agree germany can not compete simply by lowering its labor costs .

" india has undergone a phenomenal opening since 2003 , " said peter von guretzky-cornitz , a regional analyst for hypovereinsbank . but he thinks the changes in india present more of an opportunity than a challenge to germany .
after talking about improving the country 's infrastructure for 20 years , indian officials are finally doing something about it .
and that 's good for german business . " you can see that germany will benefit as asia general decides to put a greater emphasis on quality , " von guretzky-cornitz said .

" i see strong advantages for capital goods from germany , " he said . but all the experts agreed germany will have to concentrate on future-oriented fields and areas of expertise if it wants to keep pace with the changing global economy .

so why are german schools giving music education short shrift ? classical violinist anne-sophie mutter may be one of germany 's best known ambassadors in the field of music , but lately she has rounded out her schedule of concerts , recordings and master classes with unexpected activity : promoting a music curriculum she developed for kindergartens and grade schools .
kids who don ’ t learn to read notes are like musical dyslexics , " mutter recently said in an interview with the german welt am sonntag newspaper .
she hopes her curriculum - a progressive , age based method that brings young children into early contact with music in theory and practice - will help make germany music-literate again .
" it is absurd that we go to the gym regularly to shape our hips but do n't do anything to keep our mind in form .

growing chorus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne-sophie mutter mutter 's voice is one of the most recent additions to the chorus of complaints about how german schools are failing in the area of music education .
amid ever-tighter budgets and a renewed zeal for " back to basics " education , the country has neglected to teach children how to make and appreciate music , the critics argue .
a 1999 study by the nonprofit german music council , an umbrella organization that promotes music in germany , showed that only 20 percent of german schoolchildren are taught by qualified music teachers .
the rest either got no music education or were instructed by unqualified teachers , said the council 's vice president , hans bessler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresdner kreuz choir recent polls have suggested the consequences are dramatic .
surveys have shown that german children sing worse and less frequently than they did a decade ago and they 're ignorant of their cultural patrimony .
fewer germans are music-literate , too .
mozart effect meanwhile , neurological studies - loosely grouped under the heading " mozart effect " - show a clear correlation between exposure to music and brain development , spatial and logical thinking , and academic success .
" the three important constants that the brain uses to absorb information are haptics , acoustics , and analysis , " mutter told welt am sonntag .
" all three are developed through music . ...
music should not be seen as a secondary subject , but as a basis for all other subjects . "
the sputnik effect felicitas liemersdorf , the principal of a cologne primary school , agrees .
" learning music in the school - from a qualified music teacher - is just as important as learning german or math or foreign languages .
unfortunately , society does n't really support this view . "
several decades ago , liemersdorf recalled , primary teachers needed to play an instrument as part of their degree studies .
" that all changed with sputnik , " she said .
in the era of the cold war and the space race , the focus in education switched from all-around liberal arts to science and technology .
finally , in the 1980s , the obligatory music component to education degrees was removed .
since the late 1990s , when germans were shocked by their country 's poor showing in comparative international tests , music education has lost even more ground .
any spare resources tend to be aimed at improving results in " basics , " like reading , math and foreign languages .

it will campaign to attract more music students to the teaching profession , and plans are underway to revamp archaic teacher training , he added .
a lot is riding on their success .
when music in the public schools fails , only wealthier children will have ready access to lessons .
music : key to identity ?
more important than academic benefits , " a good music education helps children understand their own identity .
they learn to understand their own personality , " bessler said .
he cited several music projects , including one recorded in last year 's documentary film " rhythm is it " - about the effects of classical music on impoverished youth in berlin - where music gave hope to people in dire straits .
" where we make music , the social climate changes .
we need this more now than ever , " bessler said .
for anne-sophie mutter , nothing less than german culture is at stake .
" in the short term , a lack of culture can leads us to spiritual and mental poverty .
in the long term , it can make a nation stupid , " mutter told welt am sonntag .
" we have to ask ourselves if a country that wo n't fund good music education for its youth is the kind of country we want to have .

wanted : music teachers in fact , bessler of the german music council notes that german schools are meant to follow what he and others say is an " excellent " music curriculum .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competitor in the " youth makes music " contest the german music council is making a public push to correct this weakness , bessler said .
it will campaign to attract more music students to the teaching profession , and plans are underway to revamp archaic teacher training , he added .
a lot is riding on their success .
when music in the public schools fails , only wealthier children will have ready access to lessons .
music : key to identity ?
more important than academic benefits , " a good music education helps children understand their own identity .
they learn to understand their own personality , " bessler said .
he cited several music projects , including one recorded in last year 's documentary film " rhythm is it " - about the effects of classical music on impoverished youth in berlin - where music gave hope to people in dire straits .
" where we make music , the social climate changes .
we need this more now than ever , " bessler said .
for anne-sophie mutter , nothing less than german culture is at stake .
" in the short term , a lack of culture can leads us to spiritual and mental poverty .
in the long term , it can make a nation stupid , " mutter told welt am sonntag .
" we have to ask ourselves if a country that wo n't fund good music education for its youth is the kind of country we want to have .

a 1999 study by the nonprofit german music council , an umbrella organization that promotes music in germany , showed that only 20 percent of german schoolchildren are taught by qualified music teachers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 11.03.2005 making germany music-literate again großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : playing and learning are one and the same when it comes to music numerous studies have shown a strong correlation between music and intellectual development .
so why are german schools giving music education short shrift ? classical violinist anne-sophie mutter may be one of germany 's best known ambassadors in the field of music , but lately she has rounded out her schedule of concerts , recordings and master classes with unexpected activity : promoting a music curriculum she developed for kindergartens and grade schools .
kids who don ’ t learn to read notes are like musical dyslexics , " mutter recently said in an interview with the german welt am sonntag newspaper .
she hopes her curriculum - a progressive , age based method that brings young children into early contact with music in theory and practice - will help make germany music-literate again .
" it is absurd that we go to the gym regularly to shape our hips but do n't do anything to keep our mind in form .
all infants are rocked and sung to , -lrb- but in school -rrb- music is no longer considered a basic need , " said mutter -lrb- photo -rrb- in the interview .
growing chorus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne-sophie mutter mutter 's voice is one of the most recent additions to the chorus of complaints about how german schools are failing in the area of music education .
amid ever-tighter budgets and a renewed zeal for " back to basics " education , the country has neglected to teach children how to make and appreciate music , the critics argue .
a 1999 study by the nonprofit german music council , an umbrella organization that promotes music in germany , showed that only 20 percent of german schoolchildren are taught by qualified music teachers .
the rest either got no music education or were instructed by unqualified teachers , said the council 's vice president , hans bessler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresdner kreuz choir recent polls have suggested the consequences are dramatic .
surveys have shown that german children sing worse and less frequently than they did a decade ago and they 're ignorant of their cultural patrimony .
fewer germans are music-literate , too .
mozart effect meanwhile , neurological studies - loosely grouped under the heading " mozart effect " - show a clear correlation between exposure to music and brain development , spatial and logical thinking , and academic success .
" the three important constants that the brain uses to absorb information are haptics , acoustics , and analysis , " mutter told welt am sonntag .
" all three are developed through music . ...
music should not be seen as a secondary subject , but as a basis for all other subjects . "
the sputnik effect felicitas liemersdorf , the principal of a cologne primary school , agrees .
" learning music in the school - from a qualified music teacher - is just as important as learning german or math or foreign languages .
unfortunately , society does n't really support this view . "
several decades ago , liemersdorf recalled , primary teachers needed to play an instrument as part of their degree studies .
" that all changed with sputnik , " she said .
in the era of the cold war and the space race , the focus in education switched from all-around liberal arts to science and technology .
finally , in the 1980s , the obligatory music component to education degrees was removed .
since the late 1990s , when germans were shocked by their country 's poor showing in comparative international tests , music education has lost even more ground .
any spare resources tend to be aimed at improving results in " basics , " like reading , math and foreign languages .
wanted : music teachers in fact , bessler of the german music council notes that german schools are meant to follow what he and others say is an " excellent " music curriculum .
but while it looks good on paper , it is almost never carried through - due to the severe shortage of trained music teachers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competitor in the " youth makes music " contest the german music council is making a public push to correct this weakness , bessler said .
it will campaign to attract more music students to the teaching profession , and plans are underway to revamp archaic teacher training , he added .
a lot is riding on their success .
when music in the public schools fails , only wealthier children will have ready access to lessons .
music : key to identity ?
more important than academic benefits , " a good music education helps children understand their own identity .
they learn to understand their own personality , " bessler said .
he cited several music projects , including one recorded in last year 's documentary film " rhythm is it " - about the effects of classical music on impoverished youth in berlin - where music gave hope to people in dire straits .
" where we make music , the social climate changes .
we need this more now than ever , " bessler said .
for anne-sophie mutter , nothing less than german culture is at stake .
" in the short term , a lack of culture can leads us to spiritual and mental poverty .
in the long term , it can make a nation stupid , " mutter told welt am sonntag .
" we have to ask ourselves if a country that wo n't fund good music education for its youth is the kind of country we want to have .

"
he has been hiding since a warrant for his arrest on multiple counts of pedophilia was issued in august 1996 .
schäfer was convicted of the charges in november 2004 along with 22 other dignidad members . " the arrest of paul schaefer is good news , " fischer said .
" his arrest will allow a comprehensive investigation all the criminal activities in the former colonia dignidad to be carried out and punishments to be handed down . "
argentine police commissioner alejandro dinisio told afp that schäfer carried no identification documents and refused to speak at the time of his arrest .
he added that police had been on his trail for six months . television reporters mobbed schäfer as an agent pushed the elderly suspect on his wheelchair into a provincial police station .
schäfer was shown on television handcuffed and smiling , and holding a bottle of soda . officials said he could be transferred to buenos aires as early as friday . child abuse and cultic practices a former corporal and medic in hitler 's nazi army , schäfer fled germany to chile in 1961 to avoid child sexual abuse charges .

schäfer was convicted of the charges in november 2004 along with 22 other dignidad members . " the arrest of paul schaefer is good news , " fischer said .

until now , it ’ s involved destroying a human embryo – a small one , of course , just a few hundred cells . but in nine months , that embryo could be a healthy human baby . not everybody is going to agree that a scientist should be allowed to do that , even if it helps us develop treatments for cancer , paralysis , and heart disease .
but now scientists are finding a way to skirt the ethical question – and keep going with their research in a way to which few would object . instead of pulling the stem cell out of an embryo , they ’ re finding ways to take single stem cells from adults – a perfectly safe procedure – and then “ reprogramming ” them so they have all the flexibility that a stem cell has , if it came from an embryo .
here ’ s how it works . some stem cells , as you may know , are useful because they can produce any cell in the body .
the right kind of stem cell – one which is “ potent ” enough – can become a blood cell , a bone cell , a nerve cell , or whatever it is you need to repair , or regrow , inside a patient ’ s body .
stem cells have different degrees of potency – that means , they have the potential to produce more or fewer different kinds of cells . the most potent kind of stem cell is called “ totipotent ” – they can grow into an entire organism , like a healthy , smiling baby . the second most potent is called “ pluripotent ” – they can become just about any kind of cell , but they can ’ t grow into a whole organism .
even less potent ones are called “ multipotent ” , “ oligopotent ” , and “ unipotent ” – they can only become one , or some kinds of cells .
cells develop along a “ programme ” – that is , as you grow up , your cells become less and less potent . at least it seemed that way to scientists ; they had always thought that as an adult , your skin cells , for example , can only produce new skin cells , and not , say , suddenly become liver cells . -lrb- otherwise , you might just start growing a liver on your arm . -rrb- but just a few years ago , a group of scientists took the right nutrients and growth factors and managed to make neuron stem cells out of adult blood stem cells – which only stayed that way for a few days . since then , scientists have been doing everything they can to figure out how this reprogramming works .
now , at the max planck institute for molecular biomedicine in munster , germany , scientists have isolated the part of the cell where the reprogramming takes place . it ’ s in the nucleus , where the genetic material is . dr. hans schöler is going to tell us now how they found it , and how that brings us a step closer to reprogramming the way we do stem cell research . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german science weekly highlight-17 a happy catastrophe in the baltic sea german science weekly highlight-16 getting in the way of faulty rna german science weekly highlight-15 hope for genetically defective hearts german science weekly highlight-14 dropping atoms from the tower of pisa german science weekly highlight-13 under the earth that 's under the ocean german science weekly highlight-12 how a nose from mainz sniffed out water on mars german science weekly highlight -11 seeing your cells in multicolour german science weekly highlight - 10 how mice choose partners by their smell .

but now scientists are finding a way to skirt the ethical question – and keep going with their research in a way to which few would object . instead of pulling the stem cell out of an embryo , they ’ re finding ways to take single stem cells from adults – a perfectly safe procedure – and then “ reprogramming ” them so they have all the flexibility that a stem cell has , if it came from an embryo .
here ’ s how it works . some stem cells , as you may know , are useful because they can produce any cell in the body .
the right kind of stem cell – one which is “ potent ” enough – can become a blood cell , a bone cell , a nerve cell , or whatever it is you need to repair , or regrow , inside a patient ’ s body .
stem cells have different degrees of potency – that means , they have the potential to produce more or fewer different kinds of cells . the most potent kind of stem cell is called “ totipotent ” – they can grow into an entire organism , like a healthy , smiling baby . the second most potent is called “ pluripotent ” – they can become just about any kind of cell , but they can ’ t grow into a whole organism .
even less potent ones are called “ multipotent ” , “ oligopotent ” , and “ unipotent ” – they can only become one , or some kinds of cells .
cells develop along a “ programme ” – that is , as you grow up , your cells become less and less potent . at least it seemed that way to scientists ; they had always thought that as an adult , your skin cells , for example , can only produce new skin cells , and not , say , suddenly become liver cells . -lrb- otherwise , you might just start growing a liver on your arm . -rrb- but just a few years ago , a group of scientists took the right nutrients and growth factors and managed to make neuron stem cells out of adult blood stem cells – which only stayed that way for a few days . since then , scientists have been doing everything they can to figure out how this reprogramming works .
now , at the max planck institute for molecular biomedicine in munster , germany , scientists have isolated the part of the cell where the reprogramming takes place . it ’ s in the nucleus , where the genetic material is . dr. hans schöler is going to tell us now how they found it , and how that brings us a step closer to reprogramming the way we do stem cell research . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german science weekly highlight-17 a happy catastrophe in the baltic sea german science weekly highlight-16 getting in the way of faulty rna german science weekly highlight-15 hope for genetically defective hearts german science weekly highlight-14 dropping atoms from the tower of pisa german science weekly highlight-13 under the earth that 's under the ocean german science weekly highlight-12 how a nose from mainz sniffed out water on mars german science weekly highlight -11 seeing your cells in multicolour german science weekly highlight - 10 how mice choose partners by their smell .

the city worked hard to restore its historic city center , left intact after the war , to its former glory , and for that reason , has become a tourist magnet in eastern germany . but beauty aside , the town has been hit hard by the unemployment , westward migration and high vacancy rates seen throughout the eastern states .

and in this , essen and görlitz came out ahead of the other candidates braunschweig , bremen , halle , karlsruhe , kassel , lübeck , potsdam and regensburg . germany is expected to pass on the recommendations to brüssels in the fall , where the final decision will be made in 2006 . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de görlitz : a tale of two cities görlitz and zgorzelec are separated by the neisse river , and the history that created the german-polish border .

the city worked hard to restore its historic city center , left intact after the war , to its former glory , and for that reason , has become a tourist magnet in eastern germany . but beauty aside , the town has been hit hard by the unemployment , westward migration and high vacancy rates seen throughout the eastern states .

the topic had been debated for years in germany , but took on a new urgency in the past few weeks after germany came under increased pressure to rein in its emboldened right-wing extremists .

in addition to sharpening the right of assembly , friday 's vote also approved changing the country 's criminal code to include a passage calling for up to three years in jail or a fine for glorification of the nazis , or justifying or downplaying the atrocities of the third reich .
" to think of right-wing extremist groups demonstrating in front of memorials for the victims of nazi crimes , either endorsing , denying , or playing down these crimes against humanity , is unbearable , " german interior minister otto schily said last month .
the bundesrat or the upper house of parliament is expected to ratify the changes within the next week .

however , germany 's opposition liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- on friday , voted against the planned beefing up of the right of assembly , saying it had doubts whether the move would work to curb far-right groups .
max stadler , domestic policy expert of the fdp , said that freedom of expression and assembly were fundamental to a democracy and that a tightening of the law was the wrong way to deal with far-right extremists .
stadler criticized that the bundestag was worrying showing itself to be increasingly prepared to violate basic rights .
he added it was probably okay in a one-off case , but simply went too far on the whole .
doubts remain over effectiveness despite the relief among most mainstream parties at friday 's decision , questions still remain over how effective the proposed sharpening of the law will prove in limiting neo-nazi groups .

others voiced doubts over whether the changes were in line with the constitution .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the cdu parliamentary group , said there was no guarantee that the new law was in step with the constitution .
" we ca n't guarantee what decision the german constitutional court could possibly come to one day , " bosbach said .
" we 're only doing what we can to give the authorities instruments to prevent demonstrations more easily . "

the topic had been debated for years in germany , but took on a new urgency in the past few weeks after germany came under increased pressure to rein in its emboldened right-wing extremists .

in addition to sharpening the right of assembly , friday 's vote also approved changing the country 's criminal code to include a passage calling for up to three years in jail or a fine for glorification of the nazis , or justifying or downplaying the atrocities of the third reich .
" to think of right-wing extremist groups demonstrating in front of memorials for the victims of nazi crimes , either endorsing , denying , or playing down these crimes against humanity , is unbearable , " german interior minister otto schily said last month .

the protesters refused to leave the craft , but shortly after the incident started they allowed other passengers and crew to get off without incident . at an early stage in the standoff a correspondent for zdf german television who spoke with one of the passengers by telephone said he had been told that no arms were aboard the plane and that no hostages were being held . the remaining passengers " all have passports from the european union , " but " they say they are of iranian origin , " cleemput said earlier . a young iranian , who spoke to reporters at brussels airport on behalf of the passengers , said the action had been under preparation for five months by a london-based iranian monarchist group , " azarakhsh . " " we all ask the leaders of the european union -lrb- not to -rrb- support the regime in iran .
we do n't ask nobody , no country , nor any power in the world to help us to change the regime .
we can do it ourselves , " said the man who identified himself as ramin . the rtl-tvi television station said the group 's demands were " political demands " linked notably to the european union 's policies with regard to iran . the german magazine der spiegel said it had received a letter from the group , which described itself as representing iranian men and women protesting against a tehran regime responsible for " torture and terror . " as the night wore on , the plane was moved from its parking gate in preparation for an " administrative " arrest of those on board , police said . peaceful resolution it was at this point that the protesters decided to give themselves up .
" we always said to the activists that they would have no problems if they decided to leave the plane , " said cleemput . in berlin , a lufthansa spokesman said the protest " had nothing to do with our company . " " they have chosen without a doubt a strange place to demonstrate , " said the spokesman , thomas ellerbeck . he said the plane was carrying 120 passengers when it left frankfurt .

the topic had been debated for years in germany , but took on a new urgency in the past few weeks after germany came under increased pressure to rein in its emboldened right-wing extremists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large neo-nazi demonstrations in dresden -lrb- photo -rrb- during the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of the city last month and further planned far-right marches at the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , had turned up the heat on policy makers .
in addition to sharpening the right of assembly , friday 's vote also approved changing the country 's criminal code to include a passage calling for up to three years in jail or a fine for glorification of the nazis , or justifying or downplaying the atrocities of the third reich .
" to think of right-wing extremist groups demonstrating in front of memorials for the victims of nazi crimes , either endorsing , denying , or playing down these crimes against humanity , is unbearable , " german interior minister otto schily said last month .
the bundesrat or the upper house of parliament is expected to ratify the changes within the next week .
a threat to democracy most parties on friday hailed the vote as a boost to democracy .
" we 'll have a few additional possibilities in the future to prevent nazi mischief on our streets and squares , " said dieter wiefelspütz , spd domestic policy expert .

27 , 2005 .
" a broad majority of the bundestag has given the victims of the nazi regime a clear signal : germany will remain alert even 60 years after auschwitz , " said silke stokar von neuforn of the green party .
however , germany 's opposition liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- on friday , voted against the planned beefing up of the right of assembly , saying it had doubts whether the move would work to curb far-right groups .
max stadler , domestic policy expert of the fdp , said that freedom of expression and assembly were fundamental to a democracy and that a tightening of the law was the wrong way to deal with far-right extremists .
stadler criticized that the bundestag was worrying showing itself to be increasingly prepared to violate basic rights .
he added it was probably okay in a one-off case , but simply went too far on the whole .
doubts remain over effectiveness despite the relief among most mainstream parties at friday 's decision , questions still remain over how effective the proposed sharpening of the law will prove in limiting neo-nazi groups .
many politicians were annoyed that the changes disregarded a cdu demand to include the brandenburg gate in the demonstration-free zone around the german reichstag .

bavarian interior minister günther beckstein criticized that the new law was " rushed and in parts half-hearted , " though it did go in the right direction .
both beckstein and german interior minister otto schily said they had doubts whether the spiking of the law could prevent the yearly neo-nazi march to the grave of rudolf hess , hitler 's deputy , in wunsiedel .
others voiced doubts over whether the changes were in line with the constitution .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the cdu parliamentary group , said there was no guarantee that the new law was in step with the constitution .
" we ca n't guarantee what decision the german constitutional court could possibly come to one day , " bosbach said .
" we 're only doing what we can to give the authorities instruments to prevent demonstrations more easily . "
earlier , fdp head guido westerwelle called the law " dilettantish " and said that neo-nazi groups could easily challenge the curbs on their right to demonstrate and had " a very good chance of success " at the constitutional court . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de seeking common ground to curb neo-nazis both the government and opposition agree that the right of assembly needs tightening to prevent neo-nazi marches at historic landmarks such as the brandenburg gate in berlin .

soon , when calls are n't bouncing off cell phone towers , they 'll be hurtling through the internet - for less than half the price of a " normal " call . dozens of exhibitors at cebit , the world 's largest it fair , which opened in hanover on thursday , are ready to outfit consumers with headsets , switchboards , phones and answering machines for the day when voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- replaces analog and isdn phone lines . andreas gauger , head of 1 & 1 , germany 's second largest dsl provider , after deutsche telekom , called 2005 " the year that will go down in history for breaking the border between the internet and telephony . " dozens of companies in germany offer private and corporate internet telephony services and the cheaper calls that accompany it . after subscribing to a particular service , users can usually call within that network for free and calls to the german fixed-line network normally costs between one and two cents a minute .
the hamburg internet provider freenet has even done away with those costs for some of its voip packages . germany currently has about six million people using dsl connections to access the internet and 330,000 of them are taking advantage of their high-speed connections to make telephone calls , according to the association of telecommunications providers . " dsl is the technology that made voice over ip possible , " said karsten krug of avm , the producer of the widely popular fritz line of devices used to connect computers to high-speed internet services . telekom joins in voip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile communications providers like o2 are also interested in making voip work for them transferring phone calls to the internet could spell trouble for deutsche telekom , which still keeps the vast majority of germans connected , if people begin to shy away from the former monopoly 's ubiquitous analog and isdn phone systems . " internet telephony is not going to bring a large growth in profits , " said rainer beaujean , head of t-online , the deutsche telekom subsidiary responsible for internet connections .
" but it is important to keep customers . " also important to customers is being able to guarantee a certain quality of service , said carsten lachmann , who manned a t-systems - another deutsche telekom subsidiary - booth at cebit . " there are no guarantees on the internet , " said lachmann , who sets up voip calling for corporate customers .
" anyone who tells you different is lying .
if everyone on the network starts calling or downloading at the same time there are going to be problems . " dsl will keep speeding up a typical voip call requires an upstream data supply of about 100 kbps , while today 's dsl connections offer between 128 kbps and 392 kbps .
deutsche telekom is planning to double download speeds to 6 megabits per second across germany by the middle of this year and speed things up to 25 mbps in some major german cities by 2006 . " voice over ip already has the quality of analog phones , " krug of avm said .
" now , by increasing bandwidth , we are able to improve the quality even more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voip phones look just like their analog counterparts .

it 's long been no secret that new economic powerhouses are on the rise in asia .
but are they endangering jobs in " old " economies like germany and japan ?
not necessarily . asia , along with the united states , is quickly on its way to becoming a main pillar of the world economy .
for years , china has been making headlines with blazing growth rates and expanding wealth .
india now appears set on a similar path , as it becomes an important part of international trade and commerce . in the coming years , over 100 million people in those two nations will become a part of the global labor market .
what will that mean for comparably older economies such as japan and germany ?
will world export champ germany soon become the global leader in exporting jobs ?
is cutting wages and working longer the answer to the new challenge from asia ? quality exports when markus taube , director of the east asia institute at the university of duisburg , gives a speech about china , he essentially only needs to carry one chart with him .
regardless of what he 's talking about - foreign investment , exports , imports or gross domestic product - the graph for china points skyward .
he believes that 's evidence enough that the country far more advanced than is generally known . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tourist walks past a chinese sign as skyscrapers tower into clouds as background in shanghai .
taube uses the example of china 's exports , which are no longer confined to labor-intensive products , to make his point .
" the technological sophistication of chinese exports is much higher than most us can imagine , " he said .
" and it is effectively also much higher than many eastern european states . " in china , capitalism has been compatible with marx and lenin since 1992 .
the country even joined the world trade organization in 2001 and last year , private ownership was given equal status with that of the state in the chinese constitution .
all of that has helped push china to the pinnacle the world economy in a matter of years .
it is now the world 's fourth biggest exporter after germany , the usa and japan . taube said prospects for stable and continuous growth for years to come will ensure china is not simply the world 's sweatshop for cheap , mass-made products .
and as inexpensive labor meets high-tech , quality german goods will face ever more competition on world markets . and experts agree germany can not compete simply by lowering its labor costs .
whereas hourly wages for manufactured goods in china cost a mere $ 0.80 -lrb- € 0.60 -rrb- , in the united states its $ 21 and in germany over $ 30 . india awakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's ascent has been expected for years , but only recently , another asian giant has awakened : india .
seeing its neighbor sprint ahead as it continued to flounder , india was spurned on to undertake economy reforms recently .
in only a short time , the country has become a global player in the outsourcing and high-tech industries . " india has undergone a phenomenal opening since 2003 , " said peter von guretzky-cornitz , a regional analyst for hypovereinsbank . but he thinks the changes in india present more of an opportunity than a challenge to germany .
after talking about improving the country 's infrastructure for 20 years , indian officials are finally doing something about it .
and that 's good for german business . " you can see that germany will benefit as asia general decides to put a greater emphasis on quality , " von guretzky-cornitz said .
" an indian or chinese who drives a bmw privately now wants a backhoe or a crane or a cement mixer that ’ s from switzerland , germany or austria instead of a copy of a european machine from korea . " good for germany that 's obviously good for german exporters , but what about german investment in booming asian economies ?
as the money goes , wo n't that also move jobs abroad ?
not according to von guretzky-cornitz , who said much of what is produced in asia is meant for those markets alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael finger , an economist at the wto in geneva , even said growth in asia was like " manna from heaven " as german firm profit from those expanding markets .

it 's long been no secret that new economic powerhouses are on the rise in asia .
but are they endangering jobs in " old " economies like germany and japan ?
not necessarily . asia , along with the united states , is quickly on its way to becoming a main pillar of the world economy .
for years , china has been making headlines with blazing growth rates and expanding wealth .
india now appears set on a similar path , as it becomes an important part of international trade and commerce . in the coming years , over 100 million people in those two nations will become a part of the global labor market .
what will that mean for comparably older economies such as japan and germany ?
will world export champ germany soon become the global leader in exporting jobs ?
is cutting wages and working longer the answer to the new challenge from asia ? quality exports when markus taube , director of the east asia institute at the university of duisburg , gives a speech about china , he essentially only needs to carry one chart with him .
regardless of what he 's talking about - foreign investment , exports , imports or gross domestic product - the graph for china points skyward .
he believes that 's evidence enough that the country far more advanced than is generally known . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tourist walks past a chinese sign as skyscrapers tower into clouds as background in shanghai .
taube uses the example of china 's exports , which are no longer confined to labor-intensive products , to make his point .
" the technological sophistication of chinese exports is much higher than most us can imagine , " he said .
" and it is effectively also much higher than many eastern european states . " in china , capitalism has been compatible with marx and lenin since 1992 .
the country even joined the world trade organization in 2001 and last year , private ownership was given equal status with that of the state in the chinese constitution .
all of that has helped push china to the pinnacle the world economy in a matter of years .
it is now the world 's fourth biggest exporter after germany , the usa and japan . taube said prospects for stable and continuous growth for years to come will ensure china is not simply the world 's sweatshop for cheap , mass-made products .
and as inexpensive labor meets high-tech , quality german goods will face ever more competition on world markets . and experts agree germany can not compete simply by lowering its labor costs .

" india has undergone a phenomenal opening since 2003 , " said peter von guretzky-cornitz , a regional analyst for hypovereinsbank . but he thinks the changes in india present more of an opportunity than a challenge to germany .
after talking about improving the country 's infrastructure for 20 years , indian officials are finally doing something about it .

not necessarily . asia , along with the united states , is quickly on its way to becoming a main pillar of the world economy .
for years , china has been making headlines with blazing growth rates and expanding wealth .
india now appears set on a similar path , as it becomes an important part of international trade and commerce . in the coming years , over 100 million people in those two nations will become a part of the global labor market .

he believes that 's evidence enough that the country far more advanced than is generally known . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tourist walks past a chinese sign as skyscrapers tower into clouds as background in shanghai .
taube uses the example of china 's exports , which are no longer confined to labor-intensive products , to make his point .

"
he has been hiding since a warrant for his arrest on multiple counts of pedophilia was issued in august 1996 .
schäfer was convicted of the charges in november 2004 along with 22 other dignidad members . " the arrest of paul schaefer is good news , " fischer said .
" his arrest will allow a comprehensive investigation all the criminal activities in the former colonia dignidad to be carried out and punishments to be handed down . "
argentine police commissioner alejandro dinisio told afp that schäfer carried no identification documents and refused to speak at the time of his arrest .
he added that police had been on his trail for six months . television reporters mobbed schäfer as an agent pushed the elderly suspect on his wheelchair into a provincial police station .
schäfer was shown on television handcuffed and smiling , and holding a bottle of soda . officials said he could be transferred to buenos aires as early as friday . child abuse and cultic practices a former corporal and medic in hitler 's nazi army , schäfer fled germany to chile in 1961 to avoid child sexual abuse charges .
he established the self-sufficient colonia dignidad , also called " villa baviera , " in the mountains near the city of parral , some 350 kilometers -lrb- 218 miles -rrb- south of santiago along with other german immigrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the main gate of " colonia dignidad " in 1988 surrounded by barbed wire and electric fences and protected by barricades , the community , populated largely by germans , adhered to a strict discipline and remained cut off from the rest of chile .
a mixture of cultic practices such as exorcising devils and psychological terror were said to rampant in the sect . in 1996 a number of former residents testified that schäfer systematically abused the colony 's young children , many of whom were taken from the parents at birth .
accusations of forced labor and other forms of maltreatment also surfaced at the time . a torture center and school chilean officials also want schäfer in connection with torture during the 1973-1990 pinochet dictatorship .
the colony apparently served as a torture center for the chilean secret service as well as a torture school where former gestapo and nazi officers gave lessons . investigators say that political prisoners , including former leftist leader alvaro vallejos villagran - arrested by pinochet agents in may 1974 - vanished after being sent to colonia dignidad . a former member of pinochet 's secret police gave testimony stating that he knew vallejos villagran was taken alive to dignidad . schäfer and the colony are believed to have enjoyed pinochet 's protection right until the end of his dictatorship in 1990 . disappearance of professor police also want to question schäfer about the 1985 disappearance of boris weisfeiler , an american jewish mathematics professor of russian origin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators outside " colonia dignidad " investigators believe weisfeiler was picked up by a military border patrol while he was backpacking in the region on suspicion of being a spy and dropped off at dignidad . weisfeiler 's sister olga said there were reports by dignidad residents of seeing him alive up to two years later . schäfer 's arrest on thursday sparked relief among the present residents of the colony .
about 300 people , mainly germans , still live there . " i believe , we 're all happy here today .
i definitely am - we had to suffer too much , " one of them told chilean television . to accelerate schäfer 's departure , the chilean interior minister asked his argentine counterpart to kick him out of argentina and avoid going to court to ask for an extradition , which could delay the case with appeals . officials praised the joint action on thursday by argentine and chilean police which led to schäfer 's arrest . " we are proud of this arrest , " said a justice spokesman in santiago de chile .

"
he has been hiding since a warrant for his arrest on multiple counts of pedophilia was issued in august 1996 .
schäfer was convicted of the charges in november 2004 along with 22 other dignidad members . " the arrest of paul schaefer is good news , " fischer said .
" his arrest will allow a comprehensive investigation all the criminal activities in the former colonia dignidad to be carried out and punishments to be handed down . "
argentine police commissioner alejandro dinisio told afp that schäfer carried no identification documents and refused to speak at the time of his arrest .
he added that police had been on his trail for six months . television reporters mobbed schäfer as an agent pushed the elderly suspect on his wheelchair into a provincial police station .
schäfer was shown on television handcuffed and smiling , and holding a bottle of soda . officials said he could be transferred to buenos aires as early as friday . child abuse and cultic practices a former corporal and medic in hitler 's nazi army , schäfer fled germany to chile in 1961 to avoid child sexual abuse charges .
he established the self-sufficient colonia dignidad , also called " villa baviera , " in the mountains near the city of parral , some 350 kilometers -lrb- 218 miles -rrb- south of santiago along with other german immigrants . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the main gate of " colonia dignidad " in 1988 surrounded by barbed wire and electric fences and protected by barricades , the community , populated largely by germans , adhered to a strict discipline and remained cut off from the rest of chile .

until now , it ’ s involved destroying a human embryo – a small one , of course , just a few hundred cells . but in nine months , that embryo could be a healthy human baby . not everybody is going to agree that a scientist should be allowed to do that , even if it helps us develop treatments for cancer , paralysis , and heart disease .
but now scientists are finding a way to skirt the ethical question – and keep going with their research in a way to which few would object . instead of pulling the stem cell out of an embryo , they ’ re finding ways to take single stem cells from adults – a perfectly safe procedure – and then “ reprogramming ” them so they have all the flexibility that a stem cell has , if it came from an embryo .
here ’ s how it works . some stem cells , as you may know , are useful because they can produce any cell in the body .
the right kind of stem cell – one which is “ potent ” enough – can become a blood cell , a bone cell , a nerve cell , or whatever it is you need to repair , or regrow , inside a patient ’ s body .
stem cells have different degrees of potency – that means , they have the potential to produce more or fewer different kinds of cells . the most potent kind of stem cell is called “ totipotent ” – they can grow into an entire organism , like a healthy , smiling baby . the second most potent is called “ pluripotent ” – they can become just about any kind of cell , but they can ’ t grow into a whole organism .
even less potent ones are called “ multipotent ” , “ oligopotent ” , and “ unipotent ” – they can only become one , or some kinds of cells .
cells develop along a “ programme ” – that is , as you grow up , your cells become less and less potent . at least it seemed that way to scientists ; they had always thought that as an adult , your skin cells , for example , can only produce new skin cells , and not , say , suddenly become liver cells . -lrb- otherwise , you might just start growing a liver on your arm . -rrb- but just a few years ago , a group of scientists took the right nutrients and growth factors and managed to make neuron stem cells out of adult blood stem cells – which only stayed that way for a few days . since then , scientists have been doing everything they can to figure out how this reprogramming works .
now , at the max planck institute for molecular biomedicine in munster , germany , scientists have isolated the part of the cell where the reprogramming takes place . it ’ s in the nucleus , where the genetic material is . dr. hans schöler is going to tell us now how they found it , and how that brings us a step closer to reprogramming the way we do stem cell research . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german science weekly highlight-17 a happy catastrophe in the baltic sea german science weekly highlight-16 getting in the way of faulty rna german science weekly highlight-15 hope for genetically defective hearts german science weekly highlight-14 dropping atoms from the tower of pisa german science weekly highlight-13 under the earth that 's under the ocean german science weekly highlight-12 how a nose from mainz sniffed out water on mars german science weekly highlight -11 seeing your cells in multicolour german science weekly highlight - 10 how mice choose partners by their smell .

cells develop along a “ programme ” – that is , as you grow up , your cells become less and less potent . at least it seemed that way to scientists ; they had always thought that as an adult , your skin cells , for example , can only produce new skin cells , and not , say , suddenly become liver cells . -lrb- otherwise , you might just start growing a liver on your arm . -rrb- but just a few years ago , a group of scientists took the right nutrients and growth factors and managed to make neuron stem cells out of adult blood stem cells – which only stayed that way for a few days . since then , scientists have been doing everything they can to figure out how this reprogramming works .
now , at the max planck institute for molecular biomedicine in munster , germany , scientists have isolated the part of the cell where the reprogramming takes place . it ’ s in the nucleus , where the genetic material is . dr. hans schöler is going to tell us now how they found it , and how that brings us a step closer to reprogramming the way we do stem cell research . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german science weekly highlight-17 a happy catastrophe in the baltic sea german science weekly highlight-16 getting in the way of faulty rna german science weekly highlight-15 hope for genetically defective hearts german science weekly highlight-14 dropping atoms from the tower of pisa german science weekly highlight-13 under the earth that 's under the ocean german science weekly highlight-12 how a nose from mainz sniffed out water on mars german science weekly highlight -11 seeing your cells in multicolour german science weekly highlight - 10 how mice choose partners by their smell .

until now , it ’ s involved destroying a human embryo – a small one , of course , just a few hundred cells . but in nine months , that embryo could be a healthy human baby . not everybody is going to agree that a scientist should be allowed to do that , even if it helps us develop treatments for cancer , paralysis , and heart disease .
but now scientists are finding a way to skirt the ethical question – and keep going with their research in a way to which few would object . instead of pulling the stem cell out of an embryo , they ’ re finding ways to take single stem cells from adults – a perfectly safe procedure – and then “ reprogramming ” them so they have all the flexibility that a stem cell has , if it came from an embryo .
here ’ s how it works . some stem cells , as you may know , are useful because they can produce any cell in the body .
the right kind of stem cell – one which is “ potent ” enough – can become a blood cell , a bone cell , a nerve cell , or whatever it is you need to repair , or regrow , inside a patient ’ s body .

ahead of a parliamentary budget committee meeting next week , members of the green party are refusing a costly project which would make german participation in the air defense air system meads irreversible . german companies and social democratic defense minister peter struck view meads as being strategically important , as it would be the only nato-commissioned defense project carried out jointly by the united states and european nations , notably germany and italy . according to nato , the medium extended air defense system would replace current hawk and patriot interceptors .
the initiators of meads credit it with the ability to protect forces and fixed installations against attacks by current and next-generation tactical ballistic missiles .
it ’ s been promised that meads as a surface-to-air system will have greater firepower and require less manpower than its predecessors . but do we need it ? but whether a new system is required at all for such a specific purpose remains a highly contested question among german parliamentarians .
meads started as a think-tank project between the us , italy and germany .
the system is meant to be fully operational by 2012 , with the us to provide 58 percent , germany 25 percent and italy 17 percent of the financing , the companies involved - lockheed martin , the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and mbda italy - sense a lucrative business opportunity .

the us and italy have already signed the meads contract and have been waiting for germany to follow suit . greens mps fear that the cost of the project will cause the meager national defense budget to burst at its seams .
but hans-peter bartels , a social democratic defense expert , argues that the cost will be offset by the opportunities that meads offers to german industry . “ germany is supposed to play a major role in the development of the radar system for meads , " bartels said .
" german industry stands to profit considerably from its participation in the project .
the expertise it already has and will gain in this field will no doubt come in handy in similar or follow-up projects . ” eads managers argue that the government in berlin can not afford to opt out of the project .
spokesman alexander reinhardt estimated that at least 450 jobs are at stake .

ahead of a parliamentary budget committee meeting next week , members of the green party are refusing a costly project which would make german participation in the air defense air system meads irreversible . german companies and social democratic defense minister peter struck view meads as being strategically important , as it would be the only nato-commissioned defense project carried out jointly by the united states and european nations , notably germany and italy . according to nato , the medium extended air defense system would replace current hawk and patriot interceptors .
the initiators of meads credit it with the ability to protect forces and fixed installations against attacks by current and next-generation tactical ballistic missiles .
it ’ s been promised that meads as a surface-to-air system will have greater firepower and require less manpower than its predecessors . but do we need it ? but whether a new system is required at all for such a specific purpose remains a highly contested question among german parliamentarians .
meads started as a think-tank project between the us , italy and germany .
the system is meant to be fully operational by 2012 , with the us to provide 58 percent , germany 25 percent and italy 17 percent of the financing , the companies involved - lockheed martin , the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and mbda italy - sense a lucrative business opportunity .
but german greens parliamentarian hans-christian ströbele said the plan is more about politics than about being a military necessity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-christian ströbele “ i have the impression that the military use of the system is no longer at the heart of those who are pushing meads here , " ströbele -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" this goes for both the development of the system and the ensuing purchase of meads launchers by germany .
it seems it ’ s rather a question of not spoiling transatlantic relations again after the iraq war and putting nato in an awkward position . ” waiting on germany defense minister struck has been unable to drum up unanimous support for the project , which he aims to push through during a meeting of the parliamentary budget committee on march 16 .
the us and italy have already signed the meads contract and have been waiting for germany to follow suit . greens mps fear that the cost of the project will cause the meager national defense budget to burst at its seams .
but hans-peter bartels , a social democratic defense expert , argues that the cost will be offset by the opportunities that meads offers to german industry . “ germany is supposed to play a major role in the development of the radar system for meads , " bartels said .
" german industry stands to profit considerably from its participation in the project .
the expertise it already has and will gain in this field will no doubt come in handy in similar or follow-up projects . ” eads managers argue that the government in berlin can not afford to opt out of the project .
spokesman alexander reinhardt estimated that at least 450 jobs are at stake .
in the end , the greens , as the government 's junior coalition partner may not be prepared to thwart the project altogether .
but they could insist that germany order fewer than the 12 to 24 meads units planned by the defense minister . hardy graupner -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin to spend billion on missile defense germany reportedly plans to spend over € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.25 billion -rrb- on the development of a new transatlantic anti-aircraft system over the next eight years .

the topic had been debated for years in germany , but took on a new urgency in the past few weeks after germany came under increased pressure to rein in its emboldened right-wing extremists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large neo-nazi demonstrations in dresden -lrb- photo -rrb- during the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of the city last month and further planned far-right marches at the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , had turned up the heat on policy makers .
in addition to sharpening the right of assembly , friday 's vote also approved changing the country 's criminal code to include a passage calling for up to three years in jail or a fine for glorification of the nazis , or justifying or downplaying the atrocities of the third reich .
" to think of right-wing extremist groups demonstrating in front of memorials for the victims of nazi crimes , either endorsing , denying , or playing down these crimes against humanity , is unbearable , " german interior minister otto schily said last month .
the bundesrat or the upper house of parliament is expected to ratify the changes within the next week .
a threat to democracy most parties on friday hailed the vote as a boost to democracy .
" we 'll have a few additional possibilities in the future to prevent nazi mischief on our streets and squares , " said dieter wiefelspütz , spd domestic policy expert .

27 , 2005 .
" a broad majority of the bundestag has given the victims of the nazi regime a clear signal : germany will remain alert even 60 years after auschwitz , " said silke stokar von neuforn of the green party .
however , germany 's opposition liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- on friday , voted against the planned beefing up of the right of assembly , saying it had doubts whether the move would work to curb far-right groups .
max stadler , domestic policy expert of the fdp , said that freedom of expression and assembly were fundamental to a democracy and that a tightening of the law was the wrong way to deal with far-right extremists .
stadler criticized that the bundestag was worrying showing itself to be increasingly prepared to violate basic rights .
he added it was probably okay in a one-off case , but simply went too far on the whole .
doubts remain over effectiveness despite the relief among most mainstream parties at friday 's decision , questions still remain over how effective the proposed sharpening of the law will prove in limiting neo-nazi groups .
many politicians were annoyed that the changes disregarded a cdu demand to include the brandenburg gate in the demonstration-free zone around the german reichstag .

bavarian interior minister günther beckstein criticized that the new law was " rushed and in parts half-hearted , " though it did go in the right direction .
both beckstein and german interior minister otto schily said they had doubts whether the spiking of the law could prevent the yearly neo-nazi march to the grave of rudolf hess , hitler 's deputy , in wunsiedel .
others voiced doubts over whether the changes were in line with the constitution .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the cdu parliamentary group , said there was no guarantee that the new law was in step with the constitution .
" we ca n't guarantee what decision the german constitutional court could possibly come to one day , " bosbach said .
" we 're only doing what we can to give the authorities instruments to prevent demonstrations more easily . "
earlier , fdp head guido westerwelle called the law " dilettantish " and said that neo-nazi groups could easily challenge the curbs on their right to demonstrate and had " a very good chance of success " at the constitutional court . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de seeking common ground to curb neo-nazis both the government and opposition agree that the right of assembly needs tightening to prevent neo-nazi marches at historic landmarks such as the brandenburg gate in berlin .

the topic had been debated for years in germany , but took on a new urgency in the past few weeks after germany came under increased pressure to rein in its emboldened right-wing extremists .

in addition to sharpening the right of assembly , friday 's vote also approved changing the country 's criminal code to include a passage calling for up to three years in jail or a fine for glorification of the nazis , or justifying or downplaying the atrocities of the third reich .

the eu is negotiating with the islamic state 's government , notably offering the prospect of a trade agreement in exchange for guarantees about its nuclear program . the plane had arrived from frankfurt on thursday afternoon .
the protesters refused to leave the craft , but shortly after the incident started they allowed other passengers and crew to get off without incident . at an early stage in the standoff a correspondent for zdf german television who spoke with one of the passengers by telephone said he had been told that no arms were aboard the plane and that no hostages were being held . the remaining passengers " all have passports from the european union , " but " they say they are of iranian origin , " cleemput said earlier . a young iranian , who spoke to reporters at brussels airport on behalf of the passengers , said the action had been under preparation for five months by a london-based iranian monarchist group , " azarakhsh . " " we all ask the leaders of the european union -lrb- not to -rrb- support the regime in iran .
we do n't ask nobody , no country , nor any power in the world to help us to change the regime .
we can do it ourselves , " said the man who identified himself as ramin . the rtl-tvi television station said the group 's demands were " political demands " linked notably to the european union 's policies with regard to iran . the german magazine der spiegel said it had received a letter from the group , which described itself as representing iranian men and women protesting against a tehran regime responsible for " torture and terror . " as the night wore on , the plane was moved from its parking gate in preparation for an " administrative " arrest of those on board , police said . peaceful resolution it was at this point that the protesters decided to give themselves up .
" we always said to the activists that they would have no problems if they decided to leave the plane , " said cleemput . in berlin , a lufthansa spokesman said the protest " had nothing to do with our company . " " they have chosen without a doubt a strange place to demonstrate , " said the spokesman , thomas ellerbeck . he said the plane was carrying 120 passengers when it left frankfurt .

so why are german schools giving music education short shrift ? classical violinist anne-sophie mutter may be one of germany 's best known ambassadors in the field of music , but lately she has rounded out her schedule of concerts , recordings and master classes with unexpected activity : promoting a music curriculum she developed for kindergartens and grade schools .
kids who don ’ t learn to read notes are like musical dyslexics , " mutter recently said in an interview with the german welt am sonntag newspaper .
she hopes her curriculum - a progressive , age based method that brings young children into early contact with music in theory and practice - will help make germany music-literate again .
" it is absurd that we go to the gym regularly to shape our hips but do n't do anything to keep our mind in form .
all infants are rocked and sung to , -lrb- but in school -rrb- music is no longer considered a basic need , " said mutter -lrb- photo -rrb- in the interview .
growing chorus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne-sophie mutter mutter 's voice is one of the most recent additions to the chorus of complaints about how german schools are failing in the area of music education .
amid ever-tighter budgets and a renewed zeal for " back to basics " education , the country has neglected to teach children how to make and appreciate music , the critics argue .
a 1999 study by the nonprofit german music council , an umbrella organization that promotes music in germany , showed that only 20 percent of german schoolchildren are taught by qualified music teachers .
the rest either got no music education or were instructed by unqualified teachers , said the council 's vice president , hans bessler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresdner kreuz choir recent polls have suggested the consequences are dramatic .
surveys have shown that german children sing worse and less frequently than they did a decade ago and they 're ignorant of their cultural patrimony .
fewer germans are music-literate , too .
mozart effect meanwhile , neurological studies - loosely grouped under the heading " mozart effect " - show a clear correlation between exposure to music and brain development , spatial and logical thinking , and academic success .
" the three important constants that the brain uses to absorb information are haptics , acoustics , and analysis , " mutter told welt am sonntag .
" all three are developed through music . ...
music should not be seen as a secondary subject , but as a basis for all other subjects . "
the sputnik effect felicitas liemersdorf , the principal of a cologne primary school , agrees .
" learning music in the school - from a qualified music teacher - is just as important as learning german or math or foreign languages .
unfortunately , society does n't really support this view . "
several decades ago , liemersdorf recalled , primary teachers needed to play an instrument as part of their degree studies .
" that all changed with sputnik , " she said .
in the era of the cold war and the space race , the focus in education switched from all-around liberal arts to science and technology .
finally , in the 1980s , the obligatory music component to education degrees was removed .
since the late 1990s , when germans were shocked by their country 's poor showing in comparative international tests , music education has lost even more ground .
any spare resources tend to be aimed at improving results in " basics , " like reading , math and foreign languages .
wanted : music teachers in fact , bessler of the german music council notes that german schools are meant to follow what he and others say is an " excellent " music curriculum .
but while it looks good on paper , it is almost never carried through - due to the severe shortage of trained music teachers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competitor in the " youth makes music " contest the german music council is making a public push to correct this weakness , bessler said .
it will campaign to attract more music students to the teaching profession , and plans are underway to revamp archaic teacher training , he added .
a lot is riding on their success .
when music in the public schools fails , only wealthier children will have ready access to lessons .
music : key to identity ?
more important than academic benefits , " a good music education helps children understand their own identity .
they learn to understand their own personality , " bessler said .
he cited several music projects , including one recorded in last year 's documentary film " rhythm is it " - about the effects of classical music on impoverished youth in berlin - where music gave hope to people in dire straits .
" where we make music , the social climate changes .
we need this more now than ever , " bessler said .
for anne-sophie mutter , nothing less than german culture is at stake .
" in the short term , a lack of culture can leads us to spiritual and mental poverty .
in the long term , it can make a nation stupid , " mutter told welt am sonntag .
" we have to ask ourselves if a country that wo n't fund good music education for its youth is the kind of country we want to have .

the topic had been debated for years in germany , but took on a new urgency in the past few weeks after germany came under increased pressure to rein in its emboldened right-wing extremists .

in addition to sharpening the right of assembly , friday 's vote also approved changing the country 's criminal code to include a passage calling for up to three years in jail or a fine for glorification of the nazis , or justifying or downplaying the atrocities of the third reich .
" to think of right-wing extremist groups demonstrating in front of memorials for the victims of nazi crimes , either endorsing , denying , or playing down these crimes against humanity , is unbearable , " german interior minister otto schily said last month .

he added it was probably okay in a one-off case , but simply went too far on the whole .

others voiced doubts over whether the changes were in line with the constitution .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the cdu parliamentary group , said there was no guarantee that the new law was in step with the constitution .
" we ca n't guarantee what decision the german constitutional court could possibly come to one day , " bosbach said .
" we 're only doing what we can to give the authorities instruments to prevent demonstrations more easily . "

so why are german schools giving music education short shrift ? classical violinist anne-sophie mutter may be one of germany 's best known ambassadors in the field of music , but lately she has rounded out her schedule of concerts , recordings and master classes with unexpected activity : promoting a music curriculum she developed for kindergartens and grade schools .
kids who don ’ t learn to read notes are like musical dyslexics , " mutter recently said in an interview with the german welt am sonntag newspaper .
she hopes her curriculum - a progressive , age based method that brings young children into early contact with music in theory and practice - will help make germany music-literate again .
" it is absurd that we go to the gym regularly to shape our hips but do n't do anything to keep our mind in form .
all infants are rocked and sung to , -lrb- but in school -rrb- music is no longer considered a basic need , " said mutter -lrb- photo -rrb- in the interview .
growing chorus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anne-sophie mutter mutter 's voice is one of the most recent additions to the chorus of complaints about how german schools are failing in the area of music education .
amid ever-tighter budgets and a renewed zeal for " back to basics " education , the country has neglected to teach children how to make and appreciate music , the critics argue .
a 1999 study by the nonprofit german music council , an umbrella organization that promotes music in germany , showed that only 20 percent of german schoolchildren are taught by qualified music teachers .
the rest either got no music education or were instructed by unqualified teachers , said the council 's vice president , hans bessler .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dresdner kreuz choir recent polls have suggested the consequences are dramatic .
surveys have shown that german children sing worse and less frequently than they did a decade ago and they 're ignorant of their cultural patrimony .
fewer germans are music-literate , too .
mozart effect meanwhile , neurological studies - loosely grouped under the heading " mozart effect " - show a clear correlation between exposure to music and brain development , spatial and logical thinking , and academic success .
" the three important constants that the brain uses to absorb information are haptics , acoustics , and analysis , " mutter told welt am sonntag .
" all three are developed through music . ...
music should not be seen as a secondary subject , but as a basis for all other subjects . "
the sputnik effect felicitas liemersdorf , the principal of a cologne primary school , agrees .
" learning music in the school - from a qualified music teacher - is just as important as learning german or math or foreign languages .
unfortunately , society does n't really support this view . "
several decades ago , liemersdorf recalled , primary teachers needed to play an instrument as part of their degree studies .
" that all changed with sputnik , " she said .
in the era of the cold war and the space race , the focus in education switched from all-around liberal arts to science and technology .
finally , in the 1980s , the obligatory music component to education degrees was removed .
since the late 1990s , when germans were shocked by their country 's poor showing in comparative international tests , music education has lost even more ground .
any spare resources tend to be aimed at improving results in " basics , " like reading , math and foreign languages .
wanted : music teachers in fact , bessler of the german music council notes that german schools are meant to follow what he and others say is an " excellent " music curriculum .
but while it looks good on paper , it is almost never carried through - due to the severe shortage of trained music teachers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competitor in the " youth makes music " contest the german music council is making a public push to correct this weakness , bessler said .
it will campaign to attract more music students to the teaching profession , and plans are underway to revamp archaic teacher training , he added .
a lot is riding on their success .
when music in the public schools fails , only wealthier children will have ready access to lessons .
music : key to identity ?
more important than academic benefits , " a good music education helps children understand their own identity .
they learn to understand their own personality , " bessler said .
he cited several music projects , including one recorded in last year 's documentary film " rhythm is it " - about the effects of classical music on impoverished youth in berlin - where music gave hope to people in dire straits .
" where we make music , the social climate changes .
we need this more now than ever , " bessler said .
for anne-sophie mutter , nothing less than german culture is at stake .
" in the short term , a lack of culture can leads us to spiritual and mental poverty .
in the long term , it can make a nation stupid , " mutter told welt am sonntag .
" we have to ask ourselves if a country that wo n't fund good music education for its youth is the kind of country we want to have .

wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the cdu parliamentary group , said there was no guarantee that the new law was in step with the constitution .
" we ca n't guarantee what decision the german constitutional court could possibly come to one day , " bosbach said .
" we 're only doing what we can to give the authorities instruments to prevent demonstrations more easily . "

soon , when calls are n't bouncing off cell phone towers , they 'll be hurtling through the internet - for less than half the price of a " normal " call . dozens of exhibitors at cebit , the world 's largest it fair , which opened in hanover on thursday , are ready to outfit consumers with headsets , switchboards , phones and answering machines for the day when voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- replaces analog and isdn phone lines . andreas gauger , head of 1 & 1 , germany 's second largest dsl provider , after deutsche telekom , called 2005 " the year that will go down in history for breaking the border between the internet and telephony . " dozens of companies in germany offer private and corporate internet telephony services and the cheaper calls that accompany it . after subscribing to a particular service , users can usually call within that network for free and calls to the german fixed-line network normally costs between one and two cents a minute .
the hamburg internet provider freenet has even done away with those costs for some of its voip packages . germany currently has about six million people using dsl connections to access the internet and 330,000 of them are taking advantage of their high-speed connections to make telephone calls , according to the association of telecommunications providers . " dsl is the technology that made voice over ip possible , " said karsten krug of avm , the producer of the widely popular fritz line of devices used to connect computers to high-speed internet services . telekom joins in voip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile communications providers like o2 are also interested in making voip work for them transferring phone calls to the internet could spell trouble for deutsche telekom , which still keeps the vast majority of germans connected , if people begin to shy away from the former monopoly 's ubiquitous analog and isdn phone systems . " internet telephony is not going to bring a large growth in profits , " said rainer beaujean , head of t-online , the deutsche telekom subsidiary responsible for internet connections .
" but it is important to keep customers . " also important to customers is being able to guarantee a certain quality of service , said carsten lachmann , who manned a t-systems - another deutsche telekom subsidiary - booth at cebit . " there are no guarantees on the internet , " said lachmann , who sets up voip calling for corporate customers .

soon , when calls are n't bouncing off cell phone towers , they 'll be hurtling through the internet - for less than half the price of a " normal " call . dozens of exhibitors at cebit , the world 's largest it fair , which opened in hanover on thursday , are ready to outfit consumers with headsets , switchboards , phones and answering machines for the day when voice over internet protocol -lrb- voip -rrb- replaces analog and isdn phone lines . andreas gauger , head of 1 & 1 , germany 's second largest dsl provider , after deutsche telekom , called 2005 " the year that will go down in history for breaking the border between the internet and telephony . " dozens of companies in germany offer private and corporate internet telephony services and the cheaper calls that accompany it . after subscribing to a particular service , users can usually call within that network for free and calls to the german fixed-line network normally costs between one and two cents a minute .
the hamburg internet provider freenet has even done away with those costs for some of its voip packages . germany currently has about six million people using dsl connections to access the internet and 330,000 of them are taking advantage of their high-speed connections to make telephone calls , according to the association of telecommunications providers . " dsl is the technology that made voice over ip possible , " said karsten krug of avm , the producer of the widely popular fritz line of devices used to connect computers to high-speed internet services . telekom joins in voip bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile communications providers like o2 are also interested in making voip work for them transferring phone calls to the internet could spell trouble for deutsche telekom , which still keeps the vast majority of germans connected , if people begin to shy away from the former monopoly 's ubiquitous analog and isdn phone systems . " internet telephony is not going to bring a large growth in profits , " said rainer beaujean , head of t-online , the deutsche telekom subsidiary responsible for internet connections .
" but it is important to keep customers . " also important to customers is being able to guarantee a certain quality of service , said carsten lachmann , who manned a t-systems - another deutsche telekom subsidiary - booth at cebit . " there are no guarantees on the internet , " said lachmann , who sets up voip calling for corporate customers .
" anyone who tells you different is lying .
if everyone on the network starts calling or downloading at the same time there are going to be problems . " dsl will keep speeding up a typical voip call requires an upstream data supply of about 100 kbps , while today 's dsl connections offer between 128 kbps and 392 kbps .
deutsche telekom is planning to double download speeds to 6 megabits per second across germany by the middle of this year and speed things up to 25 mbps in some major german cities by 2006 . " voice over ip already has the quality of analog phones , " krug of avm said .
" now , by increasing bandwidth , we are able to improve the quality even more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : voip phones look just like their analog counterparts .
voip works by encoding a caller 's voice into digital data then breaking the information into small packets and sending them through the internet to be correctly decoded at the other end by the person receiving the call . new phones for non-tech types along with lower costs , better quality has taken voip from the domain of a few computer geeks when it first emerged about 10 years ago to the general public . at cebit , avm and other telecommunications companies are looking for ways to make internet telephony easier for customers to use .
the new high-tech phones now resemble their analog counterparts in all but the type of cable that is plugged in and the phone bill that comes at the end of the month .
" i do n't notice any difference in quality between voip and an analog phone , " said t-systems lachmann , who uses a dsl connection to make his phone calls .
" except , of course , that my phone bill is a lot lower .

" we 're in support of what the europeans are doing , but we had to find a way to demonstrate it , " a senior american official told the new york times about the pending announcement .
" this is our way of making clear that we will join the europeans in giving iran positive reasons to give up its program . " modest incentives the new york times said the us incentives - support for iran 's entry into the world trade organization and selling iran spare parts for its ageing commercial airliners - would go into effect only if iran agreed to permanently halt uranium enrichment at its nuclear plants . senior administration officials , quoted but not identified by both us dailies , told the times that the united states does not plan to join the talks with iran directly , leaving that to the europeans . britain , france and germany are trying to convince iran to halt its work on the nuclear fuel cycle - including the sensitive process of enriching uranium - in return for a package of incentives covering trade , security and technology . a new round of talks , the fifth since december , is to be held later this month , possibly in a capital of one of the three states negotiating for the european union . the united states maintains that iran is trying to covertly develop nuclear weapons , while tehran insists that its program is purely meant to meet civilian energy needs . citing an " unusual and extraordinary threat " from tehran , us president george w. bush on thursday renewed sanctions that bar us firms and citizens from oil dealings with iran . afp / dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran 's top nuclear official strikes defiant note iran 's hassan rowhani saturday warned the us and europe of an oil crisis if tehran is sent before the un security council over its nuclear program , rejecting outright their demands to halt uranium enrichment .

it 's long been no secret that new economic powerhouses are on the rise in asia .

not necessarily . asia , along with the united states , is quickly on its way to becoming a main pillar of the world economy .
for years , china has been making headlines with blazing growth rates and expanding wealth .
india now appears set on a similar path , as it becomes an important part of international trade and commerce . in the coming years , over 100 million people in those two nations will become a part of the global labor market .
what will that mean for comparably older economies such as japan and germany ?
will world export champ germany soon become the global leader in exporting jobs ?
is cutting wages and working longer the answer to the new challenge from asia ? quality exports when markus taube , director of the east asia institute at the university of duisburg , gives a speech about china , he essentially only needs to carry one chart with him .
regardless of what he 's talking about - foreign investment , exports , imports or gross domestic product - the graph for china points skyward .
he believes that 's evidence enough that the country far more advanced than is generally known . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tourist walks past a chinese sign as skyscrapers tower into clouds as background in shanghai .
taube uses the example of china 's exports , which are no longer confined to labor-intensive products , to make his point .
" the technological sophistication of chinese exports is much higher than most us can imagine , " he said .
" and it is effectively also much higher than many eastern european states . " in china , capitalism has been compatible with marx and lenin since 1992 .
the country even joined the world trade organization in 2001 and last year , private ownership was given equal status with that of the state in the chinese constitution .
all of that has helped push china to the pinnacle the world economy in a matter of years .
it is now the world 's fourth biggest exporter after germany , the usa and japan . taube said prospects for stable and continuous growth for years to come will ensure china is not simply the world 's sweatshop for cheap , mass-made products .
and as inexpensive labor meets high-tech , quality german goods will face ever more competition on world markets . and experts agree germany can not compete simply by lowering its labor costs .

" india has undergone a phenomenal opening since 2003 , " said peter von guretzky-cornitz , a regional analyst for hypovereinsbank . but he thinks the changes in india present more of an opportunity than a challenge to germany .

it 's long been no secret that new economic powerhouses are on the rise in asia .
but are they endangering jobs in " old " economies like germany and japan ?
not necessarily . asia , along with the united states , is quickly on its way to becoming a main pillar of the world economy .
for years , china has been making headlines with blazing growth rates and expanding wealth .
india now appears set on a similar path , as it becomes an important part of international trade and commerce . in the coming years , over 100 million people in those two nations will become a part of the global labor market .
what will that mean for comparably older economies such as japan and germany ?
will world export champ germany soon become the global leader in exporting jobs ?
is cutting wages and working longer the answer to the new challenge from asia ? quality exports when markus taube , director of the east asia institute at the university of duisburg , gives a speech about china , he essentially only needs to carry one chart with him .
regardless of what he 's talking about - foreign investment , exports , imports or gross domestic product - the graph for china points skyward .
he believes that 's evidence enough that the country far more advanced than is generally known . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tourist walks past a chinese sign as skyscrapers tower into clouds as background in shanghai .
taube uses the example of china 's exports , which are no longer confined to labor-intensive products , to make his point .
" the technological sophistication of chinese exports is much higher than most us can imagine , " he said .
" and it is effectively also much higher than many eastern european states . " in china , capitalism has been compatible with marx and lenin since 1992 .
the country even joined the world trade organization in 2001 and last year , private ownership was given equal status with that of the state in the chinese constitution .
all of that has helped push china to the pinnacle the world economy in a matter of years .
it is now the world 's fourth biggest exporter after germany , the usa and japan . taube said prospects for stable and continuous growth for years to come will ensure china is not simply the world 's sweatshop for cheap , mass-made products .
and as inexpensive labor meets high-tech , quality german goods will face ever more competition on world markets . and experts agree germany can not compete simply by lowering its labor costs .
whereas hourly wages for manufactured goods in china cost a mere $ 0.80 -lrb- € 0.60 -rrb- , in the united states its $ 21 and in germany over $ 30 . india awakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's ascent has been expected for years , but only recently , another asian giant has awakened : india .
seeing its neighbor sprint ahead as it continued to flounder , india was spurned on to undertake economy reforms recently .
in only a short time , the country has become a global player in the outsourcing and high-tech industries . " india has undergone a phenomenal opening since 2003 , " said peter von guretzky-cornitz , a regional analyst for hypovereinsbank . but he thinks the changes in india present more of an opportunity than a challenge to germany .
after talking about improving the country 's infrastructure for 20 years , indian officials are finally doing something about it .
and that 's good for german business . " you can see that germany will benefit as asia general decides to put a greater emphasis on quality , " von guretzky-cornitz said .
" an indian or chinese who drives a bmw privately now wants a backhoe or a crane or a cement mixer that ’ s from switzerland , germany or austria instead of a copy of a european machine from korea . " good for germany that 's obviously good for german exporters , but what about german investment in booming asian economies ?
as the money goes , wo n't that also move jobs abroad ?
not according to von guretzky-cornitz , who said much of what is produced in asia is meant for those markets alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael finger , an economist at the wto in geneva , even said growth in asia was like " manna from heaven " as german firm profit from those expanding markets .
" i see strong advantages for capital goods from germany , " he said . but all the experts agreed germany will have to concentrate on future-oriented fields and areas of expertise if it wants to keep pace with the changing global economy .
simply trying to lower costs to go toe-to-toe with cheap producers such as china and india , however , would be a disaster .

the topic had been debated for years in germany , but took on a new urgency in the past few weeks after germany came under increased pressure to rein in its emboldened right-wing extremists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : large neo-nazi demonstrations in dresden -lrb- photo -rrb- during the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of the city last month and further planned far-right marches at the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , had turned up the heat on policy makers .
in addition to sharpening the right of assembly , friday 's vote also approved changing the country 's criminal code to include a passage calling for up to three years in jail or a fine for glorification of the nazis , or justifying or downplaying the atrocities of the third reich .
" to think of right-wing extremist groups demonstrating in front of memorials for the victims of nazi crimes , either endorsing , denying , or playing down these crimes against humanity , is unbearable , " german interior minister otto schily said last month .
the bundesrat or the upper house of parliament is expected to ratify the changes within the next week .
a threat to democracy most parties on friday hailed the vote as a boost to democracy .
" we 'll have a few additional possibilities in the future to prevent nazi mischief on our streets and squares , " said dieter wiefelspütz , spd domestic policy expert .

" a broad majority of the bundestag has given the victims of the nazi regime a clear signal : germany will remain alert even 60 years after auschwitz , " said silke stokar von neuforn of the green party .
however , germany 's opposition liberal democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- on friday , voted against the planned beefing up of the right of assembly , saying it had doubts whether the move would work to curb far-right groups .
max stadler , domestic policy expert of the fdp , said that freedom of expression and assembly were fundamental to a democracy and that a tightening of the law was the wrong way to deal with far-right extremists .
stadler criticized that the bundestag was worrying showing itself to be increasingly prepared to violate basic rights .
he added it was probably okay in a one-off case , but simply went too far on the whole .
doubts remain over effectiveness despite the relief among most mainstream parties at friday 's decision , questions still remain over how effective the proposed sharpening of the law will prove in limiting neo-nazi groups .
many politicians were annoyed that the changes disregarded a cdu demand to include the brandenburg gate in the demonstration-free zone around the german reichstag .

both beckstein and german interior minister otto schily said they had doubts whether the spiking of the law could prevent the yearly neo-nazi march to the grave of rudolf hess , hitler 's deputy , in wunsiedel .
others voiced doubts over whether the changes were in line with the constitution .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of the cdu parliamentary group , said there was no guarantee that the new law was in step with the constitution .
" we ca n't guarantee what decision the german constitutional court could possibly come to one day , " bosbach said .
" we 're only doing what we can to give the authorities instruments to prevent demonstrations more easily . "

up to 40,000 fans are expected to travel to edinburgh to see if wales can keep their grand slam dream alive .
the team are jetting from cardiff international airport on friday , part of 4,000 people expected to fly out over the weekend for sunday 's game .
veteran performer max boyce is among those who have already left to cheer on the side at murrayfield .
rugby supporters have arranged a total of 20 chartered flights for the trip to edinburgh , doubling the airport 's usual passenger numbers .
i ca n't remember ever seeing so many people travelling to scotland - it 's got to be great for welsh hopes max boyce most are expected to travel through the airport on friday , along with the welsh team and wru representatives .
a further 1,500 either flew out on thursday or are set to do so on saturday .
cardiff airport managing director jon horne said : " i am sure that the excitement and anticipation will start here as wales ' grand slam hopes draws closer .
" we are confident that we will get everyone off to a great start to the weekend .
" everyone at cardiff international is looking forward to giving the wales team and all its supporters a true welsh send-off . "
different result max boyce said the sight of so many welsh fans at murrayfield would nullify any home advantage the scottish team might expect .
he said : " i ca n't remember ever seeing so many people travelling to scotland - it 's got to be great for welsh hopes . "
one couple making the trip are ceredigion farmers gwyn and enid jones , who met at the wales-scotland game 30 years ago .
the pair , both 51 , from llanrhystud , near aberystwyth , have visited edinburgh many times since but said this trip would be particularly special .
however , like all wales fans , they are hoping for a different result on the field this time - in 1975 wales lost .

" i must have believed that .
that 's why i did it and it 's been a great year . "
he said had has enjoyed his first 12 months , but can not take all the credit for wales ' improved performances .
" a year on , i can reflect on a very good year only because of the hard work of people like andrew hore , scott johnson , clive griffiths and the players themselves .
they 've got to take the credit really .
' great year ' " all i 've done is try to create the environment where they can actually breathe and feel as though they can actually deliver what they are really good at , and that 's playing and coaching , and those guys have done it . "
even so , ruddock said he had thoroughly enjoyed his first year in charge .
" it 's been a great year , not just for me , for the team , all the coaches .

it is 25 years since former west german chancellor willy brandt called for action to help the developing world .
the brandt report appeared to catch the public imagination - translated into two dozen languages , it sold nearly a million copies .
but despite its endorsement by the united nations and discussion at the g7 summit and an economic summit of world leaders - aid levels fell and few of brandt 's suggestions were ever acted on .
wasted opportunities ?
mr brandt spent two years on the report , officially called the north-south report .
its central thrust was that it would benefit the north to address poverty in the south .
the report called for more and better-deployed aid , suggesting that developed countries should be giving aid equivalent to 1 % of their gdp to poor nations by 2000 .
in fact , since then , aid to poor nations has actually fallen from 0.35 % of gdp to 0.21 % of gdp .
a wide ranging look at development , the report called for an emergency relief programme , restructuring of the global economy and ongoing global negotiations on the issues it raised .
some argue that brandt was the right report at the wrong time - published at the cusp of a new era , one which saw both ronald reagan and margaret thatcher come to power and one in which aid flows fell .
" the vision was really ahead of its time , " says james quilligan , an adviser to the brandt commission .
" it was at the end of the keynesian era ... the whole economic culture has -lsb- since -rsb- been redefined . "
since then , he says , the debate on development has shifted from talk of global change to a discussion on trade , aid and debt relief .
pearson cry but brandt was not the first rallying call for greater aid flows to go ignored .
in 1968 , world bank president robert mcnamara asked former canadian prime minister lester b.pearson to look at the achievements of 20 years of development funding and what should happen next .
top 10 recipients of aid in africa , 2002 * mozambique : 2,058 ethiopia : 1,307 egypt : 1.286 tanzania : 1,233 ivory coast : 1,069 drc : 807 south africa : 657 ghana : 653 zambia : 641 uganda : 638 * figures in us dollars million .
source : oecd it concluded that aid had played a role in the economic development of less-developed countries and set specific aid targets .
by 1975 , it said , total aid should amount to 1 % of gnp while official aid should touch 0.7 % of gnp .
again , the targets went unmet .
the report - foreshadowing the trade campaigns of later years - warned it would be futile to nullify the effects of increased aid by inconsiderate trade policies .
cold war winds the pearson report was commissioned at a time when aid - which had its roots in post-colonial times - was being rapidly politicised during the cold war . "
the developed world has a moral duty to assist africa " most computers will open pdf documents automatically , but you may need to download adobe acrobat reader .
the 1980s witnessed the rise of structural adjustment programmes -lrb- saps -rrb- which offered aid in return for reform .
these programmes became a lightning rod for frustration at the west 's apparent desire to dictate policy to the developed world .
partly as a result of this criticism , saps are no longer just about balancing the books but also about reducing poverty , edward brett , a senior research fellow in the development studies institute at the london school of economics , points out .
this also means more aid is needed - to maintain provision of services such as health and education while the deficit is being cut .
mounting scepticism the commission for africa will publish its report into a different world than previous reports and it is by no means clear whether this will make its task - of persuading governments to increase aid - easier .
there is now greater public awareness of the issues highlighted by brandt and pearson than there was previously .
unlike brandt , tony blair is a serving politician , a fact which could limit him from making radical suggestions but may strengthen his hand when it comes to implementation .
decades of aid flows to africa have however increased scepticism about its effectiveness .
some argue that over-reliance on aid allows recipient governments to shirk reform of domestic revenue systems .
while money is needed , by itself it is not enough .
" there are still plenty of governments of crooks and criminals .
do we give them five times as much aid and allow them to put it into their own bank accounts ? " says john roberts , the overseas ' development institute 's director of the economic and statistics analysis unit .
the sense of urgency remains .
the odi 's john roberts says aid works " very , very badly " , but that is n't a reason for not doing it - but a reason to find ways of improving it .
the issue is - partly at least - whether the people holding the purse strings will buy into the latest report .
" if people buy into the moral , it could mean a major increase in the aid available , " mr roberts says .

it is 25 years since former west german chancellor willy brandt called for action to help the developing world .
the brandt report appeared to catch the public imagination - translated into two dozen languages , it sold nearly a million copies .
but despite its endorsement by the united nations and discussion at the g7 summit and an economic summit of world leaders - aid levels fell and few of brandt 's suggestions were ever acted on .

mr brandt spent two years on the report , officially called the north-south report .
its central thrust was that it would benefit the north to address poverty in the south .
the former german chancellor willy brandt - out of office , he became a champion for aid the report called for more and better-deployed aid , suggesting that developed countries should be giving aid equivalent to 1 % of their gdp to poor nations by 2000 .
in fact , since then , aid to poor nations has actually fallen from 0.35 % of gdp to 0.21 % of gdp .
a wide ranging look at development , the report called for an emergency relief programme , restructuring of the global economy and ongoing global negotiations on the issues it raised .
some argue that brandt was the right report at the wrong time - published at the cusp of a new era , one which saw both ronald reagan and margaret thatcher come to power and one in which aid flows fell .
" the vision was really ahead of its time , " says james quilligan , an adviser to the brandt commission .
" it was at the end of the keynesian era ... the whole economic culture has -lsb- since -rsb- been redefined . "
since then , he says , the debate on development has shifted from talk of global change to a discussion on trade , aid and debt relief .

the health and social services department wants to make smoking illegal in all enclosed public places , and in the workplace .
the proposals follow lengthy consultations with states departments and medical professionals .
it is proposed one year 's notice should be given to allow landlords time to prepare outdoor smoking areas .
the call for a complete ban has been prompted by new evidence of the health risks from passive smoking , the need to protect all workers , and the relative success of similar bans in countries like norway and ireland .
the law would include restaurants , bars and clubs .
the health and social services department is also putting forward a second-best alternative which would ban smoking only in public places where food is served .
the proposals will be debated when the states meet at the end of march .

uk prime minister tony blair 's commission for africa urges rich countries - like medical doctors - to take a hippocratic oath on african policy .
that is they should do no harm but help the continent .
and in its 400-page report is a long list of western policies that damage africa - such as subsidising western farmers to compete against african ones ; selling arms into war zones ; demanding repayment of dubious mega-debts and warehousing stolen state funds in western banks .
speaking directly to the industrialised countries of the g8 , which britain chairs this year , the report calls for a new kind of partnership with africa " based on mutual respect and solidarity " in what british officials regard as the most serious review of western policy on africa in a generation .
the commission 's recommendations on trade , corruption , arms sales and aid have long been touted by african activists but will meet strong opposition from britain 's fellow g8 members and british businesses uneasy about more regulation and accountability .
objections however , signing up to the report alongside mr blair , were 17 commissioners including the uk 's finance minister gordon brown and development minister hilary benn together with france 's former head of the imf michel camdessus and veteran us senator nancy kassebaum baker . "
few in brussels believe mr blair stands much chance of getting farm subsidies dismantled by 2010 " rich country finance ministers will cavil at the commission 's calls for an extra $ 25bn a year in aid to africa by 2010 , more so at calls for a further $ 25bn a year by 2015 .
the united states has its own highly conditional aid plans known as the millennium challenge account , for which few countries have qualified , but it will not sign up to mr brown 's development bond plan , the international financing facility -lrb- iff -rrb- .
and canada , whose aid budget is more generous than either the us 's or britain 's in percentage terms , is also unwilling to join the iff plan - although it backs many of the commission 's other proposals .
distorting markets the us treasury also opposes the commission 's plans for 100 % debt relief and the us trade secretary has rejected calls for an immediate end to subsidies on cotton and sugar , as called for by the africa commission .
last week , the world trade organisation judged us cotton subsidies to have breached its trade rules but instead of complying with the ruling , us officials offered to negotiate with mali and brazil - two of the countries most affected by the us 's market-distorting subsidies .
other g8 countries such as france , germany and italy benefit hugely from the european union 's -lrb- eu -rrb- common agricultural policy , which is targeted by the africa commission as the world 's most protectionist trade regime .
few in brussels believe mr blair and his team stand much chance of getting either the us or the eu this year to commit to dismantling all farm and export subsidies by 2010 .
and it 's questionable how much support britain will get in promoting its african agenda from russia which takes over the chair of the g8 in january 2006 .
stark challenges british diplomats have a formidable policy agenda to sell not just to their g8 colleagues but to other whitehall officials and british companies who will resist many of the commission 's recommendations .
britain has become the ' laundromat of choice ' for companies and individuals handling stolen funds from countries such as kenya and nigeria . "
britain has been one of the worst poachers of african health workers " many of the main arms bankers and financiers selling into africa base their operations in britain .
a leading provider of military equipment to president robert mugabe 's government in zimbabwe has indefinite leave to remain in britain .
successive un expert reports on links between exploitation and conflict in the democratic republic of congo have accused several british companies of malpractice , which they have all denied , and asked britain 's department of trade and industry to investigate , without result .
and britain , along with canada , has been one of the worst poachers of african health workers ; the commission calls for one million new health workers to be trained in africa by 2015 to cope with the hiv / aids pandemic .
but perhaps the starkest example of the mountain to be climbed is in sudan , where the uk government has played a leading role in mediating a peace deal between the islamist government in khartoum and the sudan people 's liberation army in the south , while khartoum sent its soldiers and militia allies on military strikes in the country 's western province of darfur - killing more than 100,000 and displacing at least 2m .
if the g8 and china - hovering on the club 's threshold - lack the political will to stop the killing in darfur and provide serious support to the african union peacekeepers there , the africa commission 's avowal that " the right to life and security is the most basic of human rights " will ring hollow indeed .

the commission wants to combat poverty in africa uk prime minister tony blair 's commission for africa urges rich countries - like medical doctors - to take a hippocratic oath on african policy .
that is they should do no harm but help the continent .
and in its 400-page report is a long list of western policies that damage africa - such as subsidising western farmers to compete against african ones ; selling arms into war zones ; demanding repayment of dubious mega-debts and warehousing stolen state funds in western banks .
speaking directly to the industrialised countries of the g8 , which britain chairs this year , the report calls for a new kind of partnership with africa " based on mutual respect and solidarity " in what british officials regard as the most serious review of western policy on africa in a generation .
the commission 's recommendations on trade , corruption , arms sales and aid have long been touted by african activists but will meet strong opposition from britain 's fellow g8 members and british businesses uneasy about more regulation and accountability .
objections however , signing up to the report alongside mr blair , were 17 commissioners including the uk 's finance minister gordon brown and development minister hilary benn together with france 's former head of the imf michel camdessus and veteran us senator nancy kassebaum baker .
few in brussels believe mr blair stands much chance of getting farm subsidies dismantled by 2010 rich country finance ministers will cavil at the commission 's calls for an extra $ 25bn a year in aid to africa by 2010 , more so at calls for a further $ 25bn a year by 2015 .
the united states has its own highly conditional aid plans known as the millennium challenge account , for which few countries have qualified , but it will not sign up to mr brown 's development bond plan , the international financing facility -lrb- iff -rrb- .
and canada , whose aid budget is more generous than either the us 's or britain 's in percentage terms , is also unwilling to join the iff plan - although it backs many of the commission 's other proposals .
distorting markets the us treasury also opposes the commission 's plans for 100 % debt relief and the us trade secretary has rejected calls for an immediate end to subsidies on cotton and sugar , as called for by the africa commission .
last week , the world trade organisation judged us cotton subsidies to have breached its trade rules the us opposes many measures which could help trade but instead of complying with the ruling , us officials offered to negotiate with mali and brazil - two of the countries most affected by the us 's market-distorting subsidies .
other g8 countries such as france , germany and italy benefit hugely from the european union 's -lrb- eu -rrb- common agricultural policy , which is targeted by the africa commission as the world 's most protectionist trade regime .
few in brussels believe mr blair and his team stand much chance of getting either the us or the eu this year to commit to dismantling all farm and export subsidies by 2010 .
and it 's questionable how much support britain will get in promoting its african agenda from russia which takes over the chair of the g8 in january 2006 .
stark challenges british diplomats have a formidable policy agenda to sell not just to their g8 colleagues but to other whitehall officials and british companies who will resist many of the commission 's recommendations .
britain has become the ' laundromat of choice ' for companies and individuals handling stolen funds from countries such as kenya and nigeria .
britain has been one of the worst poachers of african health workers many of the main arms bankers and financiers selling into africa base their operations in britain .
a leading provider of military equipment to president robert mugabe 's government in zimbabwe has indefinite leave to remain in britain .
successive un expert reports on links between exploitation and conflict in the democratic republic of congo have accused several british companies of malpractice , which they have all denied , and asked britain 's department of trade and industry to investigate , without result .
and britain , along with canada , has been one of the worst poachers of african health workers ; the commission calls for one million new health workers to be trained in africa by 2015 to cope with the hiv / aids pandemic .
but perhaps the starkest example of the mountain to be climbed is in sudan , where the uk government has played a leading role in mediating a peace deal between the islamist government in khartoum and the sudan people 's liberation army in the south , while khartoum sent its soldiers and militia allies on military strikes in the country 's western province of darfur - killing more than 100,000 and displacing at least 2m .
if the g8 and china - hovering on the club 's threshold - lack the political will to stop the killing in darfur and provide serious support to the african union peacekeepers there , the africa commission 's avowal that " the right to life and security is the most basic of human rights " will ring hollow indeed .

the charity wants the government to boost the minimum wage to alleviate the problems of low-paid , seasonal jobs , which forms a large part of cumbria 's economy .

figures from the campaign group end child poverty show that almost 47 % of families with children in the sandwith ward of copeland rely on benefits .
similar figures are reported in the barrow area , where the group says 46 % are dependent on state hand-outs .
the charity says the county illustrates how areas , not traditionally regarded as deprived , have poverty problems .
there are next to no jobs and what there is offers very low pay copeland councillor peter tyson jonathan stearn , the director of end child poverty , said : " we are talking about children who often do n't have warm winter coats , weatherproof shoes and do n't have three square meals a day .
" we know it 's all about material deprivation as well .
but we also know that these children get bullied at school , get isolated and do n't fulfil their full potential .
" cumbria illustrates the point that it 's not actually the most deprived areas that have children living in poverty . "
the charity wants the government to boost the minimum wage to alleviate the problems of low-paid , seasonal jobs , which forms a large part of cumbria 's economy .
copeland councillor peter tyson , who represents the sandwith ward , said : " it is well recognised that the sandwith ward is a large unemployment area .

no p & o or seafrance vessels had left the kent port since wednesday afternoon because of the 24-hour strike .
the first ferries departed on thursday evening as the industrial action came to an end .
the action has seen a backlog of lorries parked on the m20 as operation stack was implemented by kent police .
berth damaged the operation uses the coastbound carriageway of the motorway between junctions 11 and 12 for lorries to park while they wait to cross the channel .
it was put in place overnight between wednesday and thursday and again during thursday afternoon and evening .
kent police called in officers from surrey and essex to cope with traffic problems caused by operation stack .
p & o spokesperson brian rees said he hoped there would be no significant traffic backlog after the strike ends , because some of the waiting freight was sent over to zeebrugge .
operation stack has been brought in several times so far this year all the main french trade unions were taking part in a 24-hour strike to protest against government economic reforms .
the freight transport association said the action would cost freight companies about £ 1m .
cross-channel travellers have been hit by other disruption recently after a berth at calais was damaged .
further delays are now expected on monday , tuesday and wednesday of next week when one of calais ' large berths is closed for repairs , leaving only one working berth for all large cross-channel ferries .

no p & o or seafrance vessels had left the kent port since wednesday afternoon because of the 24-hour strike .
the first ferries departed on thursday evening as the industrial action came to an end .
the action has seen a backlog of lorries parked on the m20 as operation stack was implemented by kent police .
berth damaged the operation uses the coastbound carriageway of the motorway between junctions 11 and 12 for lorries to park while they wait to cross the channel .
it was put in place overnight between wednesday and thursday and again during thursday afternoon and evening .
kent police called in officers from surrey and essex to cope with traffic problems caused by operation stack .
p & o spokesperson brian rees said he hoped there would be no significant traffic backlog after the strike ends , because some of the waiting freight was sent over to zeebrugge .
operation stack has been brought in several times so far this year all the main french trade unions were taking part in a 24-hour strike to protest against government economic reforms .
the freight transport association said the action would cost freight companies about £ 1m .
cross-channel travellers have been hit by other disruption recently after a berth at calais was damaged .

no p & o or seafrance vessels had left the kent port since wednesday afternoon because of the 24-hour strike .
the first ferries departed on thursday evening as the industrial action came to an end .
the action has seen a backlog of lorries parked on the m20 as operation stack was implemented by kent police .
berth damaged the operation uses the coastbound carriageway of the motorway between junctions 11 and 12 for lorries to park while they wait to cross the channel .
it was put in place overnight between wednesday and thursday and again during thursday afternoon and evening .
kent police called in officers from surrey and essex to cope with traffic problems caused by operation stack .
p & o spokesperson brian rees said he hoped there would be no significant traffic backlog after the strike ends , because some of the waiting freight was sent over to zeebrugge .
all the main french trade unions were taking part in a 24-hour strike to protest against government economic reforms .
the freight transport association said the action would cost freight companies about £ 1m .
cross-channel travellers have been hit by other disruption recently after a berth at calais was damaged .
further delays are now expected on monday , tuesday and wednesday of next week when one of calais ' large berths is closed for repairs , leaving only one working berth for all large cross-channel ferries .

figures from the campaign group end child poverty show that almost 47 % of families with children in the sandwith ward of copeland rely on benefits .
similar figures are reported in the barrow area , where the group says 46 % are dependent on state hand-outs .
the charity says the county illustrates how areas , not traditionally regarded as deprived , have poverty problems . "
there are next to no jobs and what there is offers very low pay " copeland councillor peter tyson jonathan stearn , the director of end child poverty , said : " we are talking about children who often do n't have warm winter coats , weatherproof shoes and do n't have three square meals a day .
" we know it 's all about material deprivation as well .
but we also know that these children get bullied at school , get isolated and do n't fulfil their full potential .
" cumbria illustrates the point that it 's not actually the most deprived areas that have children living in poverty . "
the charity wants the government to boost the minimum wage to alleviate the problems of low-paid , seasonal jobs , which forms a large part of cumbria 's economy .
copeland councillor peter tyson , who represents the sandwith ward , said : " it is well recognised that the sandwith ward is a large unemployment area .
" there are next to no jobs and what there is offers very low pay . "
as well as sandwith , the charity also highlights the moss bay area of allerdale , which it says has 45.8 % of youngsters relying on state benefits and the barrow central ward , with 45.7 % dependent upon the benefits system .

china has emerged as the likeliest challenger to the united states as a global superpower .
it has the world 's fastest growing economy , with millions moving to the country 's rapidly expanding cities .
the boom was triggered by a move towards a market-style economy and away from the centrally-planned communist model of 20 years ago .
however , economic change has not been accompanied by political reform and the government still maintains strict control over opposition and the media .
what does the future hold for china ?
have you experienced the changes of the last 20 years ?
do you live in china - or have you visited recently ?
if so , send us your impressions .
chinese voices audio gallery hear what young chinese people around the world think of the changes their country has experienced in our audio gallery .
your comments : i am an overseas chinese currently living in sydney .
although i grew up for most of my childhood and all of my teenager years in australia , i 've never forgotten my homeland , china .
every year 's end i return to visit my hometown , shanghai , for two particular reasons ; not forgetting i am a chinese , and to absorb inspirations .
shanghai in particular has modernized in an unimaginable manner , with constructions being carried out 24/7 and has one of the highest fdi rates amongst many -lrb- if not any -rrb- cities in the world .
each time i return , i would n't be able to recognize places if it was n't for the street signs .
since i left china in 1991 at the age of 8 , my memories of china were colourless .
people had similar clothing , furniture and clustered housings .
now all of that has changed with the addition of private cars , an increasing taste for western sports , music and culture .
indeed , china has somewhat tarnished in its own cultural uniqueness in many ways , but i think the reason is that the china has been deprived for too long -lrb- ever since the collapse of the qing dynasty -rrb- , hence it is no surprise that the chinese want to rapidly absorb the best of all worlds .
jia-jie xu , sydney , australia here in anhui the benefits of trickle down from the new rich and middle class are evident .
sadly it does n't seem to trickle down to the poorest .
begging is on the increase and people fight to take away my rubbish .
recently prices have begun to increase more rapidly and the wages of the poorest are static or even falling .
whether the wealthy can continue to uphold the facade of an improving life for all is probably the big question of the next 5 years .
adam porter , ma 'anshan , anhui , china being a chinese myself , i had n't seen china in an objective way before i came to study in australia .
i never questioned or even bothered to think about communism , since the impact of that " scary " word on my life is hardly noticeable .
i 'm from a middle class family .
my life has been as comfortable as it can be .
but while i 'm here in melbourne , and after witnessing the election campaign , i keep realizing how far we are from real democracy .
the bright side is , for the last 25 years china has been striving to open to the world .
we started to understand each other more as distinct cultures , than political rivals .
dan wang , melbourne , australia the inequality in the new chinese society is very obvious yongdan li , berkeley , california , usa i was only a child when i left mainland china .
back then , there was only one mcdonalds and one kfc .
most major stores were still very much state-owned .
however , i 've seen some amazing changes during visits to my homeland over the past several years .
everything has become highly commercialized and influenced by western trends .
mcdonalds , wal-marts and even starbucks have sprung up everywhere .
another big change has been the amount of information from abroad that has been exposed to mainland chinese .
now everyone knows the major stars from america and what movies in the us have been top box office hits , as well as the political scandals and bush 's speech mishaps .
these changes have all been very exciting to me .
at the same time , the hutong and the streets leading up to all the places i knew as a child have been bulldozed and paved over - replaced by more modern-looking structures .
part of me misses the scenery of " old china " that i know i very possibly would never see again , but i feel that change is good .
change might involve inequality and difficulties , but if china had n't gone through these changes , it would n't have made any progress .
when i visited china this summer , i dined in a little noodle shop where one bowl of noodle cost only 1 yuan -lrb- a little more than 10 cents -rrb- , i also ate at mcdonalds , where it cost me 17 times more money .
the inequality in the new chinese society is very obvious , but i 'm confident china has the potential to work things out .
let 's give it time .
yongdan li , berkeley , california , usa i am a beijing born chinese and have been living in the city for almost my entire life .
i am going through the changing of our city and out country .
i am fortunately among the crowd who have much better life than our parents , but i also see many more chinese people are struggling to make their families survive than ever .
people nowadays always say that china is the hottest hotspot for business opportunity .
however , billions of ordinary chinese people are paying a very heavy price for a few to achieve this so-called significant growth .
please think about how many chinese families are still living under poverty !
their life is not at all so pleasant as that of children in the big cities , who have adequate toys , snacks and money in their daily life !
brownie , beijing , china i am amazed by the tremendous improvements that have been achieved so , kuala lumpur , malaysia to understand china , one has to first and foremost understand ' chinese culture ' .
we chinese have always placed great respect on elders , both within the family and outside it .
this is probably the reason most non-chinese people would think that chinese wanted a strong totalitarian government to lead them back to the greatness that we had experienced before .
i am constantly reminded of a popular lay-phrase that i heard when travelling around china sometime ago - the central government set rules and regulations , we the common folks have methods to circumvent them -lrb- yet seemingly to comply with them -rrb- !
i am amazed by the tremendous improvements that have been achieved and am sure that this will continue .
whatever it takes to be a superpower , please try not to judge china with your own pre-conceived ideas of it .
china is not the united states -lrb- or any of the developed countries -rrb- .
it is uniquely just china !
so , kuala lumpur , malaysia some may be worried that china will establish itself as a global superpower like the united states , and that it may send its trails around the whole world .
well , we do want to be strong , for we 've suffered a lot in the past , but we do n't want to be powerful .
we have our own culture , which is peaceful , friendly , tolerant and wise - never combative , never furious .
during the tang period , china did n't conquer other nations , although the fact is that our culture did spread a lot .
we want to be strong because we have to .
we never want to be a superpower like the united states because our culture does not allow us to do so .
we hate to mention a word about ruling the world .
i 'm a teenager , aged 18 , and i will follow our great culture seriously in order to build a peaceful world , with a balance between the western and the orient .
what 's more , when i am 81 years old , i will also tell my grandsons and granddaughters to do as i have done .
and that 's for sure , they will fellow me , because of our chinese tradition , and our culture .
zhang rong , chinese now studying in australia a growing china will be a huge benefit to the west .
they may lack democracy as the west knows it but they are liberal in their outlook compared to most other non-democratic countries .
it could also be said that china will also curb the threat of islamic extremism as the islam in its aggressive form will be a hindrance to china in its growing prosperity .
philip shorter , tonbridge , england i am a 40-year-old chinese and have experienced the big change myself in the past 20 years .
i have two basic points .
first , in spite of the economic growth , the main task of china is still nothing else but to fight against poverty .
i believe that , at least in my life time , i will not see china become a real global superpower .
secondly , although there is not a total qualitative change in social life , compared to the time of the cultural revolution , the situation of human rights in china has been improved and this is the main comfort of the most chinese people .
chun , han , berlin , germany china wants to regain its true place amongst the current world order roberto , bristol , uk to fully understand china 's future , you must understand its past .
communism in part was a nationalistic movement and one that was a reaction to the degradations that the west visited upon her in the 19th and early 20th century .
for my part , i believe that communism will be replaced , if it has n't been already .
china wants to regain its true place amongst the current world order , and will keep progressing towards that goal .
roberto , bristol , uk the fact that china got this far is a miracle in itself .
chinese people are not too interested in politics but rather in creating wealth .
the people are quite happy to accept whatever form of government as long as everyone has the opportunity of bettering themselves .
i do not think we want a repetition of the form of government between 1900s1970s .
my father had to leave china at the age of 14 to seek his fortune because they were all starving ! !
soon , exeter , uk i was in beijing and in a very remote village in north china in 2002 .
the transport infrastructures being constructed , even in remote places , are impressive .
but you can also see many poor people who are living on less than $ 2 a day .
a nation can not be successful based on some economical statistics but leaving its people behind .
prasun , the netherlands this is a country that has no respect for human right wei chun , boston , usa the rich get richer and the farmer gets left behind .
i 've been to china several times a year and have seen people complaining about corrupt party officials demolishing their homes without any compensation as originally promised and unreasonable tax collection demands .
this is a country that has no respect for human rights and will not tolerate dissenting view .
this a country where the communist party official is the law of the land .
wei chun , boston , usa i went to china last year with my dad on a tour of tianjin and beijing .
china has come a long way and still has a long way to go before becoming the next " superpower " .
the west tends to exaggerate the threat from beijing but it 's true that china still wields much power in asia .
for example , 6-party talks were organised by the chinese government to defuse north korea 's nuclear crisis and i thank china for their constructive role .
michael jun sung shim , korea shanghai is amazing !
from the air it makes manhattan look insignificant .
and my stay in beijing left no doubt in my mind that the army runs the show .
from thailand to korea and japan , as china 's economy soars , the perceived power of the usa is melting into impotence .
peter gamache , anchorage , alaska i have only seen a glimpse of this extremely complex and beautiful country and love it !
lindsay palmer , johannesburg , south africa i recently spent 6 months teaching english in china in guangzhou and also spent 10 days touring beijing and shanghai in 2000 .
i am struck not only by their determination to become a superpower but also that it is backed by a willingness to sacrifice now to achieve their end goal .
their approach to life and way of thinking is different from the questioning , individualistic way of thinking of the west and i think this is going to take them to the top as a country .
i have only seen a glimpse of this extremely complex and beautiful country and love it !
lindsay palmer , johannesburg , south africa i see all these opinions from people of chinese origin and they confirm my fears .
they are not interested in a peaceful china , a tolerant china , a democratic and liberal china , they want to see the superpower , the best country in the world throwing its weight around and bullying the rest of the world .
it seems to me that they want an imperialistic china as much as they detest any western superpower .
not good , not good at all .
carlos , toronto , canada it is probable that the beijing olympics will give china the platform it needs to show the world that it is interested in development and is looking forward rather than back .
if this is the case , i would like to see china take a leading role in bringing north korea closer to the international community .
luke mclachlan , auckland , new zealand the fact that china is getting stronger should not be feared by the rest of the world .
it could be worse in the future if there was only one superpower in the world as they would throw their weight around in the world of politics , military and commerce .
with two superpowers , there will be balance in the world and the fear of total domination by one nation will be diminished .
william , ireland china will be the most interesting , dynamic nation of the coming century josh , denver , usa china will become increasingly multi-faceted .
even now chinese movies fill our theatres , chinese peacekeepers patrol in haiti , and two chinese engineers are hostages in pakistan .
they 've come a long way from the blue-jacketed masses of the chairman .
my biggest concern in terms of stability and human rights will be that china shifts from communism to oligarchy , much like america 's 19th century " robber barons " - or like pre-1949 china .
that being said , china will be the most interesting , dynamic nation of the coming century .
josh , denver , usa the future of china will be bright and it will also a next superpower .
yes , i have recently visited china , the growth is tremendous in every way .
philip loke , singapore i have been to china , and lived there .
i think the move to a market economy will not be affected by the political system .
if anything the government will seek to extend its control - as is happening in every other country in the world .
china will not become a world power .
the reason is simple .
their ability to produce high return products will be affected by the concentration of that ability in a few select countries - namely , the us , europe and japan .
peter , melbourne , australia china has made a big progress in the last two decades .
we must realise it .
although it still has some disadvantages , we should be more tolerant when the chinese government implements the reform and opening policy .
human rights are being respected .
you can go to china and have a look .
please do not criticise too much if you do not understand a country .
respect others and you will be respected .
please remember !
china has been making a big progress !
yajun zhang , henan , china they are trying to build a compassionate and civic-minded society beng tang , singapore i was in china in august , it struck me as a country that faces great problems , but also has great potential .
what rayan , new orleans , usa said is quite true .
if you look at what us-sponsored " democracy " has led to in russia , compared to the prosperity of the booming chinese cities , chinese people would rather have " socialism with chinese characteristics " and one party rule than that .
at the same time , i was very interested to see the propaganda films on tv which showcase altruistic behaviour , like the story of a village elder who paid off his village 's debts with great self-sacrifice .
that and the very courteous and generous manners of many of the people i met there , is encouraging because it suggests that they are trying to build a compassionate and civic-minded society , to try and temper the materialism and the growing gap between rich and poor that capitalism brings .
as for being a super power , i think china certainly wants to exert a lot of influence in its neighbourhood in asia , but i do n't think it has ambitions of dominating the world , unlike some .
beng tang , singapore -lrb- in uk -rrb- during the economic transition , characterised by a massive influx of western businesses and investments , the chinese government deters political movements by exerting rigorous control over the media .
the effect of this has been significant ; today , anyone who is critical of the government 's actions is labelled as " anti-china . "
china can not and will not be a superpower if the 1.3 billion people are always " pro-china " in every action the government takes .
will , stockholm , sweden it seems to me that the turnaround in china 's fortunes started about the time that hong kong was handed back to them .
if the chinese government continue to listen to voices from hong kong , taiwan and other parts of the world , their economy will continue to grow as western influence makes it mark .
they must be careful , however , not to leave their poor population behind .
graham rodhouse , helmond , the netherlands i disagree that chinese are going to be satisfied with consumer goods for the foreseeable future .
behind closed doors , the chinese i have met and lived with do have a clear desire to be more free and to have their say as individuals .
what 's more , there 's a whole generation of young chinese growing up now that have been educated in the west and come back to their homeland wondering why they do n't have the rights we take for granted .
one day there will have to be political reform , but i just hope it does n't take another tiananmen to do it .
greg , nottingham , uk i see no immediate need for a change in china 's political system wong wan kit , petaling jaya , malaysia i see no immediate need for a change in china 's political system to follow the western system of popular government .
a popular leader does not equals to capable leader .
as long as the governing power is able to lead and manage , the specific type of government is not immediately important for china at this moment .
wong wan kit , petaling jaya , malaysia i have just visited china recently -lrb- two weeks ago -rrb- .
my impressions are that they will become a economic superpower .
however it can only have strong positive impact to the world if it can open up its media and allows a second political party to exist .
by the way , in china , i can not access bbc news website and i wonder if there are any other countries in the world which block all bbc websites .
jason , singapore i am proud that china is once more becoming the most important country in the world .
china has never in it 's history set out to cause trouble in the world .
it traded with the americas way before columbus " discovered " america .
i hope china will play a part on the world stage as a strong powerful but peaceful nation that has given the world so much , and will give the world so much more .
mike cheng , hong kong people from the west are keen to put the human rights issue on the table when talking about china .
in my opinion , china is on the way to a country with greater freedom and greater democracy .
food and shelter is the basis of human rights .
i could n't imagine a country where people want freedom of speech , even freedom of gay marriage when they 're starving .
the party in power had done well in ensuring basic human rights .
i hope my country will grow stronger , fight against corruption and provide better social welfare to chinese people .
chenfu , tampere , finland i want to see democracy in china , but not now !
echo , guangdong , china as a chinese , i want to see china to become the next superpower more than i want to see china become a western style democratic country .
of course , i want to see democracy in china , but not now !
china has a lot of problems to face when going the way to a superpower .
such as taiwan issue , poverty , etc ...
echo , guangdong , china i used to live in beijing and i found that everyone i spoke to , from teachers to taxi drivers , was acutely aware of the freedoms they lack .
did the students in tiananmen square or the practitioners of fa lun gong " not know any different " ?
i doubt it .
in the end , i think china will have no choice but to liberalize : either the government will fail to deliver on the promise of long-term growth and have to offer the incentive of civil liberties to keep the support of the people , or , as the educated , affluent middle class grows in size and strength , so too will its hunger for something more satisfying than mcdonald 's and starbucks .
alexander wille , kakamigahara , japan today , we -lrb- at least i -rrb- complain about the fact the us throws its weight around with little care for the damage it causes .
the china of 50 years from now will be much more difficult to handle .
if only speaking chinese could be as easy as speaking english ...
vassili le moigne , prague , czech republic the future will indeed be a scary place as china will likely be another superpower gerod wattier , wa , usa the future will indeed be a scary place as china will likely be another superpower .
a superpower that is undemocratic and has no respect for human rights .
a nation that is getting stronger economically and militarily every day .
gerod wattier , carnation , wa , usa the problem is the system that china is setting up is something that could very easily work .
the people have had their freedoms repressed by their government for generations - they do n't know any different .
and as long their government allows them to make more money than they normally would under a centrally-planned communist market , you 're not going to get many complaints from them .
they can put a roof over their heads , food on the table , and have some money left over for entertainment that they would n't normally have .
you really think they 're going to care about a one-party system and strict government control over the media when they 're hanging out at a chinese starbucks with their friends , sipping a café ' mocha ?
i do n't think so .
ryan , new orleans , usa i agree totally with ryan of new orleans .
after speaking with many young chinese people overseas , i was astonished by the amazing effect of nationalistic propaganda imposed on the new generation .
any criticism towards the communist party is regarded by them as an attack on the people and nation of china .
the chinese communist party has reinforced its grasp of power very well after putting down the massive democratic movement of 1989 .
i believe the students had good intentions 15 years ago but were overly naïve and hasty .
the movement achieved exactly the opposite of its goals : even if the government at the time was starting to slowly concede more political freedom to the people , it certainly changed its mind in 1989 and decided instead to re-educate the youths to ensure that such challenges to the absolute authority of the party never happened again .
chinese people now immensely enjoy their new found economic freedom and very few are longing for a deeper level of freedom .
the reality is bizarre : china is actually democratic in its own way because the authoritarian one-party rule is really what most chinese people want .
j yang , london , england what is happening in china right now is similar to what occurred during the industrial revolution in the uk lynne , london , uk it took over 200 years for democracy to develop in the western countries like the uk and the us .
why should china be expected to change overnight ?
what is happening in china right now is similar to what occurred during the industrial revolution in the uk .
i do n't seem to hear any people complaining about that ? !
china may well become a super power ... and what of it ?
china was once a great empire - and it will be again !
lynne , london , uk the prospect of china becoming a military and economic power is frightening indeed , especially with absolute power being held by a corrupted and authoritarian government that is not accountable to anybody but itself .
idris m , sydney , australia as someone who is half chinese , i am very happy to see china succeeding after decades of failure .
i do not think the west should be afraid of china .
china wants to do business , not war , with the west .
let china develop itself and slowly give freedom back .
we all remember what happened when russia moved to quickly towards freedom .
china is gradually becoming more and more free , but you have to eat to be free in the first place .
mark , brisbane , australia china has changed a lot in economic policy , and it has improved the living standard in china .
mostly in urban areas of china .
that means still a lot of people in rural areas are living in poor environment .
the communist government abuses basic human rights and bans freedom of religion .
china has greatly threatened regional peace and stability in the asia-pacific area , because china has systematically increased the number of missiles those pointed to taiwan .
china has ignored all the chinese peoples ' rights and freedoms .
if china wo n't change the political system , it wo n't become the superpower , but will cause military competition between taiwan .
it may lead to war in asia-pacific or china will spend high volume of money on military .
johnson kao , australia china will necessarily undergo a social revolution in the next 25 to 50 years mark , usa china will necessarily undergo a social revolution in the next 25 to 50 years even greater than its economic revolution of the last 30 .
china is communist today in name only .
like a snake outgrowing its skin , the current system will prove far too restrictive to allow the kind of expansion it has come to expect .
along with prosperity for many tens and even hundreds of millions will come expectations of freedom of movement and expression that will be irresistible .
look for china to undergo upheavals leading to a thriving democratic nation at peace with itself and the world and preoccupied with its own growth and development by mid century .
mark , usa china 's economic improvement is worth praising but in order for china to become a " real " superpower in the stage of worldwide , interrelated economy , the central government infrastructure must change from the top down .

china has emerged as the likeliest challenger to the united states as a global superpower .
it has the world 's fastest growing economy , with millions moving to the country 's rapidly expanding cities .
the boom was triggered by a move towards a market-style economy and away from the centrally-planned communist model of 20 years ago .
however , economic change has not been accompanied by political reform and the government still maintains strict control over opposition and the media .
what does the future hold for china ?
have you experienced the changes of the last 20 years ?
do you live in china - or have you visited recently ?
if so , send us your impressions .
chinese voices audio gallery hear what young chinese people around the world think of the changes their country has experienced in our audio gallery .
your comments : i am an overseas chinese currently living in sydney .
although i grew up for most of my childhood and all of my teenager years in australia , i 've never forgotten my homeland , china .
every year 's end i return to visit my hometown , shanghai , for two particular reasons ; not forgetting i am a chinese , and to absorb inspirations .
shanghai in particular has modernized in an unimaginable manner , with constructions being carried out 24/7 and has one of the highest fdi rates amongst many -lrb- if not any -rrb- cities in the world .
each time i return , i would n't be able to recognize places if it was n't for the street signs .
since i left china in 1991 at the age of 8 , my memories of china were colourless .
people had similar clothing , furniture and clustered housings .
now all of that has changed with the addition of private cars , an increasing taste for western sports , music and culture .
indeed , china has somewhat tarnished in its own cultural uniqueness in many ways , but i think the reason is that the china has been deprived for too long -lrb- ever since the collapse of the qing dynasty -rrb- , hence it is no surprise that the chinese want to rapidly absorb the best of all worlds .
jia-jie xu , sydney , australia here in anhui the benefits of trickle down from the new rich and middle class are evident .
sadly it does n't seem to trickle down to the poorest .
begging is on the increase and people fight to take away my rubbish .
recently prices have begun to increase more rapidly and the wages of the poorest are static or even falling .
whether the wealthy can continue to uphold the facade of an improving life for all is probably the big question of the next 5 years .
adam porter , ma 'anshan , anhui , china being a chinese myself , i had n't seen china in an objective way before i came to study in australia .
i never questioned or even bothered to think about communism , since the impact of that " scary " word on my life is hardly noticeable .
i 'm from a middle class family .
my life has been as comfortable as it can be .
but while i 'm here in melbourne , and after witnessing the election campaign , i keep realizing how far we are from real democracy .
the bright side is , for the last 25 years china has been striving to open to the world .
we started to understand each other more as distinct cultures , than political rivals .
dan wang , melbourne , australia the inequality in the new chinese society is very obvious yongdan li , berkeley , california , usa i was only a child when i left mainland china .
back then , there was only one mcdonalds and one kfc .
most major stores were still very much state-owned .
however , i 've seen some amazing changes during visits to my homeland over the past several years .
everything has become highly commercialized and influenced by western trends .
mcdonalds , wal-marts and even starbucks have sprung up everywhere .
another big change has been the amount of information from abroad that has been exposed to mainland chinese .
now everyone knows the major stars from america and what movies in the us have been top box office hits , as well as the political scandals and bush 's speech mishaps .
these changes have all been very exciting to me .
at the same time , the hutong and the streets leading up to all the places i knew as a child have been bulldozed and paved over - replaced by more modern-looking structures .
part of me misses the scenery of " old china " that i know i very possibly would never see again , but i feel that change is good .
change might involve inequality and difficulties , but if china had n't gone through these changes , it would n't have made any progress .
when i visited china this summer , i dined in a little noodle shop where one bowl of noodle cost only 1 yuan -lrb- a little more than 10 cents -rrb- , i also ate at mcdonalds , where it cost me 17 times more money .
the inequality in the new chinese society is very obvious , but i 'm confident china has the potential to work things out .
let 's give it time .
yongdan li , berkeley , california , usa i am a beijing born chinese and have been living in the city for almost my entire life .
i am going through the changing of our city and out country .
i am fortunately among the crowd who have much better life than our parents , but i also see many more chinese people are struggling to make their families survive than ever .
people nowadays always say that china is the hottest hotspot for business opportunity .
however , billions of ordinary chinese people are paying a very heavy price for a few to achieve this so-called significant growth .
please think about how many chinese families are still living under poverty !
their life is not at all so pleasant as that of children in the big cities , who have adequate toys , snacks and money in their daily life !
brownie , beijing , china i am amazed by the tremendous improvements that have been achieved so , kuala lumpur , malaysia to understand china , one has to first and foremost understand ' chinese culture ' .
we chinese have always placed great respect on elders , both within the family and outside it .
this is probably the reason most non-chinese people would think that chinese wanted a strong totalitarian government to lead them back to the greatness that we had experienced before .
i am constantly reminded of a popular lay-phrase that i heard when travelling around china sometime ago - the central government set rules and regulations , we the common folks have methods to circumvent them -lrb- yet seemingly to comply with them -rrb- !
i am amazed by the tremendous improvements that have been achieved and am sure that this will continue .
whatever it takes to be a superpower , please try not to judge china with your own pre-conceived ideas of it .
china is not the united states -lrb- or any of the developed countries -rrb- .
it is uniquely just china !
so , kuala lumpur , malaysia some may be worried that china will establish itself as a global superpower like the united states , and that it may send its trails around the whole world .
well , we do want to be strong , for we 've suffered a lot in the past , but we do n't want to be powerful .
we have our own culture , which is peaceful , friendly , tolerant and wise - never combative , never furious .
during the tang period , china did n't conquer other nations , although the fact is that our culture did spread a lot .
we want to be strong because we have to .
we never want to be a superpower like the united states because our culture does not allow us to do so .
we hate to mention a word about ruling the world .
i 'm a teenager , aged 18 , and i will follow our great culture seriously in order to build a peaceful world , with a balance between the western and the orient .
what 's more , when i am 81 years old , i will also tell my grandsons and granddaughters to do as i have done .
and that 's for sure , they will fellow me , because of our chinese tradition , and our culture .
zhang rong , chinese now studying in australia a growing china will be a huge benefit to the west .
they may lack democracy as the west knows it but they are liberal in their outlook compared to most other non-democratic countries .
it could also be said that china will also curb the threat of islamic extremism as the islam in its aggressive form will be a hindrance to china in its growing prosperity .
philip shorter , tonbridge , england i am a 40-year-old chinese and have experienced the big change myself in the past 20 years .
i have two basic points .
first , in spite of the economic growth , the main task of china is still nothing else but to fight against poverty .
i believe that , at least in my life time , i will not see china become a real global superpower .
secondly , although there is not a total qualitative change in social life , compared to the time of the cultural revolution , the situation of human rights in china has been improved and this is the main comfort of the most chinese people .
chun , han , berlin , germany china wants to regain its true place amongst the current world order roberto , bristol , uk to fully understand china 's future , you must understand its past .
communism in part was a nationalistic movement and one that was a reaction to the degradations that the west visited upon her in the 19th and early 20th century .
for my part , i believe that communism will be replaced , if it has n't been already .
china wants to regain its true place amongst the current world order , and will keep progressing towards that goal .
roberto , bristol , uk the fact that china got this far is a miracle in itself .
chinese people are not too interested in politics but rather in creating wealth .
the people are quite happy to accept whatever form of government as long as everyone has the opportunity of bettering themselves .
i do not think we want a repetition of the form of government between 1900s1970s .
my father had to leave china at the age of 14 to seek his fortune because they were all starving ! !
soon , exeter , uk i was in beijing and in a very remote village in north china in 2002 .
the transport infrastructures being constructed , even in remote places , are impressive .
but you can also see many poor people who are living on less than $ 2 a day .
a nation can not be successful based on some economical statistics but leaving its people behind .
prasun , the netherlands this is a country that has no respect for human right wei chun , boston , usa the rich get richer and the farmer gets left behind .
i 've been to china several times a year and have seen people complaining about corrupt party officials demolishing their homes without any compensation as originally promised and unreasonable tax collection demands .
this is a country that has no respect for human rights and will not tolerate dissenting view .
this a country where the communist party official is the law of the land .
wei chun , boston , usa i went to china last year with my dad on a tour of tianjin and beijing .
china has come a long way and still has a long way to go before becoming the next " superpower " .
the west tends to exaggerate the threat from beijing but it 's true that china still wields much power in asia .
for example , 6-party talks were organised by the chinese government to defuse north korea 's nuclear crisis and i thank china for their constructive role .
michael jun sung shim , korea shanghai is amazing !
from the air it makes manhattan look insignificant .
and my stay in beijing left no doubt in my mind that the army runs the show .
from thailand to korea and japan , as china 's economy soars , the perceived power of the usa is melting into impotence .
peter gamache , anchorage , alaska i have only seen a glimpse of this extremely complex and beautiful country and love it !
lindsay palmer , johannesburg , south africa i recently spent 6 months teaching english in china in guangzhou and also spent 10 days touring beijing and shanghai in 2000 .
i am struck not only by their determination to become a superpower but also that it is backed by a willingness to sacrifice now to achieve their end goal .
their approach to life and way of thinking is different from the questioning , individualistic way of thinking of the west and i think this is going to take them to the top as a country .
i have only seen a glimpse of this extremely complex and beautiful country and love it !
lindsay palmer , johannesburg , south africa i see all these opinions from people of chinese origin and they confirm my fears .
they are not interested in a peaceful china , a tolerant china , a democratic and liberal china , they want to see the superpower , the best country in the world throwing its weight around and bullying the rest of the world .
it seems to me that they want an imperialistic china as much as they detest any western superpower .
not good , not good at all .
carlos , toronto , canada it is probable that the beijing olympics will give china the platform it needs to show the world that it is interested in development and is looking forward rather than back .
if this is the case , i would like to see china take a leading role in bringing north korea closer to the international community .
luke mclachlan , auckland , new zealand the fact that china is getting stronger should not be feared by the rest of the world .
it could be worse in the future if there was only one superpower in the world as they would throw their weight around in the world of politics , military and commerce .
with two superpowers , there will be balance in the world and the fear of total domination by one nation will be diminished .
william , ireland china will be the most interesting , dynamic nation of the coming century josh , denver , usa china will become increasingly multi-faceted .
even now chinese movies fill our theatres , chinese peacekeepers patrol in haiti , and two chinese engineers are hostages in pakistan .
they 've come a long way from the blue-jacketed masses of the chairman .
my biggest concern in terms of stability and human rights will be that china shifts from communism to oligarchy , much like america 's 19th century " robber barons " - or like pre-1949 china .
that being said , china will be the most interesting , dynamic nation of the coming century .
josh , denver , usa the future of china will be bright and it will also a next superpower .
yes , i have recently visited china , the growth is tremendous in every way .
philip loke , singapore i have been to china , and lived there .
i think the move to a market economy will not be affected by the political system .
if anything the government will seek to extend its control - as is happening in every other country in the world .
china will not become a world power .
the reason is simple .
their ability to produce high return products will be affected by the concentration of that ability in a few select countries - namely , the us , europe and japan .
peter , melbourne , australia china has made a big progress in the last two decades .
we must realise it .
although it still has some disadvantages , we should be more tolerant when the chinese government implements the reform and opening policy .
human rights are being respected .
you can go to china and have a look .
please do not criticise too much if you do not understand a country .
respect others and you will be respected .
please remember !
china has been making a big progress !
yajun zhang , henan , china they are trying to build a compassionate and civic-minded society beng tang , singapore i was in china in august , it struck me as a country that faces great problems , but also has great potential .
what rayan , new orleans , usa said is quite true .
if you look at what us-sponsored " democracy " has led to in russia , compared to the prosperity of the booming chinese cities , chinese people would rather have " socialism with chinese characteristics " and one party rule than that .
at the same time , i was very interested to see the propaganda films on tv which showcase altruistic behaviour , like the story of a village elder who paid off his village 's debts with great self-sacrifice .
that and the very courteous and generous manners of many of the people i met there , is encouraging because it suggests that they are trying to build a compassionate and civic-minded society , to try and temper the materialism and the growing gap between rich and poor that capitalism brings .
as for being a super power , i think china certainly wants to exert a lot of influence in its neighbourhood in asia , but i do n't think it has ambitions of dominating the world , unlike some .
beng tang , singapore -lrb- in uk -rrb- during the economic transition , characterised by a massive influx of western businesses and investments , the chinese government deters political movements by exerting rigorous control over the media .
the effect of this has been significant ; today , anyone who is critical of the government 's actions is labelled as " anti-china . "
china can not and will not be a superpower if the 1.3 billion people are always " pro-china " in every action the government takes .
will , stockholm , sweden it seems to me that the turnaround in china 's fortunes started about the time that hong kong was handed back to them .
if the chinese government continue to listen to voices from hong kong , taiwan and other parts of the world , their economy will continue to grow as western influence makes it mark .
they must be careful , however , not to leave their poor population behind .
graham rodhouse , helmond , the netherlands i disagree that chinese are going to be satisfied with consumer goods for the foreseeable future .
behind closed doors , the chinese i have met and lived with do have a clear desire to be more free and to have their say as individuals .
what 's more , there 's a whole generation of young chinese growing up now that have been educated in the west and come back to their homeland wondering why they do n't have the rights we take for granted .
one day there will have to be political reform , but i just hope it does n't take another tiananmen to do it .
greg , nottingham , uk i see no immediate need for a change in china 's political system wong wan kit , petaling jaya , malaysia i see no immediate need for a change in china 's political system to follow the western system of popular government .
a popular leader does not equals to capable leader .
as long as the governing power is able to lead and manage , the specific type of government is not immediately important for china at this moment .
wong wan kit , petaling jaya , malaysia i have just visited china recently -lrb- two weeks ago -rrb- .
my impressions are that they will become a economic superpower .
however it can only have strong positive impact to the world if it can open up its media and allows a second political party to exist .
by the way , in china , i can not access bbc news website and i wonder if there are any other countries in the world which block all bbc websites .
jason , singapore i am proud that china is once more becoming the most important country in the world .
china has never in it 's history set out to cause trouble in the world .
it traded with the americas way before columbus " discovered " america .
i hope china will play a part on the world stage as a strong powerful but peaceful nation that has given the world so much , and will give the world so much more .
mike cheng , hong kong people from the west are keen to put the human rights issue on the table when talking about china .
in my opinion , china is on the way to a country with greater freedom and greater democracy .
food and shelter is the basis of human rights .
i could n't imagine a country where people want freedom of speech , even freedom of gay marriage when they 're starving .
the party in power had done well in ensuring basic human rights .
i hope my country will grow stronger , fight against corruption and provide better social welfare to chinese people .
chenfu , tampere , finland i want to see democracy in china , but not now !
echo , guangdong , china as a chinese , i want to see china to become the next superpower more than i want to see china become a western style democratic country .
of course , i want to see democracy in china , but not now !
china has a lot of problems to face when going the way to a superpower .
such as taiwan issue , poverty , etc ...
echo , guangdong , china i used to live in beijing and i found that everyone i spoke to , from teachers to taxi drivers , was acutely aware of the freedoms they lack .
did the students in tiananmen square or the practitioners of fa lun gong " not know any different " ?
i doubt it .
in the end , i think china will have no choice but to liberalize : either the government will fail to deliver on the promise of long-term growth and have to offer the incentive of civil liberties to keep the support of the people , or , as the educated , affluent middle class grows in size and strength , so too will its hunger for something more satisfying than mcdonald 's and starbucks .
alexander wille , kakamigahara , japan today , we -lrb- at least i -rrb- complain about the fact the us throws its weight around with little care for the damage it causes .
the china of 50 years from now will be much more difficult to handle .
if only speaking chinese could be as easy as speaking english ...
vassili le moigne , prague , czech republic the future will indeed be a scary place as china will likely be another superpower gerod wattier , wa , usa the future will indeed be a scary place as china will likely be another superpower .
a superpower that is undemocratic and has no respect for human rights .
a nation that is getting stronger economically and militarily every day .
gerod wattier , carnation , wa , usa the problem is the system that china is setting up is something that could very easily work .
the people have had their freedoms repressed by their government for generations - they do n't know any different .
and as long their government allows them to make more money than they normally would under a centrally-planned communist market , you 're not going to get many complaints from them .
they can put a roof over their heads , food on the table , and have some money left over for entertainment that they would n't normally have .
you really think they 're going to care about a one-party system and strict government control over the media when they 're hanging out at a chinese starbucks with their friends , sipping a café ' mocha ?
i do n't think so .
ryan , new orleans , usa i agree totally with ryan of new orleans .
after speaking with many young chinese people overseas , i was astonished by the amazing effect of nationalistic propaganda imposed on the new generation .
any criticism towards the communist party is regarded by them as an attack on the people and nation of china .
the chinese communist party has reinforced its grasp of power very well after putting down the massive democratic movement of 1989 .
i believe the students had good intentions 15 years ago but were overly naïve and hasty .
the movement achieved exactly the opposite of its goals : even if the government at the time was starting to slowly concede more political freedom to the people , it certainly changed its mind in 1989 and decided instead to re-educate the youths to ensure that such challenges to the absolute authority of the party never happened again .
chinese people now immensely enjoy their new found economic freedom and very few are longing for a deeper level of freedom .
the reality is bizarre : china is actually democratic in its own way because the authoritarian one-party rule is really what most chinese people want .
j yang , london , england what is happening in china right now is similar to what occurred during the industrial revolution in the uk lynne , london , uk it took over 200 years for democracy to develop in the western countries like the uk and the us .
why should china be expected to change overnight ?
what is happening in china right now is similar to what occurred during the industrial revolution in the uk .
i do n't seem to hear any people complaining about that ? !
china may well become a super power ... and what of it ?
china was once a great empire - and it will be again !
lynne , london , uk the prospect of china becoming a military and economic power is frightening indeed , especially with absolute power being held by a corrupted and authoritarian government that is not accountable to anybody but itself .
idris m , sydney , australia as someone who is half chinese , i am very happy to see china succeeding after decades of failure .
i do not think the west should be afraid of china .
china wants to do business , not war , with the west .
let china develop itself and slowly give freedom back .
we all remember what happened when russia moved to quickly towards freedom .
china is gradually becoming more and more free , but you have to eat to be free in the first place .
mark , brisbane , australia china has changed a lot in economic policy , and it has improved the living standard in china .
mostly in urban areas of china .
that means still a lot of people in rural areas are living in poor environment .
the communist government abuses basic human rights and bans freedom of religion .
china has greatly threatened regional peace and stability in the asia-pacific area , because china has systematically increased the number of missiles those pointed to taiwan .
china has ignored all the chinese peoples ' rights and freedoms .
if china wo n't change the political system , it wo n't become the superpower , but will cause military competition between taiwan .
it may lead to war in asia-pacific or china will spend high volume of money on military .
johnson kao , australia china will necessarily undergo a social revolution in the next 25 to 50 years mark , usa china will necessarily undergo a social revolution in the next 25 to 50 years even greater than its economic revolution of the last 30 .
china is communist today in name only .
like a snake outgrowing its skin , the current system will prove far too restrictive to allow the kind of expansion it has come to expect .
along with prosperity for many tens and even hundreds of millions will come expectations of freedom of movement and expression that will be irresistible .
look for china to undergo upheavals leading to a thriving democratic nation at peace with itself and the world and preoccupied with its own growth and development by mid century .
mark , usa china 's economic improvement is worth praising but in order for china to become a " real " superpower in the stage of worldwide , interrelated economy , the central government infrastructure must change from the top down .
i live in taiwan and my work involves travelling to china .
any foreigner to china would know that without political change , economic miracle of china will go bust , and burst like a bubble .

i am going through the changing of our city and out country .
i am fortunately among the crowd who have much better life than our parents , but i also see many more chinese people are struggling to make their families survive than ever .
people nowadays always say that china is the hottest hotspot for business opportunity .
however , billions of ordinary chinese people are paying a very heavy price for a few to achieve this so-called significant growth .
please think about how many chinese families are still living under poverty !
their life is not at all so pleasant as that of children in the big cities , who have adequate toys , snacks and money in their daily life !
brownie , beijing , china i am amazed by the tremendous improvements that have been achieved so , kuala lumpur , malaysia to understand china , one has to first and foremost understand ' chinese culture ' .
we chinese have always placed great respect on elders , both within the family and outside it .
this is probably the reason most non-chinese people would think that chinese wanted a strong totalitarian government to lead them back to the greatness that we had experienced before .
i am constantly reminded of a popular lay-phrase that i heard when travelling around china sometime ago - the central government set rules and regulations , we the common folks have methods to circumvent them -lrb- yet seemingly to comply with them -rrb- !
i am amazed by the tremendous improvements that have been achieved and am sure that this will continue .
whatever it takes to be a superpower , please try not to judge china with your own pre-conceived ideas of it .
china is not the united states -lrb- or any of the developed countries -rrb- .
it is uniquely just china !
so , kuala lumpur , malaysia some may be worried that china will establish itself as a global superpower like the united states , and that it may send its trails around the whole world .
well , we do want to be strong , for we 've suffered a lot in the past , but we do n't want to be powerful .
we have our own culture , which is peaceful , friendly , tolerant and wise - never combative , never furious .
during the tang period , china did n't conquer other nations , although the fact is that our culture did spread a lot .
we want to be strong because we have to .
we never want to be a superpower like the united states because our culture does not allow us to do so .
we hate to mention a word about ruling the world .
i 'm a teenager , aged 18 , and i will follow our great culture seriously in order to build a peaceful world , with a balance between the western and the orient .
what 's more , when i am 81 years old , i will also tell my grandsons and granddaughters to do as i have done .
and that 's for sure , they will fellow me , because of our chinese tradition , and our culture .
zhang rong , chinese now studying in australia a growing china will be a huge benefit to the west .
they may lack democracy as the west knows it but they are liberal in their outlook compared to most other non-democratic countries .
it could also be said that china will also curb the threat of islamic extremism as the islam in its aggressive form will be a hindrance to china in its growing prosperity .
philip shorter , tonbridge , england i am a 40-year-old chinese and have experienced the big change myself in the past 20 years .
i have two basic points .
first , in spite of the economic growth , the main task of china is still nothing else but to fight against poverty .
i believe that , at least in my life time , i will not see china become a real global superpower .
secondly , although there is not a total qualitative change in social life , compared to the time of the cultural revolution , the situation of human rights in china has been improved and this is the main comfort of the most chinese people .
chun , han , berlin , germany china wants to regain its true place amongst the current world order roberto , bristol , uk to fully understand china 's future , you must understand its past .
communism in part was a nationalistic movement and one that was a reaction to the degradations that the west visited upon her in the 19th and early 20th century .
for my part , i believe that communism will be replaced , if it has n't been already .
china wants to regain its true place amongst the current world order , and will keep progressing towards that goal .
roberto , bristol , uk the fact that china got this far is a miracle in itself .
chinese people are not too interested in politics but rather in creating wealth .
the people are quite happy to accept whatever form of government as long as everyone has the opportunity of bettering themselves .
i do not think we want a repetition of the form of government between 1900s1970s .
my father had to leave china at the age of 14 to seek his fortune because they were all starving ! !
soon , exeter , uk i was in beijing and in a very remote village in north china in 2002 .
the transport infrastructures being constructed , even in remote places , are impressive .
but you can also see many poor people who are living on less than $ 2 a day .
a nation can not be successful based on some economical statistics but leaving its people behind .
prasun , the netherlands this is a country that has no respect for human right wei chun , boston , usa the rich get richer and the farmer gets left behind .
i 've been to china several times a year and have seen people complaining about corrupt party officials demolishing their homes without any compensation as originally promised and unreasonable tax collection demands .
this is a country that has no respect for human rights and will not tolerate dissenting view .
this a country where the communist party official is the law of the land .
wei chun , boston , usa i went to china last year with my dad on a tour of tianjin and beijing .
china has come a long way and still has a long way to go before becoming the next " superpower " .
the west tends to exaggerate the threat from beijing but it 's true that china still wields much power in asia .
for example , 6-party talks were organised by the chinese government to defuse north korea 's nuclear crisis and i thank china for their constructive role .
michael jun sung shim , korea shanghai is amazing !
from the air it makes manhattan look insignificant .
and my stay in beijing left no doubt in my mind that the army runs the show .
from thailand to korea and japan , as china 's economy soars , the perceived power of the usa is melting into impotence .
peter gamache , anchorage , alaska i have only seen a glimpse of this extremely complex and beautiful country and love it !
lindsay palmer , johannesburg , south africa i recently spent 6 months teaching english in china in guangzhou and also spent 10 days touring beijing and shanghai in 2000 .
i am struck not only by their determination to become a superpower but also that it is backed by a willingness to sacrifice now to achieve their end goal .
their approach to life and way of thinking is different from the questioning , individualistic way of thinking of the west and i think this is going to take them to the top as a country .
i have only seen a glimpse of this extremely complex and beautiful country and love it !
lindsay palmer , johannesburg , south africa i see all these opinions from people of chinese origin and they confirm my fears .
they are not interested in a peaceful china , a tolerant china , a democratic and liberal china , they want to see the superpower , the best country in the world throwing its weight around and bullying the rest of the world .
it seems to me that they want an imperialistic china as much as they detest any western superpower .
not good , not good at all .
carlos , toronto , canada it is probable that the beijing olympics will give china the platform it needs to show the world that it is interested in development and is looking forward rather than back .
if this is the case , i would like to see china take a leading role in bringing north korea closer to the international community .
luke mclachlan , auckland , new zealand the fact that china is getting stronger should not be feared by the rest of the world .
it could be worse in the future if there was only one superpower in the world as they would throw their weight around in the world of politics , military and commerce .
with two superpowers , there will be balance in the world and the fear of total domination by one nation will be diminished .
william , ireland china will be the most interesting , dynamic nation of the coming century josh , denver , usa china will become increasingly multi-faceted .
even now chinese movies fill our theatres , chinese peacekeepers patrol in haiti , and two chinese engineers are hostages in pakistan .
they 've come a long way from the blue-jacketed masses of the chairman .
my biggest concern in terms of stability and human rights will be that china shifts from communism to oligarchy , much like america 's 19th century " robber barons " - or like pre-1949 china .
that being said , china will be the most interesting , dynamic nation of the coming century .
josh , denver , usa the future of china will be bright and it will also a next superpower .
yes , i have recently visited china , the growth is tremendous in every way .
philip loke , singapore i have been to china , and lived there .
i think the move to a market economy will not be affected by the political system .
if anything the government will seek to extend its control - as is happening in every other country in the world .
china will not become a world power .
the reason is simple .
their ability to produce high return products will be affected by the concentration of that ability in a few select countries - namely , the us , europe and japan .
peter , melbourne , australia china has made a big progress in the last two decades .
we must realise it .
although it still has some disadvantages , we should be more tolerant when the chinese government implements the reform and opening policy .
human rights are being respected .
you can go to china and have a look .
please do not criticise too much if you do not understand a country .
respect others and you will be respected .
please remember !
china has been making a big progress !
yajun zhang , henan , china they are trying to build a compassionate and civic-minded society beng tang , singapore i was in china in august , it struck me as a country that faces great problems , but also has great potential .
what rayan , new orleans , usa said is quite true .
if you look at what us-sponsored " democracy " has led to in russia , compared to the prosperity of the booming chinese cities , chinese people would rather have " socialism with chinese characteristics " and one party rule than that .
at the same time , i was very interested to see the propaganda films on tv which showcase altruistic behaviour , like the story of a village elder who paid off his village 's debts with great self-sacrifice .
that and the very courteous and generous manners of many of the people i met there , is encouraging because it suggests that they are trying to build a compassionate and civic-minded society , to try and temper the materialism and the growing gap between rich and poor that capitalism brings .
as for being a super power , i think china certainly wants to exert a lot of influence in its neighbourhood in asia , but i do n't think it has ambitions of dominating the world , unlike some .
beng tang , singapore -lrb- in uk -rrb- during the economic transition , characterised by a massive influx of western businesses and investments , the chinese government deters political movements by exerting rigorous control over the media .
the effect of this has been significant ; today , anyone who is critical of the government 's actions is labelled as " anti-china . "
china can not and will not be a superpower if the 1.3 billion people are always " pro-china " in every action the government takes .
will , stockholm , sweden it seems to me that the turnaround in china 's fortunes started about the time that hong kong was handed back to them .
if the chinese government continue to listen to voices from hong kong , taiwan and other parts of the world , their economy will continue to grow as western influence makes it mark .
they must be careful , however , not to leave their poor population behind .
graham rodhouse , helmond , the netherlands i disagree that chinese are going to be satisfied with consumer goods for the foreseeable future .
behind closed doors , the chinese i have met and lived with do have a clear desire to be more free and to have their say as individuals .
what 's more , there 's a whole generation of young chinese growing up now that have been educated in the west and come back to their homeland wondering why they do n't have the rights we take for granted .
one day there will have to be political reform , but i just hope it does n't take another tiananmen to do it .
greg , nottingham , uk i see no immediate need for a change in china 's political system wong wan kit , petaling jaya , malaysia i see no immediate need for a change in china 's political system to follow the western system of popular government .
a popular leader does not equals to capable leader .
as long as the governing power is able to lead and manage , the specific type of government is not immediately important for china at this moment .
wong wan kit , petaling jaya , malaysia i have just visited china recently -lrb- two weeks ago -rrb- .
my impressions are that they will become a economic superpower .
however it can only have strong positive impact to the world if it can open up its media and allows a second political party to exist .
by the way , in china , i can not access bbc news website and i wonder if there are any other countries in the world which block all bbc websites .
jason , singapore i am proud that china is once more becoming the most important country in the world .
china has never in it 's history set out to cause trouble in the world .
it traded with the americas way before columbus " discovered " america .
i hope china will play a part on the world stage as a strong powerful but peaceful nation that has given the world so much , and will give the world so much more .
mike cheng , hong kong people from the west are keen to put the human rights issue on the table when talking about china .
in my opinion , china is on the way to a country with greater freedom and greater democracy .
food and shelter is the basis of human rights .
i could n't imagine a country where people want freedom of speech , even freedom of gay marriage when they 're starving .
the party in power had done well in ensuring basic human rights .
i hope my country will grow stronger , fight against corruption and provide better social welfare to chinese people .
chenfu , tampere , finland i want to see democracy in china , but not now !
echo , guangdong , china as a chinese , i want to see china to become the next superpower more than i want to see china become a western style democratic country .
of course , i want to see democracy in china , but not now !
china has a lot of problems to face when going the way to a superpower .
such as taiwan issue , poverty , etc ...
echo , guangdong , china i used to live in beijing and i found that everyone i spoke to , from teachers to taxi drivers , was acutely aware of the freedoms they lack .
did the students in tiananmen square or the practitioners of fa lun gong " not know any different " ?
i doubt it .
in the end , i think china will have no choice but to liberalize : either the government will fail to deliver on the promise of long-term growth and have to offer the incentive of civil liberties to keep the support of the people , or , as the educated , affluent middle class grows in size and strength , so too will its hunger for something more satisfying than mcdonald 's and starbucks .
alexander wille , kakamigahara , japan today , we -lrb- at least i -rrb- complain about the fact the us throws its weight around with little care for the damage it causes .
the china of 50 years from now will be much more difficult to handle .
if only speaking chinese could be as easy as speaking english ...
vassili le moigne , prague , czech republic the future will indeed be a scary place as china will likely be another superpower gerod wattier , wa , usa the future will indeed be a scary place as china will likely be another superpower .
a superpower that is undemocratic and has no respect for human rights .
a nation that is getting stronger economically and militarily every day .
gerod wattier , carnation , wa , usa the problem is the system that china is setting up is something that could very easily work .
the people have had their freedoms repressed by their government for generations - they do n't know any different .
and as long their government allows them to make more money than they normally would under a centrally-planned communist market , you 're not going to get many complaints from them .
they can put a roof over their heads , food on the table , and have some money left over for entertainment that they would n't normally have .
you really think they 're going to care about a one-party system and strict government control over the media when they 're hanging out at a chinese starbucks with their friends , sipping a café ' mocha ?
i do n't think so .
ryan , new orleans , usa i agree totally with ryan of new orleans .
after speaking with many young chinese people overseas , i was astonished by the amazing effect of nationalistic propaganda imposed on the new generation .
any criticism towards the communist party is regarded by them as an attack on the people and nation of china .
the chinese communist party has reinforced its grasp of power very well after putting down the massive democratic movement of 1989 .
i believe the students had good intentions 15 years ago but were overly naïve and hasty .
the movement achieved exactly the opposite of its goals : even if the government at the time was starting to slowly concede more political freedom to the people , it certainly changed its mind in 1989 and decided instead to re-educate the youths to ensure that such challenges to the absolute authority of the party never happened again .
chinese people now immensely enjoy their new found economic freedom and very few are longing for a deeper level of freedom .
the reality is bizarre : china is actually democratic in its own way because the authoritarian one-party rule is really what most chinese people want .
j yang , london , england what is happening in china right now is similar to what occurred during the industrial revolution in the uk lynne , london , uk it took over 200 years for democracy to develop in the western countries like the uk and the us .
why should china be expected to change overnight ?
what is happening in china right now is similar to what occurred during the industrial revolution in the uk .
i do n't seem to hear any people complaining about that ? !
china may well become a super power ... and what of it ?
china was once a great empire - and it will be again !
lynne , london , uk the prospect of china becoming a military and economic power is frightening indeed , especially with absolute power being held by a corrupted and authoritarian government that is not accountable to anybody but itself .
idris m , sydney , australia as someone who is half chinese , i am very happy to see china succeeding after decades of failure .
i do not think the west should be afraid of china .
china wants to do business , not war , with the west .
let china develop itself and slowly give freedom back .
we all remember what happened when russia moved to quickly towards freedom .
china is gradually becoming more and more free , but you have to eat to be free in the first place .
mark , brisbane , australia china has changed a lot in economic policy , and it has improved the living standard in china .
mostly in urban areas of china .
that means still a lot of people in rural areas are living in poor environment .
the communist government abuses basic human rights and bans freedom of religion .
china has greatly threatened regional peace and stability in the asia-pacific area , because china has systematically increased the number of missiles those pointed to taiwan .
china has ignored all the chinese peoples ' rights and freedoms .
if china wo n't change the political system , it wo n't become the superpower , but will cause military competition between taiwan .
it may lead to war in asia-pacific or china will spend high volume of money on military .
johnson kao , australia china will necessarily undergo a social revolution in the next 25 to 50 years mark , usa china will necessarily undergo a social revolution in the next 25 to 50 years even greater than its economic revolution of the last 30 .
china is communist today in name only .
like a snake outgrowing its skin , the current system will prove far too restrictive to allow the kind of expansion it has come to expect .
along with prosperity for many tens and even hundreds of millions will come expectations of freedom of movement and expression that will be irresistible .
look for china to undergo upheavals leading to a thriving democratic nation at peace with itself and the world and preoccupied with its own growth and development by mid century .
mark , usa china 's economic improvement is worth praising but in order for china to become a " real " superpower in the stage of worldwide , interrelated economy , the central government infrastructure must change from the top down .
i live in taiwan and my work involves travelling to china .
any foreigner to china would know that without political change , economic miracle of china will go bust , and burst like a bubble .

china has emerged as the likeliest challenger to the united states as a global superpower .
it has the world 's fastest growing economy , with millions moving to the country 's rapidly expanding cities .
the boom was triggered by a move towards a market-style economy and away from the centrally-planned communist model of 20 years ago .
however , economic change has not been accompanied by political reform and the government still maintains strict control over opposition and the media .
what does the future hold for china ?
have you experienced the changes of the last 20 years ?
do you live in china - or have you visited recently ?
if so , send us your impressions .

your comments : i am an overseas chinese currently living in sydney .
although i grew up for most of my childhood and all of my teenager years in australia , i 've never forgotten my homeland , china .
every year 's end i return to visit my hometown , shanghai , for two particular reasons ; not forgetting i am a chinese , and to absorb inspirations .
shanghai in particular has modernized in an unimaginable manner , with constructions being carried out 24/7 and has one of the highest fdi rates amongst many -lrb- if not any -rrb- cities in the world .
each time i return , i would n't be able to recognize places if it was n't for the street signs .
since i left china in 1991 at the age of 8 , my memories of china were colourless .
people had similar clothing , furniture and clustered housings .
now all of that has changed with the addition of private cars , an increasing taste for western sports , music and culture .
indeed , china has somewhat tarnished in its own cultural uniqueness in many ways , but i think the reason is that the china has been deprived for too long -lrb- ever since the collapse of the qing dynasty -rrb- , hence it is no surprise that the chinese want to rapidly absorb the best of all worlds .
jia-jie xu , sydney , australia here in anhui the benefits of trickle down from the new rich and middle class are evident .
sadly it does n't seem to trickle down to the poorest .
begging is on the increase and people fight to take away my rubbish .
recently prices have begun to increase more rapidly and the wages of the poorest are static or even falling .
whether the wealthy can continue to uphold the facade of an improving life for all is probably the big question of the next 5 years .
adam porter , ma 'anshan , anhui , china being a chinese myself , i had n't seen china in an objective way before i came to study in australia .
i never questioned or even bothered to think about communism , since the impact of that " scary " word on my life is hardly noticeable .
i 'm from a middle class family .
my life has been as comfortable as it can be .
but while i 'm here in melbourne , and after witnessing the election campaign , i keep realizing how far we are from real democracy .
the bright side is , for the last 25 years china has been striving to open to the world .
we started to understand each other more as distinct cultures , than political rivals .
dan wang , melbourne , australia the inequality in the new chinese society is very obvious yongdan li , berkeley , california , usa i was only a child when i left mainland china .
back then , there was only one mcdonalds and one kfc .
most major stores were still very much state-owned .
however , i 've seen some amazing changes during visits to my homeland over the past several years .
everything has become highly commercialized and influenced by western trends .
mcdonalds , wal-marts and even starbucks have sprung up everywhere .
another big change has been the amount of information from abroad that has been exposed to mainland chinese .
now everyone knows the major stars from america and what movies in the us have been top box office hits , as well as the political scandals and bush 's speech mishaps .
these changes have all been very exciting to me .
at the same time , the hutong and the streets leading up to all the places i knew as a child have been bulldozed and paved over - replaced by more modern-looking structures .
part of me misses the scenery of " old china " that i know i very possibly would never see again , but i feel that change is good .
change might involve inequality and difficulties , but if china had n't gone through these changes , it would n't have made any progress .
when i visited china this summer , i dined in a little noodle shop where one bowl of noodle cost only 1 yuan -lrb- a little more than 10 cents -rrb- , i also ate at mcdonalds , where it cost me 17 times more money .
the inequality in the new chinese society is very obvious , but i 'm confident china has the potential to work things out .
let 's give it time .
yongdan li , berkeley , california , usa i am a beijing born chinese and have been living in the city for almost my entire life .
i am going through the changing of our city and out country .
i am fortunately among the crowd who have much better life than our parents , but i also see many more chinese people are struggling to make their families survive than ever .

i have only seen a glimpse of this extremely complex and beautiful country and love it !
lindsay palmer , johannesburg , south africa i see all these opinions from people of chinese origin and they confirm my fears .
they are not interested in a peaceful china , a tolerant china , a democratic and liberal china , they want to see the superpower , the best country in the world throwing its weight around and bullying the rest of the world .
it seems to me that they want an imperialistic china as much as they detest any western superpower .
not good , not good at all .
carlos , toronto , canada it is probable that the beijing olympics will give china the platform it needs to show the world that it is interested in development and is looking forward rather than back .
if this is the case , i would like to see china take a leading role in bringing north korea closer to the international community .
luke mclachlan , auckland , new zealand the fact that china is getting stronger should not be feared by the rest of the world .
it could be worse in the future if there was only one superpower in the world as they would throw their weight around in the world of politics , military and commerce .
with two superpowers , there will be balance in the world and the fear of total domination by one nation will be diminished .
william , ireland china will be the most interesting , dynamic nation of the coming century josh , denver , usa china will become increasingly multi-faceted .
even now chinese movies fill our theatres , chinese peacekeepers patrol in haiti , and two chinese engineers are hostages in pakistan .
they 've come a long way from the blue-jacketed masses of the chairman .
my biggest concern in terms of stability and human rights will be that china shifts from communism to oligarchy , much like america 's 19th century " robber barons " - or like pre-1949 china .
that being said , china will be the most interesting , dynamic nation of the coming century .
josh , denver , usa the future of china will be bright and it will also a next superpower .
yes , i have recently visited china , the growth is tremendous in every way .
philip loke , singapore i have been to china , and lived there .
i think the move to a market economy will not be affected by the political system .
if anything the government will seek to extend its control - as is happening in every other country in the world .
china will not become a world power .
the reason is simple .
their ability to produce high return products will be affected by the concentration of that ability in a few select countries - namely , the us , europe and japan .
peter , melbourne , australia china has made a big progress in the last two decades .
we must realise it .
although it still has some disadvantages , we should be more tolerant when the chinese government implements the reform and opening policy .
human rights are being respected .
you can go to china and have a look .
please do not criticise too much if you do not understand a country .
respect others and you will be respected .
please remember !
china has been making a big progress !
yajun zhang , henan , china they are trying to build a compassionate and civic-minded society beng tang , singapore i was in china in august , it struck me as a country that faces great problems , but also has great potential .
what rayan , new orleans , usa said is quite true .
if you look at what us-sponsored " democracy " has led to in russia , compared to the prosperity of the booming chinese cities , chinese people would rather have " socialism with chinese characteristics " and one party rule than that .
at the same time , i was very interested to see the propaganda films on tv which showcase altruistic behaviour , like the story of a village elder who paid off his village 's debts with great self-sacrifice .
that and the very courteous and generous manners of many of the people i met there , is encouraging because it suggests that they are trying to build a compassionate and civic-minded society , to try and temper the materialism and the growing gap between rich and poor that capitalism brings .
as for being a super power , i think china certainly wants to exert a lot of influence in its neighbourhood in asia , but i do n't think it has ambitions of dominating the world , unlike some .
beng tang , singapore -lrb- in uk -rrb- during the economic transition , characterised by a massive influx of western businesses and investments , the chinese government deters political movements by exerting rigorous control over the media .
the effect of this has been significant ; today , anyone who is critical of the government 's actions is labelled as " anti-china . "
china can not and will not be a superpower if the 1.3 billion people are always " pro-china " in every action the government takes .
will , stockholm , sweden it seems to me that the turnaround in china 's fortunes started about the time that hong kong was handed back to them .
if the chinese government continue to listen to voices from hong kong , taiwan and other parts of the world , their economy will continue to grow as western influence makes it mark .
they must be careful , however , not to leave their poor population behind .
graham rodhouse , helmond , the netherlands i disagree that chinese are going to be satisfied with consumer goods for the foreseeable future .
behind closed doors , the chinese i have met and lived with do have a clear desire to be more free and to have their say as individuals .
what 's more , there 's a whole generation of young chinese growing up now that have been educated in the west and come back to their homeland wondering why they do n't have the rights we take for granted .
one day there will have to be political reform , but i just hope it does n't take another tiananmen to do it .
greg , nottingham , uk i see no immediate need for a change in china 's political system wong wan kit , petaling jaya , malaysia i see no immediate need for a change in china 's political system to follow the western system of popular government .
a popular leader does not equals to capable leader .
as long as the governing power is able to lead and manage , the specific type of government is not immediately important for china at this moment .
wong wan kit , petaling jaya , malaysia i have just visited china recently -lrb- two weeks ago -rrb- .
my impressions are that they will become a economic superpower .
however it can only have strong positive impact to the world if it can open up its media and allows a second political party to exist .
by the way , in china , i can not access bbc news website and i wonder if there are any other countries in the world which block all bbc websites .
jason , singapore i am proud that china is once more becoming the most important country in the world .
china has never in it 's history set out to cause trouble in the world .
it traded with the americas way before columbus " discovered " america .
i hope china will play a part on the world stage as a strong powerful but peaceful nation that has given the world so much , and will give the world so much more .
mike cheng , hong kong people from the west are keen to put the human rights issue on the table when talking about china .
in my opinion , china is on the way to a country with greater freedom and greater democracy .
food and shelter is the basis of human rights .
i could n't imagine a country where people want freedom of speech , even freedom of gay marriage when they 're starving .
the party in power had done well in ensuring basic human rights .
i hope my country will grow stronger , fight against corruption and provide better social welfare to chinese people .
chenfu , tampere , finland i want to see democracy in china , but not now !
echo , guangdong , china as a chinese , i want to see china to become the next superpower more than i want to see china become a western style democratic country .
of course , i want to see democracy in china , but not now !
china has a lot of problems to face when going the way to a superpower .
such as taiwan issue , poverty , etc ...
echo , guangdong , china i used to live in beijing and i found that everyone i spoke to , from teachers to taxi drivers , was acutely aware of the freedoms they lack .
did the students in tiananmen square or the practitioners of fa lun gong " not know any different " ?
i doubt it .
in the end , i think china will have no choice but to liberalize : either the government will fail to deliver on the promise of long-term growth and have to offer the incentive of civil liberties to keep the support of the people , or , as the educated , affluent middle class grows in size and strength , so too will its hunger for something more satisfying than mcdonald 's and starbucks .
alexander wille , kakamigahara , japan today , we -lrb- at least i -rrb- complain about the fact the us throws its weight around with little care for the damage it causes .
the china of 50 years from now will be much more difficult to handle .
if only speaking chinese could be as easy as speaking english ...
vassili le moigne , prague , czech republic the future will indeed be a scary place as china will likely be another superpower gerod wattier , wa , usa the future will indeed be a scary place as china will likely be another superpower .
a superpower that is undemocratic and has no respect for human rights .
a nation that is getting stronger economically and militarily every day .
gerod wattier , carnation , wa , usa the problem is the system that china is setting up is something that could very easily work .
the people have had their freedoms repressed by their government for generations - they do n't know any different .
and as long their government allows them to make more money than they normally would under a centrally-planned communist market , you 're not going to get many complaints from them .
they can put a roof over their heads , food on the table , and have some money left over for entertainment that they would n't normally have .
you really think they 're going to care about a one-party system and strict government control over the media when they 're hanging out at a chinese starbucks with their friends , sipping a café ' mocha ?
i do n't think so .
ryan , new orleans , usa i agree totally with ryan of new orleans .
after speaking with many young chinese people overseas , i was astonished by the amazing effect of nationalistic propaganda imposed on the new generation .
any criticism towards the communist party is regarded by them as an attack on the people and nation of china .
the chinese communist party has reinforced its grasp of power very well after putting down the massive democratic movement of 1989 .
i believe the students had good intentions 15 years ago but were overly naïve and hasty .
the movement achieved exactly the opposite of its goals : even if the government at the time was starting to slowly concede more political freedom to the people , it certainly changed its mind in 1989 and decided instead to re-educate the youths to ensure that such challenges to the absolute authority of the party never happened again .
chinese people now immensely enjoy their new found economic freedom and very few are longing for a deeper level of freedom .
the reality is bizarre : china is actually democratic in its own way because the authoritarian one-party rule is really what most chinese people want .
j yang , london , england what is happening in china right now is similar to what occurred during the industrial revolution in the uk lynne , london , uk it took over 200 years for democracy to develop in the western countries like the uk and the us .
why should china be expected to change overnight ?
what is happening in china right now is similar to what occurred during the industrial revolution in the uk .
i do n't seem to hear any people complaining about that ? !
china may well become a super power ... and what of it ?
china was once a great empire - and it will be again !
lynne , london , uk the prospect of china becoming a military and economic power is frightening indeed , especially with absolute power being held by a corrupted and authoritarian government that is not accountable to anybody but itself .
idris m , sydney , australia as someone who is half chinese , i am very happy to see china succeeding after decades of failure .
i do not think the west should be afraid of china .
china wants to do business , not war , with the west .
let china develop itself and slowly give freedom back .
we all remember what happened when russia moved to quickly towards freedom .
china is gradually becoming more and more free , but you have to eat to be free in the first place .
mark , brisbane , australia china has changed a lot in economic policy , and it has improved the living standard in china .
mostly in urban areas of china .
that means still a lot of people in rural areas are living in poor environment .
the communist government abuses basic human rights and bans freedom of religion .
china has greatly threatened regional peace and stability in the asia-pacific area , because china has systematically increased the number of missiles those pointed to taiwan .
china has ignored all the chinese peoples ' rights and freedoms .
if china wo n't change the political system , it wo n't become the superpower , but will cause military competition between taiwan .
it may lead to war in asia-pacific or china will spend high volume of money on military .
johnson kao , australia china will necessarily undergo a social revolution in the next 25 to 50 years mark , usa china will necessarily undergo a social revolution in the next 25 to 50 years even greater than its economic revolution of the last 30 .
china is communist today in name only .
like a snake outgrowing its skin , the current system will prove far too restrictive to allow the kind of expansion it has come to expect .
along with prosperity for many tens and even hundreds of millions will come expectations of freedom of movement and expression that will be irresistible .
look for china to undergo upheavals leading to a thriving democratic nation at peace with itself and the world and preoccupied with its own growth and development by mid century .
mark , usa china 's economic improvement is worth praising but in order for china to become a " real " superpower in the stage of worldwide , interrelated economy , the central government infrastructure must change from the top down .
i live in taiwan and my work involves travelling to china .
any foreigner to china would know that without political change , economic miracle of china will go bust , and burst like a bubble .

china has emerged as the likeliest challenger to the united states as a global superpower .
it has the world 's fastest growing economy , with millions moving to the country 's rapidly expanding cities .
the boom was triggered by a move towards a market-style economy and away from the centrally-planned communist model of 20 years ago .
however , economic change has not been accompanied by political reform and the government still maintains strict control over opposition and the media .
what does the future hold for china ?
have you experienced the changes of the last 20 years ?
do you live in china - or have you visited recently ?
if so , send us your impressions .
chinese voices audio gallery hear what young chinese people around the world think of the changes their country has experienced in our audio gallery .
your comments : i am an overseas chinese currently living in sydney .
although i grew up for most of my childhood and all of my teenager years in australia , i 've never forgotten my homeland , china .
every year 's end i return to visit my hometown , shanghai , for two particular reasons ; not forgetting i am a chinese , and to absorb inspirations .
shanghai in particular has modernized in an unimaginable manner , with constructions being carried out 24/7 and has one of the highest fdi rates amongst many -lrb- if not any -rrb- cities in the world .
each time i return , i would n't be able to recognize places if it was n't for the street signs .
since i left china in 1991 at the age of 8 , my memories of china were colourless .
people had similar clothing , furniture and clustered housings .
now all of that has changed with the addition of private cars , an increasing taste for western sports , music and culture .
indeed , china has somewhat tarnished in its own cultural uniqueness in many ways , but i think the reason is that the china has been deprived for too long -lrb- ever since the collapse of the qing dynasty -rrb- , hence it is no surprise that the chinese want to rapidly absorb the best of all worlds .
jia-jie xu , sydney , australia here in anhui the benefits of trickle down from the new rich and middle class are evident .
sadly it does n't seem to trickle down to the poorest .
begging is on the increase and people fight to take away my rubbish .
recently prices have begun to increase more rapidly and the wages of the poorest are static or even falling .
whether the wealthy can continue to uphold the facade of an improving life for all is probably the big question of the next 5 years .
adam porter , ma 'anshan , anhui , china being a chinese myself , i had n't seen china in an objective way before i came to study in australia .
i never questioned or even bothered to think about communism , since the impact of that " scary " word on my life is hardly noticeable .
i 'm from a middle class family .
my life has been as comfortable as it can be .
but while i 'm here in melbourne , and after witnessing the election campaign , i keep realizing how far we are from real democracy .
the bright side is , for the last 25 years china has been striving to open to the world .
we started to understand each other more as distinct cultures , than political rivals .
dan wang , melbourne , australia the inequality in the new chinese society is very obvious yongdan li , berkeley , california , usa i was only a child when i left mainland china .
back then , there was only one mcdonalds and one kfc .
most major stores were still very much state-owned .
however , i 've seen some amazing changes during visits to my homeland over the past several years .
everything has become highly commercialized and influenced by western trends .
mcdonalds , wal-marts and even starbucks have sprung up everywhere .
another big change has been the amount of information from abroad that has been exposed to mainland chinese .
now everyone knows the major stars from america and what movies in the us have been top box office hits , as well as the political scandals and bush 's speech mishaps .
these changes have all been very exciting to me .
at the same time , the hutong and the streets leading up to all the places i knew as a child have been bulldozed and paved over - replaced by more modern-looking structures .
part of me misses the scenery of " old china " that i know i very possibly would never see again , but i feel that change is good .
change might involve inequality and difficulties , but if china had n't gone through these changes , it would n't have made any progress .
when i visited china this summer , i dined in a little noodle shop where one bowl of noodle cost only 1 yuan -lrb- a little more than 10 cents -rrb- , i also ate at mcdonalds , where it cost me 17 times more money .
the inequality in the new chinese society is very obvious , but i 'm confident china has the potential to work things out .
let 's give it time .
yongdan li , berkeley , california , usa i am a beijing born chinese and have been living in the city for almost my entire life .
i am going through the changing of our city and out country .
i am fortunately among the crowd who have much better life than our parents , but i also see many more chinese people are struggling to make their families survive than ever .
people nowadays always say that china is the hottest hotspot for business opportunity .
however , billions of ordinary chinese people are paying a very heavy price for a few to achieve this so-called significant growth .
please think about how many chinese families are still living under poverty !
their life is not at all so pleasant as that of children in the big cities , who have adequate toys , snacks and money in their daily life !
brownie , beijing , china i am amazed by the tremendous improvements that have been achieved so , kuala lumpur , malaysia to understand china , one has to first and foremost understand ' chinese culture ' .
we chinese have always placed great respect on elders , both within the family and outside it .
this is probably the reason most non-chinese people would think that chinese wanted a strong totalitarian government to lead them back to the greatness that we had experienced before .
i am constantly reminded of a popular lay-phrase that i heard when travelling around china sometime ago - the central government set rules and regulations , we the common folks have methods to circumvent them -lrb- yet seemingly to comply with them -rrb- !
i am amazed by the tremendous improvements that have been achieved and am sure that this will continue .
whatever it takes to be a superpower , please try not to judge china with your own pre-conceived ideas of it .
china is not the united states -lrb- or any of the developed countries -rrb- .
it is uniquely just china !
so , kuala lumpur , malaysia some may be worried that china will establish itself as a global superpower like the united states , and that it may send its trails around the whole world .
well , we do want to be strong , for we 've suffered a lot in the past , but we do n't want to be powerful .
we have our own culture , which is peaceful , friendly , tolerant and wise - never combative , never furious .
during the tang period , china did n't conquer other nations , although the fact is that our culture did spread a lot .
we want to be strong because we have to .
we never want to be a superpower like the united states because our culture does not allow us to do so .
we hate to mention a word about ruling the world .
i 'm a teenager , aged 18 , and i will follow our great culture seriously in order to build a peaceful world , with a balance between the western and the orient .
what 's more , when i am 81 years old , i will also tell my grandsons and granddaughters to do as i have done .
and that 's for sure , they will fellow me , because of our chinese tradition , and our culture .
zhang rong , chinese now studying in australia a growing china will be a huge benefit to the west .
they may lack democracy as the west knows it but they are liberal in their outlook compared to most other non-democratic countries .
it could also be said that china will also curb the threat of islamic extremism as the islam in its aggressive form will be a hindrance to china in its growing prosperity .
philip shorter , tonbridge , england i am a 40-year-old chinese and have experienced the big change myself in the past 20 years .
i have two basic points .
first , in spite of the economic growth , the main task of china is still nothing else but to fight against poverty .
i believe that , at least in my life time , i will not see china become a real global superpower .
secondly , although there is not a total qualitative change in social life , compared to the time of the cultural revolution , the situation of human rights in china has been improved and this is the main comfort of the most chinese people .
chun , han , berlin , germany china wants to regain its true place amongst the current world order roberto , bristol , uk to fully understand china 's future , you must understand its past .
communism in part was a nationalistic movement and one that was a reaction to the degradations that the west visited upon her in the 19th and early 20th century .
for my part , i believe that communism will be replaced , if it has n't been already .
china wants to regain its true place amongst the current world order , and will keep progressing towards that goal .
roberto , bristol , uk the fact that china got this far is a miracle in itself .
chinese people are not too interested in politics but rather in creating wealth .
the people are quite happy to accept whatever form of government as long as everyone has the opportunity of bettering themselves .
i do not think we want a repetition of the form of government between 1900s1970s .
my father had to leave china at the age of 14 to seek his fortune because they were all starving ! !
soon , exeter , uk i was in beijing and in a very remote village in north china in 2002 .
the transport infrastructures being constructed , even in remote places , are impressive .
but you can also see many poor people who are living on less than $ 2 a day .
a nation can not be successful based on some economical statistics but leaving its people behind .
prasun , the netherlands this is a country that has no respect for human right wei chun , boston , usa the rich get richer and the farmer gets left behind .
i 've been to china several times a year and have seen people complaining about corrupt party officials demolishing their homes without any compensation as originally promised and unreasonable tax collection demands .
this is a country that has no respect for human rights and will not tolerate dissenting view .
this a country where the communist party official is the law of the land .
wei chun , boston , usa i went to china last year with my dad on a tour of tianjin and beijing .
china has come a long way and still has a long way to go before becoming the next " superpower " .
the west tends to exaggerate the threat from beijing but it 's true that china still wields much power in asia .
for example , 6-party talks were organised by the chinese government to defuse north korea 's nuclear crisis and i thank china for their constructive role .
michael jun sung shim , korea shanghai is amazing !
from the air it makes manhattan look insignificant .
and my stay in beijing left no doubt in my mind that the army runs the show .
from thailand to korea and japan , as china 's economy soars , the perceived power of the usa is melting into impotence .
peter gamache , anchorage , alaska i have only seen a glimpse of this extremely complex and beautiful country and love it !
lindsay palmer , johannesburg , south africa i recently spent 6 months teaching english in china in guangzhou and also spent 10 days touring beijing and shanghai in 2000 .
i am struck not only by their determination to become a superpower but also that it is backed by a willingness to sacrifice now to achieve their end goal .
their approach to life and way of thinking is different from the questioning , individualistic way of thinking of the west and i think this is going to take them to the top as a country .
i have only seen a glimpse of this extremely complex and beautiful country and love it !
lindsay palmer , johannesburg , south africa i see all these opinions from people of chinese origin and they confirm my fears .
they are not interested in a peaceful china , a tolerant china , a democratic and liberal china , they want to see the superpower , the best country in the world throwing its weight around and bullying the rest of the world .
it seems to me that they want an imperialistic china as much as they detest any western superpower .
not good , not good at all .
carlos , toronto , canada it is probable that the beijing olympics will give china the platform it needs to show the world that it is interested in development and is looking forward rather than back .
if this is the case , i would like to see china take a leading role in bringing north korea closer to the international community .
luke mclachlan , auckland , new zealand the fact that china is getting stronger should not be feared by the rest of the world .
it could be worse in the future if there was only one superpower in the world as they would throw their weight around in the world of politics , military and commerce .
with two superpowers , there will be balance in the world and the fear of total domination by one nation will be diminished .
william , ireland china will be the most interesting , dynamic nation of the coming century josh , denver , usa china will become increasingly multi-faceted .
even now chinese movies fill our theatres , chinese peacekeepers patrol in haiti , and two chinese engineers are hostages in pakistan .
they 've come a long way from the blue-jacketed masses of the chairman .
my biggest concern in terms of stability and human rights will be that china shifts from communism to oligarchy , much like america 's 19th century " robber barons " - or like pre-1949 china .
that being said , china will be the most interesting , dynamic nation of the coming century .
josh , denver , usa the future of china will be bright and it will also a next superpower .
yes , i have recently visited china , the growth is tremendous in every way .
philip loke , singapore i have been to china , and lived there .
i think the move to a market economy will not be affected by the political system .
if anything the government will seek to extend its control - as is happening in every other country in the world .
china will not become a world power .
the reason is simple .
their ability to produce high return products will be affected by the concentration of that ability in a few select countries - namely , the us , europe and japan .
peter , melbourne , australia china has made a big progress in the last two decades .
we must realise it .
although it still has some disadvantages , we should be more tolerant when the chinese government implements the reform and opening policy .
human rights are being respected .

mike cheng , hong kong people from the west are keen to put the human rights issue on the table when talking about china .
in my opinion , china is on the way to a country with greater freedom and greater democracy .
food and shelter is the basis of human rights .
i could n't imagine a country where people want freedom of speech , even freedom of gay marriage when they 're starving .
the party in power had done well in ensuring basic human rights .
i hope my country will grow stronger , fight against corruption and provide better social welfare to chinese people .
chenfu , tampere , finland i want to see democracy in china , but not now !
echo , guangdong , china as a chinese , i want to see china to become the next superpower more than i want to see china become a western style democratic country .
of course , i want to see democracy in china , but not now !
china has a lot of problems to face when going the way to a superpower .
such as taiwan issue , poverty , etc ...
echo , guangdong , china i used to live in beijing and i found that everyone i spoke to , from teachers to taxi drivers , was acutely aware of the freedoms they lack .
did the students in tiananmen square or the practitioners of fa lun gong " not know any different " ?
i doubt it .
in the end , i think china will have no choice but to liberalize : either the government will fail to deliver on the promise of long-term growth and have to offer the incentive of civil liberties to keep the support of the people , or , as the educated , affluent middle class grows in size and strength , so too will its hunger for something more satisfying than mcdonald 's and starbucks .
alexander wille , kakamigahara , japan today , we -lrb- at least i -rrb- complain about the fact the us throws its weight around with little care for the damage it causes .
the china of 50 years from now will be much more difficult to handle .
if only speaking chinese could be as easy as speaking english ...
vassili le moigne , prague , czech republic the future will indeed be a scary place as china will likely be another superpower gerod wattier , wa , usa the future will indeed be a scary place as china will likely be another superpower .
a superpower that is undemocratic and has no respect for human rights .
a nation that is getting stronger economically and militarily every day .
gerod wattier , carnation , wa , usa the problem is the system that china is setting up is something that could very easily work .
the people have had their freedoms repressed by their government for generations - they do n't know any different .
and as long their government allows them to make more money than they normally would under a centrally-planned communist market , you 're not going to get many complaints from them .
they can put a roof over their heads , food on the table , and have some money left over for entertainment that they would n't normally have .
you really think they 're going to care about a one-party system and strict government control over the media when they 're hanging out at a chinese starbucks with their friends , sipping a café ' mocha ?
i do n't think so .
ryan , new orleans , usa i agree totally with ryan of new orleans .
after speaking with many young chinese people overseas , i was astonished by the amazing effect of nationalistic propaganda imposed on the new generation .
any criticism towards the communist party is regarded by them as an attack on the people and nation of china .
the chinese communist party has reinforced its grasp of power very well after putting down the massive democratic movement of 1989 .
i believe the students had good intentions 15 years ago but were overly naïve and hasty .
the movement achieved exactly the opposite of its goals : even if the government at the time was starting to slowly concede more political freedom to the people , it certainly changed its mind in 1989 and decided instead to re-educate the youths to ensure that such challenges to the absolute authority of the party never happened again .
chinese people now immensely enjoy their new found economic freedom and very few are longing for a deeper level of freedom .
the reality is bizarre : china is actually democratic in its own way because the authoritarian one-party rule is really what most chinese people want .
j yang , london , england what is happening in china right now is similar to what occurred during the industrial revolution in the uk lynne , london , uk it took over 200 years for democracy to develop in the western countries like the uk and the us .
why should china be expected to change overnight ?
what is happening in china right now is similar to what occurred during the industrial revolution in the uk .
i do n't seem to hear any people complaining about that ? !
china may well become a super power ... and what of it ?
china was once a great empire - and it will be again !
lynne , london , uk the prospect of china becoming a military and economic power is frightening indeed , especially with absolute power being held by a corrupted and authoritarian government that is not accountable to anybody but itself .
idris m , sydney , australia as someone who is half chinese , i am very happy to see china succeeding after decades of failure .
i do not think the west should be afraid of china .
china wants to do business , not war , with the west .
let china develop itself and slowly give freedom back .
we all remember what happened when russia moved to quickly towards freedom .
china is gradually becoming more and more free , but you have to eat to be free in the first place .
mark , brisbane , australia china has changed a lot in economic policy , and it has improved the living standard in china .
mostly in urban areas of china .
that means still a lot of people in rural areas are living in poor environment .
the communist government abuses basic human rights and bans freedom of religion .
china has greatly threatened regional peace and stability in the asia-pacific area , because china has systematically increased the number of missiles those pointed to taiwan .
china has ignored all the chinese peoples ' rights and freedoms .
if china wo n't change the political system , it wo n't become the superpower , but will cause military competition between taiwan .
it may lead to war in asia-pacific or china will spend high volume of money on military .
johnson kao , australia china will necessarily undergo a social revolution in the next 25 to 50 years mark , usa china will necessarily undergo a social revolution in the next 25 to 50 years even greater than its economic revolution of the last 30 .
china is communist today in name only .
like a snake outgrowing its skin , the current system will prove far too restrictive to allow the kind of expansion it has come to expect .
along with prosperity for many tens and even hundreds of millions will come expectations of freedom of movement and expression that will be irresistible .
look for china to undergo upheavals leading to a thriving democratic nation at peace with itself and the world and preoccupied with its own growth and development by mid century .
mark , usa china 's economic improvement is worth praising but in order for china to become a " real " superpower in the stage of worldwide , interrelated economy , the central government infrastructure must change from the top down .
i live in taiwan and my work involves travelling to china .
any foreigner to china would know that without political change , economic miracle of china will go bust , and burst like a bubble .

china has emerged as the likeliest challenger to the united states as a global superpower .
it has the world 's fastest growing economy , with millions moving to the country 's rapidly expanding cities .
the boom was triggered by a move towards a market-style economy and away from the centrally-planned communist model of 20 years ago .
however , economic change has not been accompanied by political reform and the government still maintains strict control over opposition and the media .
what does the future hold for china ?
have you experienced the changes of the last 20 years ?
do you live in china - or have you visited recently ?
if so , send us your impressions .
chinese voices audio gallery hear what young chinese people around the world think of the changes their country has experienced in our audio gallery .
your comments : i am an overseas chinese currently living in sydney .
although i grew up for most of my childhood and all of my teenager years in australia , i 've never forgotten my homeland , china .
every year 's end i return to visit my hometown , shanghai , for two particular reasons ; not forgetting i am a chinese , and to absorb inspirations .
shanghai in particular has modernized in an unimaginable manner , with constructions being carried out 24/7 and has one of the highest fdi rates amongst many -lrb- if not any -rrb- cities in the world .
each time i return , i would n't be able to recognize places if it was n't for the street signs .
since i left china in 1991 at the age of 8 , my memories of china were colourless .
people had similar clothing , furniture and clustered housings .
now all of that has changed with the addition of private cars , an increasing taste for western sports , music and culture .
indeed , china has somewhat tarnished in its own cultural uniqueness in many ways , but i think the reason is that the china has been deprived for too long -lrb- ever since the collapse of the qing dynasty -rrb- , hence it is no surprise that the chinese want to rapidly absorb the best of all worlds .
jia-jie xu , sydney , australia here in anhui the benefits of trickle down from the new rich and middle class are evident .
sadly it does n't seem to trickle down to the poorest .
begging is on the increase and people fight to take away my rubbish .
recently prices have begun to increase more rapidly and the wages of the poorest are static or even falling .
whether the wealthy can continue to uphold the facade of an improving life for all is probably the big question of the next 5 years .
adam porter , ma 'anshan , anhui , china being a chinese myself , i had n't seen china in an objective way before i came to study in australia .
i never questioned or even bothered to think about communism , since the impact of that " scary " word on my life is hardly noticeable .
i 'm from a middle class family .
my life has been as comfortable as it can be .
but while i 'm here in melbourne , and after witnessing the election campaign , i keep realizing how far we are from real democracy .
the bright side is , for the last 25 years china has been striving to open to the world .
we started to understand each other more as distinct cultures , than political rivals .
dan wang , melbourne , australia the inequality in the new chinese society is very obvious yongdan li , berkeley , california , usa i was only a child when i left mainland china .
back then , there was only one mcdonalds and one kfc .
most major stores were still very much state-owned .
however , i 've seen some amazing changes during visits to my homeland over the past several years .
everything has become highly commercialized and influenced by western trends .
mcdonalds , wal-marts and even starbucks have sprung up everywhere .
another big change has been the amount of information from abroad that has been exposed to mainland chinese .
now everyone knows the major stars from america and what movies in the us have been top box office hits , as well as the political scandals and bush 's speech mishaps .
these changes have all been very exciting to me .
at the same time , the hutong and the streets leading up to all the places i knew as a child have been bulldozed and paved over - replaced by more modern-looking structures .
part of me misses the scenery of " old china " that i know i very possibly would never see again , but i feel that change is good .
change might involve inequality and difficulties , but if china had n't gone through these changes , it would n't have made any progress .
when i visited china this summer , i dined in a little noodle shop where one bowl of noodle cost only 1 yuan -lrb- a little more than 10 cents -rrb- , i also ate at mcdonalds , where it cost me 17 times more money .
the inequality in the new chinese society is very obvious , but i 'm confident china has the potential to work things out .
let 's give it time .
yongdan li , berkeley , california , usa i am a beijing born chinese and have been living in the city for almost my entire life .
i am going through the changing of our city and out country .
i am fortunately among the crowd who have much better life than our parents , but i also see many more chinese people are struggling to make their families survive than ever .
people nowadays always say that china is the hottest hotspot for business opportunity .
however , billions of ordinary chinese people are paying a very heavy price for a few to achieve this so-called significant growth .
please think about how many chinese families are still living under poverty !
their life is not at all so pleasant as that of children in the big cities , who have adequate toys , snacks and money in their daily life !
brownie , beijing , china i am amazed by the tremendous improvements that have been achieved so , kuala lumpur , malaysia to understand china , one has to first and foremost understand ' chinese culture ' .
we chinese have always placed great respect on elders , both within the family and outside it .
this is probably the reason most non-chinese people would think that chinese wanted a strong totalitarian government to lead them back to the greatness that we had experienced before .
i am constantly reminded of a popular lay-phrase that i heard when travelling around china sometime ago - the central government set rules and regulations , we the common folks have methods to circumvent them -lrb- yet seemingly to comply with them -rrb- !
i am amazed by the tremendous improvements that have been achieved and am sure that this will continue .
whatever it takes to be a superpower , please try not to judge china with your own pre-conceived ideas of it .
china is not the united states -lrb- or any of the developed countries -rrb- .
it is uniquely just china !
so , kuala lumpur , malaysia some may be worried that china will establish itself as a global superpower like the united states , and that it may send its trails around the whole world .
well , we do want to be strong , for we 've suffered a lot in the past , but we do n't want to be powerful .
we have our own culture , which is peaceful , friendly , tolerant and wise - never combative , never furious .
during the tang period , china did n't conquer other nations , although the fact is that our culture did spread a lot .
we want to be strong because we have to .
we never want to be a superpower like the united states because our culture does not allow us to do so .
we hate to mention a word about ruling the world .
i 'm a teenager , aged 18 , and i will follow our great culture seriously in order to build a peaceful world , with a balance between the western and the orient .
what 's more , when i am 81 years old , i will also tell my grandsons and granddaughters to do as i have done .
and that 's for sure , they will fellow me , because of our chinese tradition , and our culture .
zhang rong , chinese now studying in australia a growing china will be a huge benefit to the west .
they may lack democracy as the west knows it but they are liberal in their outlook compared to most other non-democratic countries .
it could also be said that china will also curb the threat of islamic extremism as the islam in its aggressive form will be a hindrance to china in its growing prosperity .
philip shorter , tonbridge , england i am a 40-year-old chinese and have experienced the big change myself in the past 20 years .
i have two basic points .
first , in spite of the economic growth , the main task of china is still nothing else but to fight against poverty .
i believe that , at least in my life time , i will not see china become a real global superpower .
secondly , although there is not a total qualitative change in social life , compared to the time of the cultural revolution , the situation of human rights in china has been improved and this is the main comfort of the most chinese people .
chun , han , berlin , germany china wants to regain its true place amongst the current world order roberto , bristol , uk to fully understand china 's future , you must understand its past .
communism in part was a nationalistic movement and one that was a reaction to the degradations that the west visited upon her in the 19th and early 20th century .
for my part , i believe that communism will be replaced , if it has n't been already .
china wants to regain its true place amongst the current world order , and will keep progressing towards that goal .
roberto , bristol , uk the fact that china got this far is a miracle in itself .
chinese people are not too interested in politics but rather in creating wealth .
the people are quite happy to accept whatever form of government as long as everyone has the opportunity of bettering themselves .
i do not think we want a repetition of the form of government between 1900s1970s .
my father had to leave china at the age of 14 to seek his fortune because they were all starving ! !
soon , exeter , uk i was in beijing and in a very remote village in north china in 2002 .
the transport infrastructures being constructed , even in remote places , are impressive .
but you can also see many poor people who are living on less than $ 2 a day .
a nation can not be successful based on some economical statistics but leaving its people behind .
prasun , the netherlands this is a country that has no respect for human right wei chun , boston , usa the rich get richer and the farmer gets left behind .
i 've been to china several times a year and have seen people complaining about corrupt party officials demolishing their homes without any compensation as originally promised and unreasonable tax collection demands .
this is a country that has no respect for human rights and will not tolerate dissenting view .
this a country where the communist party official is the law of the land .
wei chun , boston , usa i went to china last year with my dad on a tour of tianjin and beijing .
china has come a long way and still has a long way to go before becoming the next " superpower " .
the west tends to exaggerate the threat from beijing but it 's true that china still wields much power in asia .
for example , 6-party talks were organised by the chinese government to defuse north korea 's nuclear crisis and i thank china for their constructive role .
michael jun sung shim , korea shanghai is amazing !
from the air it makes manhattan look insignificant .
and my stay in beijing left no doubt in my mind that the army runs the show .
from thailand to korea and japan , as china 's economy soars , the perceived power of the usa is melting into impotence .
peter gamache , anchorage , alaska i have only seen a glimpse of this extremely complex and beautiful country and love it !
lindsay palmer , johannesburg , south africa i recently spent 6 months teaching english in china in guangzhou and also spent 10 days touring beijing and shanghai in 2000 .
i am struck not only by their determination to become a superpower but also that it is backed by a willingness to sacrifice now to achieve their end goal .
their approach to life and way of thinking is different from the questioning , individualistic way of thinking of the west and i think this is going to take them to the top as a country .
i have only seen a glimpse of this extremely complex and beautiful country and love it !
lindsay palmer , johannesburg , south africa i see all these opinions from people of chinese origin and they confirm my fears .
they are not interested in a peaceful china , a tolerant china , a democratic and liberal china , they want to see the superpower , the best country in the world throwing its weight around and bullying the rest of the world .
it seems to me that they want an imperialistic china as much as they detest any western superpower .
not good , not good at all .
carlos , toronto , canada it is probable that the beijing olympics will give china the platform it needs to show the world that it is interested in development and is looking forward rather than back .
if this is the case , i would like to see china take a leading role in bringing north korea closer to the international community .
luke mclachlan , auckland , new zealand the fact that china is getting stronger should not be feared by the rest of the world .
it could be worse in the future if there was only one superpower in the world as they would throw their weight around in the world of politics , military and commerce .
with two superpowers , there will be balance in the world and the fear of total domination by one nation will be diminished .
william , ireland china will be the most interesting , dynamic nation of the coming century josh , denver , usa china will become increasingly multi-faceted .
even now chinese movies fill our theatres , chinese peacekeepers patrol in haiti , and two chinese engineers are hostages in pakistan .
they 've come a long way from the blue-jacketed masses of the chairman .
my biggest concern in terms of stability and human rights will be that china shifts from communism to oligarchy , much like america 's 19th century " robber barons " - or like pre-1949 china .
that being said , china will be the most interesting , dynamic nation of the coming century .
josh , denver , usa the future of china will be bright and it will also a next superpower .
yes , i have recently visited china , the growth is tremendous in every way .
philip loke , singapore i have been to china , and lived there .
i think the move to a market economy will not be affected by the political system .
if anything the government will seek to extend its control - as is happening in every other country in the world .
china will not become a world power .
the reason is simple .
their ability to produce high return products will be affected by the concentration of that ability in a few select countries - namely , the us , europe and japan .
peter , melbourne , australia china has made a big progress in the last two decades .
we must realise it .
although it still has some disadvantages , we should be more tolerant when the chinese government implements the reform and opening policy .
human rights are being respected .
you can go to china and have a look .
please do not criticise too much if you do not understand a country .
respect others and you will be respected .
please remember !
china has been making a big progress !
yajun zhang , henan , china they are trying to build a compassionate and civic-minded society beng tang , singapore i was in china in august , it struck me as a country that faces great problems , but also has great potential .
what rayan , new orleans , usa said is quite true .
if you look at what us-sponsored " democracy " has led to in russia , compared to the prosperity of the booming chinese cities , chinese people would rather have " socialism with chinese characteristics " and one party rule than that .
at the same time , i was very interested to see the propaganda films on tv which showcase altruistic behaviour , like the story of a village elder who paid off his village 's debts with great self-sacrifice .
that and the very courteous and generous manners of many of the people i met there , is encouraging because it suggests that they are trying to build a compassionate and civic-minded society , to try and temper the materialism and the growing gap between rich and poor that capitalism brings .
as for being a super power , i think china certainly wants to exert a lot of influence in its neighbourhood in asia , but i do n't think it has ambitions of dominating the world , unlike some .
beng tang , singapore -lrb- in uk -rrb- during the economic transition , characterised by a massive influx of western businesses and investments , the chinese government deters political movements by exerting rigorous control over the media .
the effect of this has been significant ; today , anyone who is critical of the government 's actions is labelled as " anti-china . "
china can not and will not be a superpower if the 1.3 billion people are always " pro-china " in every action the government takes .
will , stockholm , sweden it seems to me that the turnaround in china 's fortunes started about the time that hong kong was handed back to them .
if the chinese government continue to listen to voices from hong kong , taiwan and other parts of the world , their economy will continue to grow as western influence makes it mark .
they must be careful , however , not to leave their poor population behind .
graham rodhouse , helmond , the netherlands i disagree that chinese are going to be satisfied with consumer goods for the foreseeable future .
behind closed doors , the chinese i have met and lived with do have a clear desire to be more free and to have their say as individuals .
what 's more , there 's a whole generation of young chinese growing up now that have been educated in the west and come back to their homeland wondering why they do n't have the rights we take for granted .
one day there will have to be political reform , but i just hope it does n't take another tiananmen to do it .
greg , nottingham , uk i see no immediate need for a change in china 's political system wong wan kit , petaling jaya , malaysia i see no immediate need for a change in china 's political system to follow the western system of popular government .
a popular leader does not equals to capable leader .
as long as the governing power is able to lead and manage , the specific type of government is not immediately important for china at this moment .
wong wan kit , petaling jaya , malaysia i have just visited china recently -lrb- two weeks ago -rrb- .
my impressions are that they will become a economic superpower .
however it can only have strong positive impact to the world if it can open up its media and allows a second political party to exist .
by the way , in china , i can not access bbc news website and i wonder if there are any other countries in the world which block all bbc websites .
jason , singapore i am proud that china is once more becoming the most important country in the world .
china has never in it 's history set out to cause trouble in the world .
it traded with the americas way before columbus " discovered " america .
i hope china will play a part on the world stage as a strong powerful but peaceful nation that has given the world so much , and will give the world so much more .
mike cheng , hong kong people from the west are keen to put the human rights issue on the table when talking about china .
in my opinion , china is on the way to a country with greater freedom and greater democracy .
food and shelter is the basis of human rights .
i could n't imagine a country where people want freedom of speech , even freedom of gay marriage when they 're starving .
the party in power had done well in ensuring basic human rights .
i hope my country will grow stronger , fight against corruption and provide better social welfare to chinese people .

china has emerged as the likeliest challenger to the united states as a global superpower .
it has the world 's fastest growing economy , with millions moving to the country 's rapidly expanding cities .
the boom was triggered by a move towards a market-style economy and away from the centrally-planned communist model of 20 years ago .
however , economic change has not been accompanied by political reform and the government still maintains strict control over opposition and the media .
what does the future hold for china ?
have you experienced the changes of the last 20 years ?
do you live in china - or have you visited recently ?
if so , send us your impressions .
chinese voices audio gallery hear what young chinese people around the world think of the changes their country has experienced in our audio gallery .
your comments : i am an overseas chinese currently living in sydney .
although i grew up for most of my childhood and all of my teenager years in australia , i 've never forgotten my homeland , china .
every year 's end i return to visit my hometown , shanghai , for two particular reasons ; not forgetting i am a chinese , and to absorb inspirations .
shanghai in particular has modernized in an unimaginable manner , with constructions being carried out 24/7 and has one of the highest fdi rates amongst many -lrb- if not any -rrb- cities in the world .
each time i return , i would n't be able to recognize places if it was n't for the street signs .
since i left china in 1991 at the age of 8 , my memories of china were colourless .
people had similar clothing , furniture and clustered housings .
now all of that has changed with the addition of private cars , an increasing taste for western sports , music and culture .
indeed , china has somewhat tarnished in its own cultural uniqueness in many ways , but i think the reason is that the china has been deprived for too long -lrb- ever since the collapse of the qing dynasty -rrb- , hence it is no surprise that the chinese want to rapidly absorb the best of all worlds .
jia-jie xu , sydney , australia here in anhui the benefits of trickle down from the new rich and middle class are evident .
sadly it does n't seem to trickle down to the poorest .
begging is on the increase and people fight to take away my rubbish .
recently prices have begun to increase more rapidly and the wages of the poorest are static or even falling .
whether the wealthy can continue to uphold the facade of an improving life for all is probably the big question of the next 5 years .
adam porter , ma 'anshan , anhui , china being a chinese myself , i had n't seen china in an objective way before i came to study in australia .
i never questioned or even bothered to think about communism , since the impact of that " scary " word on my life is hardly noticeable .
i 'm from a middle class family .
my life has been as comfortable as it can be .
but while i 'm here in melbourne , and after witnessing the election campaign , i keep realizing how far we are from real democracy .
the bright side is , for the last 25 years china has been striving to open to the world .
we started to understand each other more as distinct cultures , than political rivals .
dan wang , melbourne , australia the inequality in the new chinese society is very obvious yongdan li , berkeley , california , usa i was only a child when i left mainland china .
back then , there was only one mcdonalds and one kfc .
most major stores were still very much state-owned .
however , i 've seen some amazing changes during visits to my homeland over the past several years .
everything has become highly commercialized and influenced by western trends .
mcdonalds , wal-marts and even starbucks have sprung up everywhere .
another big change has been the amount of information from abroad that has been exposed to mainland chinese .
now everyone knows the major stars from america and what movies in the us have been top box office hits , as well as the political scandals and bush 's speech mishaps .
these changes have all been very exciting to me .
at the same time , the hutong and the streets leading up to all the places i knew as a child have been bulldozed and paved over - replaced by more modern-looking structures .
part of me misses the scenery of " old china " that i know i very possibly would never see again , but i feel that change is good .
change might involve inequality and difficulties , but if china had n't gone through these changes , it would n't have made any progress .
when i visited china this summer , i dined in a little noodle shop where one bowl of noodle cost only 1 yuan -lrb- a little more than 10 cents -rrb- , i also ate at mcdonalds , where it cost me 17 times more money .
the inequality in the new chinese society is very obvious , but i 'm confident china has the potential to work things out .
let 's give it time .
yongdan li , berkeley , california , usa i am a beijing born chinese and have been living in the city for almost my entire life .
i am going through the changing of our city and out country .
i am fortunately among the crowd who have much better life than our parents , but i also see many more chinese people are struggling to make their families survive than ever .
people nowadays always say that china is the hottest hotspot for business opportunity .
however , billions of ordinary chinese people are paying a very heavy price for a few to achieve this so-called significant growth .
please think about how many chinese families are still living under poverty !
their life is not at all so pleasant as that of children in the big cities , who have adequate toys , snacks and money in their daily life !
brownie , beijing , china i am amazed by the tremendous improvements that have been achieved so , kuala lumpur , malaysia to understand china , one has to first and foremost understand ' chinese culture ' .
we chinese have always placed great respect on elders , both within the family and outside it .
this is probably the reason most non-chinese people would think that chinese wanted a strong totalitarian government to lead them back to the greatness that we had experienced before .
i am constantly reminded of a popular lay-phrase that i heard when travelling around china sometime ago - the central government set rules and regulations , we the common folks have methods to circumvent them -lrb- yet seemingly to comply with them -rrb- !
i am amazed by the tremendous improvements that have been achieved and am sure that this will continue .
whatever it takes to be a superpower , please try not to judge china with your own pre-conceived ideas of it .
china is not the united states -lrb- or any of the developed countries -rrb- .
it is uniquely just china !
so , kuala lumpur , malaysia some may be worried that china will establish itself as a global superpower like the united states , and that it may send its trails around the whole world .
well , we do want to be strong , for we 've suffered a lot in the past , but we do n't want to be powerful .
we have our own culture , which is peaceful , friendly , tolerant and wise - never combative , never furious .
during the tang period , china did n't conquer other nations , although the fact is that our culture did spread a lot .
we want to be strong because we have to .
we never want to be a superpower like the united states because our culture does not allow us to do so .
we hate to mention a word about ruling the world .
i 'm a teenager , aged 18 , and i will follow our great culture seriously in order to build a peaceful world , with a balance between the western and the orient .
what 's more , when i am 81 years old , i will also tell my grandsons and granddaughters to do as i have done .
and that 's for sure , they will fellow me , because of our chinese tradition , and our culture .
zhang rong , chinese now studying in australia a growing china will be a huge benefit to the west .
they may lack democracy as the west knows it but they are liberal in their outlook compared to most other non-democratic countries .
it could also be said that china will also curb the threat of islamic extremism as the islam in its aggressive form will be a hindrance to china in its growing prosperity .
philip shorter , tonbridge , england i am a 40-year-old chinese and have experienced the big change myself in the past 20 years .
i have two basic points .
first , in spite of the economic growth , the main task of china is still nothing else but to fight against poverty .
i believe that , at least in my life time , i will not see china become a real global superpower .
secondly , although there is not a total qualitative change in social life , compared to the time of the cultural revolution , the situation of human rights in china has been improved and this is the main comfort of the most chinese people .
chun , han , berlin , germany china wants to regain its true place amongst the current world order roberto , bristol , uk to fully understand china 's future , you must understand its past .
communism in part was a nationalistic movement and one that was a reaction to the degradations that the west visited upon her in the 19th and early 20th century .
for my part , i believe that communism will be replaced , if it has n't been already .
china wants to regain its true place amongst the current world order , and will keep progressing towards that goal .
roberto , bristol , uk the fact that china got this far is a miracle in itself .
chinese people are not too interested in politics but rather in creating wealth .
the people are quite happy to accept whatever form of government as long as everyone has the opportunity of bettering themselves .
i do not think we want a repetition of the form of government between 1900s1970s .
my father had to leave china at the age of 14 to seek his fortune because they were all starving ! !
soon , exeter , uk i was in beijing and in a very remote village in north china in 2002 .
the transport infrastructures being constructed , even in remote places , are impressive .
but you can also see many poor people who are living on less than $ 2 a day .
a nation can not be successful based on some economical statistics but leaving its people behind .
prasun , the netherlands this is a country that has no respect for human right wei chun , boston , usa the rich get richer and the farmer gets left behind .
i 've been to china several times a year and have seen people complaining about corrupt party officials demolishing their homes without any compensation as originally promised and unreasonable tax collection demands .
this is a country that has no respect for human rights and will not tolerate dissenting view .
this a country where the communist party official is the law of the land .
wei chun , boston , usa i went to china last year with my dad on a tour of tianjin and beijing .
china has come a long way and still has a long way to go before becoming the next " superpower " .
the west tends to exaggerate the threat from beijing but it 's true that china still wields much power in asia .
for example , 6-party talks were organised by the chinese government to defuse north korea 's nuclear crisis and i thank china for their constructive role .
michael jun sung shim , korea shanghai is amazing !
from the air it makes manhattan look insignificant .
and my stay in beijing left no doubt in my mind that the army runs the show .
from thailand to korea and japan , as china 's economy soars , the perceived power of the usa is melting into impotence .
peter gamache , anchorage , alaska i have only seen a glimpse of this extremely complex and beautiful country and love it !
lindsay palmer , johannesburg , south africa i recently spent 6 months teaching english in china in guangzhou and also spent 10 days touring beijing and shanghai in 2000 .
i am struck not only by their determination to become a superpower but also that it is backed by a willingness to sacrifice now to achieve their end goal .
their approach to life and way of thinking is different from the questioning , individualistic way of thinking of the west and i think this is going to take them to the top as a country .
i have only seen a glimpse of this extremely complex and beautiful country and love it !
lindsay palmer , johannesburg , south africa i see all these opinions from people of chinese origin and they confirm my fears .
they are not interested in a peaceful china , a tolerant china , a democratic and liberal china , they want to see the superpower , the best country in the world throwing its weight around and bullying the rest of the world .
it seems to me that they want an imperialistic china as much as they detest any western superpower .
not good , not good at all .
carlos , toronto , canada it is probable that the beijing olympics will give china the platform it needs to show the world that it is interested in development and is looking forward rather than back .
if this is the case , i would like to see china take a leading role in bringing north korea closer to the international community .
luke mclachlan , auckland , new zealand the fact that china is getting stronger should not be feared by the rest of the world .
it could be worse in the future if there was only one superpower in the world as they would throw their weight around in the world of politics , military and commerce .
with two superpowers , there will be balance in the world and the fear of total domination by one nation will be diminished .
william , ireland china will be the most interesting , dynamic nation of the coming century josh , denver , usa china will become increasingly multi-faceted .
even now chinese movies fill our theatres , chinese peacekeepers patrol in haiti , and two chinese engineers are hostages in pakistan .
they 've come a long way from the blue-jacketed masses of the chairman .
my biggest concern in terms of stability and human rights will be that china shifts from communism to oligarchy , much like america 's 19th century " robber barons " - or like pre-1949 china .
that being said , china will be the most interesting , dynamic nation of the coming century .
josh , denver , usa the future of china will be bright and it will also a next superpower .
yes , i have recently visited china , the growth is tremendous in every way .
philip loke , singapore i have been to china , and lived there .
i think the move to a market economy will not be affected by the political system .
if anything the government will seek to extend its control - as is happening in every other country in the world .
china will not become a world power .
the reason is simple .
their ability to produce high return products will be affected by the concentration of that ability in a few select countries - namely , the us , europe and japan .
peter , melbourne , australia china has made a big progress in the last two decades .
we must realise it .
although it still has some disadvantages , we should be more tolerant when the chinese government implements the reform and opening policy .
human rights are being respected .
you can go to china and have a look .
please do not criticise too much if you do not understand a country .
respect others and you will be respected .
please remember !
china has been making a big progress !
yajun zhang , henan , china they are trying to build a compassionate and civic-minded society beng tang , singapore i was in china in august , it struck me as a country that faces great problems , but also has great potential .
what rayan , new orleans , usa said is quite true .
if you look at what us-sponsored " democracy " has led to in russia , compared to the prosperity of the booming chinese cities , chinese people would rather have " socialism with chinese characteristics " and one party rule than that .
at the same time , i was very interested to see the propaganda films on tv which showcase altruistic behaviour , like the story of a village elder who paid off his village 's debts with great self-sacrifice .
that and the very courteous and generous manners of many of the people i met there , is encouraging because it suggests that they are trying to build a compassionate and civic-minded society , to try and temper the materialism and the growing gap between rich and poor that capitalism brings .
as for being a super power , i think china certainly wants to exert a lot of influence in its neighbourhood in asia , but i do n't think it has ambitions of dominating the world , unlike some .
beng tang , singapore -lrb- in uk -rrb- during the economic transition , characterised by a massive influx of western businesses and investments , the chinese government deters political movements by exerting rigorous control over the media .
the effect of this has been significant ; today , anyone who is critical of the government 's actions is labelled as " anti-china . "
china can not and will not be a superpower if the 1.3 billion people are always " pro-china " in every action the government takes .
will , stockholm , sweden it seems to me that the turnaround in china 's fortunes started about the time that hong kong was handed back to them .
if the chinese government continue to listen to voices from hong kong , taiwan and other parts of the world , their economy will continue to grow as western influence makes it mark .
they must be careful , however , not to leave their poor population behind .
graham rodhouse , helmond , the netherlands i disagree that chinese are going to be satisfied with consumer goods for the foreseeable future .
behind closed doors , the chinese i have met and lived with do have a clear desire to be more free and to have their say as individuals .
what 's more , there 's a whole generation of young chinese growing up now that have been educated in the west and come back to their homeland wondering why they do n't have the rights we take for granted .
one day there will have to be political reform , but i just hope it does n't take another tiananmen to do it .
greg , nottingham , uk i see no immediate need for a change in china 's political system wong wan kit , petaling jaya , malaysia i see no immediate need for a change in china 's political system to follow the western system of popular government .
a popular leader does not equals to capable leader .
as long as the governing power is able to lead and manage , the specific type of government is not immediately important for china at this moment .
wong wan kit , petaling jaya , malaysia i have just visited china recently -lrb- two weeks ago -rrb- .
my impressions are that they will become a economic superpower .
however it can only have strong positive impact to the world if it can open up its media and allows a second political party to exist .
by the way , in china , i can not access bbc news website and i wonder if there are any other countries in the world which block all bbc websites .
jason , singapore i am proud that china is once more becoming the most important country in the world .
china has never in it 's history set out to cause trouble in the world .
it traded with the americas way before columbus " discovered " america .
i hope china will play a part on the world stage as a strong powerful but peaceful nation that has given the world so much , and will give the world so much more .
mike cheng , hong kong people from the west are keen to put the human rights issue on the table when talking about china .
in my opinion , china is on the way to a country with greater freedom and greater democracy .
food and shelter is the basis of human rights .
i could n't imagine a country where people want freedom of speech , even freedom of gay marriage when they 're starving .
the party in power had done well in ensuring basic human rights .
i hope my country will grow stronger , fight against corruption and provide better social welfare to chinese people .
chenfu , tampere , finland i want to see democracy in china , but not now !
echo , guangdong , china as a chinese , i want to see china to become the next superpower more than i want to see china become a western style democratic country .
of course , i want to see democracy in china , but not now !
china has a lot of problems to face when going the way to a superpower .
such as taiwan issue , poverty , etc ...
echo , guangdong , china i used to live in beijing and i found that everyone i spoke to , from teachers to taxi drivers , was acutely aware of the freedoms they lack .
did the students in tiananmen square or the practitioners of fa lun gong " not know any different " ?
i doubt it .
in the end , i think china will have no choice but to liberalize : either the government will fail to deliver on the promise of long-term growth and have to offer the incentive of civil liberties to keep the support of the people , or , as the educated , affluent middle class grows in size and strength , so too will its hunger for something more satisfying than mcdonald 's and starbucks .
alexander wille , kakamigahara , japan today , we -lrb- at least i -rrb- complain about the fact the us throws its weight around with little care for the damage it causes .
the china of 50 years from now will be much more difficult to handle .
if only speaking chinese could be as easy as speaking english ...
vassili le moigne , prague , czech republic the future will indeed be a scary place as china will likely be another superpower gerod wattier , wa , usa the future will indeed be a scary place as china will likely be another superpower .
a superpower that is undemocratic and has no respect for human rights .
a nation that is getting stronger economically and militarily every day .
gerod wattier , carnation , wa , usa the problem is the system that china is setting up is something that could very easily work .
the people have had their freedoms repressed by their government for generations - they do n't know any different .
and as long their government allows them to make more money than they normally would under a centrally-planned communist market , you 're not going to get many complaints from them .
they can put a roof over their heads , food on the table , and have some money left over for entertainment that they would n't normally have .
you really think they 're going to care about a one-party system and strict government control over the media when they 're hanging out at a chinese starbucks with their friends , sipping a café ' mocha ?
i do n't think so .
ryan , new orleans , usa i agree totally with ryan of new orleans .
after speaking with many young chinese people overseas , i was astonished by the amazing effect of nationalistic propaganda imposed on the new generation .
any criticism towards the communist party is regarded by them as an attack on the people and nation of china .
the chinese communist party has reinforced its grasp of power very well after putting down the massive democratic movement of 1989 .
i believe the students had good intentions 15 years ago but were overly naïve and hasty .
the movement achieved exactly the opposite of its goals : even if the government at the time was starting to slowly concede more political freedom to the people , it certainly changed its mind in 1989 and decided instead to re-educate the youths to ensure that such challenges to the absolute authority of the party never happened again .
chinese people now immensely enjoy their new found economic freedom and very few are longing for a deeper level of freedom .
the reality is bizarre : china is actually democratic in its own way because the authoritarian one-party rule is really what most chinese people want .
j yang , london , england what is happening in china right now is similar to what occurred during the industrial revolution in the uk lynne , london , uk it took over 200 years for democracy to develop in the western countries like the uk and the us .
why should china be expected to change overnight ?
what is happening in china right now is similar to what occurred during the industrial revolution in the uk .
i do n't seem to hear any people complaining about that ? !
china may well become a super power ... and what of it ?
china was once a great empire - and it will be again !
lynne , london , uk the prospect of china becoming a military and economic power is frightening indeed , especially with absolute power being held by a corrupted and authoritarian government that is not accountable to anybody but itself .
idris m , sydney , australia as someone who is half chinese , i am very happy to see china succeeding after decades of failure .
i do not think the west should be afraid of china .
china wants to do business , not war , with the west .
let china develop itself and slowly give freedom back .
we all remember what happened when russia moved to quickly towards freedom .
china is gradually becoming more and more free , but you have to eat to be free in the first place .
mark , brisbane , australia china has changed a lot in economic policy , and it has improved the living standard in china .
mostly in urban areas of china .
that means still a lot of people in rural areas are living in poor environment .
the communist government abuses basic human rights and bans freedom of religion .
china has greatly threatened regional peace and stability in the asia-pacific area , because china has systematically increased the number of missiles those pointed to taiwan .
china has ignored all the chinese peoples ' rights and freedoms .
if china wo n't change the political system , it wo n't become the superpower , but will cause military competition between taiwan .
it may lead to war in asia-pacific or china will spend high volume of money on military .
johnson kao , australia china will necessarily undergo a social revolution in the next 25 to 50 years mark , usa china will necessarily undergo a social revolution in the next 25 to 50 years even greater than its economic revolution of the last 30 .
china is communist today in name only .
like a snake outgrowing its skin , the current system will prove far too restrictive to allow the kind of expansion it has come to expect .
along with prosperity for many tens and even hundreds of millions will come expectations of freedom of movement and expression that will be irresistible .
look for china to undergo upheavals leading to a thriving democratic nation at peace with itself and the world and preoccupied with its own growth and development by mid century .
mark , usa china 's economic improvement is worth praising but in order for china to become a " real " superpower in the stage of worldwide , interrelated economy , the central government infrastructure must change from the top down .
i live in taiwan and my work involves travelling to china .
any foreigner to china would know that without political change , economic miracle of china will go bust , and burst like a bubble .
