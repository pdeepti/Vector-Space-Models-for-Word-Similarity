" we must not tolerate this treacherous relativization and minimization of the holocaust , " said spokesman hans-herman langguth . he said that chancellor gerhard schröder had " learned with repugnance " of the protest .
langguth said any new attempt to ban the npd would have to be examined very carefully .
however on monday , federal prosecutors said there was no basis to open any proceedings against the npd . in march 2003 , germany 's highest court threw out a government and parliament request to ban the neo-nazi party for inciting racist violence , after a two-year legal wrangle .
the constitutional court 's decision came after it heard that some npd members who gave evidence were police informers . dw-world.de far-right german party belittles holocaust a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims .

during the ceremony on sunday , the 50-year-old hero of the orange revolution vowed to defend the sovereignty and independence of his country and to uphold the values of his party , the constitution and the ukrainian people . “ this is a victory for freedom over tyranny , ” yushchenko proclaimed to tens of thousands of his protestors gathered in the main square of kiev . bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko passes by honor guards during a military ceremony in mariinsky palace in kiev , ukraine , sunday , jan .
23 , 2005 . but the pro-western leader will have little time to celebrate what surely is a tremendous victory for democracy in a state that just recently shed the yoke of soviet influence .
starting monday , yushchenko sets out on a tour of europe to prove his sincerity in cooperating closely with the west . opening new doors in brussels , ukraine ’ s future eu minister is already hard at work paving the way for his country ’ s most ambitious goal : entry in the 25-member european union . in an interview with deutsche welle , oleg ribatschuk said he ’ d like to see ukrainian accession as soon as possible , but he conceded that brussels ’ official line only allows for a close partnership in the near future . officially , the eu has said it is not negotiating accession , only a close partnership as part of the bloc ’ s neighborhood policy .
but even after meetings with the eu ’ s foreign policy chief javier solana and eu foreign relations commission benita ferrero-waldner , ribatschuk remains convinced that brussels will open its doors fully to kiev in the next 10 years , even before it lets in turkey . “ the door is not closed , ” he said .
“ what we need to do in ukraine is impress the eu with our rapid tempo in introducing and implementing reforms .
if we develop quickly enough , the eu will have to respond positively – i ’ m absolutely convinced . ” increase reform tempo ukraine ’ s reform efforts have not gone unnoticed in the eu , ribatschuk said . just a week ago , the eu parliament voted in favor of offering kiev a european perspective .
solana and ferrero-waldner have also written a letter to yushchenko outlining an “ eu action plan ” for partnership .
the letter is a first step in the right direction , according to ribatschuk who sees it as proof of brussels ’ interest in strengthening ties with kiev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin backed yushchenko 's opponent in the election , viktor yanokovych in addition to the eu , ukraine is also striving to enter the nato .
there are just two options , said ribatschuk : “ either we align ourselves with the west or with russia . ”
ukraine and viktor yushchenko have clearly decided in favor of europe .
that does not mean kiev aims to alienate itself from russia , nor does russian president vladimir putin have cause for alarm concerning ukraine ’ s new political course . refocusing foreign policy russia is still the new ukrainian president ’ s first official stop on his foreign tour .
in doing so , yushchenko will stress the fact that he does not wish to break away entirely from russia , a country which for years exerted influence on the smaller neighboring country . “ the main reason for the visit with putin is not to sign any contracts or to drink too many glasses of vodka in the name of friendship .
rather , the point is to revive the close ties , ” ribatschuk said . at the moment though , russia is not at the forefront of ukraine ’ s foreign policy .
it is more important that the new ukrainian government focus its efforts on the eu and nato and convince the population of the necessity of such an endeavor , the future eu minister said .

dw 's heinz dylong says there 's too little outrage over their behavior . the national democratic party 's -lrb- npd -rrb- behavior in saxony 's state parliament was absolutely unbearable !
first , they withdrew from a minute of silence for the victims of the holocaust , then came a debate in which they equated the world war ii bombing of dresden with the holocaust .
they spoke of a " bombing holocaust , " described the allies as " mass murderers " and the air strikes as a " cold-blooded planned industrial mass murder of the civilian population . " the air campaign on dresden in february 1945 certainly should n't be played down .
the attack on the refugee-filled city that killed more than 35,000 made little sense according to military standards .
that may - indeed , it must - be lamented .
all the same , nothing can be equated to the mass murder and the contempt for humanity that distinguished the holocaust .
it was an unparalleled historical low .
the air campaign on dresden was a superfluous and appalling operation ; but its deeper cause was the war provoked by germany .
and that must without fail be taken into consideration when the victims of the attack on dresden are commemorated . but such considerations are entirely alien to the far-right npd .
given their muddled thoughts , no one should be surprised .
what is alarming is that the npd does n't fear that such statements would hurt them in the eyes of voters .
they received more than 9 percent of the votes in state parliamentary elections in saxony in september . no deterrent and even though that does n't mean the voters were all right-known extremists - a significant number was motivated by the federal government 's social reforms - the frightening findings do show that the npd 's well-known extremist positions did n't deter voters .
the core of the npd 's party platform was n't enough to keep voters in the democratic camp .
while in the 1960s , the npd 's temporary upswing was attributed to their voters coming from old nazi circles , this explanation is impossible today . the secretary general of the central council of jews in germany , stephan kramer , declared that " anti-semitic and xenophobic ideas long ago became socially acceptable again . "
that should n't be viewed simply as an all too pessimistic estimation .
rather , it is a request to the democratic parties and the democratic public .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , 60 years after the liberation of the concentration camps , an offensive confrontation with right-wing extremist attitudes must be sought . and the ban on the npd that failed two years ago due to the applicants ' amateurish procedure - they relied on testimony to the federal constitutional court from witnesses in the service of one of germany 's intelligence services - should be considered again . after all , one need n't repeat the same mistakes , and intellectual discussion of right-wing extremism , which is surely necessary , is thus not out of the question . heinz dylong -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right german party belittles holocaust a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.01.2005 opinion : banning the far-right npd großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd politicians rejected a minute 's silence for holocaust victims politicians in saxony 's state parliament made no bones about their extreme right-wing views by walking out on a commemoration of holocaust victims .
dw 's heinz dylong says there 's too little outrage over their behavior . the national democratic party 's -lrb- npd -rrb- behavior in saxony 's state parliament was absolutely unbearable !
first , they withdrew from a minute of silence for the victims of the holocaust , then came a debate in which they equated the world war ii bombing of dresden with the holocaust .
they spoke of a " bombing holocaust , " described the allies as " mass murderers " and the air strikes as a " cold-blooded planned industrial mass murder of the civilian population . " the air campaign on dresden in february 1945 certainly should n't be played down .
the attack on the refugee-filled city that killed more than 35,000 made little sense according to military standards .
that may - indeed , it must - be lamented .
all the same , nothing can be equated to the mass murder and the contempt for humanity that distinguished the holocaust .
it was an unparalleled historical low .
the air campaign on dresden was a superfluous and appalling operation ; but its deeper cause was the war provoked by germany .
and that must without fail be taken into consideration when the victims of the attack on dresden are commemorated . but such considerations are entirely alien to the far-right npd .
given their muddled thoughts , no one should be surprised .
what is alarming is that the npd does n't fear that such statements would hurt them in the eyes of voters .
they received more than 9 percent of the votes in state parliamentary elections in saxony in september . no deterrent and even though that does n't mean the voters were all right-known extremists - a significant number was motivated by the federal government 's social reforms - the frightening findings do show that the npd 's well-known extremist positions did n't deter voters .
the core of the npd 's party platform was n't enough to keep voters in the democratic camp .
while in the 1960s , the npd 's temporary upswing was attributed to their voters coming from old nazi circles , this explanation is impossible today . the secretary general of the central council of jews in germany , stephan kramer , declared that " anti-semitic and xenophobic ideas long ago became socially acceptable again . "
that should n't be viewed simply as an all too pessimistic estimation .
rather , it is a request to the democratic parties and the democratic public .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , 60 years after the liberation of the concentration camps , an offensive confrontation with right-wing extremist attitudes must be sought . and the ban on the npd that failed two years ago due to the applicants ' amateurish procedure - they relied on testimony to the federal constitutional court from witnesses in the service of one of germany 's intelligence services - should be considered again . after all , one need n't repeat the same mistakes , and intellectual discussion of right-wing extremism , which is surely necessary , is thus not out of the question . heinz dylong -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right german party belittles holocaust a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims .

the berlin-born referee resigned from his post on friday when the probe came to light . the match at the center of the scandal took place on aug .
21 , 2004 , with regional side sc paderborn and bundesliga heavyweights sv hamburg contesting a dfb cup first round match . with the 1983 european cup winners leading the minor league minnows 2-0 , hamburg inexplicably saw their lead disintegrate .
during an allegedly assisted comeback , paderborn were awarded two dubious penalites , both of which were scored , and also benefited when hsv 's belgian striker emile mpenza was sent off for complaining against hozyer 's decisions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer .
the dfb , who will hold an emergency meeting on monday following hozyer 's -lrb- picture -rrb- shock resignation , added that there was also evidence of manipulation of other games involving the the referee . fears of multiple offences " since friday we have had evidence that he rigged games , " dfb joint-president theo zwanziger said on german television station ard .
hoyzer did not referee in the top bundesliga division but had taken charge of 12 second division matches as well as cup and regional league fixtures . " this case has caused great damage to the dfb , " said gerhard mayer-vorfelder , the other of the dfb 's two co-chairmen , ahead of monday 's meeting .
" just from the psychological aspect , incredible damage has been done , for the german federation and for the referees ' organization . "
mayer-vorfelder also called for a general ban on betting for referees . dfb board president horst hilpert told german sports news agency sid on sunday that the investigation into the scandal would be concluded as soon as possible .
" it is always the obligation of the board of control to reach their conclusions swiftly , particularly in so stressful a case . " " we 're going to see if prosecutors need to be involved , " dfb spokesman harald stenger added in a separate statement .
" we 'll also want to talk to bookmakers .
-lrb- the dfb -rrb- will leave no stone unturned in this investigation .
from what we know at this point , this is absolutely a single case .
no other referee , no player , no coach , no club is involved .
i also want to stress that -lrb- hoyzer 's -rrb- denying all allegations . " " i have never bet on a game i have refereed , " hoyzer told the bild newspaper on monday .
" the accusations have left me pensive , uneasy and dismayed .
i can not comprehend them , and also can not understand that my refereeing colleagues could think me capable of such a thing . " aggrieved hsv consider own action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hsv hamburg could seek compensation .
meanwhile , hamburg officials are holding fire on action of their own until the dfb investigation is complete .
" we are waiting to see how the probe develops and will stay in contact with the dfb to see how we should react , " explained hamburg chief bernd hoffmann told zdf television .
" if it is confirmed , we want some sort of compensation .
who knows how our season might have gone ?
we could still be going strong in the cup at this stage . " " great damage has been inflicted on hamburg sv and on german football , " hoffman added .
" we will use all legal means to put right this wrong . "
however , there is little chance that the clubs will get the chance to right the wrongs on the pitch .
the dfb has already ruled out any possibility of replaying the disputed match . another person involved was entertaining similar thoughts as to what would have happened if the outcome of the game had been different .
former hsv coach klaus toppmoller was in charge of hamburg at the time of the match and claimed hoyzer 's corrupt decisions caused his dismissal two months later . toppmöller blames ref for sack " the referee -lrb- hoyzer -rrb- cost me my job as we were doing fine until the paderborn game , " raged toppmoller in the bild am sonntag weekly . " after that it all went downhill.i had the impression that it was a match we could never win .
i knew something was n't right and i even told the referee 's assistant at the time .
but what can you do ?
if you say there is cheating going on , you could face a ban . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmöller feels his future was jeopardized by the refereeing decisions .
referees now face increased scrutiny into their actions for the remainder of the season .
the hoyzer revelations are likely to increase suspicion when questionable decisions are made .
" from now on all referee decisions will be questioned , " admitted oliver bierhoff , assistant coach of the german national team , in a statement to reporters .
" but i am sure this is just a one-off case . " ghosts of 1971 scandal stirring the dfb will surely hope so .
while it is doing its upmost to prevent the hozyer affair from enveloping german football ahead of the 2006 world cup on home soil , the dfb will be sorely reminded of a previous incident which blew up into the biggest scandal in german football . match-fixing and bribes engulfed the bundesliga in 1971 when more than 50 players , a number of coaches and officials plus the clubs arminia bielefeld and kickers offenbach were found guilty of offering bribes and fixing bundesliga games , prompting the dfb to dish out hefty fines and suspensions . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga restarts with bayern victory it was business as usual as bayern munich opened the second half of the bundesliga season with a 3-0 win over hamburg sv in the olympic stadium on friday .

the berlin-born referee resigned from his post on friday when the probe came to light . the match at the center of the scandal took place on aug .
21 , 2004 , with regional side sc paderborn and bundesliga heavyweights sv hamburg contesting a dfb cup first round match . with the 1983 european cup winners leading the minor league minnows 2-0 , hamburg inexplicably saw their lead disintegrate .
during an allegedly assisted comeback , paderborn were awarded two dubious penalites , both of which were scored , and also benefited when hsv 's belgian striker emile mpenza was sent off for complaining against hozyer 's decisions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer .
the dfb , who will hold an emergency meeting on monday following hozyer 's -lrb- picture -rrb- shock resignation , added that there was also evidence of manipulation of other games involving the the referee . fears of multiple offences " since friday we have had evidence that he rigged games , " dfb joint-president theo zwanziger said on german television station ard .
hoyzer did not referee in the top bundesliga division but had taken charge of 12 second division matches as well as cup and regional league fixtures . " this case has caused great damage to the dfb , " said gerhard mayer-vorfelder , the other of the dfb 's two co-chairmen , ahead of monday 's meeting .
" just from the psychological aspect , incredible damage has been done , for the german federation and for the referees ' organization . "
mayer-vorfelder also called for a general ban on betting for referees . dfb board president horst hilpert told german sports news agency sid on sunday that the investigation into the scandal would be concluded as soon as possible .
" it is always the obligation of the board of control to reach their conclusions swiftly , particularly in so stressful a case . " " we 're going to see if prosecutors need to be involved , " dfb spokesman harald stenger added in a separate statement .
" we 'll also want to talk to bookmakers .
-lrb- the dfb -rrb- will leave no stone unturned in this investigation .
from what we know at this point , this is absolutely a single case .
no other referee , no player , no coach , no club is involved .
i also want to stress that -lrb- hoyzer 's -rrb- denying all allegations . " " i have never bet on a game i have refereed , " hoyzer told the bild newspaper on monday .
" the accusations have left me pensive , uneasy and dismayed .
i can not comprehend them , and also can not understand that my refereeing colleagues could think me capable of such a thing . " aggrieved hsv consider own action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hsv hamburg could seek compensation .
meanwhile , hamburg officials are holding fire on action of their own until the dfb investigation is complete .
" we are waiting to see how the probe develops and will stay in contact with the dfb to see how we should react , " explained hamburg chief bernd hoffmann told zdf television .
" if it is confirmed , we want some sort of compensation .
who knows how our season might have gone ?
we could still be going strong in the cup at this stage . " " great damage has been inflicted on hamburg sv and on german football , " hoffman added .
" we will use all legal means to put right this wrong . "
however , there is little chance that the clubs will get the chance to right the wrongs on the pitch .
the dfb has already ruled out any possibility of replaying the disputed match . another person involved was entertaining similar thoughts as to what would have happened if the outcome of the game had been different .
former hsv coach klaus toppmoller was in charge of hamburg at the time of the match and claimed hoyzer 's corrupt decisions caused his dismissal two months later . toppmöller blames ref for sack " the referee -lrb- hoyzer -rrb- cost me my job as we were doing fine until the paderborn game , " raged toppmoller in the bild am sonntag weekly . " after that it all went downhill.i had the impression that it was a match we could never win .
i knew something was n't right and i even told the referee 's assistant at the time .
but what can you do ?
if you say there is cheating going on , you could face a ban . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmöller feels his future was jeopardized by the refereeing decisions .
referees now face increased scrutiny into their actions for the remainder of the season .
the hoyzer revelations are likely to increase suspicion when questionable decisions are made .
" from now on all referee decisions will be questioned , " admitted oliver bierhoff , assistant coach of the german national team , in a statement to reporters .
" but i am sure this is just a one-off case . " ghosts of 1971 scandal stirring the dfb will surely hope so .
while it is doing its upmost to prevent the hozyer affair from enveloping german football ahead of the 2006 world cup on home soil , the dfb will be sorely reminded of a previous incident which blew up into the biggest scandal in german football . match-fixing and bribes engulfed the bundesliga in 1971 when more than 50 players , a number of coaches and officials plus the clubs arminia bielefeld and kickers offenbach were found guilty of offering bribes and fixing bundesliga games , prompting the dfb to dish out hefty fines and suspensions . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga restarts with bayern victory it was business as usual as bayern munich opened the second half of the bundesliga season with a 3-0 win over hamburg sv in the olympic stadium on friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : a stain on the soul of german soccer key man in match rigging scandal released soccer chiefs debate betting post-hoyzer referee scandal rears its ugly head former dortmund player admits to bribe current affairs -pipe- 24.01.2005 referee scandal threatens germany 's world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pointing the finger : hoyzer -lrb- right -rrb- is accused of widespread match-fixing instead of a fanfare heralding the first opportunity for the public to book their places at the world cup in germany in 2006 , alarm bells are ringing over a match-rigging scandal that threatens to sully the event . just over a day before the world 's attention was to turn to germany for the official release of world cup 2006 tickets , the latest in the host country 's moments in the sporting sun was eclipsed by a largely unknown second division german referee called robert hoyzer . the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- confirmed on saturday afternoon that they had begun investigating hozyer , 25 , for fixing a cup match that he had apparently bet on .
the berlin-born referee resigned from his post on friday when the probe came to light . the match at the center of the scandal took place on aug .
21 , 2004 , with regional side sc paderborn and bundesliga heavyweights sv hamburg contesting a dfb cup first round match . with the 1983 european cup winners leading the minor league minnows 2-0 , hamburg inexplicably saw their lead disintegrate .
during an allegedly assisted comeback , paderborn were awarded two dubious penalites , both of which were scored , and also benefited when hsv 's belgian striker emile mpenza was sent off for complaining against hozyer 's decisions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer .
the dfb , who will hold an emergency meeting on monday following hozyer 's -lrb- picture -rrb- shock resignation , added that there was also evidence of manipulation of other games involving the the referee . fears of multiple offences " since friday we have had evidence that he rigged games , " dfb joint-president theo zwanziger said on german television station ard .
hoyzer did not referee in the top bundesliga division but had taken charge of 12 second division matches as well as cup and regional league fixtures . " this case has caused great damage to the dfb , " said gerhard mayer-vorfelder , the other of the dfb 's two co-chairmen , ahead of monday 's meeting .
" just from the psychological aspect , incredible damage has been done , for the german federation and for the referees ' organization . "
mayer-vorfelder also called for a general ban on betting for referees . dfb board president horst hilpert told german sports news agency sid on sunday that the investigation into the scandal would be concluded as soon as possible .
" it is always the obligation of the board of control to reach their conclusions swiftly , particularly in so stressful a case . " " we 're going to see if prosecutors need to be involved , " dfb spokesman harald stenger added in a separate statement .
" we 'll also want to talk to bookmakers .
-lrb- the dfb -rrb- will leave no stone unturned in this investigation .
from what we know at this point , this is absolutely a single case .
no other referee , no player , no coach , no club is involved .
i also want to stress that -lrb- hoyzer 's -rrb- denying all allegations . " " i have never bet on a game i have refereed , " hoyzer told the bild newspaper on monday .
" the accusations have left me pensive , uneasy and dismayed .
i can not comprehend them , and also can not understand that my refereeing colleagues could think me capable of such a thing . " aggrieved hsv consider own action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hsv hamburg could seek compensation .
meanwhile , hamburg officials are holding fire on action of their own until the dfb investigation is complete .
" we are waiting to see how the probe develops and will stay in contact with the dfb to see how we should react , " explained hamburg chief bernd hoffmann told zdf television .
" if it is confirmed , we want some sort of compensation .
who knows how our season might have gone ?
we could still be going strong in the cup at this stage . " " great damage has been inflicted on hamburg sv and on german football , " hoffman added .
" we will use all legal means to put right this wrong . "
however , there is little chance that the clubs will get the chance to right the wrongs on the pitch .
the dfb has already ruled out any possibility of replaying the disputed match . another person involved was entertaining similar thoughts as to what would have happened if the outcome of the game had been different .
former hsv coach klaus toppmoller was in charge of hamburg at the time of the match and claimed hoyzer 's corrupt decisions caused his dismissal two months later . toppmöller blames ref for sack " the referee -lrb- hoyzer -rrb- cost me my job as we were doing fine until the paderborn game , " raged toppmoller in the bild am sonntag weekly . " after that it all went downhill.i had the impression that it was a match we could never win .
i knew something was n't right and i even told the referee 's assistant at the time .
but what can you do ?
if you say there is cheating going on , you could face a ban . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmöller feels his future was jeopardized by the refereeing decisions .
referees now face increased scrutiny into their actions for the remainder of the season .
the hoyzer revelations are likely to increase suspicion when questionable decisions are made .
" from now on all referee decisions will be questioned , " admitted oliver bierhoff , assistant coach of the german national team , in a statement to reporters .
" but i am sure this is just a one-off case . " ghosts of 1971 scandal stirring the dfb will surely hope so .
while it is doing its upmost to prevent the hozyer affair from enveloping german football ahead of the 2006 world cup on home soil , the dfb will be sorely reminded of a previous incident which blew up into the biggest scandal in german football . match-fixing and bribes engulfed the bundesliga in 1971 when more than 50 players , a number of coaches and officials plus the clubs arminia bielefeld and kickers offenbach were found guilty of offering bribes and fixing bundesliga games , prompting the dfb to dish out hefty fines and suspensions . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga restarts with bayern victory it was business as usual as bayern munich opened the second half of the bundesliga season with a 3-0 win over hamburg sv in the olympic stadium on friday .

dw 's heinz dylong says there 's too little outrage over their behavior . the national democratic party 's -lrb- npd -rrb- behavior in saxony 's state parliament was absolutely unbearable !
first , they withdrew from a minute of silence for the victims of the holocaust , then came a debate in which they equated the world war ii bombing of dresden with the holocaust .
they spoke of a " bombing holocaust , " described the allies as " mass murderers " and the air strikes as a " cold-blooded planned industrial mass murder of the civilian population . " the air campaign on dresden in february 1945 certainly should n't be played down .
the attack on the refugee-filled city that killed more than 35,000 made little sense according to military standards .
that may - indeed , it must - be lamented .
all the same , nothing can be equated to the mass murder and the contempt for humanity that distinguished the holocaust .
it was an unparalleled historical low .
the air campaign on dresden was a superfluous and appalling operation ; but its deeper cause was the war provoked by germany .
and that must without fail be taken into consideration when the victims of the attack on dresden are commemorated . but such considerations are entirely alien to the far-right npd .
given their muddled thoughts , no one should be surprised .
what is alarming is that the npd does n't fear that such statements would hurt them in the eyes of voters .
they received more than 9 percent of the votes in state parliamentary elections in saxony in september . no deterrent and even though that does n't mean the voters were all right-known extremists - a significant number was motivated by the federal government 's social reforms - the frightening findings do show that the npd 's well-known extremist positions did n't deter voters .
the core of the npd 's party platform was n't enough to keep voters in the democratic camp .
while in the 1960s , the npd 's temporary upswing was attributed to their voters coming from old nazi circles , this explanation is impossible today . the secretary general of the central council of jews in germany , stephan kramer , declared that " anti-semitic and xenophobic ideas long ago became socially acceptable again . "
that should n't be viewed simply as an all too pessimistic estimation .
rather , it is a request to the democratic parties and the democratic public .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , 60 years after the liberation of the concentration camps , an offensive confrontation with right-wing extremist attitudes must be sought . and the ban on the npd that failed two years ago due to the applicants ' amateurish procedure - they relied on testimony to the federal constitutional court from witnesses in the service of one of germany 's intelligence services - should be considered again . after all , one need n't repeat the same mistakes , and intellectual discussion of right-wing extremism , which is surely necessary , is thus not out of the question . heinz dylong -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right german party belittles holocaust a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims .

dw 's heinz dylong says there 's too little outrage over their behavior . the national democratic party 's -lrb- npd -rrb- behavior in saxony 's state parliament was absolutely unbearable !
first , they withdrew from a minute of silence for the victims of the holocaust , then came a debate in which they equated the world war ii bombing of dresden with the holocaust .
they spoke of a " bombing holocaust , " described the allies as " mass murderers " and the air strikes as a " cold-blooded planned industrial mass murder of the civilian population . " the air campaign on dresden in february 1945 certainly should n't be played down .
the attack on the refugee-filled city that killed more than 35,000 made little sense according to military standards .
that may - indeed , it must - be lamented .
all the same , nothing can be equated to the mass murder and the contempt for humanity that distinguished the holocaust .
it was an unparalleled historical low .
the air campaign on dresden was a superfluous and appalling operation ; but its deeper cause was the war provoked by germany .
and that must without fail be taken into consideration when the victims of the attack on dresden are commemorated . but such considerations are entirely alien to the far-right npd .
given their muddled thoughts , no one should be surprised .
what is alarming is that the npd does n't fear that such statements would hurt them in the eyes of voters .
they received more than 9 percent of the votes in state parliamentary elections in saxony in september . no deterrent and even though that does n't mean the voters were all right-known extremists - a significant number was motivated by the federal government 's social reforms - the frightening findings do show that the npd 's well-known extremist positions did n't deter voters .
the core of the npd 's party platform was n't enough to keep voters in the democratic camp .
while in the 1960s , the npd 's temporary upswing was attributed to their voters coming from old nazi circles , this explanation is impossible today . the secretary general of the central council of jews in germany , stephan kramer , declared that " anti-semitic and xenophobic ideas long ago became socially acceptable again . "
that should n't be viewed simply as an all too pessimistic estimation .
rather , it is a request to the democratic parties and the democratic public .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , 60 years after the liberation of the concentration camps , an offensive confrontation with right-wing extremist attitudes must be sought . and the ban on the npd that failed two years ago due to the applicants ' amateurish procedure - they relied on testimony to the federal constitutional court from witnesses in the service of one of germany 's intelligence services - should be considered again . after all , one need n't repeat the same mistakes , and intellectual discussion of right-wing extremism , which is surely necessary , is thus not out of the question . heinz dylong -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right german party belittles holocaust a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims .

during the ceremony on sunday , the 50-year-old hero of the orange revolution vowed to defend the sovereignty and independence of his country and to uphold the values of his party , the constitution and the ukrainian people . “ this is a victory for freedom over tyranny , ” yushchenko proclaimed to tens of thousands of his protestors gathered in the main square of kiev . bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko passes by honor guards during a military ceremony in mariinsky palace in kiev , ukraine , sunday , jan .

but even after meetings with the eu ’ s foreign policy chief javier solana and eu foreign relations commission benita ferrero-waldner , ribatschuk remains convinced that brussels will open its doors fully to kiev in the next 10 years , even before it lets in turkey . “ the door is not closed , ” he said .

that does not mean kiev aims to alienate itself from russia , nor does russian president vladimir putin have cause for alarm concerning ukraine ’ s new political course . refocusing foreign policy russia is still the new ukrainian president ’ s first official stop on his foreign tour .
in doing so , yushchenko will stress the fact that he does not wish to break away entirely from russia , a country which for years exerted influence on the smaller neighboring country . “ the main reason for the visit with putin is not to sign any contracts or to drink too many glasses of vodka in the name of friendship .
rather , the point is to revive the close ties , ” ribatschuk said . at the moment though , russia is not at the forefront of ukraine ’ s foreign policy .

during the ceremony on sunday , the 50-year-old hero of the orange revolution vowed to defend the sovereignty and independence of his country and to uphold the values of his party , the constitution and the ukrainian people . “ this is a victory for freedom over tyranny , ” yushchenko proclaimed to tens of thousands of his protestors gathered in the main square of kiev . bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko passes by honor guards during a military ceremony in mariinsky palace in kiev , ukraine , sunday , jan .
23 , 2005 . but the pro-western leader will have little time to celebrate what surely is a tremendous victory for democracy in a state that just recently shed the yoke of soviet influence .
starting monday , yushchenko sets out on a tour of europe to prove his sincerity in cooperating closely with the west . opening new doors in brussels , ukraine ’ s future eu minister is already hard at work paving the way for his country ’ s most ambitious goal : entry in the 25-member european union . in an interview with deutsche welle , oleg ribatschuk said he ’ d like to see ukrainian accession as soon as possible , but he conceded that brussels ’ official line only allows for a close partnership in the near future . officially , the eu has said it is not negotiating accession , only a close partnership as part of the bloc ’ s neighborhood policy .
but even after meetings with the eu ’ s foreign policy chief javier solana and eu foreign relations commission benita ferrero-waldner , ribatschuk remains convinced that brussels will open its doors fully to kiev in the next 10 years , even before it lets in turkey . “ the door is not closed , ” he said .
“ what we need to do in ukraine is impress the eu with our rapid tempo in introducing and implementing reforms .
if we develop quickly enough , the eu will have to respond positively – i ’ m absolutely convinced . ” increase reform tempo ukraine ’ s reform efforts have not gone unnoticed in the eu , ribatschuk said . just a week ago , the eu parliament voted in favor of offering kiev a european perspective .
solana and ferrero-waldner have also written a letter to yushchenko outlining an “ eu action plan ” for partnership .
the letter is a first step in the right direction , according to ribatschuk who sees it as proof of brussels ’ interest in strengthening ties with kiev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin backed yushchenko 's opponent in the election , viktor yanokovych in addition to the eu , ukraine is also striving to enter the nato .
there are just two options , said ribatschuk : “ either we align ourselves with the west or with russia . ”
ukraine and viktor yushchenko have clearly decided in favor of europe .
that does not mean kiev aims to alienate itself from russia , nor does russian president vladimir putin have cause for alarm concerning ukraine ’ s new political course . refocusing foreign policy russia is still the new ukrainian president ’ s first official stop on his foreign tour .
in doing so , yushchenko will stress the fact that he does not wish to break away entirely from russia , a country which for years exerted influence on the smaller neighboring country . “ the main reason for the visit with putin is not to sign any contracts or to drink too many glasses of vodka in the name of friendship .

during the ceremony on sunday , the 50-year-old hero of the orange revolution vowed to defend the sovereignty and independence of his country and to uphold the values of his party , the constitution and the ukrainian people . “ this is a victory for freedom over tyranny , ” yushchenko proclaimed to tens of thousands of his protestors gathered in the main square of kiev . bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko passes by honor guards during a military ceremony in mariinsky palace in kiev , ukraine , sunday , jan .
23 , 2005 . but the pro-western leader will have little time to celebrate what surely is a tremendous victory for democracy in a state that just recently shed the yoke of soviet influence .
starting monday , yushchenko sets out on a tour of europe to prove his sincerity in cooperating closely with the west . opening new doors in brussels , ukraine ’ s future eu minister is already hard at work paving the way for his country ’ s most ambitious goal : entry in the 25-member european union . in an interview with deutsche welle , oleg ribatschuk said he ’ d like to see ukrainian accession as soon as possible , but he conceded that brussels ’ official line only allows for a close partnership in the near future . officially , the eu has said it is not negotiating accession , only a close partnership as part of the bloc ’ s neighborhood policy .
but even after meetings with the eu ’ s foreign policy chief javier solana and eu foreign relations commission benita ferrero-waldner , ribatschuk remains convinced that brussels will open its doors fully to kiev in the next 10 years , even before it lets in turkey . “ the door is not closed , ” he said .
“ what we need to do in ukraine is impress the eu with our rapid tempo in introducing and implementing reforms .
if we develop quickly enough , the eu will have to respond positively – i ’ m absolutely convinced . ” increase reform tempo ukraine ’ s reform efforts have not gone unnoticed in the eu , ribatschuk said . just a week ago , the eu parliament voted in favor of offering kiev a european perspective .
solana and ferrero-waldner have also written a letter to yushchenko outlining an “ eu action plan ” for partnership .
the letter is a first step in the right direction , according to ribatschuk who sees it as proof of brussels ’ interest in strengthening ties with kiev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin backed yushchenko 's opponent in the election , viktor yanokovych in addition to the eu , ukraine is also striving to enter the nato .
there are just two options , said ribatschuk : “ either we align ourselves with the west or with russia . ”
ukraine and viktor yushchenko have clearly decided in favor of europe .
that does not mean kiev aims to alienate itself from russia , nor does russian president vladimir putin have cause for alarm concerning ukraine ’ s new political course . refocusing foreign policy russia is still the new ukrainian president ’ s first official stop on his foreign tour .
in doing so , yushchenko will stress the fact that he does not wish to break away entirely from russia , a country which for years exerted influence on the smaller neighboring country . “ the main reason for the visit with putin is not to sign any contracts or to drink too many glasses of vodka in the name of friendship .
rather , the point is to revive the close ties , ” ribatschuk said . at the moment though , russia is not at the forefront of ukraine ’ s foreign policy .
it is more important that the new ukrainian government focus its efforts on the eu and nato and convince the population of the necessity of such an endeavor , the future eu minister said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : a stain on the soul of german soccer key man in match rigging scandal released soccer chiefs debate betting post-hoyzer referee scandal rears its ugly head former dortmund player admits to bribe current affairs -pipe- 24.01.2005 referee scandal threatens germany 's world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pointing the finger : hoyzer -lrb- right -rrb- is accused of widespread match-fixing instead of a fanfare heralding the first opportunity for the public to book their places at the world cup in germany in 2006 , alarm bells are ringing over a match-rigging scandal that threatens to sully the event . just over a day before the world 's attention was to turn to germany for the official release of world cup 2006 tickets , the latest in the host country 's moments in the sporting sun was eclipsed by a largely unknown second division german referee called robert hoyzer . the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- confirmed on saturday afternoon that they had begun investigating hozyer , 25 , for fixing a cup match that he had apparently bet on .
the berlin-born referee resigned from his post on friday when the probe came to light . the match at the center of the scandal took place on aug .
21 , 2004 , with regional side sc paderborn and bundesliga heavyweights sv hamburg contesting a dfb cup first round match . with the 1983 european cup winners leading the minor league minnows 2-0 , hamburg inexplicably saw their lead disintegrate .
during an allegedly assisted comeback , paderborn were awarded two dubious penalites , both of which were scored , and also benefited when hsv 's belgian striker emile mpenza was sent off for complaining against hozyer 's decisions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer .
the dfb , who will hold an emergency meeting on monday following hozyer 's -lrb- picture -rrb- shock resignation , added that there was also evidence of manipulation of other games involving the the referee . fears of multiple offences " since friday we have had evidence that he rigged games , " dfb joint-president theo zwanziger said on german television station ard .
hoyzer did not referee in the top bundesliga division but had taken charge of 12 second division matches as well as cup and regional league fixtures . " this case has caused great damage to the dfb , " said gerhard mayer-vorfelder , the other of the dfb 's two co-chairmen , ahead of monday 's meeting .
" just from the psychological aspect , incredible damage has been done , for the german federation and for the referees ' organization . "
mayer-vorfelder also called for a general ban on betting for referees . dfb board president horst hilpert told german sports news agency sid on sunday that the investigation into the scandal would be concluded as soon as possible .
" it is always the obligation of the board of control to reach their conclusions swiftly , particularly in so stressful a case . " " we 're going to see if prosecutors need to be involved , " dfb spokesman harald stenger added in a separate statement .
" we 'll also want to talk to bookmakers .
-lrb- the dfb -rrb- will leave no stone unturned in this investigation .
from what we know at this point , this is absolutely a single case .
no other referee , no player , no coach , no club is involved .
i also want to stress that -lrb- hoyzer 's -rrb- denying all allegations . " " i have never bet on a game i have refereed , " hoyzer told the bild newspaper on monday .
" the accusations have left me pensive , uneasy and dismayed .
i can not comprehend them , and also can not understand that my refereeing colleagues could think me capable of such a thing . " aggrieved hsv consider own action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hsv hamburg could seek compensation .
meanwhile , hamburg officials are holding fire on action of their own until the dfb investigation is complete .
" we are waiting to see how the probe develops and will stay in contact with the dfb to see how we should react , " explained hamburg chief bernd hoffmann told zdf television .
" if it is confirmed , we want some sort of compensation .
who knows how our season might have gone ?
we could still be going strong in the cup at this stage . " " great damage has been inflicted on hamburg sv and on german football , " hoffman added .
" we will use all legal means to put right this wrong . "
however , there is little chance that the clubs will get the chance to right the wrongs on the pitch .
the dfb has already ruled out any possibility of replaying the disputed match . another person involved was entertaining similar thoughts as to what would have happened if the outcome of the game had been different .
former hsv coach klaus toppmoller was in charge of hamburg at the time of the match and claimed hoyzer 's corrupt decisions caused his dismissal two months later . toppmöller blames ref for sack " the referee -lrb- hoyzer -rrb- cost me my job as we were doing fine until the paderborn game , " raged toppmoller in the bild am sonntag weekly . " after that it all went downhill.i had the impression that it was a match we could never win .
i knew something was n't right and i even told the referee 's assistant at the time .
but what can you do ?
if you say there is cheating going on , you could face a ban . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmöller feels his future was jeopardized by the refereeing decisions .
referees now face increased scrutiny into their actions for the remainder of the season .
the hoyzer revelations are likely to increase suspicion when questionable decisions are made .
" from now on all referee decisions will be questioned , " admitted oliver bierhoff , assistant coach of the german national team , in a statement to reporters .
" but i am sure this is just a one-off case . " ghosts of 1971 scandal stirring the dfb will surely hope so .
while it is doing its upmost to prevent the hozyer affair from enveloping german football ahead of the 2006 world cup on home soil , the dfb will be sorely reminded of a previous incident which blew up into the biggest scandal in german football . match-fixing and bribes engulfed the bundesliga in 1971 when more than 50 players , a number of coaches and officials plus the clubs arminia bielefeld and kickers offenbach were found guilty of offering bribes and fixing bundesliga games , prompting the dfb to dish out hefty fines and suspensions . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga restarts with bayern victory it was business as usual as bayern munich opened the second half of the bundesliga season with a 3-0 win over hamburg sv in the olympic stadium on friday .

the berlin-born referee resigned from his post on friday when the probe came to light . the match at the center of the scandal took place on aug .
21 , 2004 , with regional side sc paderborn and bundesliga heavyweights sv hamburg contesting a dfb cup first round match . with the 1983 european cup winners leading the minor league minnows 2-0 , hamburg inexplicably saw their lead disintegrate .
during an allegedly assisted comeback , paderborn were awarded two dubious penalites , both of which were scored , and also benefited when hsv 's belgian striker emile mpenza was sent off for complaining against hozyer 's decisions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer .
the dfb , who will hold an emergency meeting on monday following hozyer 's -lrb- picture -rrb- shock resignation , added that there was also evidence of manipulation of other games involving the the referee . fears of multiple offences " since friday we have had evidence that he rigged games , " dfb joint-president theo zwanziger said on german television station ard .
hoyzer did not referee in the top bundesliga division but had taken charge of 12 second division matches as well as cup and regional league fixtures . " this case has caused great damage to the dfb , " said gerhard mayer-vorfelder , the other of the dfb 's two co-chairmen , ahead of monday 's meeting .
" just from the psychological aspect , incredible damage has been done , for the german federation and for the referees ' organization . "
mayer-vorfelder also called for a general ban on betting for referees . dfb board president horst hilpert told german sports news agency sid on sunday that the investigation into the scandal would be concluded as soon as possible .
" it is always the obligation of the board of control to reach their conclusions swiftly , particularly in so stressful a case . " " we 're going to see if prosecutors need to be involved , " dfb spokesman harald stenger added in a separate statement .
" we 'll also want to talk to bookmakers .
-lrb- the dfb -rrb- will leave no stone unturned in this investigation .
from what we know at this point , this is absolutely a single case .
no other referee , no player , no coach , no club is involved .
i also want to stress that -lrb- hoyzer 's -rrb- denying all allegations . " " i have never bet on a game i have refereed , " hoyzer told the bild newspaper on monday .
" the accusations have left me pensive , uneasy and dismayed .
i can not comprehend them , and also can not understand that my refereeing colleagues could think me capable of such a thing . " aggrieved hsv consider own action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hsv hamburg could seek compensation .
meanwhile , hamburg officials are holding fire on action of their own until the dfb investigation is complete .
" we are waiting to see how the probe develops and will stay in contact with the dfb to see how we should react , " explained hamburg chief bernd hoffmann told zdf television .
" if it is confirmed , we want some sort of compensation .
who knows how our season might have gone ?
we could still be going strong in the cup at this stage . " " great damage has been inflicted on hamburg sv and on german football , " hoffman added .
" we will use all legal means to put right this wrong . "
however , there is little chance that the clubs will get the chance to right the wrongs on the pitch .
the dfb has already ruled out any possibility of replaying the disputed match . another person involved was entertaining similar thoughts as to what would have happened if the outcome of the game had been different .
former hsv coach klaus toppmoller was in charge of hamburg at the time of the match and claimed hoyzer 's corrupt decisions caused his dismissal two months later . toppmöller blames ref for sack " the referee -lrb- hoyzer -rrb- cost me my job as we were doing fine until the paderborn game , " raged toppmoller in the bild am sonntag weekly . " after that it all went downhill.i had the impression that it was a match we could never win .
i knew something was n't right and i even told the referee 's assistant at the time .
but what can you do ?
if you say there is cheating going on , you could face a ban . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmöller feels his future was jeopardized by the refereeing decisions .
referees now face increased scrutiny into their actions for the remainder of the season .
the hoyzer revelations are likely to increase suspicion when questionable decisions are made .
" from now on all referee decisions will be questioned , " admitted oliver bierhoff , assistant coach of the german national team , in a statement to reporters .
" but i am sure this is just a one-off case . " ghosts of 1971 scandal stirring the dfb will surely hope so .
while it is doing its upmost to prevent the hozyer affair from enveloping german football ahead of the 2006 world cup on home soil , the dfb will be sorely reminded of a previous incident which blew up into the biggest scandal in german football . match-fixing and bribes engulfed the bundesliga in 1971 when more than 50 players , a number of coaches and officials plus the clubs arminia bielefeld and kickers offenbach were found guilty of offering bribes and fixing bundesliga games , prompting the dfb to dish out hefty fines and suspensions . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga restarts with bayern victory it was business as usual as bayern munich opened the second half of the bundesliga season with a 3-0 win over hamburg sv in the olympic stadium on friday .

i can not comprehend them , and also can not understand that my refereeing colleagues could think me capable of such a thing . " aggrieved hsv consider own action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hsv hamburg could seek compensation .
meanwhile , hamburg officials are holding fire on action of their own until the dfb investigation is complete .
" we are waiting to see how the probe develops and will stay in contact with the dfb to see how we should react , " explained hamburg chief bernd hoffmann told zdf television .
" if it is confirmed , we want some sort of compensation .
who knows how our season might have gone ?
we could still be going strong in the cup at this stage . " " great damage has been inflicted on hamburg sv and on german football , " hoffman added .
" we will use all legal means to put right this wrong . "
however , there is little chance that the clubs will get the chance to right the wrongs on the pitch .
the dfb has already ruled out any possibility of replaying the disputed match . another person involved was entertaining similar thoughts as to what would have happened if the outcome of the game had been different .
former hsv coach klaus toppmoller was in charge of hamburg at the time of the match and claimed hoyzer 's corrupt decisions caused his dismissal two months later . toppmöller blames ref for sack " the referee -lrb- hoyzer -rrb- cost me my job as we were doing fine until the paderborn game , " raged toppmoller in the bild am sonntag weekly . " after that it all went downhill.i had the impression that it was a match we could never win .
i knew something was n't right and i even told the referee 's assistant at the time .
but what can you do ?
if you say there is cheating going on , you could face a ban . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmöller feels his future was jeopardized by the refereeing decisions .
referees now face increased scrutiny into their actions for the remainder of the season .
the hoyzer revelations are likely to increase suspicion when questionable decisions are made .
" from now on all referee decisions will be questioned , " admitted oliver bierhoff , assistant coach of the german national team , in a statement to reporters .
" but i am sure this is just a one-off case . " ghosts of 1971 scandal stirring the dfb will surely hope so .
while it is doing its upmost to prevent the hozyer affair from enveloping german football ahead of the 2006 world cup on home soil , the dfb will be sorely reminded of a previous incident which blew up into the biggest scandal in german football . match-fixing and bribes engulfed the bundesliga in 1971 when more than 50 players , a number of coaches and officials plus the clubs arminia bielefeld and kickers offenbach were found guilty of offering bribes and fixing bundesliga games , prompting the dfb to dish out hefty fines and suspensions . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga restarts with bayern victory it was business as usual as bayern munich opened the second half of the bundesliga season with a 3-0 win over hamburg sv in the olympic stadium on friday .

dw 's heinz dylong says there 's too little outrage over their behavior . the national democratic party 's -lrb- npd -rrb- behavior in saxony 's state parliament was absolutely unbearable !
first , they withdrew from a minute of silence for the victims of the holocaust , then came a debate in which they equated the world war ii bombing of dresden with the holocaust .
they spoke of a " bombing holocaust , " described the allies as " mass murderers " and the air strikes as a " cold-blooded planned industrial mass murder of the civilian population . " the air campaign on dresden in february 1945 certainly should n't be played down .
the attack on the refugee-filled city that killed more than 35,000 made little sense according to military standards .
that may - indeed , it must - be lamented .
all the same , nothing can be equated to the mass murder and the contempt for humanity that distinguished the holocaust .
it was an unparalleled historical low .
the air campaign on dresden was a superfluous and appalling operation ; but its deeper cause was the war provoked by germany .
and that must without fail be taken into consideration when the victims of the attack on dresden are commemorated . but such considerations are entirely alien to the far-right npd .
given their muddled thoughts , no one should be surprised .
what is alarming is that the npd does n't fear that such statements would hurt them in the eyes of voters .
they received more than 9 percent of the votes in state parliamentary elections in saxony in september . no deterrent and even though that does n't mean the voters were all right-known extremists - a significant number was motivated by the federal government 's social reforms - the frightening findings do show that the npd 's well-known extremist positions did n't deter voters .
the core of the npd 's party platform was n't enough to keep voters in the democratic camp .
while in the 1960s , the npd 's temporary upswing was attributed to their voters coming from old nazi circles , this explanation is impossible today . the secretary general of the central council of jews in germany , stephan kramer , declared that " anti-semitic and xenophobic ideas long ago became socially acceptable again . "
that should n't be viewed simply as an all too pessimistic estimation .
rather , it is a request to the democratic parties and the democratic public .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , 60 years after the liberation of the concentration camps , an offensive confrontation with right-wing extremist attitudes must be sought . and the ban on the npd that failed two years ago due to the applicants ' amateurish procedure - they relied on testimony to the federal constitutional court from witnesses in the service of one of germany 's intelligence services - should be considered again . after all , one need n't repeat the same mistakes , and intellectual discussion of right-wing extremism , which is surely necessary , is thus not out of the question . heinz dylong -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right german party belittles holocaust a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims .

first , they withdrew from a minute of silence for the victims of the holocaust , then came a debate in which they equated the world war ii bombing of dresden with the holocaust .
they spoke of a " bombing holocaust , " described the allies as " mass murderers " and the air strikes as a " cold-blooded planned industrial mass murder of the civilian population . " the air campaign on dresden in february 1945 certainly should n't be played down .

with the winter break over , the top three teams broke from the chasing pack with victories in their first games of the new year . the bundesliga got underway again after the winter break on friday evening with league leaders bayern munich entertaining mid-table hamburg sv .
the bavarian giants seemed happy to be back and looked as though they had celebrated the festive spell in moderation as bayern romped to an energetic 3-0 win over hsv . felix magath 's side took the lead with a 21st minute claudio pizarro header from mehmet scholl 's free kick and whethered a spirited hsv resurgeance before hitting the visitors hard in a tiring second half .
goals from bastian schweinsteiger and roy makaay completed the win to consolidate munich 's lead at the top of the bundesliga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pizarro opens the scoring for bayern against hsv . the majority of the chasing pack returned to action on saturday .
second-placed schalke 04 played host to floundering champions werder bremen and were lucky to survive a first half where the royal blues appeared leaden-footed .
schalke improved dramatically after the break , taking the lead through striker gerald asamoah two minutes after the restart . werder equalized when miroslav klose was bundled over in the penalty area and valerien ismael converted the spot-kick .
schalke 's ailton hit the side-netting five minutes later but he made no mistake when the outstanding asamoah found him with a short pass after 67 minutes to give the home side a 2-1 win which kept schalke 's championship aspirations alive . bildunterschrift : schalke sunk werder 's title defense with goals from asamoah and ailton . third-placed stuttgart traveled to mainz for their first game of the year and fell behind early on when fabian gerber lifted the ball over timo hildebrand after taking a sweet pass from antonio da silva in the 13th minute . dimo wache 's own goal got stuttgart back into the game early in the second half and then aliaksandr hleb added the second in the 54th minute before surging threough the mainz defence to set up cacau for the third with 66 minutes gone .
christoph teinert caused vfb a scare by pulling one back for mainz in injury-time but the points went to stuttgart who remain on the title pace . wolfsburg challenge hit by battling bvb former league leaders vfl wolfsburg were in need of a lift following a run of results before the break which undermined their previously strong , although surprising , title challenge .
unfortunately , the winners in the day were borussia dortmund who came and conquered with their own challenge in mind : staying up . dortmund eased their relegation fears with a fine victory courtesy of new signing ebi smolarek who scored with a left-foot shot after 55 minutes .
five minutes later , jan koller took a through ball from lars ricken , held off the covering defender and tucked bvb 's second past the keeper .
facundo quiroga pulled one back with eight minutes to go after being set up by martin petrov but the wolves went down and slipped to seven points adrift of bayern at the top . bildunterschrift : dortmund helped their own cause and severely dented wolfsburg 's title hopes with a vital win . kaiserslautern , another team which had flirted with relegation for most of the early part of the season , jumped three places to a comfortable 10th with a comprehensive 3-1 win away at nuremberg .
herve lembi opened the scoring six minutes after the break and stefan blank , signed this week from alemmania aachen , side-footed in for the second on the hour . sven müller 's reply for nuremberg in the 66th minute offered the home side brief hope but dimitris grammozis sealed the win for the visitors with a free kick that squeezed through the wall . relegation congestion easing in the cellar borussia mönchengladbach earned some breathing space in the relegation zone by beating arminia bielefeld 1-0 .
australian international craig moore , signed from scottish club rangers in the transfer window , made a match-winning debut for mönchengladbach with a header in the 52nd minute to give his side a valuable win that lifts them away from the basement .
gladbach are now five points clear of the drop zone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalemate in the relgation battle between freiburg and rostock .
bottom club freiburg were not so lucky .
the basement dwellers will feel aggrieved not to have beaten their fellow relegation candidates hansa rostock after dominating the second half of their crucial contest . soumalia coulibaly hit the bar in the 62nd minute and samuel koejoe had a goal disallowed when he bundled the ball over the line only for referee markus merk to blow for a foul on the keeper .
there was little else to cheer in the 0-0 draw which did either sides no real favors in their battle to escape the drop . berlin slip-up in title pursuit hertha berlin 's resurgent form before the break failed to continue past the new year as the league 's form team missed the chance to go fourth by letting a 2-0 lead slip at bochum on sunday .
nando rafael chipped in the first and then gilberto lashed in the second within the first quarter of an hour , but a peter madsen penalty six minutes before half-time and a deserved equalizer from vratislav lokvenc robbed the capital 's club the chance to maintain their impressive winning streak . rudi völler was left beaming in the other sunday game as bayer leverkusen put on a virtuoso performance in their first match since the former germany coach rejoined the club as sporting director , beating hannover 3-0 away from home . traveling bayer ease to away win bildunterschrift : bayer leverkusen eased to a 3-0 victory over hanover 96 . paul freier set up the opening goal in the 18th minute with a fine cross for andriy voronin to head into the roof of the net and dimitar berbatov made it 2-0 nine minutes before the break with a turn and shot from outside the area .
a deflected freier shot in the 58th minute completed the scoring and spoiled the party for hanover fans who had come to celebrate the official opening of their rebuilt world cup stadium . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga restarts with bayern victory it was business as usual as bayern munich opened the second half of the bundesliga season with a 3-0 win over hamburg sv in the olympic stadium on friday .

goals from bastian schweinsteiger and roy makaay completed the win to consolidate munich 's lead at the top of the bundesliga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pizarro opens the scoring for bayern against hsv . the majority of the chasing pack returned to action on saturday .
second-placed schalke 04 played host to floundering champions werder bremen and were lucky to survive a first half where the royal blues appeared leaden-footed .
schalke improved dramatically after the break , taking the lead through striker gerald asamoah two minutes after the restart . werder equalized when miroslav klose was bundled over in the penalty area and valerien ismael converted the spot-kick .
schalke 's ailton hit the side-netting five minutes later but he made no mistake when the outstanding asamoah found him with a short pass after 67 minutes to give the home side a 2-1 win which kept schalke 's championship aspirations alive . bildunterschrift : schalke sunk werder 's title defense with goals from asamoah and ailton . third-placed stuttgart traveled to mainz for their first game of the year and fell behind early on when fabian gerber lifted the ball over timo hildebrand after taking a sweet pass from antonio da silva in the 13th minute . dimo wache 's own goal got stuttgart back into the game early in the second half and then aliaksandr hleb added the second in the 54th minute before surging threough the mainz defence to set up cacau for the third with 66 minutes gone .

unfortunately , the winners in the day were borussia dortmund who came and conquered with their own challenge in mind : staying up . dortmund eased their relegation fears with a fine victory courtesy of new signing ebi smolarek who scored with a left-foot shot after 55 minutes .
five minutes later , jan koller took a through ball from lars ricken , held off the covering defender and tucked bvb 's second past the keeper .
facundo quiroga pulled one back with eight minutes to go after being set up by martin petrov but the wolves went down and slipped to seven points adrift of bayern at the top . bildunterschrift : dortmund helped their own cause and severely dented wolfsburg 's title hopes with a vital win . kaiserslautern , another team which had flirted with relegation for most of the early part of the season , jumped three places to a comfortable 10th with a comprehensive 3-1 win away at nuremberg .

there was little else to cheer in the 0-0 draw which did either sides no real favors in their battle to escape the drop . berlin slip-up in title pursuit hertha berlin 's resurgent form before the break failed to continue past the new year as the league 's form team missed the chance to go fourth by letting a 2-0 lead slip at bochum on sunday .
nando rafael chipped in the first and then gilberto lashed in the second within the first quarter of an hour , but a peter madsen penalty six minutes before half-time and a deserved equalizer from vratislav lokvenc robbed the capital 's club the chance to maintain their impressive winning streak . rudi völler was left beaming in the other sunday game as bayer leverkusen put on a virtuoso performance in their first match since the former germany coach rejoined the club as sporting director , beating hannover 3-0 away from home . traveling bayer ease to away win bildunterschrift : bayer leverkusen eased to a 3-0 victory over hanover 96 . paul freier set up the opening goal in the 18th minute with a fine cross for andriy voronin to head into the roof of the net and dimitar berbatov made it 2-0 nine minutes before the break with a turn and shot from outside the area .

and well it should be considering the purportedly excessive amount of drugs consumed and sexual fantasies fulfilled there .

with the winter break over , the top three teams broke from the chasing pack with victories in their first games of the new year . the bundesliga got underway again after the winter break on friday evening with league leaders bayern munich entertaining mid-table hamburg sv .
the bavarian giants seemed happy to be back and looked as though they had celebrated the festive spell in moderation as bayern romped to an energetic 3-0 win over hsv . felix magath 's side took the lead with a 21st minute claudio pizarro header from mehmet scholl 's free kick and whethered a spirited hsv resurgeance before hitting the visitors hard in a tiring second half .
goals from bastian schweinsteiger and roy makaay completed the win to consolidate munich 's lead at the top of the bundesliga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pizarro opens the scoring for bayern against hsv . the majority of the chasing pack returned to action on saturday .
second-placed schalke 04 played host to floundering champions werder bremen and were lucky to survive a first half where the royal blues appeared leaden-footed .
schalke improved dramatically after the break , taking the lead through striker gerald asamoah two minutes after the restart . werder equalized when miroslav klose was bundled over in the penalty area and valerien ismael converted the spot-kick .
schalke 's ailton hit the side-netting five minutes later but he made no mistake when the outstanding asamoah found him with a short pass after 67 minutes to give the home side a 2-1 win which kept schalke 's championship aspirations alive . bildunterschrift : schalke sunk werder 's title defense with goals from asamoah and ailton . third-placed stuttgart traveled to mainz for their first game of the year and fell behind early on when fabian gerber lifted the ball over timo hildebrand after taking a sweet pass from antonio da silva in the 13th minute . dimo wache 's own goal got stuttgart back into the game early in the second half and then aliaksandr hleb added the second in the 54th minute before surging threough the mainz defence to set up cacau for the third with 66 minutes gone .

five minutes later , jan koller took a through ball from lars ricken , held off the covering defender and tucked bvb 's second past the keeper .
facundo quiroga pulled one back with eight minutes to go after being set up by martin petrov but the wolves went down and slipped to seven points adrift of bayern at the top . bildunterschrift : dortmund helped their own cause and severely dented wolfsburg 's title hopes with a vital win . kaiserslautern , another team which had flirted with relegation for most of the early part of the season , jumped three places to a comfortable 10th with a comprehensive 3-1 win away at nuremberg .
herve lembi opened the scoring six minutes after the break and stefan blank , signed this week from alemmania aachen , side-footed in for the second on the hour . sven müller 's reply for nuremberg in the 66th minute offered the home side brief hope but dimitris grammozis sealed the win for the visitors with a free kick that squeezed through the wall . relegation congestion easing in the cellar borussia mönchengladbach earned some breathing space in the relegation zone by beating arminia bielefeld 1-0 .

there was little else to cheer in the 0-0 draw which did either sides no real favors in their battle to escape the drop . berlin slip-up in title pursuit hertha berlin 's resurgent form before the break failed to continue past the new year as the league 's form team missed the chance to go fourth by letting a 2-0 lead slip at bochum on sunday .
nando rafael chipped in the first and then gilberto lashed in the second within the first quarter of an hour , but a peter madsen penalty six minutes before half-time and a deserved equalizer from vratislav lokvenc robbed the capital 's club the chance to maintain their impressive winning streak . rudi völler was left beaming in the other sunday game as bayer leverkusen put on a virtuoso performance in their first match since the former germany coach rejoined the club as sporting director , beating hannover 3-0 away from home . traveling bayer ease to away win bildunterschrift : bayer leverkusen eased to a 3-0 victory over hanover 96 . paul freier set up the opening goal in the 18th minute with a fine cross for andriy voronin to head into the roof of the net and dimitar berbatov made it 2-0 nine minutes before the break with a turn and shot from outside the area .

during the ceremony on sunday , the 50-year-old hero of the orange revolution vowed to defend the sovereignty and independence of his country and to uphold the values of his party , the constitution and the ukrainian people . “ this is a victory for freedom over tyranny , ” yushchenko proclaimed to tens of thousands of his protestors gathered in the main square of kiev . bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko passes by honor guards during a military ceremony in mariinsky palace in kiev , ukraine , sunday , jan .

rather , the point is to revive the close ties , ” ribatschuk said . at the moment though , russia is not at the forefront of ukraine ’ s foreign policy .

with the winter break over , the top three teams broke from the chasing pack with victories in their first games of the new year . the bundesliga got underway again after the winter break on friday evening with league leaders bayern munich entertaining mid-table hamburg sv .
the bavarian giants seemed happy to be back and looked as though they had celebrated the festive spell in moderation as bayern romped to an energetic 3-0 win over hsv . felix magath 's side took the lead with a 21st minute claudio pizarro header from mehmet scholl 's free kick and whethered a spirited hsv resurgeance before hitting the visitors hard in a tiring second half .
goals from bastian schweinsteiger and roy makaay completed the win to consolidate munich 's lead at the top of the bundesliga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pizarro opens the scoring for bayern against hsv . the majority of the chasing pack returned to action on saturday .
second-placed schalke 04 played host to floundering champions werder bremen and were lucky to survive a first half where the royal blues appeared leaden-footed .
schalke improved dramatically after the break , taking the lead through striker gerald asamoah two minutes after the restart . werder equalized when miroslav klose was bundled over in the penalty area and valerien ismael converted the spot-kick .
schalke 's ailton hit the side-netting five minutes later but he made no mistake when the outstanding asamoah found him with a short pass after 67 minutes to give the home side a 2-1 win which kept schalke 's championship aspirations alive . bildunterschrift : schalke sunk werder 's title defense with goals from asamoah and ailton . third-placed stuttgart traveled to mainz for their first game of the year and fell behind early on when fabian gerber lifted the ball over timo hildebrand after taking a sweet pass from antonio da silva in the 13th minute . dimo wache 's own goal got stuttgart back into the game early in the second half and then aliaksandr hleb added the second in the 54th minute before surging threough the mainz defence to set up cacau for the third with 66 minutes gone .
christoph teinert caused vfb a scare by pulling one back for mainz in injury-time but the points went to stuttgart who remain on the title pace . wolfsburg challenge hit by battling bvb former league leaders vfl wolfsburg were in need of a lift following a run of results before the break which undermined their previously strong , although surprising , title challenge .
unfortunately , the winners in the day were borussia dortmund who came and conquered with their own challenge in mind : staying up . dortmund eased their relegation fears with a fine victory courtesy of new signing ebi smolarek who scored with a left-foot shot after 55 minutes .
five minutes later , jan koller took a through ball from lars ricken , held off the covering defender and tucked bvb 's second past the keeper .
facundo quiroga pulled one back with eight minutes to go after being set up by martin petrov but the wolves went down and slipped to seven points adrift of bayern at the top . bildunterschrift : dortmund helped their own cause and severely dented wolfsburg 's title hopes with a vital win . kaiserslautern , another team which had flirted with relegation for most of the early part of the season , jumped three places to a comfortable 10th with a comprehensive 3-1 win away at nuremberg .
herve lembi opened the scoring six minutes after the break and stefan blank , signed this week from alemmania aachen , side-footed in for the second on the hour . sven müller 's reply for nuremberg in the 66th minute offered the home side brief hope but dimitris grammozis sealed the win for the visitors with a free kick that squeezed through the wall . relegation congestion easing in the cellar borussia mönchengladbach earned some breathing space in the relegation zone by beating arminia bielefeld 1-0 .
australian international craig moore , signed from scottish club rangers in the transfer window , made a match-winning debut for mönchengladbach with a header in the 52nd minute to give his side a valuable win that lifts them away from the basement .
gladbach are now five points clear of the drop zone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalemate in the relgation battle between freiburg and rostock .
bottom club freiburg were not so lucky .
the basement dwellers will feel aggrieved not to have beaten their fellow relegation candidates hansa rostock after dominating the second half of their crucial contest . soumalia coulibaly hit the bar in the 62nd minute and samuel koejoe had a goal disallowed when he bundled the ball over the line only for referee markus merk to blow for a foul on the keeper .

with the winter break over , the top three teams broke from the chasing pack with victories in their first games of the new year . the bundesliga got underway again after the winter break on friday evening with league leaders bayern munich entertaining mid-table hamburg sv .
the bavarian giants seemed happy to be back and looked as though they had celebrated the festive spell in moderation as bayern romped to an energetic 3-0 win over hsv . felix magath 's side took the lead with a 21st minute claudio pizarro header from mehmet scholl 's free kick and whethered a spirited hsv resurgeance before hitting the visitors hard in a tiring second half .
goals from bastian schweinsteiger and roy makaay completed the win to consolidate munich 's lead at the top of the bundesliga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pizarro opens the scoring for bayern against hsv . the majority of the chasing pack returned to action on saturday .
second-placed schalke 04 played host to floundering champions werder bremen and were lucky to survive a first half where the royal blues appeared leaden-footed .
schalke improved dramatically after the break , taking the lead through striker gerald asamoah two minutes after the restart . werder equalized when miroslav klose was bundled over in the penalty area and valerien ismael converted the spot-kick .
schalke 's ailton hit the side-netting five minutes later but he made no mistake when the outstanding asamoah found him with a short pass after 67 minutes to give the home side a 2-1 win which kept schalke 's championship aspirations alive . bildunterschrift : schalke sunk werder 's title defense with goals from asamoah and ailton . third-placed stuttgart traveled to mainz for their first game of the year and fell behind early on when fabian gerber lifted the ball over timo hildebrand after taking a sweet pass from antonio da silva in the 13th minute . dimo wache 's own goal got stuttgart back into the game early in the second half and then aliaksandr hleb added the second in the 54th minute before surging threough the mainz defence to set up cacau for the third with 66 minutes gone .
christoph teinert caused vfb a scare by pulling one back for mainz in injury-time but the points went to stuttgart who remain on the title pace . wolfsburg challenge hit by battling bvb former league leaders vfl wolfsburg were in need of a lift following a run of results before the break which undermined their previously strong , although surprising , title challenge .
unfortunately , the winners in the day were borussia dortmund who came and conquered with their own challenge in mind : staying up . dortmund eased their relegation fears with a fine victory courtesy of new signing ebi smolarek who scored with a left-foot shot after 55 minutes .
five minutes later , jan koller took a through ball from lars ricken , held off the covering defender and tucked bvb 's second past the keeper .
facundo quiroga pulled one back with eight minutes to go after being set up by martin petrov but the wolves went down and slipped to seven points adrift of bayern at the top . bildunterschrift : dortmund helped their own cause and severely dented wolfsburg 's title hopes with a vital win . kaiserslautern , another team which had flirted with relegation for most of the early part of the season , jumped three places to a comfortable 10th with a comprehensive 3-1 win away at nuremberg .
herve lembi opened the scoring six minutes after the break and stefan blank , signed this week from alemmania aachen , side-footed in for the second on the hour . sven müller 's reply for nuremberg in the 66th minute offered the home side brief hope but dimitris grammozis sealed the win for the visitors with a free kick that squeezed through the wall . relegation congestion easing in the cellar borussia mönchengladbach earned some breathing space in the relegation zone by beating arminia bielefeld 1-0 .
australian international craig moore , signed from scottish club rangers in the transfer window , made a match-winning debut for mönchengladbach with a header in the 52nd minute to give his side a valuable win that lifts them away from the basement .
gladbach are now five points clear of the drop zone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalemate in the relgation battle between freiburg and rostock .
bottom club freiburg were not so lucky .
the basement dwellers will feel aggrieved not to have beaten their fellow relegation candidates hansa rostock after dominating the second half of their crucial contest . soumalia coulibaly hit the bar in the 62nd minute and samuel koejoe had a goal disallowed when he bundled the ball over the line only for referee markus merk to blow for a foul on the keeper .

during the ceremony on sunday , the 50-year-old hero of the orange revolution vowed to defend the sovereignty and independence of his country and to uphold the values of his party , the constitution and the ukrainian people . “ this is a victory for freedom over tyranny , ” yushchenko proclaimed to tens of thousands of his protestors gathered in the main square of kiev . bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko passes by honor guards during a military ceremony in mariinsky palace in kiev , ukraine , sunday , jan .
23 , 2005 . but the pro-western leader will have little time to celebrate what surely is a tremendous victory for democracy in a state that just recently shed the yoke of soviet influence .
starting monday , yushchenko sets out on a tour of europe to prove his sincerity in cooperating closely with the west . opening new doors in brussels , ukraine ’ s future eu minister is already hard at work paving the way for his country ’ s most ambitious goal : entry in the 25-member european union . in an interview with deutsche welle , oleg ribatschuk said he ’ d like to see ukrainian accession as soon as possible , but he conceded that brussels ’ official line only allows for a close partnership in the near future . officially , the eu has said it is not negotiating accession , only a close partnership as part of the bloc ’ s neighborhood policy .
but even after meetings with the eu ’ s foreign policy chief javier solana and eu foreign relations commission benita ferrero-waldner , ribatschuk remains convinced that brussels will open its doors fully to kiev in the next 10 years , even before it lets in turkey . “ the door is not closed , ” he said .
“ what we need to do in ukraine is impress the eu with our rapid tempo in introducing and implementing reforms .
if we develop quickly enough , the eu will have to respond positively – i ’ m absolutely convinced . ” increase reform tempo ukraine ’ s reform efforts have not gone unnoticed in the eu , ribatschuk said . just a week ago , the eu parliament voted in favor of offering kiev a european perspective .
solana and ferrero-waldner have also written a letter to yushchenko outlining an “ eu action plan ” for partnership .
the letter is a first step in the right direction , according to ribatschuk who sees it as proof of brussels ’ interest in strengthening ties with kiev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin backed yushchenko 's opponent in the election , viktor yanokovych in addition to the eu , ukraine is also striving to enter the nato .
there are just two options , said ribatschuk : “ either we align ourselves with the west or with russia . ”
ukraine and viktor yushchenko have clearly decided in favor of europe .
that does not mean kiev aims to alienate itself from russia , nor does russian president vladimir putin have cause for alarm concerning ukraine ’ s new political course . refocusing foreign policy russia is still the new ukrainian president ’ s first official stop on his foreign tour .
in doing so , yushchenko will stress the fact that he does not wish to break away entirely from russia , a country which for years exerted influence on the smaller neighboring country . “ the main reason for the visit with putin is not to sign any contracts or to drink too many glasses of vodka in the name of friendship .
rather , the point is to revive the close ties , ” ribatschuk said . at the moment though , russia is not at the forefront of ukraine ’ s foreign policy .
it is more important that the new ukrainian government focus its efforts on the eu and nato and convince the population of the necessity of such an endeavor , the future eu minister said .

but even after meetings with the eu ’ s foreign policy chief javier solana and eu foreign relations commission benita ferrero-waldner , ribatschuk remains convinced that brussels will open its doors fully to kiev in the next 10 years , even before it lets in turkey . “ the door is not closed , ” he said .
“ what we need to do in ukraine is impress the eu with our rapid tempo in introducing and implementing reforms .
if we develop quickly enough , the eu will have to respond positively – i ’ m absolutely convinced . ” increase reform tempo ukraine ’ s reform efforts have not gone unnoticed in the eu , ribatschuk said . just a week ago , the eu parliament voted in favor of offering kiev a european perspective .
solana and ferrero-waldner have also written a letter to yushchenko outlining an “ eu action plan ” for partnership .
the letter is a first step in the right direction , according to ribatschuk who sees it as proof of brussels ’ interest in strengthening ties with kiev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin backed yushchenko 's opponent in the election , viktor yanokovych in addition to the eu , ukraine is also striving to enter the nato .
there are just two options , said ribatschuk : “ either we align ourselves with the west or with russia . ”
ukraine and viktor yushchenko have clearly decided in favor of europe .
that does not mean kiev aims to alienate itself from russia , nor does russian president vladimir putin have cause for alarm concerning ukraine ’ s new political course . refocusing foreign policy russia is still the new ukrainian president ’ s first official stop on his foreign tour .
in doing so , yushchenko will stress the fact that he does not wish to break away entirely from russia , a country which for years exerted influence on the smaller neighboring country . “ the main reason for the visit with putin is not to sign any contracts or to drink too many glasses of vodka in the name of friendship .
rather , the point is to revive the close ties , ” ribatschuk said . at the moment though , russia is not at the forefront of ukraine ’ s foreign policy .
it is more important that the new ukrainian government focus its efforts on the eu and nato and convince the population of the necessity of such an endeavor , the future eu minister said .

the berlin-born referee resigned from his post on friday when the probe came to light . the match at the center of the scandal took place on aug .
21 , 2004 , with regional side sc paderborn and bundesliga heavyweights sv hamburg contesting a dfb cup first round match . with the 1983 european cup winners leading the minor league minnows 2-0 , hamburg inexplicably saw their lead disintegrate .
during an allegedly assisted comeback , paderborn were awarded two dubious penalites , both of which were scored , and also benefited when hsv 's belgian striker emile mpenza was sent off for complaining against hozyer 's decisions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer .
the dfb , who will hold an emergency meeting on monday following hozyer 's -lrb- picture -rrb- shock resignation , added that there was also evidence of manipulation of other games involving the the referee . fears of multiple offences " since friday we have had evidence that he rigged games , " dfb joint-president theo zwanziger said on german television station ard .
hoyzer did not referee in the top bundesliga division but had taken charge of 12 second division matches as well as cup and regional league fixtures . " this case has caused great damage to the dfb , " said gerhard mayer-vorfelder , the other of the dfb 's two co-chairmen , ahead of monday 's meeting .
" just from the psychological aspect , incredible damage has been done , for the german federation and for the referees ' organization . "
mayer-vorfelder also called for a general ban on betting for referees . dfb board president horst hilpert told german sports news agency sid on sunday that the investigation into the scandal would be concluded as soon as possible .
" it is always the obligation of the board of control to reach their conclusions swiftly , particularly in so stressful a case . " " we 're going to see if prosecutors need to be involved , " dfb spokesman harald stenger added in a separate statement .
" we 'll also want to talk to bookmakers .
-lrb- the dfb -rrb- will leave no stone unturned in this investigation .
from what we know at this point , this is absolutely a single case .
no other referee , no player , no coach , no club is involved .
i also want to stress that -lrb- hoyzer 's -rrb- denying all allegations . " " i have never bet on a game i have refereed , " hoyzer told the bild newspaper on monday .
" the accusations have left me pensive , uneasy and dismayed .
i can not comprehend them , and also can not understand that my refereeing colleagues could think me capable of such a thing . " aggrieved hsv consider own action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hsv hamburg could seek compensation .
meanwhile , hamburg officials are holding fire on action of their own until the dfb investigation is complete .
" we are waiting to see how the probe develops and will stay in contact with the dfb to see how we should react , " explained hamburg chief bernd hoffmann told zdf television .
" if it is confirmed , we want some sort of compensation .
who knows how our season might have gone ?
we could still be going strong in the cup at this stage . " " great damage has been inflicted on hamburg sv and on german football , " hoffman added .
" we will use all legal means to put right this wrong . "
however , there is little chance that the clubs will get the chance to right the wrongs on the pitch .
the dfb has already ruled out any possibility of replaying the disputed match . another person involved was entertaining similar thoughts as to what would have happened if the outcome of the game had been different .
former hsv coach klaus toppmoller was in charge of hamburg at the time of the match and claimed hoyzer 's corrupt decisions caused his dismissal two months later . toppmöller blames ref for sack " the referee -lrb- hoyzer -rrb- cost me my job as we were doing fine until the paderborn game , " raged toppmoller in the bild am sonntag weekly . " after that it all went downhill.i had the impression that it was a match we could never win .
i knew something was n't right and i even told the referee 's assistant at the time .
but what can you do ?
if you say there is cheating going on , you could face a ban . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmöller feels his future was jeopardized by the refereeing decisions .
referees now face increased scrutiny into their actions for the remainder of the season .
the hoyzer revelations are likely to increase suspicion when questionable decisions are made .
" from now on all referee decisions will be questioned , " admitted oliver bierhoff , assistant coach of the german national team , in a statement to reporters .
" but i am sure this is just a one-off case . " ghosts of 1971 scandal stirring the dfb will surely hope so .
while it is doing its upmost to prevent the hozyer affair from enveloping german football ahead of the 2006 world cup on home soil , the dfb will be sorely reminded of a previous incident which blew up into the biggest scandal in german football . match-fixing and bribes engulfed the bundesliga in 1971 when more than 50 players , a number of coaches and officials plus the clubs arminia bielefeld and kickers offenbach were found guilty of offering bribes and fixing bundesliga games , prompting the dfb to dish out hefty fines and suspensions . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga restarts with bayern victory it was business as usual as bayern munich opened the second half of the bundesliga season with a 3-0 win over hamburg sv in the olympic stadium on friday .

21 , 2004 , with regional side sc paderborn and bundesliga heavyweights sv hamburg contesting a dfb cup first round match . with the 1983 european cup winners leading the minor league minnows 2-0 , hamburg inexplicably saw their lead disintegrate .
during an allegedly assisted comeback , paderborn were awarded two dubious penalites , both of which were scored , and also benefited when hsv 's belgian striker emile mpenza was sent off for complaining against hozyer 's decisions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer .
the dfb , who will hold an emergency meeting on monday following hozyer 's -lrb- picture -rrb- shock resignation , added that there was also evidence of manipulation of other games involving the the referee . fears of multiple offences " since friday we have had evidence that he rigged games , " dfb joint-president theo zwanziger said on german television station ard .
hoyzer did not referee in the top bundesliga division but had taken charge of 12 second division matches as well as cup and regional league fixtures . " this case has caused great damage to the dfb , " said gerhard mayer-vorfelder , the other of the dfb 's two co-chairmen , ahead of monday 's meeting .
" just from the psychological aspect , incredible damage has been done , for the german federation and for the referees ' organization . "
mayer-vorfelder also called for a general ban on betting for referees . dfb board president horst hilpert told german sports news agency sid on sunday that the investigation into the scandal would be concluded as soon as possible .
" it is always the obligation of the board of control to reach their conclusions swiftly , particularly in so stressful a case . " " we 're going to see if prosecutors need to be involved , " dfb spokesman harald stenger added in a separate statement .
" we 'll also want to talk to bookmakers .
-lrb- the dfb -rrb- will leave no stone unturned in this investigation .
from what we know at this point , this is absolutely a single case .
no other referee , no player , no coach , no club is involved .
i also want to stress that -lrb- hoyzer 's -rrb- denying all allegations . " " i have never bet on a game i have refereed , " hoyzer told the bild newspaper on monday .
" the accusations have left me pensive , uneasy and dismayed .
i can not comprehend them , and also can not understand that my refereeing colleagues could think me capable of such a thing . " aggrieved hsv consider own action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hsv hamburg could seek compensation .
meanwhile , hamburg officials are holding fire on action of their own until the dfb investigation is complete .
" we are waiting to see how the probe develops and will stay in contact with the dfb to see how we should react , " explained hamburg chief bernd hoffmann told zdf television .
" if it is confirmed , we want some sort of compensation .
who knows how our season might have gone ?
we could still be going strong in the cup at this stage . " " great damage has been inflicted on hamburg sv and on german football , " hoffman added .
" we will use all legal means to put right this wrong . "
however , there is little chance that the clubs will get the chance to right the wrongs on the pitch .
the dfb has already ruled out any possibility of replaying the disputed match . another person involved was entertaining similar thoughts as to what would have happened if the outcome of the game had been different .
former hsv coach klaus toppmoller was in charge of hamburg at the time of the match and claimed hoyzer 's corrupt decisions caused his dismissal two months later . toppmöller blames ref for sack " the referee -lrb- hoyzer -rrb- cost me my job as we were doing fine until the paderborn game , " raged toppmoller in the bild am sonntag weekly . " after that it all went downhill.i had the impression that it was a match we could never win .
i knew something was n't right and i even told the referee 's assistant at the time .
but what can you do ?
if you say there is cheating going on , you could face a ban . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmöller feels his future was jeopardized by the refereeing decisions .
referees now face increased scrutiny into their actions for the remainder of the season .
the hoyzer revelations are likely to increase suspicion when questionable decisions are made .
" from now on all referee decisions will be questioned , " admitted oliver bierhoff , assistant coach of the german national team , in a statement to reporters .
" but i am sure this is just a one-off case . " ghosts of 1971 scandal stirring the dfb will surely hope so .
while it is doing its upmost to prevent the hozyer affair from enveloping german football ahead of the 2006 world cup on home soil , the dfb will be sorely reminded of a previous incident which blew up into the biggest scandal in german football . match-fixing and bribes engulfed the bundesliga in 1971 when more than 50 players , a number of coaches and officials plus the clubs arminia bielefeld and kickers offenbach were found guilty of offering bribes and fixing bundesliga games , prompting the dfb to dish out hefty fines and suspensions . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga restarts with bayern victory it was business as usual as bayern munich opened the second half of the bundesliga season with a 3-0 win over hamburg sv in the olympic stadium on friday .

during the ceremony on sunday , the 50-year-old hero of the orange revolution vowed to defend the sovereignty and independence of his country and to uphold the values of his party , the constitution and the ukrainian people . “ this is a victory for freedom over tyranny , ” yushchenko proclaimed to tens of thousands of his protestors gathered in the main square of kiev . bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko passes by honor guards during a military ceremony in mariinsky palace in kiev , ukraine , sunday , jan .

the berlin-born referee resigned from his post on friday when the probe came to light . the match at the center of the scandal took place on aug .
21 , 2004 , with regional side sc paderborn and bundesliga heavyweights sv hamburg contesting a dfb cup first round match . with the 1983 european cup winners leading the minor league minnows 2-0 , hamburg inexplicably saw their lead disintegrate .
during an allegedly assisted comeback , paderborn were awarded two dubious penalites , both of which were scored , and also benefited when hsv 's belgian striker emile mpenza was sent off for complaining against hozyer 's decisions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer .
the dfb , who will hold an emergency meeting on monday following hozyer 's -lrb- picture -rrb- shock resignation , added that there was also evidence of manipulation of other games involving the the referee . fears of multiple offences " since friday we have had evidence that he rigged games , " dfb joint-president theo zwanziger said on german television station ard .
hoyzer did not referee in the top bundesliga division but had taken charge of 12 second division matches as well as cup and regional league fixtures . " this case has caused great damage to the dfb , " said gerhard mayer-vorfelder , the other of the dfb 's two co-chairmen , ahead of monday 's meeting .
" just from the psychological aspect , incredible damage has been done , for the german federation and for the referees ' organization . "
mayer-vorfelder also called for a general ban on betting for referees . dfb board president horst hilpert told german sports news agency sid on sunday that the investigation into the scandal would be concluded as soon as possible .
" it is always the obligation of the board of control to reach their conclusions swiftly , particularly in so stressful a case . " " we 're going to see if prosecutors need to be involved , " dfb spokesman harald stenger added in a separate statement .
" we 'll also want to talk to bookmakers .
-lrb- the dfb -rrb- will leave no stone unturned in this investigation .
from what we know at this point , this is absolutely a single case .
no other referee , no player , no coach , no club is involved .
i also want to stress that -lrb- hoyzer 's -rrb- denying all allegations . " " i have never bet on a game i have refereed , " hoyzer told the bild newspaper on monday .
" the accusations have left me pensive , uneasy and dismayed .
i can not comprehend them , and also can not understand that my refereeing colleagues could think me capable of such a thing . " aggrieved hsv consider own action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hsv hamburg could seek compensation .
meanwhile , hamburg officials are holding fire on action of their own until the dfb investigation is complete .
" we are waiting to see how the probe develops and will stay in contact with the dfb to see how we should react , " explained hamburg chief bernd hoffmann told zdf television .
" if it is confirmed , we want some sort of compensation .
who knows how our season might have gone ?
we could still be going strong in the cup at this stage . " " great damage has been inflicted on hamburg sv and on german football , " hoffman added .
" we will use all legal means to put right this wrong . "
however , there is little chance that the clubs will get the chance to right the wrongs on the pitch .
the dfb has already ruled out any possibility of replaying the disputed match . another person involved was entertaining similar thoughts as to what would have happened if the outcome of the game had been different .
former hsv coach klaus toppmoller was in charge of hamburg at the time of the match and claimed hoyzer 's corrupt decisions caused his dismissal two months later . toppmöller blames ref for sack " the referee -lrb- hoyzer -rrb- cost me my job as we were doing fine until the paderborn game , " raged toppmoller in the bild am sonntag weekly . " after that it all went downhill.i had the impression that it was a match we could never win .
i knew something was n't right and i even told the referee 's assistant at the time .
but what can you do ?
if you say there is cheating going on , you could face a ban . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmöller feels his future was jeopardized by the refereeing decisions .
referees now face increased scrutiny into their actions for the remainder of the season .
the hoyzer revelations are likely to increase suspicion when questionable decisions are made .
" from now on all referee decisions will be questioned , " admitted oliver bierhoff , assistant coach of the german national team , in a statement to reporters .
" but i am sure this is just a one-off case . " ghosts of 1971 scandal stirring the dfb will surely hope so .
while it is doing its upmost to prevent the hozyer affair from enveloping german football ahead of the 2006 world cup on home soil , the dfb will be sorely reminded of a previous incident which blew up into the biggest scandal in german football . match-fixing and bribes engulfed the bundesliga in 1971 when more than 50 players , a number of coaches and officials plus the clubs arminia bielefeld and kickers offenbach were found guilty of offering bribes and fixing bundesliga games , prompting the dfb to dish out hefty fines and suspensions . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga restarts with bayern victory it was business as usual as bayern munich opened the second half of the bundesliga season with a 3-0 win over hamburg sv in the olympic stadium on friday .

survivors and foreign dignitaries , including fischer and israeli foreign minister silvan shalom addressed the united nations general assembly . " we can not look away when synagogues are vandalized or damaged , " said fischer .
" and we ca n't stand by and listen to anti-semitic baiting . " the motion to hold the observance on jan .
27 was backed by nearly 150 of the world body ’ s 191 members .
it was sponsored by the united states , israel , the european union , russia , canada , australia and new zealand . germans and israelis address un bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children at auschwitz just before their liberation in 1945 .
the gathering took place three days before a state ceremony in poland at the site of the infamous auschwitz-birkenau death camp , where more than 1 million people - most of them jews - were killed . coming 30 years after the world body adopted a resolution branding zionism a “ form of racism ” - a move that soured un-israeli relations - the special session represents a significant event . israeli ambassador to the un dan gillerman , a vocal opponent at times of the body 's stance on the israeli-palestinian conflict , said the organization ’ s decision to hold the event could be linked to an evolving world . “ maybe we are at a point in history where the changes in the world are reflecting on the united nations .
we do live in a changing world , in a world which hopefully presents us today with a unique window of opportunity to make peace in our region , ” he said . " maybe that atmosphere has made it possible for 148 countries , including many countries who normally may not have supported such an initiative , to come aboard and we are very gratified that this is happening , ” gillerman said . keeping the memory alive for the future un secretary general kofi annan this week said new generations born after the war must not grow up unaware of the lessons of the holocaust . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners of war at the buchenwald concentration camp near weimar , germany , in april 1945 , just before american troops liberated the camp .
“ the founding of this organization was a direct response to the holocaust .

dw 's heinz dylong says there 's too little outrage over their behavior . the national democratic party 's -lrb- npd -rrb- behavior in saxony 's state parliament was absolutely unbearable !
first , they withdrew from a minute of silence for the victims of the holocaust , then came a debate in which they equated the world war ii bombing of dresden with the holocaust .
they spoke of a " bombing holocaust , " described the allies as " mass murderers " and the air strikes as a " cold-blooded planned industrial mass murder of the civilian population . " the air campaign on dresden in february 1945 certainly should n't be played down .
the attack on the refugee-filled city that killed more than 35,000 made little sense according to military standards .
that may - indeed , it must - be lamented .
all the same , nothing can be equated to the mass murder and the contempt for humanity that distinguished the holocaust .
it was an unparalleled historical low .
the air campaign on dresden was a superfluous and appalling operation ; but its deeper cause was the war provoked by germany .
and that must without fail be taken into consideration when the victims of the attack on dresden are commemorated . but such considerations are entirely alien to the far-right npd .
given their muddled thoughts , no one should be surprised .
what is alarming is that the npd does n't fear that such statements would hurt them in the eyes of voters .
they received more than 9 percent of the votes in state parliamentary elections in saxony in september . no deterrent and even though that does n't mean the voters were all right-known extremists - a significant number was motivated by the federal government 's social reforms - the frightening findings do show that the npd 's well-known extremist positions did n't deter voters .
the core of the npd 's party platform was n't enough to keep voters in the democratic camp .
while in the 1960s , the npd 's temporary upswing was attributed to their voters coming from old nazi circles , this explanation is impossible today . the secretary general of the central council of jews in germany , stephan kramer , declared that " anti-semitic and xenophobic ideas long ago became socially acceptable again . "
that should n't be viewed simply as an all too pessimistic estimation .
rather , it is a request to the democratic parties and the democratic public .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , 60 years after the liberation of the concentration camps , an offensive confrontation with right-wing extremist attitudes must be sought . and the ban on the npd that failed two years ago due to the applicants ' amateurish procedure - they relied on testimony to the federal constitutional court from witnesses in the service of one of germany 's intelligence services - should be considered again . after all , one need n't repeat the same mistakes , and intellectual discussion of right-wing extremism , which is surely necessary , is thus not out of the question . heinz dylong -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right german party belittles holocaust a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims .

with the winter break over , the top three teams broke from the chasing pack with victories in their first games of the new year . the bundesliga got underway again after the winter break on friday evening with league leaders bayern munich entertaining mid-table hamburg sv .
the bavarian giants seemed happy to be back and looked as though they had celebrated the festive spell in moderation as bayern romped to an energetic 3-0 win over hsv . felix magath 's side took the lead with a 21st minute claudio pizarro header from mehmet scholl 's free kick and whethered a spirited hsv resurgeance before hitting the visitors hard in a tiring second half .
goals from bastian schweinsteiger and roy makaay completed the win to consolidate munich 's lead at the top of the bundesliga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pizarro opens the scoring for bayern against hsv . the majority of the chasing pack returned to action on saturday .
second-placed schalke 04 played host to floundering champions werder bremen and were lucky to survive a first half where the royal blues appeared leaden-footed .
schalke improved dramatically after the break , taking the lead through striker gerald asamoah two minutes after the restart . werder equalized when miroslav klose was bundled over in the penalty area and valerien ismael converted the spot-kick .
schalke 's ailton hit the side-netting five minutes later but he made no mistake when the outstanding asamoah found him with a short pass after 67 minutes to give the home side a 2-1 win which kept schalke 's championship aspirations alive . bildunterschrift : schalke sunk werder 's title defense with goals from asamoah and ailton . third-placed stuttgart traveled to mainz for their first game of the year and fell behind early on when fabian gerber lifted the ball over timo hildebrand after taking a sweet pass from antonio da silva in the 13th minute . dimo wache 's own goal got stuttgart back into the game early in the second half and then aliaksandr hleb added the second in the 54th minute before surging threough the mainz defence to set up cacau for the third with 66 minutes gone .
christoph teinert caused vfb a scare by pulling one back for mainz in injury-time but the points went to stuttgart who remain on the title pace . wolfsburg challenge hit by battling bvb former league leaders vfl wolfsburg were in need of a lift following a run of results before the break which undermined their previously strong , although surprising , title challenge .
unfortunately , the winners in the day were borussia dortmund who came and conquered with their own challenge in mind : staying up . dortmund eased their relegation fears with a fine victory courtesy of new signing ebi smolarek who scored with a left-foot shot after 55 minutes .
five minutes later , jan koller took a through ball from lars ricken , held off the covering defender and tucked bvb 's second past the keeper .
facundo quiroga pulled one back with eight minutes to go after being set up by martin petrov but the wolves went down and slipped to seven points adrift of bayern at the top . bildunterschrift : dortmund helped their own cause and severely dented wolfsburg 's title hopes with a vital win . kaiserslautern , another team which had flirted with relegation for most of the early part of the season , jumped three places to a comfortable 10th with a comprehensive 3-1 win away at nuremberg .
herve lembi opened the scoring six minutes after the break and stefan blank , signed this week from alemmania aachen , side-footed in for the second on the hour . sven müller 's reply for nuremberg in the 66th minute offered the home side brief hope but dimitris grammozis sealed the win for the visitors with a free kick that squeezed through the wall . relegation congestion easing in the cellar borussia mönchengladbach earned some breathing space in the relegation zone by beating arminia bielefeld 1-0 .
australian international craig moore , signed from scottish club rangers in the transfer window , made a match-winning debut for mönchengladbach with a header in the 52nd minute to give his side a valuable win that lifts them away from the basement .
gladbach are now five points clear of the drop zone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalemate in the relgation battle between freiburg and rostock .
bottom club freiburg were not so lucky .
the basement dwellers will feel aggrieved not to have beaten their fellow relegation candidates hansa rostock after dominating the second half of their crucial contest . soumalia coulibaly hit the bar in the 62nd minute and samuel koejoe had a goal disallowed when he bundled the ball over the line only for referee markus merk to blow for a foul on the keeper .
there was little else to cheer in the 0-0 draw which did either sides no real favors in their battle to escape the drop . berlin slip-up in title pursuit hertha berlin 's resurgent form before the break failed to continue past the new year as the league 's form team missed the chance to go fourth by letting a 2-0 lead slip at bochum on sunday .
nando rafael chipped in the first and then gilberto lashed in the second within the first quarter of an hour , but a peter madsen penalty six minutes before half-time and a deserved equalizer from vratislav lokvenc robbed the capital 's club the chance to maintain their impressive winning streak . rudi völler was left beaming in the other sunday game as bayer leverkusen put on a virtuoso performance in their first match since the former germany coach rejoined the club as sporting director , beating hannover 3-0 away from home . traveling bayer ease to away win bildunterschrift : bayer leverkusen eased to a 3-0 victory over hanover 96 . paul freier set up the opening goal in the 18th minute with a fine cross for andriy voronin to head into the roof of the net and dimitar berbatov made it 2-0 nine minutes before the break with a turn and shot from outside the area .
a deflected freier shot in the 58th minute completed the scoring and spoiled the party for hanover fans who had come to celebrate the official opening of their rebuilt world cup stadium . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga restarts with bayern victory it was business as usual as bayern munich opened the second half of the bundesliga season with a 3-0 win over hamburg sv in the olympic stadium on friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.01.2005 studio 54 nightclub goes german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " mother of all nightclubs " - on its way to berlin relations between germany and the usa may be cold , but they could warm up .
berlin is to become the first city outside of the states to house the legendary disco studio 54 .
michael jackson 's father is the man in charge . studio 54 in west manhattan was in business only two years during the height of disco , but the club is indelibly etched in the minds of the clientele who visited it then .
and well it should be considering the purportedly excessive amount of drugs consumed and sexual fantasies fulfilled there .
now mgm grand , who owns the name and runs an offshoot of studio 54 in their las vegas hotel , wants to go overseas with the name - to berlin .
and joseph jackson , father of pop star michael and a ripe 76-year-old board member of the capital investment company ricercar , was in berlin to find the proper location for what was in the 70s the address for anybody and everybody who wanted to see and be seen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andy warhol was a frequent visitor during the heyday of studio 54 personalities like andy warhol , filmstar liz taylor , designer calvin klein , author truman capote and jackson 's son frequented the new york nightclub , but you did not have to be a superstar to get in .
on his week-long tour to find where studio 54 might best attract international , and more importantly , beautiful people , jackson is not being accompanied by prominent names .
that would be too distracting for papa jackson , who has a vested interest in the venture .
berlin is " right " " the time is right for studio 54 in berlin , " said mike milner , manager of the nightclub in las vegas , to berliner morgenpost daily .
in a company statement , mgm said it wants to run a club where people of " all classes , races and cultures can socialize under one roof . "
and horses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin , london , amsterdam or manhattan - discos are the center of nightlife one of the infamous stories in the multitude of studio 54 memories was when , in 1978 , bianca jagger , wife of rolling stones front man mick , rode onto the dance floor on a white horse .
why she was riding a horse through manhattan was unknown but the event catapulted the club 's reputation to new heights .
in the year 2005 , things are different .
the voyeurs and hedons of the late 1970s lived in the pre-aids era of sex , drugs and rock 'n ' - umh , disco .
jackson and the club 's owners are unlikely to advertise such happenings to attract business , but that reputation may just come with the territory when the new disco opens , expected by year 's end .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph jackson , head of the jackson clan , wants to land a hit in berlin but the stories may unfairly give studio 54 a bad rap .
lilian carter , the late mother of former us president jimmy , was not known for her wild antics in nightclubs .
on her first and only visit to studio 54 she was enthralled .
" i do n't know if i was in heaven or hell ... but it was wonderful ! " was her comment .
that is exactly what the future owners of studio 54 , berlin , would like to hear from every visitor . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is the party over for the love parade ?
the organizers of the love parade , the world 's biggest techno music parade , say the event wo n't happen this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.01.2005 studio 54 nightclub goes german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " mother of all nightclubs " - on its way to berlin relations between germany and the usa may be cold , but they could warm up .
berlin is to become the first city outside of the states to house the legendary disco studio 54 .
michael jackson 's father is the man in charge . studio 54 in west manhattan was in business only two years during the height of disco , but the club is indelibly etched in the minds of the clientele who visited it then .
and well it should be considering the purportedly excessive amount of drugs consumed and sexual fantasies fulfilled there .
now mgm grand , who owns the name and runs an offshoot of studio 54 in their las vegas hotel , wants to go overseas with the name - to berlin .
and joseph jackson , father of pop star michael and a ripe 76-year-old board member of the capital investment company ricercar , was in berlin to find the proper location for what was in the 70s the address for anybody and everybody who wanted to see and be seen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andy warhol was a frequent visitor during the heyday of studio 54 personalities like andy warhol , filmstar liz taylor , designer calvin klein , author truman capote and jackson 's son frequented the new york nightclub , but you did not have to be a superstar to get in .
on his week-long tour to find where studio 54 might best attract international , and more importantly , beautiful people , jackson is not being accompanied by prominent names .
that would be too distracting for papa jackson , who has a vested interest in the venture .
berlin is " right " " the time is right for studio 54 in berlin , " said mike milner , manager of the nightclub in las vegas , to berliner morgenpost daily .
in a company statement , mgm said it wants to run a club where people of " all classes , races and cultures can socialize under one roof . "
and horses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin , london , amsterdam or manhattan - discos are the center of nightlife one of the infamous stories in the multitude of studio 54 memories was when , in 1978 , bianca jagger , wife of rolling stones front man mick , rode onto the dance floor on a white horse .
why she was riding a horse through manhattan was unknown but the event catapulted the club 's reputation to new heights .
in the year 2005 , things are different .
the voyeurs and hedons of the late 1970s lived in the pre-aids era of sex , drugs and rock 'n ' - umh , disco .
jackson and the club 's owners are unlikely to advertise such happenings to attract business , but that reputation may just come with the territory when the new disco opens , expected by year 's end .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph jackson , head of the jackson clan , wants to land a hit in berlin but the stories may unfairly give studio 54 a bad rap .
lilian carter , the late mother of former us president jimmy , was not known for her wild antics in nightclubs .
on her first and only visit to studio 54 she was enthralled .
" i do n't know if i was in heaven or hell ... but it was wonderful ! " was her comment .
that is exactly what the future owners of studio 54 , berlin , would like to hear from every visitor . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is the party over for the love parade ?
the organizers of the love parade , the world 's biggest techno music parade , say the event wo n't happen this year .

dw 's heinz dylong says there 's too little outrage over their behavior . the national democratic party 's -lrb- npd -rrb- behavior in saxony 's state parliament was absolutely unbearable !
first , they withdrew from a minute of silence for the victims of the holocaust , then came a debate in which they equated the world war ii bombing of dresden with the holocaust .
they spoke of a " bombing holocaust , " described the allies as " mass murderers " and the air strikes as a " cold-blooded planned industrial mass murder of the civilian population . " the air campaign on dresden in february 1945 certainly should n't be played down .
the attack on the refugee-filled city that killed more than 35,000 made little sense according to military standards .
that may - indeed , it must - be lamented .
all the same , nothing can be equated to the mass murder and the contempt for humanity that distinguished the holocaust .
it was an unparalleled historical low .
the air campaign on dresden was a superfluous and appalling operation ; but its deeper cause was the war provoked by germany .
and that must without fail be taken into consideration when the victims of the attack on dresden are commemorated . but such considerations are entirely alien to the far-right npd .
given their muddled thoughts , no one should be surprised .
what is alarming is that the npd does n't fear that such statements would hurt them in the eyes of voters .
they received more than 9 percent of the votes in state parliamentary elections in saxony in september . no deterrent and even though that does n't mean the voters were all right-known extremists - a significant number was motivated by the federal government 's social reforms - the frightening findings do show that the npd 's well-known extremist positions did n't deter voters .
the core of the npd 's party platform was n't enough to keep voters in the democratic camp .
while in the 1960s , the npd 's temporary upswing was attributed to their voters coming from old nazi circles , this explanation is impossible today . the secretary general of the central council of jews in germany , stephan kramer , declared that " anti-semitic and xenophobic ideas long ago became socially acceptable again . "
that should n't be viewed simply as an all too pessimistic estimation .
rather , it is a request to the democratic parties and the democratic public .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , 60 years after the liberation of the concentration camps , an offensive confrontation with right-wing extremist attitudes must be sought . and the ban on the npd that failed two years ago due to the applicants ' amateurish procedure - they relied on testimony to the federal constitutional court from witnesses in the service of one of germany 's intelligence services - should be considered again . after all , one need n't repeat the same mistakes , and intellectual discussion of right-wing extremism , which is surely necessary , is thus not out of the question . heinz dylong -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right german party belittles holocaust a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims .

dw 's heinz dylong says there 's too little outrage over their behavior . the national democratic party 's -lrb- npd -rrb- behavior in saxony 's state parliament was absolutely unbearable !
first , they withdrew from a minute of silence for the victims of the holocaust , then came a debate in which they equated the world war ii bombing of dresden with the holocaust .
they spoke of a " bombing holocaust , " described the allies as " mass murderers " and the air strikes as a " cold-blooded planned industrial mass murder of the civilian population . " the air campaign on dresden in february 1945 certainly should n't be played down .
the attack on the refugee-filled city that killed more than 35,000 made little sense according to military standards .
that may - indeed , it must - be lamented .
all the same , nothing can be equated to the mass murder and the contempt for humanity that distinguished the holocaust .
it was an unparalleled historical low .
the air campaign on dresden was a superfluous and appalling operation ; but its deeper cause was the war provoked by germany .
and that must without fail be taken into consideration when the victims of the attack on dresden are commemorated . but such considerations are entirely alien to the far-right npd .
given their muddled thoughts , no one should be surprised .
what is alarming is that the npd does n't fear that such statements would hurt them in the eyes of voters .
they received more than 9 percent of the votes in state parliamentary elections in saxony in september . no deterrent and even though that does n't mean the voters were all right-known extremists - a significant number was motivated by the federal government 's social reforms - the frightening findings do show that the npd 's well-known extremist positions did n't deter voters .
the core of the npd 's party platform was n't enough to keep voters in the democratic camp .
while in the 1960s , the npd 's temporary upswing was attributed to their voters coming from old nazi circles , this explanation is impossible today . the secretary general of the central council of jews in germany , stephan kramer , declared that " anti-semitic and xenophobic ideas long ago became socially acceptable again . "
that should n't be viewed simply as an all too pessimistic estimation .
rather , it is a request to the democratic parties and the democratic public .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , 60 years after the liberation of the concentration camps , an offensive confrontation with right-wing extremist attitudes must be sought . and the ban on the npd that failed two years ago due to the applicants ' amateurish procedure - they relied on testimony to the federal constitutional court from witnesses in the service of one of germany 's intelligence services - should be considered again . after all , one need n't repeat the same mistakes , and intellectual discussion of right-wing extremism , which is surely necessary , is thus not out of the question . heinz dylong -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right german party belittles holocaust a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims .

with the winter break over , the top three teams broke from the chasing pack with victories in their first games of the new year . the bundesliga got underway again after the winter break on friday evening with league leaders bayern munich entertaining mid-table hamburg sv .
the bavarian giants seemed happy to be back and looked as though they had celebrated the festive spell in moderation as bayern romped to an energetic 3-0 win over hsv . felix magath 's side took the lead with a 21st minute claudio pizarro header from mehmet scholl 's free kick and whethered a spirited hsv resurgeance before hitting the visitors hard in a tiring second half .
goals from bastian schweinsteiger and roy makaay completed the win to consolidate munich 's lead at the top of the bundesliga . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pizarro opens the scoring for bayern against hsv . the majority of the chasing pack returned to action on saturday .
second-placed schalke 04 played host to floundering champions werder bremen and were lucky to survive a first half where the royal blues appeared leaden-footed .
schalke improved dramatically after the break , taking the lead through striker gerald asamoah two minutes after the restart . werder equalized when miroslav klose was bundled over in the penalty area and valerien ismael converted the spot-kick .
schalke 's ailton hit the side-netting five minutes later but he made no mistake when the outstanding asamoah found him with a short pass after 67 minutes to give the home side a 2-1 win which kept schalke 's championship aspirations alive . bildunterschrift : schalke sunk werder 's title defense with goals from asamoah and ailton . third-placed stuttgart traveled to mainz for their first game of the year and fell behind early on when fabian gerber lifted the ball over timo hildebrand after taking a sweet pass from antonio da silva in the 13th minute . dimo wache 's own goal got stuttgart back into the game early in the second half and then aliaksandr hleb added the second in the 54th minute before surging threough the mainz defence to set up cacau for the third with 66 minutes gone .
christoph teinert caused vfb a scare by pulling one back for mainz in injury-time but the points went to stuttgart who remain on the title pace . wolfsburg challenge hit by battling bvb former league leaders vfl wolfsburg were in need of a lift following a run of results before the break which undermined their previously strong , although surprising , title challenge .
unfortunately , the winners in the day were borussia dortmund who came and conquered with their own challenge in mind : staying up . dortmund eased their relegation fears with a fine victory courtesy of new signing ebi smolarek who scored with a left-foot shot after 55 minutes .
five minutes later , jan koller took a through ball from lars ricken , held off the covering defender and tucked bvb 's second past the keeper .
facundo quiroga pulled one back with eight minutes to go after being set up by martin petrov but the wolves went down and slipped to seven points adrift of bayern at the top . bildunterschrift : dortmund helped their own cause and severely dented wolfsburg 's title hopes with a vital win . kaiserslautern , another team which had flirted with relegation for most of the early part of the season , jumped three places to a comfortable 10th with a comprehensive 3-1 win away at nuremberg .
herve lembi opened the scoring six minutes after the break and stefan blank , signed this week from alemmania aachen , side-footed in for the second on the hour . sven müller 's reply for nuremberg in the 66th minute offered the home side brief hope but dimitris grammozis sealed the win for the visitors with a free kick that squeezed through the wall . relegation congestion easing in the cellar borussia mönchengladbach earned some breathing space in the relegation zone by beating arminia bielefeld 1-0 .
australian international craig moore , signed from scottish club rangers in the transfer window , made a match-winning debut for mönchengladbach with a header in the 52nd minute to give his side a valuable win that lifts them away from the basement .
gladbach are now five points clear of the drop zone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalemate in the relgation battle between freiburg and rostock .
bottom club freiburg were not so lucky .
the basement dwellers will feel aggrieved not to have beaten their fellow relegation candidates hansa rostock after dominating the second half of their crucial contest . soumalia coulibaly hit the bar in the 62nd minute and samuel koejoe had a goal disallowed when he bundled the ball over the line only for referee markus merk to blow for a foul on the keeper .
there was little else to cheer in the 0-0 draw which did either sides no real favors in their battle to escape the drop . berlin slip-up in title pursuit hertha berlin 's resurgent form before the break failed to continue past the new year as the league 's form team missed the chance to go fourth by letting a 2-0 lead slip at bochum on sunday .
nando rafael chipped in the first and then gilberto lashed in the second within the first quarter of an hour , but a peter madsen penalty six minutes before half-time and a deserved equalizer from vratislav lokvenc robbed the capital 's club the chance to maintain their impressive winning streak . rudi völler was left beaming in the other sunday game as bayer leverkusen put on a virtuoso performance in their first match since the former germany coach rejoined the club as sporting director , beating hannover 3-0 away from home . traveling bayer ease to away win bildunterschrift : bayer leverkusen eased to a 3-0 victory over hanover 96 . paul freier set up the opening goal in the 18th minute with a fine cross for andriy voronin to head into the roof of the net and dimitar berbatov made it 2-0 nine minutes before the break with a turn and shot from outside the area .
a deflected freier shot in the 58th minute completed the scoring and spoiled the party for hanover fans who had come to celebrate the official opening of their rebuilt world cup stadium . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga restarts with bayern victory it was business as usual as bayern munich opened the second half of the bundesliga season with a 3-0 win over hamburg sv in the olympic stadium on friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.01.2005 studio 54 nightclub goes german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " mother of all nightclubs " - on its way to berlin relations between germany and the usa may be cold , but they could warm up .
berlin is to become the first city outside of the states to house the legendary disco studio 54 .
michael jackson 's father is the man in charge . studio 54 in west manhattan was in business only two years during the height of disco , but the club is indelibly etched in the minds of the clientele who visited it then .
and well it should be considering the purportedly excessive amount of drugs consumed and sexual fantasies fulfilled there .
now mgm grand , who owns the name and runs an offshoot of studio 54 in their las vegas hotel , wants to go overseas with the name - to berlin .
and joseph jackson , father of pop star michael and a ripe 76-year-old board member of the capital investment company ricercar , was in berlin to find the proper location for what was in the 70s the address for anybody and everybody who wanted to see and be seen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andy warhol was a frequent visitor during the heyday of studio 54 personalities like andy warhol , filmstar liz taylor , designer calvin klein , author truman capote and jackson 's son frequented the new york nightclub , but you did not have to be a superstar to get in .
on his week-long tour to find where studio 54 might best attract international , and more importantly , beautiful people , jackson is not being accompanied by prominent names .
that would be too distracting for papa jackson , who has a vested interest in the venture .
berlin is " right " " the time is right for studio 54 in berlin , " said mike milner , manager of the nightclub in las vegas , to berliner morgenpost daily .
in a company statement , mgm said it wants to run a club where people of " all classes , races and cultures can socialize under one roof . "
and horses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin , london , amsterdam or manhattan - discos are the center of nightlife one of the infamous stories in the multitude of studio 54 memories was when , in 1978 , bianca jagger , wife of rolling stones front man mick , rode onto the dance floor on a white horse .
why she was riding a horse through manhattan was unknown but the event catapulted the club 's reputation to new heights .
in the year 2005 , things are different .
the voyeurs and hedons of the late 1970s lived in the pre-aids era of sex , drugs and rock 'n ' - umh , disco .
jackson and the club 's owners are unlikely to advertise such happenings to attract business , but that reputation may just come with the territory when the new disco opens , expected by year 's end .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph jackson , head of the jackson clan , wants to land a hit in berlin but the stories may unfairly give studio 54 a bad rap .
lilian carter , the late mother of former us president jimmy , was not known for her wild antics in nightclubs .
on her first and only visit to studio 54 she was enthralled .
" i do n't know if i was in heaven or hell ... but it was wonderful ! " was her comment .
that is exactly what the future owners of studio 54 , berlin , would like to hear from every visitor . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is the party over for the love parade ?
the organizers of the love parade , the world 's biggest techno music parade , say the event wo n't happen this year .

dw 's heinz dylong says there 's too little outrage over their behavior . the national democratic party 's -lrb- npd -rrb- behavior in saxony 's state parliament was absolutely unbearable !
first , they withdrew from a minute of silence for the victims of the holocaust , then came a debate in which they equated the world war ii bombing of dresden with the holocaust .
they spoke of a " bombing holocaust , " described the allies as " mass murderers " and the air strikes as a " cold-blooded planned industrial mass murder of the civilian population . " the air campaign on dresden in february 1945 certainly should n't be played down .
the attack on the refugee-filled city that killed more than 35,000 made little sense according to military standards .
that may - indeed , it must - be lamented .
all the same , nothing can be equated to the mass murder and the contempt for humanity that distinguished the holocaust .
it was an unparalleled historical low .
the air campaign on dresden was a superfluous and appalling operation ; but its deeper cause was the war provoked by germany .
and that must without fail be taken into consideration when the victims of the attack on dresden are commemorated . but such considerations are entirely alien to the far-right npd .
given their muddled thoughts , no one should be surprised .
what is alarming is that the npd does n't fear that such statements would hurt them in the eyes of voters .
they received more than 9 percent of the votes in state parliamentary elections in saxony in september . no deterrent and even though that does n't mean the voters were all right-known extremists - a significant number was motivated by the federal government 's social reforms - the frightening findings do show that the npd 's well-known extremist positions did n't deter voters .
the core of the npd 's party platform was n't enough to keep voters in the democratic camp .
while in the 1960s , the npd 's temporary upswing was attributed to their voters coming from old nazi circles , this explanation is impossible today . the secretary general of the central council of jews in germany , stephan kramer , declared that " anti-semitic and xenophobic ideas long ago became socially acceptable again . "
that should n't be viewed simply as an all too pessimistic estimation .
rather , it is a request to the democratic parties and the democratic public .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , 60 years after the liberation of the concentration camps , an offensive confrontation with right-wing extremist attitudes must be sought . and the ban on the npd that failed two years ago due to the applicants ' amateurish procedure - they relied on testimony to the federal constitutional court from witnesses in the service of one of germany 's intelligence services - should be considered again . after all , one need n't repeat the same mistakes , and intellectual discussion of right-wing extremism , which is surely necessary , is thus not out of the question . heinz dylong -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right german party belittles holocaust a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims .

the berlin-born referee resigned from his post on friday when the probe came to light . the match at the center of the scandal took place on aug .
21 , 2004 , with regional side sc paderborn and bundesliga heavyweights sv hamburg contesting a dfb cup first round match . with the 1983 european cup winners leading the minor league minnows 2-0 , hamburg inexplicably saw their lead disintegrate .
during an allegedly assisted comeback , paderborn were awarded two dubious penalites , both of which were scored , and also benefited when hsv 's belgian striker emile mpenza was sent off for complaining against hozyer 's decisions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer .
the dfb , who will hold an emergency meeting on monday following hozyer 's -lrb- picture -rrb- shock resignation , added that there was also evidence of manipulation of other games involving the the referee . fears of multiple offences " since friday we have had evidence that he rigged games , " dfb joint-president theo zwanziger said on german television station ard .
hoyzer did not referee in the top bundesliga division but had taken charge of 12 second division matches as well as cup and regional league fixtures . " this case has caused great damage to the dfb , " said gerhard mayer-vorfelder , the other of the dfb 's two co-chairmen , ahead of monday 's meeting .
" just from the psychological aspect , incredible damage has been done , for the german federation and for the referees ' organization . "
mayer-vorfelder also called for a general ban on betting for referees . dfb board president horst hilpert told german sports news agency sid on sunday that the investigation into the scandal would be concluded as soon as possible .
" it is always the obligation of the board of control to reach their conclusions swiftly , particularly in so stressful a case . " " we 're going to see if prosecutors need to be involved , " dfb spokesman harald stenger added in a separate statement .
" we 'll also want to talk to bookmakers .
-lrb- the dfb -rrb- will leave no stone unturned in this investigation .
from what we know at this point , this is absolutely a single case .
no other referee , no player , no coach , no club is involved .
i also want to stress that -lrb- hoyzer 's -rrb- denying all allegations . " " i have never bet on a game i have refereed , " hoyzer told the bild newspaper on monday .
" the accusations have left me pensive , uneasy and dismayed .
i can not comprehend them , and also can not understand that my refereeing colleagues could think me capable of such a thing . " aggrieved hsv consider own action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hsv hamburg could seek compensation .
meanwhile , hamburg officials are holding fire on action of their own until the dfb investigation is complete .
" we are waiting to see how the probe develops and will stay in contact with the dfb to see how we should react , " explained hamburg chief bernd hoffmann told zdf television .
" if it is confirmed , we want some sort of compensation .
who knows how our season might have gone ?
we could still be going strong in the cup at this stage . " " great damage has been inflicted on hamburg sv and on german football , " hoffman added .
" we will use all legal means to put right this wrong . "
however , there is little chance that the clubs will get the chance to right the wrongs on the pitch .
the dfb has already ruled out any possibility of replaying the disputed match . another person involved was entertaining similar thoughts as to what would have happened if the outcome of the game had been different .
former hsv coach klaus toppmoller was in charge of hamburg at the time of the match and claimed hoyzer 's corrupt decisions caused his dismissal two months later . toppmöller blames ref for sack " the referee -lrb- hoyzer -rrb- cost me my job as we were doing fine until the paderborn game , " raged toppmoller in the bild am sonntag weekly . " after that it all went downhill.i had the impression that it was a match we could never win .
i knew something was n't right and i even told the referee 's assistant at the time .
but what can you do ?
if you say there is cheating going on , you could face a ban . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmöller feels his future was jeopardized by the refereeing decisions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.01.2005 opinion : banning the far-right npd großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : npd politicians rejected a minute 's silence for holocaust victims politicians in saxony 's state parliament made no bones about their extreme right-wing views by walking out on a commemoration of holocaust victims .
dw 's heinz dylong says there 's too little outrage over their behavior . the national democratic party 's -lrb- npd -rrb- behavior in saxony 's state parliament was absolutely unbearable !
first , they withdrew from a minute of silence for the victims of the holocaust , then came a debate in which they equated the world war ii bombing of dresden with the holocaust .
they spoke of a " bombing holocaust , " described the allies as " mass murderers " and the air strikes as a " cold-blooded planned industrial mass murder of the civilian population . " the air campaign on dresden in february 1945 certainly should n't be played down .
the attack on the refugee-filled city that killed more than 35,000 made little sense according to military standards .
that may - indeed , it must - be lamented .
all the same , nothing can be equated to the mass murder and the contempt for humanity that distinguished the holocaust .
it was an unparalleled historical low .
the air campaign on dresden was a superfluous and appalling operation ; but its deeper cause was the war provoked by germany .
and that must without fail be taken into consideration when the victims of the attack on dresden are commemorated . but such considerations are entirely alien to the far-right npd .
given their muddled thoughts , no one should be surprised .
what is alarming is that the npd does n't fear that such statements would hurt them in the eyes of voters .
they received more than 9 percent of the votes in state parliamentary elections in saxony in september . no deterrent and even though that does n't mean the voters were all right-known extremists - a significant number was motivated by the federal government 's social reforms - the frightening findings do show that the npd 's well-known extremist positions did n't deter voters .
the core of the npd 's party platform was n't enough to keep voters in the democratic camp .
while in the 1960s , the npd 's temporary upswing was attributed to their voters coming from old nazi circles , this explanation is impossible today . the secretary general of the central council of jews in germany , stephan kramer , declared that " anti-semitic and xenophobic ideas long ago became socially acceptable again . "
that should n't be viewed simply as an all too pessimistic estimation .
rather , it is a request to the democratic parties and the democratic public .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , 60 years after the liberation of the concentration camps , an offensive confrontation with right-wing extremist attitudes must be sought . and the ban on the npd that failed two years ago due to the applicants ' amateurish procedure - they relied on testimony to the federal constitutional court from witnesses in the service of one of germany 's intelligence services - should be considered again . after all , one need n't repeat the same mistakes , and intellectual discussion of right-wing extremism , which is surely necessary , is thus not out of the question . heinz dylong -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right german party belittles holocaust a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.01.2005 studio 54 nightclub goes german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " mother of all nightclubs " - on its way to berlin relations between germany and the usa may be cold , but they could warm up .
berlin is to become the first city outside of the states to house the legendary disco studio 54 .
michael jackson 's father is the man in charge . studio 54 in west manhattan was in business only two years during the height of disco , but the club is indelibly etched in the minds of the clientele who visited it then .
and well it should be considering the purportedly excessive amount of drugs consumed and sexual fantasies fulfilled there .
now mgm grand , who owns the name and runs an offshoot of studio 54 in their las vegas hotel , wants to go overseas with the name - to berlin .
and joseph jackson , father of pop star michael and a ripe 76-year-old board member of the capital investment company ricercar , was in berlin to find the proper location for what was in the 70s the address for anybody and everybody who wanted to see and be seen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andy warhol was a frequent visitor during the heyday of studio 54 personalities like andy warhol , filmstar liz taylor , designer calvin klein , author truman capote and jackson 's son frequented the new york nightclub , but you did not have to be a superstar to get in .
on his week-long tour to find where studio 54 might best attract international , and more importantly , beautiful people , jackson is not being accompanied by prominent names .
that would be too distracting for papa jackson , who has a vested interest in the venture .
berlin is " right " " the time is right for studio 54 in berlin , " said mike milner , manager of the nightclub in las vegas , to berliner morgenpost daily .
in a company statement , mgm said it wants to run a club where people of " all classes , races and cultures can socialize under one roof . "
and horses .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin , london , amsterdam or manhattan - discos are the center of nightlife one of the infamous stories in the multitude of studio 54 memories was when , in 1978 , bianca jagger , wife of rolling stones front man mick , rode onto the dance floor on a white horse .
why she was riding a horse through manhattan was unknown but the event catapulted the club 's reputation to new heights .
in the year 2005 , things are different .
the voyeurs and hedons of the late 1970s lived in the pre-aids era of sex , drugs and rock 'n ' - umh , disco .
jackson and the club 's owners are unlikely to advertise such happenings to attract business , but that reputation may just come with the territory when the new disco opens , expected by year 's end .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joseph jackson , head of the jackson clan , wants to land a hit in berlin but the stories may unfairly give studio 54 a bad rap .
lilian carter , the late mother of former us president jimmy , was not known for her wild antics in nightclubs .
on her first and only visit to studio 54 she was enthralled .
" i do n't know if i was in heaven or hell ... but it was wonderful ! " was her comment .
that is exactly what the future owners of studio 54 , berlin , would like to hear from every visitor . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de is the party over for the love parade ?

during the ceremony on sunday , the 50-year-old hero of the orange revolution vowed to defend the sovereignty and independence of his country and to uphold the values of his party , the constitution and the ukrainian people . “ this is a victory for freedom over tyranny , ” yushchenko proclaimed to tens of thousands of his protestors gathered in the main square of kiev . bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko passes by honor guards during a military ceremony in mariinsky palace in kiev , ukraine , sunday , jan .
23 , 2005 . but the pro-western leader will have little time to celebrate what surely is a tremendous victory for democracy in a state that just recently shed the yoke of soviet influence .
starting monday , yushchenko sets out on a tour of europe to prove his sincerity in cooperating closely with the west . opening new doors in brussels , ukraine ’ s future eu minister is already hard at work paving the way for his country ’ s most ambitious goal : entry in the 25-member european union . in an interview with deutsche welle , oleg ribatschuk said he ’ d like to see ukrainian accession as soon as possible , but he conceded that brussels ’ official line only allows for a close partnership in the near future . officially , the eu has said it is not negotiating accession , only a close partnership as part of the bloc ’ s neighborhood policy .
but even after meetings with the eu ’ s foreign policy chief javier solana and eu foreign relations commission benita ferrero-waldner , ribatschuk remains convinced that brussels will open its doors fully to kiev in the next 10 years , even before it lets in turkey . “ the door is not closed , ” he said .
“ what we need to do in ukraine is impress the eu with our rapid tempo in introducing and implementing reforms .
if we develop quickly enough , the eu will have to respond positively – i ’ m absolutely convinced . ” increase reform tempo ukraine ’ s reform efforts have not gone unnoticed in the eu , ribatschuk said . just a week ago , the eu parliament voted in favor of offering kiev a european perspective .
solana and ferrero-waldner have also written a letter to yushchenko outlining an “ eu action plan ” for partnership .
the letter is a first step in the right direction , according to ribatschuk who sees it as proof of brussels ’ interest in strengthening ties with kiev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin backed yushchenko 's opponent in the election , viktor yanokovych in addition to the eu , ukraine is also striving to enter the nato .
there are just two options , said ribatschuk : “ either we align ourselves with the west or with russia . ”
ukraine and viktor yushchenko have clearly decided in favor of europe .
that does not mean kiev aims to alienate itself from russia , nor does russian president vladimir putin have cause for alarm concerning ukraine ’ s new political course . refocusing foreign policy russia is still the new ukrainian president ’ s first official stop on his foreign tour .
in doing so , yushchenko will stress the fact that he does not wish to break away entirely from russia , a country which for years exerted influence on the smaller neighboring country . “ the main reason for the visit with putin is not to sign any contracts or to drink too many glasses of vodka in the name of friendship .
rather , the point is to revive the close ties , ” ribatschuk said . at the moment though , russia is not at the forefront of ukraine ’ s foreign policy .
it is more important that the new ukrainian government focus its efforts on the eu and nato and convince the population of the necessity of such an endeavor , the future eu minister said .

during the ceremony on sunday , the 50-year-old hero of the orange revolution vowed to defend the sovereignty and independence of his country and to uphold the values of his party , the constitution and the ukrainian people . “ this is a victory for freedom over tyranny , ” yushchenko proclaimed to tens of thousands of his protestors gathered in the main square of kiev . bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko passes by honor guards during a military ceremony in mariinsky palace in kiev , ukraine , sunday , jan .
23 , 2005 . but the pro-western leader will have little time to celebrate what surely is a tremendous victory for democracy in a state that just recently shed the yoke of soviet influence .
starting monday , yushchenko sets out on a tour of europe to prove his sincerity in cooperating closely with the west . opening new doors in brussels , ukraine ’ s future eu minister is already hard at work paving the way for his country ’ s most ambitious goal : entry in the 25-member european union . in an interview with deutsche welle , oleg ribatschuk said he ’ d like to see ukrainian accession as soon as possible , but he conceded that brussels ’ official line only allows for a close partnership in the near future . officially , the eu has said it is not negotiating accession , only a close partnership as part of the bloc ’ s neighborhood policy .
but even after meetings with the eu ’ s foreign policy chief javier solana and eu foreign relations commission benita ferrero-waldner , ribatschuk remains convinced that brussels will open its doors fully to kiev in the next 10 years , even before it lets in turkey . “ the door is not closed , ” he said .
“ what we need to do in ukraine is impress the eu with our rapid tempo in introducing and implementing reforms .
if we develop quickly enough , the eu will have to respond positively – i ’ m absolutely convinced . ” increase reform tempo ukraine ’ s reform efforts have not gone unnoticed in the eu , ribatschuk said . just a week ago , the eu parliament voted in favor of offering kiev a european perspective .
solana and ferrero-waldner have also written a letter to yushchenko outlining an “ eu action plan ” for partnership .
the letter is a first step in the right direction , according to ribatschuk who sees it as proof of brussels ’ interest in strengthening ties with kiev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin backed yushchenko 's opponent in the election , viktor yanokovych in addition to the eu , ukraine is also striving to enter the nato .
there are just two options , said ribatschuk : “ either we align ourselves with the west or with russia . ”
ukraine and viktor yushchenko have clearly decided in favor of europe .
that does not mean kiev aims to alienate itself from russia , nor does russian president vladimir putin have cause for alarm concerning ukraine ’ s new political course . refocusing foreign policy russia is still the new ukrainian president ’ s first official stop on his foreign tour .
in doing so , yushchenko will stress the fact that he does not wish to break away entirely from russia , a country which for years exerted influence on the smaller neighboring country . “ the main reason for the visit with putin is not to sign any contracts or to drink too many glasses of vodka in the name of friendship .
rather , the point is to revive the close ties , ” ribatschuk said . at the moment though , russia is not at the forefront of ukraine ’ s foreign policy .
it is more important that the new ukrainian government focus its efforts on the eu and nato and convince the population of the necessity of such an endeavor , the future eu minister said .

survivors and foreign dignitaries , including fischer and israeli foreign minister silvan shalom addressed the united nations general assembly . " we can not look away when synagogues are vandalized or damaged , " said fischer .
" and we ca n't stand by and listen to anti-semitic baiting . " the motion to hold the observance on jan .
27 was backed by nearly 150 of the world body ’ s 191 members .
it was sponsored by the united states , israel , the european union , russia , canada , australia and new zealand . germans and israelis address un bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children at auschwitz just before their liberation in 1945 .
the gathering took place three days before a state ceremony in poland at the site of the infamous auschwitz-birkenau death camp , where more than 1 million people - most of them jews - were killed . coming 30 years after the world body adopted a resolution branding zionism a “ form of racism ” - a move that soured un-israeli relations - the special session represents a significant event . israeli ambassador to the un dan gillerman , a vocal opponent at times of the body 's stance on the israeli-palestinian conflict , said the organization ’ s decision to hold the event could be linked to an evolving world . “ maybe we are at a point in history where the changes in the world are reflecting on the united nations .
we do live in a changing world , in a world which hopefully presents us today with a unique window of opportunity to make peace in our region , ” he said . " maybe that atmosphere has made it possible for 148 countries , including many countries who normally may not have supported such an initiative , to come aboard and we are very gratified that this is happening , ” gillerman said . keeping the memory alive for the future un secretary general kofi annan this week said new generations born after the war must not grow up unaware of the lessons of the holocaust . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners of war at the buchenwald concentration camp near weimar , germany , in april 1945 , just before american troops liberated the camp .

survivors and foreign dignitaries , including fischer and israeli foreign minister silvan shalom addressed the united nations general assembly . " we can not look away when synagogues are vandalized or damaged , " said fischer .
" and we ca n't stand by and listen to anti-semitic baiting . " the motion to hold the observance on jan .

it was sponsored by the united states , israel , the european union , russia , canada , australia and new zealand . germans and israelis address un bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children at auschwitz just before their liberation in 1945 .
the gathering took place three days before a state ceremony in poland at the site of the infamous auschwitz-birkenau death camp , where more than 1 million people - most of them jews - were killed . coming 30 years after the world body adopted a resolution branding zionism a “ form of racism ” - a move that soured un-israeli relations - the special session represents a significant event . israeli ambassador to the un dan gillerman , a vocal opponent at times of the body 's stance on the israeli-palestinian conflict , said the organization ’ s decision to hold the event could be linked to an evolving world . “ maybe we are at a point in history where the changes in the world are reflecting on the united nations .
we do live in a changing world , in a world which hopefully presents us today with a unique window of opportunity to make peace in our region , ” he said . " maybe that atmosphere has made it possible for 148 countries , including many countries who normally may not have supported such an initiative , to come aboard and we are very gratified that this is happening , ” gillerman said . keeping the memory alive for the future un secretary general kofi annan this week said new generations born after the war must not grow up unaware of the lessons of the holocaust . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners of war at the buchenwald concentration camp near weimar , germany , in april 1945 , just before american troops liberated the camp .
“ the founding of this organization was a direct response to the holocaust .
our charter , and the words ‘ untold sorrow , ’ were written as the world was learning the full horror of the death camps , " annan said . the memory of the holocaust ’ s horrors must be kept alive so future generations can learn from its lessons , the secretary general said . “ the evil that destroyed six million jews and others in those camps is one that still threatens all of us today , ” he added .
“ it is not something we can consign to the distant past and forget about it .
every generation must be on its guard , to make sure that such a thing never happens again , ” he said . a commitment to preventing genocide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial for victims of the 1994 genocide in rwanda in nyamata , south of kigali annan said the un special session should be seen as “ an expression of our commitment to build a united nations that can respond quickly and effectively to genocide and other serious violations of human rights . ” the un was criticized for its insufficient response to the rwandan genocide in 1994 in which at least 800,000 people were killed . some 10 years later , the organization hopes it has learned from its mistakes as it prepares to hear from a special commission next week on whether acts of genocide have been committed in sudan ’ s war-torn western darfur region . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre / ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right german party belittles holocaust a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims .

dw 's heinz dylong says there 's too little outrage over their behavior . the national democratic party 's -lrb- npd -rrb- behavior in saxony 's state parliament was absolutely unbearable !
first , they withdrew from a minute of silence for the victims of the holocaust , then came a debate in which they equated the world war ii bombing of dresden with the holocaust .
they spoke of a " bombing holocaust , " described the allies as " mass murderers " and the air strikes as a " cold-blooded planned industrial mass murder of the civilian population . " the air campaign on dresden in february 1945 certainly should n't be played down .
the attack on the refugee-filled city that killed more than 35,000 made little sense according to military standards .
that may - indeed , it must - be lamented .
all the same , nothing can be equated to the mass murder and the contempt for humanity that distinguished the holocaust .
it was an unparalleled historical low .
the air campaign on dresden was a superfluous and appalling operation ; but its deeper cause was the war provoked by germany .
and that must without fail be taken into consideration when the victims of the attack on dresden are commemorated . but such considerations are entirely alien to the far-right npd .
given their muddled thoughts , no one should be surprised .
what is alarming is that the npd does n't fear that such statements would hurt them in the eyes of voters .
they received more than 9 percent of the votes in state parliamentary elections in saxony in september . no deterrent and even though that does n't mean the voters were all right-known extremists - a significant number was motivated by the federal government 's social reforms - the frightening findings do show that the npd 's well-known extremist positions did n't deter voters .
the core of the npd 's party platform was n't enough to keep voters in the democratic camp .
while in the 1960s , the npd 's temporary upswing was attributed to their voters coming from old nazi circles , this explanation is impossible today . the secretary general of the central council of jews in germany , stephan kramer , declared that " anti-semitic and xenophobic ideas long ago became socially acceptable again . "
that should n't be viewed simply as an all too pessimistic estimation .
rather , it is a request to the democratic parties and the democratic public .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , 60 years after the liberation of the concentration camps , an offensive confrontation with right-wing extremist attitudes must be sought . and the ban on the npd that failed two years ago due to the applicants ' amateurish procedure - they relied on testimony to the federal constitutional court from witnesses in the service of one of germany 's intelligence services - should be considered again . after all , one need n't repeat the same mistakes , and intellectual discussion of right-wing extremism , which is surely necessary , is thus not out of the question . heinz dylong -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right german party belittles holocaust a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims .

dw 's heinz dylong says there 's too little outrage over their behavior . the national democratic party 's -lrb- npd -rrb- behavior in saxony 's state parliament was absolutely unbearable !
first , they withdrew from a minute of silence for the victims of the holocaust , then came a debate in which they equated the world war ii bombing of dresden with the holocaust .
they spoke of a " bombing holocaust , " described the allies as " mass murderers " and the air strikes as a " cold-blooded planned industrial mass murder of the civilian population . " the air campaign on dresden in february 1945 certainly should n't be played down .
the attack on the refugee-filled city that killed more than 35,000 made little sense according to military standards .
that may - indeed , it must - be lamented .
all the same , nothing can be equated to the mass murder and the contempt for humanity that distinguished the holocaust .
it was an unparalleled historical low .
the air campaign on dresden was a superfluous and appalling operation ; but its deeper cause was the war provoked by germany .
and that must without fail be taken into consideration when the victims of the attack on dresden are commemorated . but such considerations are entirely alien to the far-right npd .
given their muddled thoughts , no one should be surprised .
what is alarming is that the npd does n't fear that such statements would hurt them in the eyes of voters .
they received more than 9 percent of the votes in state parliamentary elections in saxony in september . no deterrent and even though that does n't mean the voters were all right-known extremists - a significant number was motivated by the federal government 's social reforms - the frightening findings do show that the npd 's well-known extremist positions did n't deter voters .
the core of the npd 's party platform was n't enough to keep voters in the democratic camp .
while in the 1960s , the npd 's temporary upswing was attributed to their voters coming from old nazi circles , this explanation is impossible today . the secretary general of the central council of jews in germany , stephan kramer , declared that " anti-semitic and xenophobic ideas long ago became socially acceptable again . "
that should n't be viewed simply as an all too pessimistic estimation .
rather , it is a request to the democratic parties and the democratic public .
sixty years after the end of world war ii , 60 years after the liberation of the concentration camps , an offensive confrontation with right-wing extremist attitudes must be sought . and the ban on the npd that failed two years ago due to the applicants ' amateurish procedure - they relied on testimony to the federal constitutional court from witnesses in the service of one of germany 's intelligence services - should be considered again . after all , one need n't repeat the same mistakes , and intellectual discussion of right-wing extremism , which is surely necessary , is thus not out of the question . heinz dylong -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right german party belittles holocaust a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims .

during the ceremony on sunday , the 50-year-old hero of the orange revolution vowed to defend the sovereignty and independence of his country and to uphold the values of his party , the constitution and the ukrainian people . “ this is a victory for freedom over tyranny , ” yushchenko proclaimed to tens of thousands of his protestors gathered in the main square of kiev . bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko passes by honor guards during a military ceremony in mariinsky palace in kiev , ukraine , sunday , jan .
23 , 2005 . but the pro-western leader will have little time to celebrate what surely is a tremendous victory for democracy in a state that just recently shed the yoke of soviet influence .
starting monday , yushchenko sets out on a tour of europe to prove his sincerity in cooperating closely with the west . opening new doors in brussels , ukraine ’ s future eu minister is already hard at work paving the way for his country ’ s most ambitious goal : entry in the 25-member european union . in an interview with deutsche welle , oleg ribatschuk said he ’ d like to see ukrainian accession as soon as possible , but he conceded that brussels ’ official line only allows for a close partnership in the near future . officially , the eu has said it is not negotiating accession , only a close partnership as part of the bloc ’ s neighborhood policy .
but even after meetings with the eu ’ s foreign policy chief javier solana and eu foreign relations commission benita ferrero-waldner , ribatschuk remains convinced that brussels will open its doors fully to kiev in the next 10 years , even before it lets in turkey . “ the door is not closed , ” he said .
“ what we need to do in ukraine is impress the eu with our rapid tempo in introducing and implementing reforms .
if we develop quickly enough , the eu will have to respond positively – i ’ m absolutely convinced . ” increase reform tempo ukraine ’ s reform efforts have not gone unnoticed in the eu , ribatschuk said . just a week ago , the eu parliament voted in favor of offering kiev a european perspective .
solana and ferrero-waldner have also written a letter to yushchenko outlining an “ eu action plan ” for partnership .
the letter is a first step in the right direction , according to ribatschuk who sees it as proof of brussels ’ interest in strengthening ties with kiev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin backed yushchenko 's opponent in the election , viktor yanokovych in addition to the eu , ukraine is also striving to enter the nato .
there are just two options , said ribatschuk : “ either we align ourselves with the west or with russia . ”
ukraine and viktor yushchenko have clearly decided in favor of europe .
that does not mean kiev aims to alienate itself from russia , nor does russian president vladimir putin have cause for alarm concerning ukraine ’ s new political course . refocusing foreign policy russia is still the new ukrainian president ’ s first official stop on his foreign tour .
in doing so , yushchenko will stress the fact that he does not wish to break away entirely from russia , a country which for years exerted influence on the smaller neighboring country . “ the main reason for the visit with putin is not to sign any contracts or to drink too many glasses of vodka in the name of friendship .
rather , the point is to revive the close ties , ” ribatschuk said . at the moment though , russia is not at the forefront of ukraine ’ s foreign policy .
it is more important that the new ukrainian government focus its efforts on the eu and nato and convince the population of the necessity of such an endeavor , the future eu minister said .

during the ceremony on sunday , the 50-year-old hero of the orange revolution vowed to defend the sovereignty and independence of his country and to uphold the values of his party , the constitution and the ukrainian people . “ this is a victory for freedom over tyranny , ” yushchenko proclaimed to tens of thousands of his protestors gathered in the main square of kiev . bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko passes by honor guards during a military ceremony in mariinsky palace in kiev , ukraine , sunday , jan .
23 , 2005 . but the pro-western leader will have little time to celebrate what surely is a tremendous victory for democracy in a state that just recently shed the yoke of soviet influence .
starting monday , yushchenko sets out on a tour of europe to prove his sincerity in cooperating closely with the west . opening new doors in brussels , ukraine ’ s future eu minister is already hard at work paving the way for his country ’ s most ambitious goal : entry in the 25-member european union . in an interview with deutsche welle , oleg ribatschuk said he ’ d like to see ukrainian accession as soon as possible , but he conceded that brussels ’ official line only allows for a close partnership in the near future . officially , the eu has said it is not negotiating accession , only a close partnership as part of the bloc ’ s neighborhood policy .
but even after meetings with the eu ’ s foreign policy chief javier solana and eu foreign relations commission benita ferrero-waldner , ribatschuk remains convinced that brussels will open its doors fully to kiev in the next 10 years , even before it lets in turkey . “ the door is not closed , ” he said .
“ what we need to do in ukraine is impress the eu with our rapid tempo in introducing and implementing reforms .
if we develop quickly enough , the eu will have to respond positively – i ’ m absolutely convinced . ” increase reform tempo ukraine ’ s reform efforts have not gone unnoticed in the eu , ribatschuk said . just a week ago , the eu parliament voted in favor of offering kiev a european perspective .
solana and ferrero-waldner have also written a letter to yushchenko outlining an “ eu action plan ” for partnership .
the letter is a first step in the right direction , according to ribatschuk who sees it as proof of brussels ’ interest in strengthening ties with kiev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin backed yushchenko 's opponent in the election , viktor yanokovych in addition to the eu , ukraine is also striving to enter the nato .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : a stain on the soul of german soccer key man in match rigging scandal released soccer chiefs debate betting post-hoyzer referee scandal rears its ugly head former dortmund player admits to bribe current affairs -pipe- 24.01.2005 referee scandal threatens germany 's world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pointing the finger : hoyzer -lrb- right -rrb- is accused of widespread match-fixing instead of a fanfare heralding the first opportunity for the public to book their places at the world cup in germany in 2006 , alarm bells are ringing over a match-rigging scandal that threatens to sully the event . just over a day before the world 's attention was to turn to germany for the official release of world cup 2006 tickets , the latest in the host country 's moments in the sporting sun was eclipsed by a largely unknown second division german referee called robert hoyzer . the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- confirmed on saturday afternoon that they had begun investigating hozyer , 25 , for fixing a cup match that he had apparently bet on .
the berlin-born referee resigned from his post on friday when the probe came to light . the match at the center of the scandal took place on aug .
21 , 2004 , with regional side sc paderborn and bundesliga heavyweights sv hamburg contesting a dfb cup first round match . with the 1983 european cup winners leading the minor league minnows 2-0 , hamburg inexplicably saw their lead disintegrate .
during an allegedly assisted comeback , paderborn were awarded two dubious penalites , both of which were scored , and also benefited when hsv 's belgian striker emile mpenza was sent off for complaining against hozyer 's decisions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer .
the dfb , who will hold an emergency meeting on monday following hozyer 's -lrb- picture -rrb- shock resignation , added that there was also evidence of manipulation of other games involving the the referee . fears of multiple offences " since friday we have had evidence that he rigged games , " dfb joint-president theo zwanziger said on german television station ard .
hoyzer did not referee in the top bundesliga division but had taken charge of 12 second division matches as well as cup and regional league fixtures . " this case has caused great damage to the dfb , " said gerhard mayer-vorfelder , the other of the dfb 's two co-chairmen , ahead of monday 's meeting .
" just from the psychological aspect , incredible damage has been done , for the german federation and for the referees ' organization . "
mayer-vorfelder also called for a general ban on betting for referees . dfb board president horst hilpert told german sports news agency sid on sunday that the investigation into the scandal would be concluded as soon as possible .
" it is always the obligation of the board of control to reach their conclusions swiftly , particularly in so stressful a case . " " we 're going to see if prosecutors need to be involved , " dfb spokesman harald stenger added in a separate statement .
" we 'll also want to talk to bookmakers .
-lrb- the dfb -rrb- will leave no stone unturned in this investigation .
from what we know at this point , this is absolutely a single case .
no other referee , no player , no coach , no club is involved .
i also want to stress that -lrb- hoyzer 's -rrb- denying all allegations . " " i have never bet on a game i have refereed , " hoyzer told the bild newspaper on monday .
" the accusations have left me pensive , uneasy and dismayed .
i can not comprehend them , and also can not understand that my refereeing colleagues could think me capable of such a thing . " aggrieved hsv consider own action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hsv hamburg could seek compensation .
meanwhile , hamburg officials are holding fire on action of their own until the dfb investigation is complete .
" we are waiting to see how the probe develops and will stay in contact with the dfb to see how we should react , " explained hamburg chief bernd hoffmann told zdf television .
" if it is confirmed , we want some sort of compensation .
who knows how our season might have gone ?
we could still be going strong in the cup at this stage . " " great damage has been inflicted on hamburg sv and on german football , " hoffman added .
" we will use all legal means to put right this wrong . "
however , there is little chance that the clubs will get the chance to right the wrongs on the pitch .
the dfb has already ruled out any possibility of replaying the disputed match . another person involved was entertaining similar thoughts as to what would have happened if the outcome of the game had been different .
former hsv coach klaus toppmoller was in charge of hamburg at the time of the match and claimed hoyzer 's corrupt decisions caused his dismissal two months later . toppmöller blames ref for sack " the referee -lrb- hoyzer -rrb- cost me my job as we were doing fine until the paderborn game , " raged toppmoller in the bild am sonntag weekly . " after that it all went downhill.i had the impression that it was a match we could never win .
i knew something was n't right and i even told the referee 's assistant at the time .
but what can you do ?
if you say there is cheating going on , you could face a ban . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmöller feels his future was jeopardized by the refereeing decisions .
referees now face increased scrutiny into their actions for the remainder of the season .
the hoyzer revelations are likely to increase suspicion when questionable decisions are made .
" from now on all referee decisions will be questioned , " admitted oliver bierhoff , assistant coach of the german national team , in a statement to reporters .
" but i am sure this is just a one-off case . " ghosts of 1971 scandal stirring the dfb will surely hope so .
while it is doing its upmost to prevent the hozyer affair from enveloping german football ahead of the 2006 world cup on home soil , the dfb will be sorely reminded of a previous incident which blew up into the biggest scandal in german football . match-fixing and bribes engulfed the bundesliga in 1971 when more than 50 players , a number of coaches and officials plus the clubs arminia bielefeld and kickers offenbach were found guilty of offering bribes and fixing bundesliga games , prompting the dfb to dish out hefty fines and suspensions . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga restarts with bayern victory it was business as usual as bayern munich opened the second half of the bundesliga season with a 3-0 win over hamburg sv in the olympic stadium on friday .

" we must not tolerate this treacherous relativization and minimization of the holocaust , " said spokesman hans-herman langguth . he said that chancellor gerhard schröder had " learned with repugnance " of the protest .
langguth said any new attempt to ban the npd would have to be examined very carefully .
however on monday , federal prosecutors said there was no basis to open any proceedings against the npd . in march 2003 , germany 's highest court threw out a government and parliament request to ban the neo-nazi party for inciting racist violence , after a two-year legal wrangle .
the constitutional court 's decision came after it heard that some npd members who gave evidence were police informers . dw-world.de far-right german party belittles holocaust a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : a stain on the soul of german soccer key man in match rigging scandal released soccer chiefs debate betting post-hoyzer referee scandal rears its ugly head former dortmund player admits to bribe current affairs -pipe- 24.01.2005 referee scandal threatens germany 's world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pointing the finger : hoyzer -lrb- right -rrb- is accused of widespread match-fixing instead of a fanfare heralding the first opportunity for the public to book their places at the world cup in germany in 2006 , alarm bells are ringing over a match-rigging scandal that threatens to sully the event . just over a day before the world 's attention was to turn to germany for the official release of world cup 2006 tickets , the latest in the host country 's moments in the sporting sun was eclipsed by a largely unknown second division german referee called robert hoyzer . the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- confirmed on saturday afternoon that they had begun investigating hozyer , 25 , for fixing a cup match that he had apparently bet on .
the berlin-born referee resigned from his post on friday when the probe came to light . the match at the center of the scandal took place on aug .
21 , 2004 , with regional side sc paderborn and bundesliga heavyweights sv hamburg contesting a dfb cup first round match . with the 1983 european cup winners leading the minor league minnows 2-0 , hamburg inexplicably saw their lead disintegrate .
during an allegedly assisted comeback , paderborn were awarded two dubious penalites , both of which were scored , and also benefited when hsv 's belgian striker emile mpenza was sent off for complaining against hozyer 's decisions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer .
the dfb , who will hold an emergency meeting on monday following hozyer 's -lrb- picture -rrb- shock resignation , added that there was also evidence of manipulation of other games involving the the referee . fears of multiple offences " since friday we have had evidence that he rigged games , " dfb joint-president theo zwanziger said on german television station ard .
hoyzer did not referee in the top bundesliga division but had taken charge of 12 second division matches as well as cup and regional league fixtures . " this case has caused great damage to the dfb , " said gerhard mayer-vorfelder , the other of the dfb 's two co-chairmen , ahead of monday 's meeting .
" just from the psychological aspect , incredible damage has been done , for the german federation and for the referees ' organization . "
mayer-vorfelder also called for a general ban on betting for referees . dfb board president horst hilpert told german sports news agency sid on sunday that the investigation into the scandal would be concluded as soon as possible .
" it is always the obligation of the board of control to reach their conclusions swiftly , particularly in so stressful a case . " " we 're going to see if prosecutors need to be involved , " dfb spokesman harald stenger added in a separate statement .
" we 'll also want to talk to bookmakers .
-lrb- the dfb -rrb- will leave no stone unturned in this investigation .
from what we know at this point , this is absolutely a single case .
no other referee , no player , no coach , no club is involved .
i also want to stress that -lrb- hoyzer 's -rrb- denying all allegations . " " i have never bet on a game i have refereed , " hoyzer told the bild newspaper on monday .
" the accusations have left me pensive , uneasy and dismayed .
i can not comprehend them , and also can not understand that my refereeing colleagues could think me capable of such a thing . " aggrieved hsv consider own action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hsv hamburg could seek compensation .
meanwhile , hamburg officials are holding fire on action of their own until the dfb investigation is complete .
" we are waiting to see how the probe develops and will stay in contact with the dfb to see how we should react , " explained hamburg chief bernd hoffmann told zdf television .
" if it is confirmed , we want some sort of compensation .
who knows how our season might have gone ?
we could still be going strong in the cup at this stage . " " great damage has been inflicted on hamburg sv and on german football , " hoffman added .
" we will use all legal means to put right this wrong . "
however , there is little chance that the clubs will get the chance to right the wrongs on the pitch .
the dfb has already ruled out any possibility of replaying the disputed match . another person involved was entertaining similar thoughts as to what would have happened if the outcome of the game had been different .
former hsv coach klaus toppmoller was in charge of hamburg at the time of the match and claimed hoyzer 's corrupt decisions caused his dismissal two months later . toppmöller blames ref for sack " the referee -lrb- hoyzer -rrb- cost me my job as we were doing fine until the paderborn game , " raged toppmoller in the bild am sonntag weekly . " after that it all went downhill.i had the impression that it was a match we could never win .
i knew something was n't right and i even told the referee 's assistant at the time .
but what can you do ?
if you say there is cheating going on , you could face a ban . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmöller feels his future was jeopardized by the refereeing decisions .
referees now face increased scrutiny into their actions for the remainder of the season .
the hoyzer revelations are likely to increase suspicion when questionable decisions are made .
" from now on all referee decisions will be questioned , " admitted oliver bierhoff , assistant coach of the german national team , in a statement to reporters .
" but i am sure this is just a one-off case . " ghosts of 1971 scandal stirring the dfb will surely hope so .
while it is doing its upmost to prevent the hozyer affair from enveloping german football ahead of the 2006 world cup on home soil , the dfb will be sorely reminded of a previous incident which blew up into the biggest scandal in german football . match-fixing and bribes engulfed the bundesliga in 1971 when more than 50 players , a number of coaches and officials plus the clubs arminia bielefeld and kickers offenbach were found guilty of offering bribes and fixing bundesliga games , prompting the dfb to dish out hefty fines and suspensions . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga restarts with bayern victory it was business as usual as bayern munich opened the second half of the bundesliga season with a 3-0 win over hamburg sv in the olympic stadium on friday .

during the ceremony on sunday , the 50-year-old hero of the orange revolution vowed to defend the sovereignty and independence of his country and to uphold the values of his party , the constitution and the ukrainian people . “ this is a victory for freedom over tyranny , ” yushchenko proclaimed to tens of thousands of his protestors gathered in the main square of kiev . bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko passes by honor guards during a military ceremony in mariinsky palace in kiev , ukraine , sunday , jan .
23 , 2005 . but the pro-western leader will have little time to celebrate what surely is a tremendous victory for democracy in a state that just recently shed the yoke of soviet influence .
starting monday , yushchenko sets out on a tour of europe to prove his sincerity in cooperating closely with the west . opening new doors in brussels , ukraine ’ s future eu minister is already hard at work paving the way for his country ’ s most ambitious goal : entry in the 25-member european union . in an interview with deutsche welle , oleg ribatschuk said he ’ d like to see ukrainian accession as soon as possible , but he conceded that brussels ’ official line only allows for a close partnership in the near future . officially , the eu has said it is not negotiating accession , only a close partnership as part of the bloc ’ s neighborhood policy .
but even after meetings with the eu ’ s foreign policy chief javier solana and eu foreign relations commission benita ferrero-waldner , ribatschuk remains convinced that brussels will open its doors fully to kiev in the next 10 years , even before it lets in turkey . “ the door is not closed , ” he said .
“ what we need to do in ukraine is impress the eu with our rapid tempo in introducing and implementing reforms .
if we develop quickly enough , the eu will have to respond positively – i ’ m absolutely convinced . ” increase reform tempo ukraine ’ s reform efforts have not gone unnoticed in the eu , ribatschuk said . just a week ago , the eu parliament voted in favor of offering kiev a european perspective .
solana and ferrero-waldner have also written a letter to yushchenko outlining an “ eu action plan ” for partnership .
the letter is a first step in the right direction , according to ribatschuk who sees it as proof of brussels ’ interest in strengthening ties with kiev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin backed yushchenko 's opponent in the election , viktor yanokovych in addition to the eu , ukraine is also striving to enter the nato .

the berlin-born referee resigned from his post on friday when the probe came to light . the match at the center of the scandal took place on aug .
21 , 2004 , with regional side sc paderborn and bundesliga heavyweights sv hamburg contesting a dfb cup first round match . with the 1983 european cup winners leading the minor league minnows 2-0 , hamburg inexplicably saw their lead disintegrate .
during an allegedly assisted comeback , paderborn were awarded two dubious penalites , both of which were scored , and also benefited when hsv 's belgian striker emile mpenza was sent off for complaining against hozyer 's decisions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer .
the dfb , who will hold an emergency meeting on monday following hozyer 's -lrb- picture -rrb- shock resignation , added that there was also evidence of manipulation of other games involving the the referee . fears of multiple offences " since friday we have had evidence that he rigged games , " dfb joint-president theo zwanziger said on german television station ard .
hoyzer did not referee in the top bundesliga division but had taken charge of 12 second division matches as well as cup and regional league fixtures . " this case has caused great damage to the dfb , " said gerhard mayer-vorfelder , the other of the dfb 's two co-chairmen , ahead of monday 's meeting .
" just from the psychological aspect , incredible damage has been done , for the german federation and for the referees ' organization . "
mayer-vorfelder also called for a general ban on betting for referees . dfb board president horst hilpert told german sports news agency sid on sunday that the investigation into the scandal would be concluded as soon as possible .
" it is always the obligation of the board of control to reach their conclusions swiftly , particularly in so stressful a case . " " we 're going to see if prosecutors need to be involved , " dfb spokesman harald stenger added in a separate statement .
" we 'll also want to talk to bookmakers .
-lrb- the dfb -rrb- will leave no stone unturned in this investigation .
from what we know at this point , this is absolutely a single case .
no other referee , no player , no coach , no club is involved .
i also want to stress that -lrb- hoyzer 's -rrb- denying all allegations . " " i have never bet on a game i have refereed , " hoyzer told the bild newspaper on monday .
" the accusations have left me pensive , uneasy and dismayed .
i can not comprehend them , and also can not understand that my refereeing colleagues could think me capable of such a thing . " aggrieved hsv consider own action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hsv hamburg could seek compensation .
meanwhile , hamburg officials are holding fire on action of their own until the dfb investigation is complete .
" we are waiting to see how the probe develops and will stay in contact with the dfb to see how we should react , " explained hamburg chief bernd hoffmann told zdf television .
" if it is confirmed , we want some sort of compensation .
who knows how our season might have gone ?
we could still be going strong in the cup at this stage . " " great damage has been inflicted on hamburg sv and on german football , " hoffman added .
" we will use all legal means to put right this wrong . "
however , there is little chance that the clubs will get the chance to right the wrongs on the pitch .
the dfb has already ruled out any possibility of replaying the disputed match . another person involved was entertaining similar thoughts as to what would have happened if the outcome of the game had been different .
former hsv coach klaus toppmoller was in charge of hamburg at the time of the match and claimed hoyzer 's corrupt decisions caused his dismissal two months later . toppmöller blames ref for sack " the referee -lrb- hoyzer -rrb- cost me my job as we were doing fine until the paderborn game , " raged toppmoller in the bild am sonntag weekly . " after that it all went downhill.i had the impression that it was a match we could never win .
i knew something was n't right and i even told the referee 's assistant at the time .
but what can you do ?
if you say there is cheating going on , you could face a ban . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmöller feels his future was jeopardized by the refereeing decisions .
referees now face increased scrutiny into their actions for the remainder of the season .
the hoyzer revelations are likely to increase suspicion when questionable decisions are made .
" from now on all referee decisions will be questioned , " admitted oliver bierhoff , assistant coach of the german national team , in a statement to reporters .
" but i am sure this is just a one-off case . " ghosts of 1971 scandal stirring the dfb will surely hope so .
while it is doing its upmost to prevent the hozyer affair from enveloping german football ahead of the 2006 world cup on home soil , the dfb will be sorely reminded of a previous incident which blew up into the biggest scandal in german football . match-fixing and bribes engulfed the bundesliga in 1971 when more than 50 players , a number of coaches and officials plus the clubs arminia bielefeld and kickers offenbach were found guilty of offering bribes and fixing bundesliga games , prompting the dfb to dish out hefty fines and suspensions . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga restarts with bayern victory it was business as usual as bayern munich opened the second half of the bundesliga season with a 3-0 win over hamburg sv in the olympic stadium on friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : a stain on the soul of german soccer key man in match rigging scandal released soccer chiefs debate betting post-hoyzer referee scandal rears its ugly head former dortmund player admits to bribe current affairs -pipe- 24.01.2005 referee scandal threatens germany 's world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pointing the finger : hoyzer -lrb- right -rrb- is accused of widespread match-fixing instead of a fanfare heralding the first opportunity for the public to book their places at the world cup in germany in 2006 , alarm bells are ringing over a match-rigging scandal that threatens to sully the event . just over a day before the world 's attention was to turn to germany for the official release of world cup 2006 tickets , the latest in the host country 's moments in the sporting sun was eclipsed by a largely unknown second division german referee called robert hoyzer . the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- confirmed on saturday afternoon that they had begun investigating hozyer , 25 , for fixing a cup match that he had apparently bet on .
the berlin-born referee resigned from his post on friday when the probe came to light . the match at the center of the scandal took place on aug .
21 , 2004 , with regional side sc paderborn and bundesliga heavyweights sv hamburg contesting a dfb cup first round match . with the 1983 european cup winners leading the minor league minnows 2-0 , hamburg inexplicably saw their lead disintegrate .
during an allegedly assisted comeback , paderborn were awarded two dubious penalites , both of which were scored , and also benefited when hsv 's belgian striker emile mpenza was sent off for complaining against hozyer 's decisions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer .
the dfb , who will hold an emergency meeting on monday following hozyer 's -lrb- picture -rrb- shock resignation , added that there was also evidence of manipulation of other games involving the the referee . fears of multiple offences " since friday we have had evidence that he rigged games , " dfb joint-president theo zwanziger said on german television station ard .
hoyzer did not referee in the top bundesliga division but had taken charge of 12 second division matches as well as cup and regional league fixtures . " this case has caused great damage to the dfb , " said gerhard mayer-vorfelder , the other of the dfb 's two co-chairmen , ahead of monday 's meeting .
" just from the psychological aspect , incredible damage has been done , for the german federation and for the referees ' organization . "
mayer-vorfelder also called for a general ban on betting for referees . dfb board president horst hilpert told german sports news agency sid on sunday that the investigation into the scandal would be concluded as soon as possible .
" it is always the obligation of the board of control to reach their conclusions swiftly , particularly in so stressful a case . " " we 're going to see if prosecutors need to be involved , " dfb spokesman harald stenger added in a separate statement .
" we 'll also want to talk to bookmakers .
-lrb- the dfb -rrb- will leave no stone unturned in this investigation .
from what we know at this point , this is absolutely a single case .
no other referee , no player , no coach , no club is involved .
i also want to stress that -lrb- hoyzer 's -rrb- denying all allegations . " " i have never bet on a game i have refereed , " hoyzer told the bild newspaper on monday .
" the accusations have left me pensive , uneasy and dismayed .
i can not comprehend them , and also can not understand that my refereeing colleagues could think me capable of such a thing . " aggrieved hsv consider own action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hsv hamburg could seek compensation .
meanwhile , hamburg officials are holding fire on action of their own until the dfb investigation is complete .
" we are waiting to see how the probe develops and will stay in contact with the dfb to see how we should react , " explained hamburg chief bernd hoffmann told zdf television .
" if it is confirmed , we want some sort of compensation .
who knows how our season might have gone ?
we could still be going strong in the cup at this stage . " " great damage has been inflicted on hamburg sv and on german football , " hoffman added .
" we will use all legal means to put right this wrong . "
however , there is little chance that the clubs will get the chance to right the wrongs on the pitch .
the dfb has already ruled out any possibility of replaying the disputed match . another person involved was entertaining similar thoughts as to what would have happened if the outcome of the game had been different .
former hsv coach klaus toppmoller was in charge of hamburg at the time of the match and claimed hoyzer 's corrupt decisions caused his dismissal two months later . toppmöller blames ref for sack " the referee -lrb- hoyzer -rrb- cost me my job as we were doing fine until the paderborn game , " raged toppmoller in the bild am sonntag weekly . " after that it all went downhill.i had the impression that it was a match we could never win .
i knew something was n't right and i even told the referee 's assistant at the time .
but what can you do ?
if you say there is cheating going on , you could face a ban . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmöller feels his future was jeopardized by the refereeing decisions .
referees now face increased scrutiny into their actions for the remainder of the season .
the hoyzer revelations are likely to increase suspicion when questionable decisions are made .
" from now on all referee decisions will be questioned , " admitted oliver bierhoff , assistant coach of the german national team , in a statement to reporters .
" but i am sure this is just a one-off case . " ghosts of 1971 scandal stirring the dfb will surely hope so .
while it is doing its upmost to prevent the hozyer affair from enveloping german football ahead of the 2006 world cup on home soil , the dfb will be sorely reminded of a previous incident which blew up into the biggest scandal in german football . match-fixing and bribes engulfed the bundesliga in 1971 when more than 50 players , a number of coaches and officials plus the clubs arminia bielefeld and kickers offenbach were found guilty of offering bribes and fixing bundesliga games , prompting the dfb to dish out hefty fines and suspensions . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga restarts with bayern victory it was business as usual as bayern munich opened the second half of the bundesliga season with a 3-0 win over hamburg sv in the olympic stadium on friday .

" we must not tolerate this treacherous relativization and minimization of the holocaust , " said spokesman hans-herman langguth . he said that chancellor gerhard schröder had " learned with repugnance " of the protest .
langguth said any new attempt to ban the npd would have to be examined very carefully .
however on monday , federal prosecutors said there was no basis to open any proceedings against the npd . in march 2003 , germany 's highest court threw out a government and parliament request to ban the neo-nazi party for inciting racist violence , after a two-year legal wrangle .
the constitutional court 's decision came after it heard that some npd members who gave evidence were police informers . dw-world.de far-right german party belittles holocaust a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims .

during the ceremony on sunday , the 50-year-old hero of the orange revolution vowed to defend the sovereignty and independence of his country and to uphold the values of his party , the constitution and the ukrainian people . “ this is a victory for freedom over tyranny , ” yushchenko proclaimed to tens of thousands of his protestors gathered in the main square of kiev . bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko passes by honor guards during a military ceremony in mariinsky palace in kiev , ukraine , sunday , jan .
23 , 2005 . but the pro-western leader will have little time to celebrate what surely is a tremendous victory for democracy in a state that just recently shed the yoke of soviet influence .
starting monday , yushchenko sets out on a tour of europe to prove his sincerity in cooperating closely with the west . opening new doors in brussels , ukraine ’ s future eu minister is already hard at work paving the way for his country ’ s most ambitious goal : entry in the 25-member european union . in an interview with deutsche welle , oleg ribatschuk said he ’ d like to see ukrainian accession as soon as possible , but he conceded that brussels ’ official line only allows for a close partnership in the near future . officially , the eu has said it is not negotiating accession , only a close partnership as part of the bloc ’ s neighborhood policy .
but even after meetings with the eu ’ s foreign policy chief javier solana and eu foreign relations commission benita ferrero-waldner , ribatschuk remains convinced that brussels will open its doors fully to kiev in the next 10 years , even before it lets in turkey . “ the door is not closed , ” he said .
“ what we need to do in ukraine is impress the eu with our rapid tempo in introducing and implementing reforms .
if we develop quickly enough , the eu will have to respond positively – i ’ m absolutely convinced . ” increase reform tempo ukraine ’ s reform efforts have not gone unnoticed in the eu , ribatschuk said . just a week ago , the eu parliament voted in favor of offering kiev a european perspective .
solana and ferrero-waldner have also written a letter to yushchenko outlining an “ eu action plan ” for partnership .
the letter is a first step in the right direction , according to ribatschuk who sees it as proof of brussels ’ interest in strengthening ties with kiev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin backed yushchenko 's opponent in the election , viktor yanokovych in addition to the eu , ukraine is also striving to enter the nato .
there are just two options , said ribatschuk : “ either we align ourselves with the west or with russia . ”
ukraine and viktor yushchenko have clearly decided in favor of europe .
that does not mean kiev aims to alienate itself from russia , nor does russian president vladimir putin have cause for alarm concerning ukraine ’ s new political course . refocusing foreign policy russia is still the new ukrainian president ’ s first official stop on his foreign tour .
in doing so , yushchenko will stress the fact that he does not wish to break away entirely from russia , a country which for years exerted influence on the smaller neighboring country . “ the main reason for the visit with putin is not to sign any contracts or to drink too many glasses of vodka in the name of friendship .
rather , the point is to revive the close ties , ” ribatschuk said . at the moment though , russia is not at the forefront of ukraine ’ s foreign policy .
it is more important that the new ukrainian government focus its efforts on the eu and nato and convince the population of the necessity of such an endeavor , the future eu minister said .

during the ceremony on sunday , the 50-year-old hero of the orange revolution vowed to defend the sovereignty and independence of his country and to uphold the values of his party , the constitution and the ukrainian people . “ this is a victory for freedom over tyranny , ” yushchenko proclaimed to tens of thousands of his protestors gathered in the main square of kiev . bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko passes by honor guards during a military ceremony in mariinsky palace in kiev , ukraine , sunday , jan .
23 , 2005 . but the pro-western leader will have little time to celebrate what surely is a tremendous victory for democracy in a state that just recently shed the yoke of soviet influence .
starting monday , yushchenko sets out on a tour of europe to prove his sincerity in cooperating closely with the west . opening new doors in brussels , ukraine ’ s future eu minister is already hard at work paving the way for his country ’ s most ambitious goal : entry in the 25-member european union . in an interview with deutsche welle , oleg ribatschuk said he ’ d like to see ukrainian accession as soon as possible , but he conceded that brussels ’ official line only allows for a close partnership in the near future . officially , the eu has said it is not negotiating accession , only a close partnership as part of the bloc ’ s neighborhood policy .
but even after meetings with the eu ’ s foreign policy chief javier solana and eu foreign relations commission benita ferrero-waldner , ribatschuk remains convinced that brussels will open its doors fully to kiev in the next 10 years , even before it lets in turkey . “ the door is not closed , ” he said .
“ what we need to do in ukraine is impress the eu with our rapid tempo in introducing and implementing reforms .
if we develop quickly enough , the eu will have to respond positively – i ’ m absolutely convinced . ” increase reform tempo ukraine ’ s reform efforts have not gone unnoticed in the eu , ribatschuk said . just a week ago , the eu parliament voted in favor of offering kiev a european perspective .
solana and ferrero-waldner have also written a letter to yushchenko outlining an “ eu action plan ” for partnership .
the letter is a first step in the right direction , according to ribatschuk who sees it as proof of brussels ’ interest in strengthening ties with kiev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin backed yushchenko 's opponent in the election , viktor yanokovych in addition to the eu , ukraine is also striving to enter the nato .
there are just two options , said ribatschuk : “ either we align ourselves with the west or with russia . ”
ukraine and viktor yushchenko have clearly decided in favor of europe .
that does not mean kiev aims to alienate itself from russia , nor does russian president vladimir putin have cause for alarm concerning ukraine ’ s new political course . refocusing foreign policy russia is still the new ukrainian president ’ s first official stop on his foreign tour .
in doing so , yushchenko will stress the fact that he does not wish to break away entirely from russia , a country which for years exerted influence on the smaller neighboring country . “ the main reason for the visit with putin is not to sign any contracts or to drink too many glasses of vodka in the name of friendship .
rather , the point is to revive the close ties , ” ribatschuk said . at the moment though , russia is not at the forefront of ukraine ’ s foreign policy .
it is more important that the new ukrainian government focus its efforts on the eu and nato and convince the population of the necessity of such an endeavor , the future eu minister said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : a stain on the soul of german soccer key man in match rigging scandal released soccer chiefs debate betting post-hoyzer referee scandal rears its ugly head former dortmund player admits to bribe current affairs -pipe- 24.01.2005 referee scandal threatens germany 's world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pointing the finger : hoyzer -lrb- right -rrb- is accused of widespread match-fixing instead of a fanfare heralding the first opportunity for the public to book their places at the world cup in germany in 2006 , alarm bells are ringing over a match-rigging scandal that threatens to sully the event . just over a day before the world 's attention was to turn to germany for the official release of world cup 2006 tickets , the latest in the host country 's moments in the sporting sun was eclipsed by a largely unknown second division german referee called robert hoyzer . the german football federation -lrb- dfb -rrb- confirmed on saturday afternoon that they had begun investigating hozyer , 25 , for fixing a cup match that he had apparently bet on .
the berlin-born referee resigned from his post on friday when the probe came to light . the match at the center of the scandal took place on aug .
21 , 2004 , with regional side sc paderborn and bundesliga heavyweights sv hamburg contesting a dfb cup first round match . with the 1983 european cup winners leading the minor league minnows 2-0 , hamburg inexplicably saw their lead disintegrate .
during an allegedly assisted comeback , paderborn were awarded two dubious penalites , both of which were scored , and also benefited when hsv 's belgian striker emile mpenza was sent off for complaining against hozyer 's decisions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer .
the dfb , who will hold an emergency meeting on monday following hozyer 's -lrb- picture -rrb- shock resignation , added that there was also evidence of manipulation of other games involving the the referee . fears of multiple offences " since friday we have had evidence that he rigged games , " dfb joint-president theo zwanziger said on german television station ard .
hoyzer did not referee in the top bundesliga division but had taken charge of 12 second division matches as well as cup and regional league fixtures . " this case has caused great damage to the dfb , " said gerhard mayer-vorfelder , the other of the dfb 's two co-chairmen , ahead of monday 's meeting .
" just from the psychological aspect , incredible damage has been done , for the german federation and for the referees ' organization . "
mayer-vorfelder also called for a general ban on betting for referees . dfb board president horst hilpert told german sports news agency sid on sunday that the investigation into the scandal would be concluded as soon as possible .
" it is always the obligation of the board of control to reach their conclusions swiftly , particularly in so stressful a case . " " we 're going to see if prosecutors need to be involved , " dfb spokesman harald stenger added in a separate statement .
" we 'll also want to talk to bookmakers .
-lrb- the dfb -rrb- will leave no stone unturned in this investigation .
from what we know at this point , this is absolutely a single case .
no other referee , no player , no coach , no club is involved .
i also want to stress that -lrb- hoyzer 's -rrb- denying all allegations . " " i have never bet on a game i have refereed , " hoyzer told the bild newspaper on monday .
" the accusations have left me pensive , uneasy and dismayed .
i can not comprehend them , and also can not understand that my refereeing colleagues could think me capable of such a thing . " aggrieved hsv consider own action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hsv hamburg could seek compensation .
meanwhile , hamburg officials are holding fire on action of their own until the dfb investigation is complete .
" we are waiting to see how the probe develops and will stay in contact with the dfb to see how we should react , " explained hamburg chief bernd hoffmann told zdf television .
" if it is confirmed , we want some sort of compensation .
who knows how our season might have gone ?
we could still be going strong in the cup at this stage . " " great damage has been inflicted on hamburg sv and on german football , " hoffman added .
" we will use all legal means to put right this wrong . "
however , there is little chance that the clubs will get the chance to right the wrongs on the pitch .
the dfb has already ruled out any possibility of replaying the disputed match . another person involved was entertaining similar thoughts as to what would have happened if the outcome of the game had been different .
former hsv coach klaus toppmoller was in charge of hamburg at the time of the match and claimed hoyzer 's corrupt decisions caused his dismissal two months later . toppmöller blames ref for sack " the referee -lrb- hoyzer -rrb- cost me my job as we were doing fine until the paderborn game , " raged toppmoller in the bild am sonntag weekly . " after that it all went downhill.i had the impression that it was a match we could never win .
i knew something was n't right and i even told the referee 's assistant at the time .
but what can you do ?
if you say there is cheating going on , you could face a ban . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmöller feels his future was jeopardized by the refereeing decisions .
referees now face increased scrutiny into their actions for the remainder of the season .
the hoyzer revelations are likely to increase suspicion when questionable decisions are made .
" from now on all referee decisions will be questioned , " admitted oliver bierhoff , assistant coach of the german national team , in a statement to reporters .
" but i am sure this is just a one-off case . " ghosts of 1971 scandal stirring the dfb will surely hope so .
while it is doing its upmost to prevent the hozyer affair from enveloping german football ahead of the 2006 world cup on home soil , the dfb will be sorely reminded of a previous incident which blew up into the biggest scandal in german football . match-fixing and bribes engulfed the bundesliga in 1971 when more than 50 players , a number of coaches and officials plus the clubs arminia bielefeld and kickers offenbach were found guilty of offering bribes and fixing bundesliga games , prompting the dfb to dish out hefty fines and suspensions . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga restarts with bayern victory it was business as usual as bayern munich opened the second half of the bundesliga season with a 3-0 win over hamburg sv in the olympic stadium on friday .

the berlin-born referee resigned from his post on friday when the probe came to light . the match at the center of the scandal took place on aug .
21 , 2004 , with regional side sc paderborn and bundesliga heavyweights sv hamburg contesting a dfb cup first round match . with the 1983 european cup winners leading the minor league minnows 2-0 , hamburg inexplicably saw their lead disintegrate .
during an allegedly assisted comeback , paderborn were awarded two dubious penalites , both of which were scored , and also benefited when hsv 's belgian striker emile mpenza was sent off for complaining against hozyer 's decisions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer .
the dfb , who will hold an emergency meeting on monday following hozyer 's -lrb- picture -rrb- shock resignation , added that there was also evidence of manipulation of other games involving the the referee . fears of multiple offences " since friday we have had evidence that he rigged games , " dfb joint-president theo zwanziger said on german television station ard .
hoyzer did not referee in the top bundesliga division but had taken charge of 12 second division matches as well as cup and regional league fixtures . " this case has caused great damage to the dfb , " said gerhard mayer-vorfelder , the other of the dfb 's two co-chairmen , ahead of monday 's meeting .
" just from the psychological aspect , incredible damage has been done , for the german federation and for the referees ' organization . "
mayer-vorfelder also called for a general ban on betting for referees . dfb board president horst hilpert told german sports news agency sid on sunday that the investigation into the scandal would be concluded as soon as possible .
" it is always the obligation of the board of control to reach their conclusions swiftly , particularly in so stressful a case . " " we 're going to see if prosecutors need to be involved , " dfb spokesman harald stenger added in a separate statement .
" we 'll also want to talk to bookmakers .
-lrb- the dfb -rrb- will leave no stone unturned in this investigation .
from what we know at this point , this is absolutely a single case .
no other referee , no player , no coach , no club is involved .
i also want to stress that -lrb- hoyzer 's -rrb- denying all allegations . " " i have never bet on a game i have refereed , " hoyzer told the bild newspaper on monday .
" the accusations have left me pensive , uneasy and dismayed .
i can not comprehend them , and also can not understand that my refereeing colleagues could think me capable of such a thing . " aggrieved hsv consider own action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hsv hamburg could seek compensation .
meanwhile , hamburg officials are holding fire on action of their own until the dfb investigation is complete .
" we are waiting to see how the probe develops and will stay in contact with the dfb to see how we should react , " explained hamburg chief bernd hoffmann told zdf television .
" if it is confirmed , we want some sort of compensation .
who knows how our season might have gone ?
we could still be going strong in the cup at this stage . " " great damage has been inflicted on hamburg sv and on german football , " hoffman added .
" we will use all legal means to put right this wrong . "
however , there is little chance that the clubs will get the chance to right the wrongs on the pitch .
the dfb has already ruled out any possibility of replaying the disputed match . another person involved was entertaining similar thoughts as to what would have happened if the outcome of the game had been different .
former hsv coach klaus toppmoller was in charge of hamburg at the time of the match and claimed hoyzer 's corrupt decisions caused his dismissal two months later . toppmöller blames ref for sack " the referee -lrb- hoyzer -rrb- cost me my job as we were doing fine until the paderborn game , " raged toppmoller in the bild am sonntag weekly . " after that it all went downhill.i had the impression that it was a match we could never win .
i knew something was n't right and i even told the referee 's assistant at the time .
but what can you do ?
if you say there is cheating going on , you could face a ban . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmöller feels his future was jeopardized by the refereeing decisions .
referees now face increased scrutiny into their actions for the remainder of the season .
the hoyzer revelations are likely to increase suspicion when questionable decisions are made .
" from now on all referee decisions will be questioned , " admitted oliver bierhoff , assistant coach of the german national team , in a statement to reporters .
" but i am sure this is just a one-off case . " ghosts of 1971 scandal stirring the dfb will surely hope so .
while it is doing its upmost to prevent the hozyer affair from enveloping german football ahead of the 2006 world cup on home soil , the dfb will be sorely reminded of a previous incident which blew up into the biggest scandal in german football . match-fixing and bribes engulfed the bundesliga in 1971 when more than 50 players , a number of coaches and officials plus the clubs arminia bielefeld and kickers offenbach were found guilty of offering bribes and fixing bundesliga games , prompting the dfb to dish out hefty fines and suspensions . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga restarts with bayern victory it was business as usual as bayern munich opened the second half of the bundesliga season with a 3-0 win over hamburg sv in the olympic stadium on friday .

during the ceremony on sunday , the 50-year-old hero of the orange revolution vowed to defend the sovereignty and independence of his country and to uphold the values of his party , the constitution and the ukrainian people . “ this is a victory for freedom over tyranny , ” yushchenko proclaimed to tens of thousands of his protestors gathered in the main square of kiev . bildunterschrift : viktor yushchenko passes by honor guards during a military ceremony in mariinsky palace in kiev , ukraine , sunday , jan .
23 , 2005 . but the pro-western leader will have little time to celebrate what surely is a tremendous victory for democracy in a state that just recently shed the yoke of soviet influence .
starting monday , yushchenko sets out on a tour of europe to prove his sincerity in cooperating closely with the west . opening new doors in brussels , ukraine ’ s future eu minister is already hard at work paving the way for his country ’ s most ambitious goal : entry in the 25-member european union . in an interview with deutsche welle , oleg ribatschuk said he ’ d like to see ukrainian accession as soon as possible , but he conceded that brussels ’ official line only allows for a close partnership in the near future . officially , the eu has said it is not negotiating accession , only a close partnership as part of the bloc ’ s neighborhood policy .
but even after meetings with the eu ’ s foreign policy chief javier solana and eu foreign relations commission benita ferrero-waldner , ribatschuk remains convinced that brussels will open its doors fully to kiev in the next 10 years , even before it lets in turkey . “ the door is not closed , ” he said .
“ what we need to do in ukraine is impress the eu with our rapid tempo in introducing and implementing reforms .
if we develop quickly enough , the eu will have to respond positively – i ’ m absolutely convinced . ” increase reform tempo ukraine ’ s reform efforts have not gone unnoticed in the eu , ribatschuk said . just a week ago , the eu parliament voted in favor of offering kiev a european perspective .
solana and ferrero-waldner have also written a letter to yushchenko outlining an “ eu action plan ” for partnership .
the letter is a first step in the right direction , according to ribatschuk who sees it as proof of brussels ’ interest in strengthening ties with kiev . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin backed yushchenko 's opponent in the election , viktor yanokovych in addition to the eu , ukraine is also striving to enter the nato .
there are just two options , said ribatschuk : “ either we align ourselves with the west or with russia . ”
ukraine and viktor yushchenko have clearly decided in favor of europe .
that does not mean kiev aims to alienate itself from russia , nor does russian president vladimir putin have cause for alarm concerning ukraine ’ s new political course . refocusing foreign policy russia is still the new ukrainian president ’ s first official stop on his foreign tour .
in doing so , yushchenko will stress the fact that he does not wish to break away entirely from russia , a country which for years exerted influence on the smaller neighboring country . “ the main reason for the visit with putin is not to sign any contracts or to drink too many glasses of vodka in the name of friendship .
rather , the point is to revive the close ties , ” ribatschuk said . at the moment though , russia is not at the forefront of ukraine ’ s foreign policy .
it is more important that the new ukrainian government focus its efforts on the eu and nato and convince the population of the necessity of such an endeavor , the future eu minister said .

survivors and foreign dignitaries , including fischer and israeli foreign minister silvan shalom addressed the united nations general assembly . " we can not look away when synagogues are vandalized or damaged , " said fischer .
" and we ca n't stand by and listen to anti-semitic baiting . " the motion to hold the observance on jan .
27 was backed by nearly 150 of the world body ’ s 191 members .
it was sponsored by the united states , israel , the european union , russia , canada , australia and new zealand . germans and israelis address un bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children at auschwitz just before their liberation in 1945 .
the gathering took place three days before a state ceremony in poland at the site of the infamous auschwitz-birkenau death camp , where more than 1 million people - most of them jews - were killed . coming 30 years after the world body adopted a resolution branding zionism a “ form of racism ” - a move that soured un-israeli relations - the special session represents a significant event . israeli ambassador to the un dan gillerman , a vocal opponent at times of the body 's stance on the israeli-palestinian conflict , said the organization ’ s decision to hold the event could be linked to an evolving world . “ maybe we are at a point in history where the changes in the world are reflecting on the united nations .
we do live in a changing world , in a world which hopefully presents us today with a unique window of opportunity to make peace in our region , ” he said .

the berlin-born referee resigned from his post on friday when the probe came to light . the match at the center of the scandal took place on aug .
21 , 2004 , with regional side sc paderborn and bundesliga heavyweights sv hamburg contesting a dfb cup first round match . with the 1983 european cup winners leading the minor league minnows 2-0 , hamburg inexplicably saw their lead disintegrate .
during an allegedly assisted comeback , paderborn were awarded two dubious penalites , both of which were scored , and also benefited when hsv 's belgian striker emile mpenza was sent off for complaining against hozyer 's decisions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : robert hoyzer .
the dfb , who will hold an emergency meeting on monday following hozyer 's -lrb- picture -rrb- shock resignation , added that there was also evidence of manipulation of other games involving the the referee . fears of multiple offences " since friday we have had evidence that he rigged games , " dfb joint-president theo zwanziger said on german television station ard .
hoyzer did not referee in the top bundesliga division but had taken charge of 12 second division matches as well as cup and regional league fixtures . " this case has caused great damage to the dfb , " said gerhard mayer-vorfelder , the other of the dfb 's two co-chairmen , ahead of monday 's meeting .
" just from the psychological aspect , incredible damage has been done , for the german federation and for the referees ' organization . "
mayer-vorfelder also called for a general ban on betting for referees . dfb board president horst hilpert told german sports news agency sid on sunday that the investigation into the scandal would be concluded as soon as possible .
" it is always the obligation of the board of control to reach their conclusions swiftly , particularly in so stressful a case . " " we 're going to see if prosecutors need to be involved , " dfb spokesman harald stenger added in a separate statement .
" we 'll also want to talk to bookmakers .
-lrb- the dfb -rrb- will leave no stone unturned in this investigation .
from what we know at this point , this is absolutely a single case .
no other referee , no player , no coach , no club is involved .
i also want to stress that -lrb- hoyzer 's -rrb- denying all allegations . " " i have never bet on a game i have refereed , " hoyzer told the bild newspaper on monday .
" the accusations have left me pensive , uneasy and dismayed .
i can not comprehend them , and also can not understand that my refereeing colleagues could think me capable of such a thing . " aggrieved hsv consider own action bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hsv hamburg could seek compensation .
meanwhile , hamburg officials are holding fire on action of their own until the dfb investigation is complete .
" we are waiting to see how the probe develops and will stay in contact with the dfb to see how we should react , " explained hamburg chief bernd hoffmann told zdf television .
" if it is confirmed , we want some sort of compensation .
who knows how our season might have gone ?
we could still be going strong in the cup at this stage . " " great damage has been inflicted on hamburg sv and on german football , " hoffman added .
" we will use all legal means to put right this wrong . "
however , there is little chance that the clubs will get the chance to right the wrongs on the pitch .
the dfb has already ruled out any possibility of replaying the disputed match . another person involved was entertaining similar thoughts as to what would have happened if the outcome of the game had been different .
former hsv coach klaus toppmoller was in charge of hamburg at the time of the match and claimed hoyzer 's corrupt decisions caused his dismissal two months later . toppmöller blames ref for sack " the referee -lrb- hoyzer -rrb- cost me my job as we were doing fine until the paderborn game , " raged toppmoller in the bild am sonntag weekly . " after that it all went downhill.i had the impression that it was a match we could never win .
i knew something was n't right and i even told the referee 's assistant at the time .
but what can you do ?
if you say there is cheating going on , you could face a ban . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus toppmöller feels his future was jeopardized by the refereeing decisions .
referees now face increased scrutiny into their actions for the remainder of the season .
the hoyzer revelations are likely to increase suspicion when questionable decisions are made .
" from now on all referee decisions will be questioned , " admitted oliver bierhoff , assistant coach of the german national team , in a statement to reporters .
" but i am sure this is just a one-off case . " ghosts of 1971 scandal stirring the dfb will surely hope so .
while it is doing its upmost to prevent the hozyer affair from enveloping german football ahead of the 2006 world cup on home soil , the dfb will be sorely reminded of a previous incident which blew up into the biggest scandal in german football . match-fixing and bribes engulfed the bundesliga in 1971 when more than 50 players , a number of coaches and officials plus the clubs arminia bielefeld and kickers offenbach were found guilty of offering bribes and fixing bundesliga games , prompting the dfb to dish out hefty fines and suspensions . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : bundesliga restarts with bayern victory it was business as usual as bayern munich opened the second half of the bundesliga season with a 3-0 win over hamburg sv in the olympic stadium on friday .

the legendary former host of nbc 's tonight show was surrounded by family and died peacefully , his nephew said .
carson retired from the top-rated late-night entertainment show in 1992 after 30 years as one of the most popular tv personalities in the us .
president bush led the public tributes , saying carson " had a profound influence on american life and entertainment " .
in 2002 carson , who often smoked during his show , was diagnosed with emphysema - a disease associated with smoking .
" mr carson passed away peacefully early sunday morning , " said his nephew , jeff sotzing .
" he was surrounded by his family , whose loss will be immeasurable .
there will be no memorial service . "
' heeeeere 's johnny ! '
carson began his career on television stations in his home state of nebraska in the late 1940s .
his boyish looks won over both audiences and guests on the tonight show , with carson 's appearance on set announced by sidekick ed mcmahon 's catchphrase : " heeeeere 's johnny ! "

the butt of the jokes was often american presidents , from kennedy to nixon to reagan .
but he was not afraid to laugh at himself - in fact some of the best moments were when a joke failed , our correspondent adds .
he remained popular until his retirement in may 1992 , when an estimated 55 million viewers watched him hand over the tonight show host duties to comic jay leno .
carson told the audience : " and so it has come to this .
i am one of the lucky people in the world .

quiet retirement his personal life did not match his career success , however .

he choose to let the tonight show stand as his finale , withdrawing into a quiet retirement and refusing to become involved in other show business projects .
in 1993 , carson explained his absence from the limelight to the washington post newspaper .
" i have an ego like anybody else , " he said , " but i do n't need to be stoked by going before the public all the time . "
he was inducted into the television hall of fame in 1987 and awarded the presidential medal of freedom in 1992 .

ex-army captain conrad dickinson , 49 , and his 51-year-old wife hilary , from hexham , northumberland , experienced temperatures as low as -45c .
weather conditions for the 1,380-mile journey were reported to be the worst for the past 15 years .
mr dickinson , an expert in arctic warfare during his time in the army , told bbc news how they regularly took painkillers to cope with their injuries .
he said : " we would have filled a doctor 's surgery 10 times over .
we had blisters , pulled muscles , torn muscles , bad backs and horrendous chilblains from the wind and cold .
all you can think is ' it hurts , it hurts ' , over and over again , all day conrad dickinson " the wind always comes from the pole , so it 's constantly in your face on the way there .
" the first four weeks were just pain .
you 're skiing for nine-and-a-half hours a day , pulling a sledge weighing about 130kg , and you 're completely immersed in your own thoughts .
" all you can think is ' it hurts , it hurts ' , over and over again , all day .
the biggest challenge is a mental one .
you ca n't look at the big picture or you 'd go mad .
" so you wake up in the morning and think about getting to the end of the day .
then you break that down into two-hour legs , and you must only think positive thoughts . "
the dickinsons reached the south pole in 52 days the trip was unsupported , which meant there was no re-supplying en-route , so all food , fuel and equipment had to be pulled on sledges .
mr dickinson said : " we wanted to do the trip in a very pure , clean way without any outside interference , and that 's what we did .
" but we did end up in danger a few times .
at one point we found an area that did n't appear on the maps and decided to lower our sledges down a sheer ice slope .
" we ended up in maze of ice cliffs and ravines , walking across snow bridges , not knowing whether they would support our weight or collapse underneath us .
" it was very hairy .
if you fell down a ravine , it would definitely be game over . "
when we arrived at the pole we ate 24 bars of chocolate between us , something we 're particularly proud of conrad dickinson the dickinsons were accompanied by canadian polar explorer , matty mcnair , 53 , and her children eric , 20 , and sarah mcnair-landry , 18 .
the team skied to the pole in 52 days , but made the return journey in just 17 days , using kites to pull them back to their starting point at speeds of up to 25mph .
they broke several records on the expedition , but mr dickinson best remembers some of the accomplishments which probably will not make it into the record books .
he said : " when we arrived at the pole we ate 24 bars of chocolate between us , something we 're particularly proud of .

mps are expected to give final approval on monday to the legislation , which will bring about a major reduction in the westminster total .
the commons will vote on an order giving final legal footing to new boundary changes .
the shake-up will reduce the number of parliamentary constituencies from 72 to 59 .
the commons vote will make legal the recommendations of the boundary commission for scotland , which decided on the cutback after a long inquiry .
it means , as a consequence of devolution , larger constituencies similar to those in england and 13 fewer seats for potential scottish mps to fight over .
westminster cull the house of lords is expected to give its backing to the legislation next week .
the result is that when voters go to the polls they will be electing 646 mps rather than the current 659 .
scottish secretary alistair darling has told mps he intends to lay parliamentary orders as soon as possible to bring the changes in before the public goes to the polls .
english constituencies currently contain nearly 70,000 voters on average , far more than the scottish average of 53,500 .
the move is seen as a means of restoring parity following devolution , which supporters say made the need for extra scottish mps redundant .
the scotland act , which paved the way for the establishment of the scottish parliament , contained an agreement to end the anomaly of scotland 's over-representation at westminster .
the final recommendations in the fifth periodical review were released just over a year ago following a lengthy consultation exercise and a series of public inquiries .
a number of cabinet ministers face seeing their constituencies disappear in the redistribution , including chancellor gordon brown , health secretary john reid and even mr darling himself .
however , the ministers are expected to be given new constituencies when labour draws up its list of parliamentary candidates for the next election .

there are hopes that a commemorative cd and dvd could be made available .
workers at the stadium are continuing to dismantle the stage after saturday 's mammoth concert , in preparation for the forthcoming rugby internationals .
stars including keane , snow patrol , manic street preachers , eric clapton , and lulu performed free of charge .
the seven-hour gig was the biggest event of its kind in the uk since live aid 20 years ago .
the stadium is now being turned back into a sporting venue .
the pitch is about to be laid ahead of the spring rugby internationals .
the wales v england game takes place in less than a fortnight .
meanwhile , 14 officers with south wales police leave for thailand on monday to join the effort to recover and identify the bodies of victims of the tsunami disaster .
they are all volunteers and have been trained to help them deal with traumatic conditions .
the officers are expected to stay in thailand for two weeks .
saturday 's fundraising concert was organised in just three weeks .
we had a world-class line-up for what was a world-class event .
paul sergeant paul sergeant , the stadium 's general manager , paid tribute to the " phenomenal " response of the 61,000 music-lovers who bought tickets for the event , and the thousands more workers who volunteered to make it happen .
the £ 1.25m raised on the day is on its way to the disaster and emergency committee , bringing the total raised by the british public for the disaster so far to over £ 200m .
but mr sergeant said he expected the figure to increase .
one way of raising more funds would be to release a cd and dvd of the entire concert , and mr sergeant said they would be " exploring the idea " .
live aid 's midge ure made a surprise appearance at the gig he said : " everyone , from all the international artists who offered to play for free , to the production teams and countless volunteers , went flat out to make sure that the event was a day to remember as well as a massive fundraiser .
" we had a world-class line-up for what was a world-class event . "
welsh musical stars including the manic street preachers and kelly jones of the stereophonics - who was touring in france , but flew in just for the event - helped make the concert a sell-out .
singers charlotte church , aled jones , and katherine jenkins , also took part .
but there was also support from uk stars like lemar , lulu , jools holland and the legendary guitarist eric clapton .
scots singer lulu said it was an " amazing , amazing event " .

there are hopes that a commemorative cd and dvd could be made available .
workers at the stadium are continuing to dismantle the stage after saturday 's mammoth concert , in preparation for the forthcoming rugby internationals .
stars including keane , snow patrol , manic street preachers , eric clapton , and lulu performed free of charge .
the seven-hour gig was the biggest event of its kind in the uk since live aid 20 years ago .
the stadium is now being turned back into a sporting venue .
the pitch is about to be laid ahead of the spring rugby internationals .
the wales v england game takes place in less than a fortnight .
meanwhile , 14 officers with south wales police leave for thailand on monday to join the effort to recover and identify the bodies of victims of the tsunami disaster .
they are all volunteers and have been trained to help them deal with traumatic conditions .
the officers are expected to stay in thailand for two weeks .
saturday 's fundraising concert was organised in just three weeks .
we had a world-class line-up for what was a world-class event .
paul sergeant paul sergeant , the stadium 's general manager , paid tribute to the " phenomenal " response of the 61,000 music-lovers who bought tickets for the event , and the thousands more workers who volunteered to make it happen .
the £ 1.25m raised on the day is on its way to the disaster and emergency committee , bringing the total raised by the british public for the disaster so far to over £ 200m .
but mr sergeant said he expected the figure to increase .
one way of raising more funds would be to release a cd and dvd of the entire concert , and mr sergeant said they would be " exploring the idea " .
live aid 's midge ure made a surprise appearance at the gig he said : " everyone , from all the international artists who offered to play for free , to the production teams and countless volunteers , went flat out to make sure that the event was a day to remember as well as a massive fundraiser .
" we had a world-class line-up for what was a world-class event . "
welsh musical stars including the manic street preachers and kelly jones of the stereophonics - who was touring in france , but flew in just for the event - helped make the concert a sell-out .
singers charlotte church , aled jones , and katherine jenkins , also took part .
but there was also support from uk stars like lemar , lulu , jools holland and the legendary guitarist eric clapton .
scots singer lulu said it was an " amazing , amazing event " .
she said the " energy coming from the audience helped to make the evening really special " .

sir mark prescott , horse trainer and hare-courser former pc danny cracknell , who retired in november as norfolk police wildlife crime officer , had to try to enforce the present laws against illegal hare-coursing .
he is concerned that the new law could damage the relationship between officers and farmers , as it will be easier to prosecute the owner of the land where the event takes place than the hare-coursers .

there are fears that banning hare-coursing , which has its strongest support in east anglia and the north west , will stretch police resources .
but a chief constable has told bbc news that the new law will be acted on and hare-coursers could be jailed .
the news comes as bbc inside out looks at legal and illegal coursing .
dealing with illegal coursing has become a regular chore for farmers in east anglia .
the sport is a feature of life in parts of bedfordshire , cambrdgeshire , essex , lancashire , lincolnshire , norfolk , northamptonshire and suffolk .

sir mark prescott , horse trainer and hare-courser former pc danny cracknell , who retired in november as norfolk police wildlife crime officer , had to try to enforce the present laws against illegal hare-coursing .
he is concerned that the new law could damage the relationship between officers and farmers , as it will be easier to prosecute the owner of the land where the event takes place than the hare-coursers .
" my biggest fear is that the land owner -lrb- where an illegal hare-coursing event has taken place -rrb- will end up being easy prey , " he said .
mr cracknell , who now works for farmwatch , believes the same areas that have had problems in the past with illegal coursing will face even more problems .
" the existing illegal hare-coursing laws they have not been able to police 100 % .
it will stretch the resources , " he said .
there is a long history of hare-coursing in britain but alistair mcwhirter , the chief constable of suffolk and rural spokesman for the association of chief police officers , said he believed the number of possible hare-coursing lawbreakers was being " over-hyped " .
" we will enforce the legislation .
people should be under no illusions .
we will be taking action in relation to hare-coursing , " he said .
" hare-coursing is more obvious than some forms of hunting , with the coursing taking place in open spaces . "
sir mark prescott , successful newmarket horse trainer and hare-courser , questioned whether local police will be able to enforce the new law .
dogs at a hare-coursing event in cambridgeshire " police ca n't control illegal coursing , which is poaching , " he said .
" if they ca n't control it now , what possible chance have they got if this legislation comes into effect ? "
nasaar raja ahmed , who in november ran his dog at a national coursing club event at fulbourne , near cambridge , said he was committed to continuing hare-coursing .

it is called high-definition - hd for short - and it is already hugely popular in japan and the us .
it is set , according to analysts , to do for images what cds did for sound .
different equipment able to receive hd signals is needed though and is expensive .
but europe 's gamers may be the early adopters to drive demand .
europeans will have to wait until at least 2006 until they see mainstream hdtv . "
it 's going to change really the way they look at gaming " dr mark tuffy , thx uk games firms face ' testing times ' to view it , it needs to be transmitted in hd format , and people need special receivers and displays that can handle the high-quality resolution .
the next generation of consoles , however , are expected to start appearing at the end of 2005 , start of 2006 .
and most new computer displays and plasma sets are already capable of handling such high-resolution pictures .
" in the next generation -lsb- of consoles -rsb- hd support is mandatory , " dr mark tuffy games systems director at digital content firm thx told the bbc news website .
" every game is going to be playable in hd .
" so consumers who have gone out and spent all this money on hdtvs , and who have no content to watch , are going to be blown away by these really high-detail pictures .
" it 's going to change really the way they look at gaming . "
long wait at the end of last year , chris deering , sony 's european president , made a prediction that 20 million european households would have hdtv sets by 2008 .
a previous prediction from analysts datamonitor put the figure at 4.6 million by 2008 , an increase from an estimated 50,000 sets at the end of 2003 .
but those in europe may see little point in buying what is quite an expensive bit of technology - about £ 2,000 - if there are few programmes or films to watch on them .
satellite broadcaster bskyb is planning hdtv services in 2006 and the bbc intends to produce all of its content in hd by 2010 .
until broadcast rights , format standards - and the practicalities of updating equipment - are agreed , tv content will be limited .
all tv images are made up of pixels which go across the screen , and scan lines which go down the screen .
most standard uk tv pictures are made up of 625 lines and about 700 pixels .
hd offers up to 1,080 active lines , with each line made up of 1,920 pixels .
this means the picture is up to six times as sharp as standard tv .
" probably , in the uk -lsb- gaming -rsb- is going to be the only thing you are going to really be able to show off , as in ' look what this tv can do ' , until hd is really adopted by broadcasters , " explains dr tuffy .
but gamers are also the ideal target audience for hd because they always crave better quality graphics , and more immersive gaming experiences .
they are used to spending money on hardware to match a game 's requirements .
demographics have changed too and the " sweet spot " for the games industry is the gamer in his or her late 20s .
this means they are likely to have higher disposable incomes and can afford the price of big-screen , high-definition display technologies and hd projectors , earlier than others .
blurring games and films higher capacity storage discs , such as hd-dvd and blue-ray , are set to be standard in the next round of games consoles - allowing developers more room for detailed graphics .
for console developers though , hd offers some production changes .
it could make games production slightly more expensive , thinks dr tuffy .
" but we may see the cross-platform development of games becoming more common because they will more easily be able to take a pc game and apply it to a console , " he says .
" you are literally going to get to the point , with a lord of the rings game for example , is going to be closer and closer to the actual film , especially the cgi stuff from the dvd .
" and the transition when they move from a cut scene to the game , just now they have almost got it seamless . "
with hd , he says , the transition will be completely seamless and the same quality as the big-screen cinema release .
this could herald an increasing convergence between the film and gaming industry .
but it may not be until the generation after the next games consoles where the two industries really collide .
at that point , says dr tuffy , games could become more or less interactive movies .

" it 's going to change really the way they look at gaming . "
long wait at the end of last year , chris deering , sony 's european president , made a prediction that 20 million european households would have hdtv sets by 2008 .
a previous prediction from analysts datamonitor put the figure at 4.6 million by 2008 , an increase from an estimated 50,000 sets at the end of 2003 .
but those in europe may see little point in buying what is quite an expensive bit of technology - about £ 2,000 - if there are few programmes or films to watch on them .
satellite broadcaster bskyb is planning hdtv services in 2006 and the bbc intends to produce all of its content in hd by 2010 .
high-definition tv broadcasts in europe will not be mainstream for a while until broadcast rights , format standards - and the practicalities of updating equipment - are agreed , tv content will be limited .
all tv images are made up of pixels which go across the screen , and scan lines which go down the screen .
most standard uk tv pictures are made up of 625 lines and about 700 pixels .
hd offers up to 1,080 active lines , with each line made up of 1,920 pixels .
this means the picture is up to six times as sharp as standard tv .
" probably , in the uk -lsb- gaming -rsb- is going to be the only thing you are going to really be able to show off , as in ' look what this tv can do ' , until hd is really adopted by broadcasters , " explains dr tuffy .
but gamers are also the ideal target audience for hd because they always crave better quality graphics , and more immersive gaming experiences .
they are used to spending money on hardware to match a game 's requirements .
demographics have changed too and the " sweet spot " for the games industry is the gamer in his or her late 20s .
this means they are likely to have higher disposable incomes and can afford the price of big-screen , high-definition display technologies and hd projectors , earlier than others .
blurring games and films higher capacity storage discs , such as hd-dvd and blue-ray , are set to be standard in the next round of games consoles - allowing developers more room for detailed graphics .
film or game ?
soon we might not be able to tell the difference for console developers though , hd offers some production changes .
it could make games production slightly more expensive , thinks dr tuffy .
" but we may see the cross-platform development of games becoming more common because they will more easily be able to take a pc game and apply it to a console , " he says .
" you are literally going to get to the point , with a lord of the rings game for example , is going to be closer and closer to the actual film , especially the cgi stuff from the dvd .
" and the transition when they move from a cut scene to the game , just now they have almost got it seamless . "
with hd , he says , the transition will be completely seamless and the same quality as the big-screen cinema release .
this could herald an increasing convergence between the film and gaming industry .
but it may not be until the generation after the next games consoles where the two industries really collide .
at that point , says dr tuffy , games could become more or less interactive movies .

all tv images are made up of pixels which go across the screen , and scan lines which go down the screen .
most standard uk tv pictures are made up of 625 lines and about 700 pixels .

they are used to spending money on hardware to match a game 's requirements .

it could make games production slightly more expensive , thinks dr tuffy .

" and the transition when they move from a cut scene to the game , just now they have almost got it seamless . "
with hd , he says , the transition will be completely seamless and the same quality as the big-screen cinema release .
this could herald an increasing convergence between the film and gaming industry .

fred hasson , head of tiga , which represents independent developers , said that more uk firms would go under due to greater risks in making new titles .
three leading uk video game companies also predicted that more firms would close as they struggled to adapt .
microsoft , sony and nintendo are expected to release new consoles in the next 18 months .
microsoft has said repeatedly that it wants to be first to the market and some analysts predict that xbox 2 will be released in the us before the end of 2005 .
once the cull has finished its likely to present those still standing with great opportunities fred hasson , tiga the new machines will all have much greater processing and graphical power which will have a huge impact on development of next generation games .
mr hasson said : " in the last four years we have probably lost a third of independent developers . "
he said there were about 150 independent developers left in the industry and more were likely to close .
" once the cull has finished its likely to present those still standing with great opportunities , " he said .
double mr hasson said the industry was predicting that developments costs and teams were likely to need to double in order to cope with the demands of the new machines .
that figure was endorsed by three independent companies contacted by the bbc news website - codemasters , climax and rebellion .
microsoft has pledged to be first to market with a new console " as consoles get more powerful , the content gets more detailed and that means more cost , " said gary dunn , development director at codemasters , which develops games in house and also publishes titles .
jason kingsley , chief executive of rebellion , said the transition from the current generation of consoles to the new machines was difficult because " the production quality expected by consumers will be that much bigger " .
he added : " we have been through five technology transitions and survived so far .
" each one has involved the death of some people .
all companies said they were investing in new tools - called middleware - in order to try and avoid staff numbers spiralling out of control .
upfront simon gardner , president of climax 's action studio , said : " we are investing in superior tools and editors .
we are investing upfront to generate this content without the need for huge teams .
" it 's vital we avoid huge teams . "
he said climax was already directing about 20 % of its resources to preparation for next generation titles .
mr dunn warned that companies could face a short supply of programming , development and artistic talent .
" if companies are hiring bigger and bigger teams , at some point the talent is going to run out . "
mr hasson said games developers were beginning to realise that they had to be more " business-like " .

the firm , a joint venture between the south korea 's lg and europe 's philips , said it earned 35bn won -lrb- $ 34m ; £ 18m -rrb- in the three months to december 2004 .
a year earlier , the same quarter had produced profits of 544bn won .
soaring demand for the screens around the world has led to over-production , driving prices sharply lower .
lg philips ' main rival is market leader samsung , also from south korea .
boom or bust ?
lg philips said prices were down by almost 20 % in the final three months of last year , and predicted a further 10-20 % fall during the first half of 2005 .
" supply has been rising led by competition among lcd makers , while demand is yet to recover , " said brian park , analyst at woori securities in seoul .
" we expect global supply to exceed demand by 20 % in the first quarter and 28 % in the second quarter , so lcd makers will have to cut operating rates down to below 80 % ... virtually a shutdown of plants . "
samsung , in contrast , sees prices reviving from april onwards , with a balance between supply and demand by mid-year .
and lg philips at least managed to stay in the black , confounding predictions that it would report a loss of about 13bn won .
" the figures are a little better than our expectations ... because shipments surged quarter on quarter , " said jeff kim of hyundai securities .
" in the short-term perspective , it means that panel prices could have bottomed out . "
