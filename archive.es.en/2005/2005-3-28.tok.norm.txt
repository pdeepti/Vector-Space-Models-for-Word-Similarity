the new , but controversial , method of calculating will shave 0.6 to 0.9 percentage points off the deficit rations of the three former communist states , kager said , putting them within the limit of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- required by the maastricht treaty for a country adopting the euro .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 28.03.2005 german hooligans taint slovenian friendly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenian police arrest a soccer fan during the violence in celje a " friendly " weekend soccer match between germany and slovenia quickly turned sour as before , during and after the game , german fans participated in racist violence , prompting fears of a revival of hooliganism . the german soccer association , dfb , was quick to apologize to slovenia for the german fans who smashed the windows of cars and shops , shouted racist slogans , and got into fist fights with police and locals in the slovenian city of celje , but the damage was already done . the images of german hooligans running riot brought back memories of violent scenes during the 1980s and 1990s .
during the 1998 world cup in france , for example , german hooligans beat up a french policeman , leaving him with permanent brain damage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a belgian riot police clubs an english soccer fan in the center of charleroi on june 17 , 2000 , following clashes between german and english hooligans ahead of the euro 2000 soccer match england versus germany .
the violence in celje over the weekend was the worst outbreak of german hooliganism since the 2000 european championships , when england played germany in charleroi , belgium .
and , 14 months before germany plays host to the 2006 world cup , it has forced the issue of how to clamp down on fan violence back into the headlines . shock and shame everyone in the german soccer world , from the head of the world cup organizing committee , franz beckenbauer , to dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder , to german national team coach jürgen klinsmann , has proclaimed their shock and shame at what happened in slovenia . " it 's our shame , " said mayer-vorfelder , who was also attacked as he left the stadium following the german team 's 1-0 victory .
" it 's a very , very sad matter . " " as hosts of the world cup , this has cast us in a bad light , " said klinsmann .
" it 's a shame that a few rioters were able to use an international match as a platform for their mindless and dangerous actions . " german officials said they were aware that between 200 and 250 known troublemakers were in celje and had warned local authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer " the cooperation between german and slovenian authorities clearly did n't work well , " said beckenbauer .
" i 'm sure german security officials warned the slovenians about the troublemakers .
they must have thought things wouldn ’ t be so bad . " in total , police in slovenia arrested 52 hooligans , 40 of whom were germans . efforts largely successful german efforts to get tough on soccer hooligans have largely been effective in recent years .
typically , when there 's reason to suspect violence will erupt , german police bar fans with violent records from leaving the country .
known hooligans are obliged to check in with their local police every day during an event such as the european championships and are given special stamps in their passports .
additionally , the dfb uses a screening process when selling tickets to german fans . the match in slovenia , however , was not sold out , meaning that german fans not screened by the dfb were able to buy tickets the day of the game in celje , german officials said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fans , not hooligans the story of portugal soccer 's chronic plague , hooliganism , was little more than a footnote at the european soccer championships in portugal this year .
organizers say more effective measures and a new fan culture are the reasons .
-lrb- july 3 , 2004 -rrb- police gear up for euro 2004 the european soccer championships in portugal this summer will host the largest security operation ever in the history of the game .

during the 1998 world cup in france , for example , german hooligans beat up a french policeman , leaving him with permanent brain damage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a belgian riot police clubs an english soccer fan in the center of charleroi on june 17 , 2000 , following clashes between german and english hooligans ahead of the euro 2000 soccer match england versus germany .
the violence in celje over the weekend was the worst outbreak of german hooliganism since the 2000 european championships , when england played germany in charleroi , belgium .
and , 14 months before germany plays host to the 2006 world cup , it has forced the issue of how to clamp down on fan violence back into the headlines . shock and shame everyone in the german soccer world , from the head of the world cup organizing committee , franz beckenbauer , to dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder , to german national team coach jürgen klinsmann , has proclaimed their shock and shame at what happened in slovenia . " it 's our shame , " said mayer-vorfelder , who was also attacked as he left the stadium following the german team 's 1-0 victory .
" it 's a very , very sad matter . " " as hosts of the world cup , this has cast us in a bad light , " said klinsmann .
" it 's a shame that a few rioters were able to use an international match as a platform for their mindless and dangerous actions . " german officials said they were aware that between 200 and 250 known troublemakers were in celje and had warned local authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer " the cooperation between german and slovenian authorities clearly did n't work well , " said beckenbauer .
" i 'm sure german security officials warned the slovenians about the troublemakers .
they must have thought things wouldn ’ t be so bad . " in total , police in slovenia arrested 52 hooligans , 40 of whom were germans . efforts largely successful german efforts to get tough on soccer hooligans have largely been effective in recent years .
typically , when there 's reason to suspect violence will erupt , german police bar fans with violent records from leaving the country .
known hooligans are obliged to check in with their local police every day during an event such as the european championships and are given special stamps in their passports .
additionally , the dfb uses a screening process when selling tickets to german fans . the match in slovenia , however , was not sold out , meaning that german fans not screened by the dfb were able to buy tickets the day of the game in celje , german officials said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fans , not hooligans the story of portugal soccer 's chronic plague , hooliganism , was little more than a footnote at the european soccer championships in portugal this year .
organizers say more effective measures and a new fan culture are the reasons .

during the 1998 world cup in france , for example , german hooligans beat up a french policeman , leaving him with permanent brain damage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a belgian riot police clubs an english soccer fan in the center of charleroi on june 17 , 2000 , following clashes between german and english hooligans ahead of the euro 2000 soccer match england versus germany .
the violence in celje over the weekend was the worst outbreak of german hooliganism since the 2000 european championships , when england played germany in charleroi , belgium .
and , 14 months before germany plays host to the 2006 world cup , it has forced the issue of how to clamp down on fan violence back into the headlines . shock and shame everyone in the german soccer world , from the head of the world cup organizing committee , franz beckenbauer , to dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder , to german national team coach jürgen klinsmann , has proclaimed their shock and shame at what happened in slovenia . " it 's our shame , " said mayer-vorfelder , who was also attacked as he left the stadium following the german team 's 1-0 victory .
" it 's a very , very sad matter . " " as hosts of the world cup , this has cast us in a bad light , " said klinsmann .
" it 's a shame that a few rioters were able to use an international match as a platform for their mindless and dangerous actions . " german officials said they were aware that between 200 and 250 known troublemakers were in celje and had warned local authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer " the cooperation between german and slovenian authorities clearly did n't work well , " said beckenbauer .
" i 'm sure german security officials warned the slovenians about the troublemakers .
they must have thought things wouldn ’ t be so bad . " in total , police in slovenia arrested 52 hooligans , 40 of whom were germans . efforts largely successful german efforts to get tough on soccer hooligans have largely been effective in recent years .
typically , when there 's reason to suspect violence will erupt , german police bar fans with violent records from leaving the country .
known hooligans are obliged to check in with their local police every day during an event such as the european championships and are given special stamps in their passports .
additionally , the dfb uses a screening process when selling tickets to german fans . the match in slovenia , however , was not sold out , meaning that german fans not screened by the dfb were able to buy tickets the day of the game in celje , german officials said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fans , not hooligans the story of portugal soccer 's chronic plague , hooliganism , was little more than a footnote at the european soccer championships in portugal this year .
organizers say more effective measures and a new fan culture are the reasons .
-lrb- july 3 , 2004 -rrb- police gear up for euro 2004 the european soccer championships in portugal this summer will host the largest security operation ever in the history of the game .
german , english and portuguese police are already operational in and around the country .

a military tribunal determined last fall that kurnaz , seized in pakistan in 2001 , was a member of al qaeda and an enemy combatant whom the us government could detain indefinitely at guantanamo .
but , according to the post , the declassified documents obtained by the newspaper show the us military and german authorities had largely concluded there was no information that linked kurnaz to al qaeda , any other terrorist organization or terrorist activities .
however , his detention has been backed by a " brief , unsupported memo " written by an unidentified us government official , the paper added . dw-world.de new evidence may clear bremen taliban lawyers campaigning for the release of " bremen taliban " murat kurnaz from us custody are hoping new evidence will clear him .
meanwhile , the german government is taking flak from his supporters for not helping enough .

another group of ministry workers , however , declared their support for fischer 's move in a letter to the editor of the internal newsletter where the obituaries are printed , saying that the change was overdue , ap reported .
the debate was sparked after the newsletter published a death notice for a deceased diplomat who had been a member of the nazi party and worked as a senior prosecutor in many cases in german-occupied czechoslovakia .
fischer decided in sept .
2003 that the newsletter 's death notices should only list the deceased 's career in the ministry as well as funeral information .
" honorific obituaries in this and comparable cases could rightly cause misunderstanding and outrage at home and abroad and would lend themselves to damaging the reputation of the foreign ministry and germany , " fischer wrote in an internal memo . dw-world.de fischer snubs ex-nazi diplomats the german foreign ministry has invoked the ire of a who 's who of former german diplomats .

a military tribunal determined last fall that kurnaz , seized in pakistan in 2001 , was a member of al qaeda and an enemy combatant whom the us government could detain indefinitely at guantanamo .
but , according to the post , the declassified documents obtained by the newspaper show the us military and german authorities had largely concluded there was no information that linked kurnaz to al qaeda , any other terrorist organization or terrorist activities .
however , his detention has been backed by a " brief , unsupported memo " written by an unidentified us government official , the paper added . dw-world.de new evidence may clear bremen taliban lawyers campaigning for the release of " bremen taliban " murat kurnaz from us custody are hoping new evidence will clear him .
meanwhile , the german government is taking flak from his supporters for not helping enough .

"
the new , but controversial , method of calculating will shave 0.6 to 0.9 percentage points off the deficit rations of the three former communist states , kager said , putting them within the limit of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- required by the maastricht treaty for a country adopting the euro .

"
the new , but controversial , method of calculating will shave 0.6 to 0.9 percentage points off the deficit rations of the three former communist states , kager said , putting them within the limit of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- required by the maastricht treaty for a country adopting the euro . " slovakia 's chance of joining the euro zone in 2009 is assured .
poland and hungary , which were aiming for 2010 , can now also set 2009 as their target , " a ba-ca report published last monday said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and foreign minister joschka fischer during a press conference at the end of an eu summit at which leaders approved watering down the rules that underpin the stability of the euro .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.03.2005 pact reform removes obstacles for east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entry to the euro zone no longer appears such a distant goal the road into the euro zone for countries in eastern europe has become smoother after the agreement by eu leaders last week to relax budget rules , ministers and analysts say . by allowing countries to take into account the cost of pension reforms when they calculate their deficit , the changes to the eu 's stability and growth pact will " remove the major obstacle to a rapid entry into the euro zone for hungary , poland and slovakia " , the chief economist for bank austria-creditanstalt -lrb- ba-ca -rrb- , marianne kager , said . the three countries , all busy reforming their pension systems , were at risk of missing their 2010 deadline for joining the euro zone because of their " high budget deficits . "
the new , but controversial , method of calculating will shave 0.6 to 0.9 percentage points off the deficit rations of the three former communist states , kager said , putting them within the limit of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- required by the maastricht treaty for a country adopting the euro . " slovakia 's chance of joining the euro zone in 2009 is assured .
poland and hungary , which were aiming for 2010 , can now also set 2009 as their target , " a ba-ca report published last monday said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and foreign minister joschka fischer during a press conference at the end of an eu summit at which leaders approved watering down the rules that underpin the stability of the euro .
following the agreement , which has raised the hackles of eu central bankers , poland and hungary can hope to bring their deficits down to 2.8 percent of gdp , instead of 3.7 and 3.4 percent respectively , while slovakia can achieve 2.3 percent instead of the forecast 3.0 percent , ba-ca predicted . hungary on euro track last week , hungarian finance minister tibor draskovics welcomed the changes to the stability pact , saying that they would enable his country to remain on track to adopt the euro by 2010 . in january , the european commission initiated an " excessive deficit procedure " against hungary for failing to rein in its public finances . " with the modifications of the stability pact , hungary could emerge sooner from the excessive deficit procedure and is more certain than before to stay on track for the adoption of the euro , " he said . poland sets hopes on 2009 his polish counterpart , moroslaw gronicki , said that the reforms would help warsaw to enter the euro zone by 2009 . " the situation is better that it was a few months ago .
we have a chance of avoiding excessive deficit procedures against poland in 2007 , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish economist marcin mroz , an analyst at french bank societe generale in warsaw , told afp : " the reforms have opened a window of opportunity for poland to reverse a situation which would otherwise have delayed its adoption of the euro by two years . " but analysts pointed out that the public deficit was only one of the criteria for joining the euro zone . " inflation could still pose a serious problem in countries like hungary , slovakia and slovenia , " kager said , while mroz warned poland to pay heed in this regard . all these countries have higher inflation that the 2.5 percent currently required by maastricht . " it is an obstacle but one that can be overcome .
it is easier to cut inflation and interest rates -lrb- another maastricht condition -rrb- in the long run than to reduce the deficit , " kager said . furthermore , all the 10 new member states of the eu complied with the requirement of having debt below 60 percent of gdp , the analysts pointed out . ba-ca said of all former east bloc states that joined the eu last year , only the czech republic looked set to exceed the 3.0-percent limit and therefore seems unlikely to join the euro zone before 2010 . prague has not undertaken pension reforms and the czechs are forecast to have a deficit of 3.3 percent of gdp two years from now . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : burying the euro stability pact eu finance ministers have agreed to reform the rules underpinning the euro .
but in doing so , the floodgates have been opened for reinterpreting the regulations meant to ensure budgetary discipline and a stable currency .
-lrb- march 22 , 2005 -rrb- mixed reactions to stability pact rewrite in the wake of sunday 's decision to loosen the rules of the stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , opposition voices in germany are crying foul .
but some economists say more flexibility was needed .
-lrb- march 21 , 2005 -rrb- germany leads pack of pact assassins germany , one of the main architects of the eu 's stability and growth pact , heads a list of potential assassins who want to kill off the bloc 's tattered fiscal rules .

"
the new , but controversial , method of calculating will shave 0.6 to 0.9 percentage points off the deficit rations of the three former communist states , kager said , putting them within the limit of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- required by the maastricht treaty for a country adopting the euro .

"
the new , but controversial , method of calculating will shave 0.6 to 0.9 percentage points off the deficit rations of the three former communist states , kager said , putting them within the limit of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- required by the maastricht treaty for a country adopting the euro . " slovakia 's chance of joining the euro zone in 2009 is assured .

" it is an obstacle but one that can be overcome .
it is easier to cut inflation and interest rates -lrb- another maastricht condition -rrb- in the long run than to reduce the deficit , " kager said . furthermore , all the 10 new member states of the eu complied with the requirement of having debt below 60 percent of gdp , the analysts pointed out . ba-ca said of all former east bloc states that joined the eu last year , only the czech republic looked set to exceed the 3.0-percent limit and therefore seems unlikely to join the euro zone before 2010 . prague has not undertaken pension reforms and the czechs are forecast to have a deficit of 3.3 percent of gdp two years from now . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : burying the euro stability pact eu finance ministers have agreed to reform the rules underpinning the euro .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.03.2005 pact reform removes obstacles for east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : entry to the euro zone no longer appears such a distant goal the road into the euro zone for countries in eastern europe has become smoother after the agreement by eu leaders last week to relax budget rules , ministers and analysts say . by allowing countries to take into account the cost of pension reforms when they calculate their deficit , the changes to the eu 's stability and growth pact will " remove the major obstacle to a rapid entry into the euro zone for hungary , poland and slovakia " , the chief economist for bank austria-creditanstalt -lrb- ba-ca -rrb- , marianne kager , said . the three countries , all busy reforming their pension systems , were at risk of missing their 2010 deadline for joining the euro zone because of their " high budget deficits . "
the new , but controversial , method of calculating will shave 0.6 to 0.9 percentage points off the deficit rations of the three former communist states , kager said , putting them within the limit of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- required by the maastricht treaty for a country adopting the euro . " slovakia 's chance of joining the euro zone in 2009 is assured .
poland and hungary , which were aiming for 2010 , can now also set 2009 as their target , " a ba-ca report published last monday said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and foreign minister joschka fischer during a press conference at the end of an eu summit at which leaders approved watering down the rules that underpin the stability of the euro .
following the agreement , which has raised the hackles of eu central bankers , poland and hungary can hope to bring their deficits down to 2.8 percent of gdp , instead of 3.7 and 3.4 percent respectively , while slovakia can achieve 2.3 percent instead of the forecast 3.0 percent , ba-ca predicted . hungary on euro track last week , hungarian finance minister tibor draskovics welcomed the changes to the stability pact , saying that they would enable his country to remain on track to adopt the euro by 2010 . in january , the european commission initiated an " excessive deficit procedure " against hungary for failing to rein in its public finances . " with the modifications of the stability pact , hungary could emerge sooner from the excessive deficit procedure and is more certain than before to stay on track for the adoption of the euro , " he said . poland sets hopes on 2009 his polish counterpart , moroslaw gronicki , said that the reforms would help warsaw to enter the euro zone by 2009 . " the situation is better that it was a few months ago .
we have a chance of avoiding excessive deficit procedures against poland in 2007 , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish economist marcin mroz , an analyst at french bank societe generale in warsaw , told afp : " the reforms have opened a window of opportunity for poland to reverse a situation which would otherwise have delayed its adoption of the euro by two years . " but analysts pointed out that the public deficit was only one of the criteria for joining the euro zone . " inflation could still pose a serious problem in countries like hungary , slovakia and slovenia , " kager said , while mroz warned poland to pay heed in this regard . all these countries have higher inflation that the 2.5 percent currently required by maastricht . " it is an obstacle but one that can be overcome .
it is easier to cut inflation and interest rates -lrb- another maastricht condition -rrb- in the long run than to reduce the deficit , " kager said . furthermore , all the 10 new member states of the eu complied with the requirement of having debt below 60 percent of gdp , the analysts pointed out . ba-ca said of all former east bloc states that joined the eu last year , only the czech republic looked set to exceed the 3.0-percent limit and therefore seems unlikely to join the euro zone before 2010 . prague has not undertaken pension reforms and the czechs are forecast to have a deficit of 3.3 percent of gdp two years from now . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : burying the euro stability pact eu finance ministers have agreed to reform the rules underpinning the euro .

another group of ministry workers , however , declared their support for fischer 's move in a letter to the editor of the internal newsletter where the obituaries are printed , saying that the change was overdue , ap reported .
the debate was sparked after the newsletter published a death notice for a deceased diplomat who had been a member of the nazi party and worked as a senior prosecutor in many cases in german-occupied czechoslovakia .
fischer decided in sept .
2003 that the newsletter 's death notices should only list the deceased 's career in the ministry as well as funeral information .
" honorific obituaries in this and comparable cases could rightly cause misunderstanding and outrage at home and abroad and would lend themselves to damaging the reputation of the foreign ministry and germany , " fischer wrote in an internal memo . dw-world.de fischer snubs ex-nazi diplomats the german foreign ministry has invoked the ire of a who 's who of former german diplomats .
critics say minister joschka fischer treats diplomats who were once members of the nazi party shabbily .

during the 1998 world cup in france , for example , german hooligans beat up a french policeman , leaving him with permanent brain damage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a belgian riot police clubs an english soccer fan in the center of charleroi on june 17 , 2000 , following clashes between german and english hooligans ahead of the euro 2000 soccer match england versus germany .
the violence in celje over the weekend was the worst outbreak of german hooliganism since the 2000 european championships , when england played germany in charleroi , belgium .
and , 14 months before germany plays host to the 2006 world cup , it has forced the issue of how to clamp down on fan violence back into the headlines . shock and shame everyone in the german soccer world , from the head of the world cup organizing committee , franz beckenbauer , to dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder , to german national team coach jürgen klinsmann , has proclaimed their shock and shame at what happened in slovenia . " it 's our shame , " said mayer-vorfelder , who was also attacked as he left the stadium following the german team 's 1-0 victory .
" it 's a very , very sad matter . " " as hosts of the world cup , this has cast us in a bad light , " said klinsmann .
" it 's a shame that a few rioters were able to use an international match as a platform for their mindless and dangerous actions . " german officials said they were aware that between 200 and 250 known troublemakers were in celje and had warned local authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer " the cooperation between german and slovenian authorities clearly did n't work well , " said beckenbauer .
" i 'm sure german security officials warned the slovenians about the troublemakers .
they must have thought things wouldn ’ t be so bad . " in total , police in slovenia arrested 52 hooligans , 40 of whom were germans . efforts largely successful german efforts to get tough on soccer hooligans have largely been effective in recent years .
typically , when there 's reason to suspect violence will erupt , german police bar fans with violent records from leaving the country .
known hooligans are obliged to check in with their local police every day during an event such as the european championships and are given special stamps in their passports .
additionally , the dfb uses a screening process when selling tickets to german fans . the match in slovenia , however , was not sold out , meaning that german fans not screened by the dfb were able to buy tickets the day of the game in celje , german officials said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fans , not hooligans the story of portugal soccer 's chronic plague , hooliganism , was little more than a footnote at the european soccer championships in portugal this year .

"
the new , but controversial , method of calculating will shave 0.6 to 0.9 percentage points off the deficit rations of the three former communist states , kager said , putting them within the limit of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- required by the maastricht treaty for a country adopting the euro .

during the 1998 world cup in france , for example , german hooligans beat up a french policeman , leaving him with permanent brain damage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a belgian riot police clubs an english soccer fan in the center of charleroi on june 17 , 2000 , following clashes between german and english hooligans ahead of the euro 2000 soccer match england versus germany .
the violence in celje over the weekend was the worst outbreak of german hooliganism since the 2000 european championships , when england played germany in charleroi , belgium .
and , 14 months before germany plays host to the 2006 world cup , it has forced the issue of how to clamp down on fan violence back into the headlines . shock and shame everyone in the german soccer world , from the head of the world cup organizing committee , franz beckenbauer , to dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder , to german national team coach jürgen klinsmann , has proclaimed their shock and shame at what happened in slovenia . " it 's our shame , " said mayer-vorfelder , who was also attacked as he left the stadium following the german team 's 1-0 victory .
" it 's a very , very sad matter . " " as hosts of the world cup , this has cast us in a bad light , " said klinsmann .
" it 's a shame that a few rioters were able to use an international match as a platform for their mindless and dangerous actions . " german officials said they were aware that between 200 and 250 known troublemakers were in celje and had warned local authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer " the cooperation between german and slovenian authorities clearly did n't work well , " said beckenbauer .
" i 'm sure german security officials warned the slovenians about the troublemakers .
they must have thought things wouldn ’ t be so bad . " in total , police in slovenia arrested 52 hooligans , 40 of whom were germans . efforts largely successful german efforts to get tough on soccer hooligans have largely been effective in recent years .
typically , when there 's reason to suspect violence will erupt , german police bar fans with violent records from leaving the country .
known hooligans are obliged to check in with their local police every day during an event such as the european championships and are given special stamps in their passports .
additionally , the dfb uses a screening process when selling tickets to german fans . the match in slovenia , however , was not sold out , meaning that german fans not screened by the dfb were able to buy tickets the day of the game in celje , german officials said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fans , not hooligans the story of portugal soccer 's chronic plague , hooliganism , was little more than a footnote at the european soccer championships in portugal this year .
organizers say more effective measures and a new fan culture are the reasons .

"
the new , but controversial , method of calculating will shave 0.6 to 0.9 percentage points off the deficit rations of the three former communist states , kager said , putting them within the limit of 3.0 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- required by the maastricht treaty for a country adopting the euro . " slovakia 's chance of joining the euro zone in 2009 is assured .
poland and hungary , which were aiming for 2010 , can now also set 2009 as their target , " a ba-ca report published last monday said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- right -rrb- and foreign minister joschka fischer during a press conference at the end of an eu summit at which leaders approved watering down the rules that underpin the stability of the euro .
following the agreement , which has raised the hackles of eu central bankers , poland and hungary can hope to bring their deficits down to 2.8 percent of gdp , instead of 3.7 and 3.4 percent respectively , while slovakia can achieve 2.3 percent instead of the forecast 3.0 percent , ba-ca predicted . hungary on euro track last week , hungarian finance minister tibor draskovics welcomed the changes to the stability pact , saying that they would enable his country to remain on track to adopt the euro by 2010 . in january , the european commission initiated an " excessive deficit procedure " against hungary for failing to rein in its public finances . " with the modifications of the stability pact , hungary could emerge sooner from the excessive deficit procedure and is more certain than before to stay on track for the adoption of the euro , " he said . poland sets hopes on 2009 his polish counterpart , moroslaw gronicki , said that the reforms would help warsaw to enter the euro zone by 2009 . " the situation is better that it was a few months ago .
we have a chance of avoiding excessive deficit procedures against poland in 2007 , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish economist marcin mroz , an analyst at french bank societe generale in warsaw , told afp : " the reforms have opened a window of opportunity for poland to reverse a situation which would otherwise have delayed its adoption of the euro by two years . " but analysts pointed out that the public deficit was only one of the criteria for joining the euro zone . " inflation could still pose a serious problem in countries like hungary , slovakia and slovenia , " kager said , while mroz warned poland to pay heed in this regard . all these countries have higher inflation that the 2.5 percent currently required by maastricht . " it is an obstacle but one that can be overcome .
it is easier to cut inflation and interest rates -lrb- another maastricht condition -rrb- in the long run than to reduce the deficit , " kager said . furthermore , all the 10 new member states of the eu complied with the requirement of having debt below 60 percent of gdp , the analysts pointed out . ba-ca said of all former east bloc states that joined the eu last year , only the czech republic looked set to exceed the 3.0-percent limit and therefore seems unlikely to join the euro zone before 2010 . prague has not undertaken pension reforms and the czechs are forecast to have a deficit of 3.3 percent of gdp two years from now . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : burying the euro stability pact eu finance ministers have agreed to reform the rules underpinning the euro .
but in doing so , the floodgates have been opened for reinterpreting the regulations meant to ensure budgetary discipline and a stable currency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 28.03.2005 german hooligans taint slovenian friendly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenian police arrest a soccer fan during the violence in celje a " friendly " weekend soccer match between germany and slovenia quickly turned sour as before , during and after the game , german fans participated in racist violence , prompting fears of a revival of hooliganism . the german soccer association , dfb , was quick to apologize to slovenia for the german fans who smashed the windows of cars and shops , shouted racist slogans , and got into fist fights with police and locals in the slovenian city of celje , but the damage was already done . the images of german hooligans running riot brought back memories of violent scenes during the 1980s and 1990s .
during the 1998 world cup in france , for example , german hooligans beat up a french policeman , leaving him with permanent brain damage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a belgian riot police clubs an english soccer fan in the center of charleroi on june 17 , 2000 , following clashes between german and english hooligans ahead of the euro 2000 soccer match england versus germany .
the violence in celje over the weekend was the worst outbreak of german hooliganism since the 2000 european championships , when england played germany in charleroi , belgium .
and , 14 months before germany plays host to the 2006 world cup , it has forced the issue of how to clamp down on fan violence back into the headlines . shock and shame everyone in the german soccer world , from the head of the world cup organizing committee , franz beckenbauer , to dfb president gerhard mayer-vorfelder , to german national team coach jürgen klinsmann , has proclaimed their shock and shame at what happened in slovenia . " it 's our shame , " said mayer-vorfelder , who was also attacked as he left the stadium following the german team 's 1-0 victory .
" it 's a very , very sad matter . " " as hosts of the world cup , this has cast us in a bad light , " said klinsmann .
" it 's a shame that a few rioters were able to use an international match as a platform for their mindless and dangerous actions . " german officials said they were aware that between 200 and 250 known troublemakers were in celje and had warned local authorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer " the cooperation between german and slovenian authorities clearly did n't work well , " said beckenbauer .
" i 'm sure german security officials warned the slovenians about the troublemakers .
they must have thought things wouldn ’ t be so bad . " in total , police in slovenia arrested 52 hooligans , 40 of whom were germans . efforts largely successful german efforts to get tough on soccer hooligans have largely been effective in recent years .
typically , when there 's reason to suspect violence will erupt , german police bar fans with violent records from leaving the country .
known hooligans are obliged to check in with their local police every day during an event such as the european championships and are given special stamps in their passports .
additionally , the dfb uses a screening process when selling tickets to german fans . the match in slovenia , however , was not sold out , meaning that german fans not screened by the dfb were able to buy tickets the day of the game in celje , german officials said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fans , not hooligans the story of portugal soccer 's chronic plague , hooliganism , was little more than a footnote at the european soccer championships in portugal this year .
organizers say more effective measures and a new fan culture are the reasons .
-lrb- july 3 , 2004 -rrb- police gear up for euro 2004 the european soccer championships in portugal this summer will host the largest security operation ever in the history of the game .

fife police said victims were being sent fake e-mails offering a " second chance " to buy goods .
this gives unsuccessful bidders goods if the winning bid falls through .
but officers have received dozens of complaints from customers in the past two weeks who have used the second chance and then received nothing .
the force 's computer crime unit said fraudsters behind the scam were sending e-mails which appeared to be from ebay , but directed shoppers to a fake website to collect their bank details and take their money . "
my advice would be never to send credit card details as a result of an e-mail request " insp alex harkness officers urged people to beware if they were asked anything unusual and contact the company or the police if they became suspicious .
the practice is commonly known in computer circles as " phishing " , due to the speculative and indiscriminate targeting of many computers .
a number of e-mails have been received by fife residents , which appear to be authentic requests from sites like ebay and internet banking sites .
inspector alex harkness said : " the people who are committing these crimes are very professional .

some of the veiled schoolgirls meet regularly to discuss their strategy " french education " , declares a trim man behind a big desk , " aims to allow each person , irrespective of their religion or their community , the chance to start on an equal footing and receive the same education . "
this impassioned defence of french secularism comes from raymond scieux , headmaster of lycee eugene delacroix in drancy , a suburb northeast of paris .
for much of last year , scieux and other french headmasters , had the unenviable task of guiding staff and students through a new french law banning all conspicuous religious symbols from state schools .
the law is widely supported by the french , who regard secularism as a pillar of the republic .
no crucifixes , no skullcaps , no islamic headscarves .
there can now be nothing within the walls of a state school that can immediately identify a religious affiliation .
dispute raymond scieux sees no place for religion in french schools from the beginning , the french law was perceived by most of france 's five million muslims to be an ill-concealed attempt to ban veils from the classroom .
" there 's a lot of tension in the islamic community which feels targeted , " scieux admits , " but it 's actually applicable to all religions " .
between may and october of last year , the bbc filmed at lycee eugene delacroix with people from both sides of the debate .
teachers , their headmaster and pupils were caught up in an emotional drama that would ultimately decide whether or not a handful of veiled girls would be expelled for wearing the islamic headscarf in school .
personal choice " what does this veil mean to me ? " asks touria , a softly-spoken and serious pupil at delacroix .
" it 's part of who i am .
it 's not just some bit of fabric on my head .
it 's everything .
people say that it 's the women who wear the veil that are submissive ... but i think it is those women who are submissive touria , student " looking back on it , i ca n't imagine taking it off .
what i 'm wearing today i consider the minimum . "
what touria is wearing is a bandanna , a simple scarf that covers her hair but not her ears or neck .
she says she prefers to wear this so she does n't draw attention to herself or her religion .
touria is one of five veiled girls from delacroix who are meeting once a week in a friend 's flat to discuss their strategy to fight a strict interpretation of the law at their school .
others come to the meetings too , including a handful of anti-law teachers and non-muslim schoolfriends .
their fear is that the headmaster will decide to ban all headcoverings , so they 're looking for a compromise .
secular france the headmaster , however , is under pressure from the majority of his teachers , who want a total ban on headcoverings .
he has decided to hold a public meeting at the school term so all interested parties can air their views .
this law is here to protect those girls who are compelled to do things they do n't want to do eric finot , teacher among the speakers at the public meeting is eric finot , a history teacher at delacroix with strong views on the subject .
as he rises to speak , he says he wants to address the veiled girls in particular .
" we are only asking you to abide by the principle of secularism , " he says .
to the anger of the girls , he then adds : " we are thinking of those girls who we could maybe protect a little bit at school ...
this law is here to protect those girls who are compelled to do things they do n't want to do - not to be forced into marriage , not to wear the veil . "
separate issues for the veiled girls , the public meeting confirmed their worst fears .
the pro-law lobby was mixing everything islamic in the same pot : sharia law , forced marriage , veils .
they understood very well the feminist arguments condemning many aspects of their faith , but all of them insisted that they were under no pressure at home to wear the veil .
iptiseim -lrb- right -rrb- believes france wants to de-veil muslim girls in order to veil its problems in fact , quite the opposite .
their parents would prefer to them to de-veil than jeopardise their education .
touria adds : " people say that it 's the women who wear the veil that are submissive ... but i think it is those women who are submissive , because it is what men want , women half naked . "
as the veiled girls agonised over whether or not they would de-veil , their headmaster became convinced that a compromise was possible .
when lycee eugene delacroix opened for the new school year , it was one of the only schools in france to allow girls to wear a discreet bandanna .
but for veiled girls like iptiseim , this was not the outcome she had hoped for .
" now that i 'm wearing a bandanna in school , " she says , " when i come out i ca n't wait to put my veil back on .
it was always important , but now even more so . "
the headmaster and the headscarves was broadcast in the uk on tuesday , 29 march , 2005 at 2100 bst on bbc two .

touria is one of five veiled girls from delacroix who are meeting once a week in a friend 's flat to discuss their strategy to fight a strict interpretation of the law at their school .
others come to the meetings too , including a handful of anti-law teachers and non-muslim schoolfriends .
their fear is that the headmaster will decide to ban all headcoverings , so they 're looking for a compromise .
secular france the headmaster , however , is under pressure from the majority of his teachers , who want a total ban on headcoverings .
he has decided to hold a public meeting at the school term so all interested parties can air their views .
this law is here to protect those girls who are compelled to do things they do n't want to do eric finot , teacher among the speakers at the public meeting is eric finot , a history teacher at delacroix with strong views on the subject .
as he rises to speak , he says he wants to address the veiled girls in particular .
" we are only asking you to abide by the principle of secularism , " he says .
to the anger of the girls , he then adds : " we are thinking of those girls who we could maybe protect a little bit at school ...
this law is here to protect those girls who are compelled to do things they do n't want to do - not to be forced into marriage , not to wear the veil . "
separate issues for the veiled girls , the public meeting confirmed their worst fears .
the pro-law lobby was mixing everything islamic in the same pot : sharia law , forced marriage , veils .
they understood very well the feminist arguments condemning many aspects of their faith , but all of them insisted that they were under no pressure at home to wear the veil .
iptiseim -lrb- right -rrb- believes france wants to de-veil muslim girls in order to veil its problems in fact , quite the opposite .
their parents would prefer to them to de-veil than jeopardise their education .
touria adds : " people say that it 's the women who wear the veil that are submissive ... but i think it is those women who are submissive , because it is what men want , women half naked . "
as the veiled girls agonised over whether or not they would de-veil , their headmaster became convinced that a compromise was possible .
when lycee eugene delacroix opened for the new school year , it was one of the only schools in france to allow girls to wear a discreet bandanna .
but for veiled girls like iptiseim , this was not the outcome she had hoped for .
" now that i 'm wearing a bandanna in school , " she says , " when i come out i ca n't wait to put my veil back on .
it was always important , but now even more so . "
the headmaster and the headscarves was broadcast in the uk on tuesday , 29 march , 2005 at 2100 bst on bbc two .

what i 'm wearing today i consider the minimum . "
what touria is wearing is a bandanna , a simple scarf that covers her hair but not her ears or neck .
she says she prefers to wear this so she does n't draw attention to herself or her religion .
touria is one of five veiled girls from delacroix who are meeting once a week in a friend 's flat to discuss their strategy to fight a strict interpretation of the law at their school .
others come to the meetings too , including a handful of anti-law teachers and non-muslim schoolfriends .
their fear is that the headmaster will decide to ban all headcoverings , so they 're looking for a compromise .
secular france the headmaster , however , is under pressure from the majority of his teachers , who want a total ban on headcoverings .
he has decided to hold a public meeting at the school term so all interested parties can air their views . "
this law is here to protect those girls who are compelled to do things they do n't want to do " eric finot , teacher among the speakers at the public meeting is eric finot , a history teacher at delacroix with strong views on the subject .
as he rises to speak , he says he wants to address the veiled girls in particular .
" we are only asking you to abide by the principle of secularism , " he says .
to the anger of the girls , he then adds : " we are thinking of those girls who we could maybe protect a little bit at school ...
this law is here to protect those girls who are compelled to do things they do n't want to do - not to be forced into marriage , not to wear the veil . "
separate issues for the veiled girls , the public meeting confirmed their worst fears .
the pro-law lobby was mixing everything islamic in the same pot : sharia law , forced marriage , veils .
they understood very well the feminist arguments condemning many aspects of their faith , but all of them insisted that they were under no pressure at home to wear the veil .
in fact , quite the opposite .
their parents would prefer to them to de-veil than jeopardise their education .
touria adds : " people say that it 's the women who wear the veil that are submissive ... but i think it is those women who are submissive , because it is what men want , women half naked . "
as the veiled girls agonised over whether or not they would de-veil , their headmaster became convinced that a compromise was possible .
when lycee eugene delacroix opened for the new school year , it was one of the only schools in france to allow girls to wear a discreet bandanna .
but for veiled girls like iptiseim , this was not the outcome she had hoped for .
" now that i 'm wearing a bandanna in school , " she says , " when i come out i ca n't wait to put my veil back on .
it was always important , but now even more so . "
the headmaster and the headscarves was broadcast in the uk on tuesday , 29 march , 2005 at 2100 bst on bbc two .

bbc eurasia analyst malcolm haslett explains the background to the discontent .
what have the protests been all about ?
the protests were triggered by two things - the disbarment of a number of opposition candidates just before the recent parliamentary elections , and the apparent " promotion " of akayev 's family at that election .
both his son and daughter won seats .
but the longer term background was the growing disenchantment of the kyrgyz intellectual and political elite .
most of the opposition leaders are former allies of mr akayev who for one reason or another fell out with the president .
they accuse him of an increasing centralisation of power , in the pattern of a number of other post-soviet republics .
who is likely to take charge ?
kurmanbek bakiev , former prime minister , has been declared acting president .
he has said elections for a formal successor to mr akayev will take place in june .
for the moment , there is a power struggle taking place between the old parliament - in charge before the recent parliamentary elections - and the new one , which some people feel has been discredited by the way those elections were held .
the osce is trying to resolve the dispute .
it is not yet clear who will stand in the presidential elections .
there are a number of opposition leaders , including mr bakiev , who may be contenders .
these include the former security minister and bishkek mayor felix kulov , who was released from prison following the storming of the white house , and who has been given his old portfolio back for now .
mr kulov was genuinely popular in the capital , and was jailed on what many believe were trumped up -lrb- or at least exaggerated -rrb- charges of misuse of power .
so is there a risk the old guard will take over ?
it may look like the return of the old guard .
but there is at least the possibility that the opposition leaders have learned from mr akayev 's mistakes and will try to build a genuine relationship with the public at large , and not just use old traditional clan structures and patrimony .
have the protests been influenced by events in georgia and ukraine ?
events in ukraine and georgia certainly provided a spur for those in kyrgyzstan dissatisfied with the government .
suddenly it was no longer impossible to dislodge well-entrenched regimes by popular protest .
but the kyrgyz opposition faced a different situation , and there is evidence that the kyrgyz protests have been more spontaneous and less organised than those in ukraine and georgia .
one big question now is to what degree the opposition leaders can control and channel the obvious anger of demonstrators .
what are the chances of other central asian leaders being overthrown ?
it is really too early to speculate about the effect on neighbouring republics .
certainly the authorities in neighbouring uzbekistan , kazakhstan and tajikistan will be very worried by what has happened .
does kyrgyzstan matter ?
is it strategically important ?
there are both us and russian air bases in kyrgyzstan .
kyrgyzstan was one of the two central asian states -lrb- the other is uzbekistan -rrb- to offer the us a base during the build-up for the anti-taleban war in afghanistan .
and the us and its allies are still there .
russia , afraid of the possible loss of its influence in a country which moscow sees as in ' its sphere of influence ' asked to set up its own air base only 40km from the us one .
so both countries have a very big interest in what goes on in bishkek .
mr akayev was generally seen as pro-russian , the opposition is partly ' pro-western ' , but there are a lot of kyrgyz who do not like either foreign base .

the protests were triggered by two things - the disbarment of a number of opposition candidates just before the recent parliamentary elections , and the apparent " promotion " of akayev 's family at that election .
both his son and daughter won seats .
but the longer term background was the growing disenchantment of the kyrgyz intellectual and political elite .
most of the opposition leaders are former allies of mr akayev who for one reason or another fell out with the president .
they accuse him of an increasing centralisation of power , in the pattern of a number of other post-soviet republics .
who is likely to take charge ?
kurmanbek bakiev , former prime minister , has been declared acting president .
he has said elections for a formal successor to mr akayev will take place in june .
for the moment , there is a power struggle taking place between the old parliament - in charge before the recent parliamentary elections - and the new one , which some people feel has been discredited by the way those elections were held .
the osce is trying to resolve the dispute .
it is not yet clear who will stand in the presidential elections .
there are a number of opposition leaders , including mr bakiev , who may be contenders .
these include the former security minister and bishkek mayor felix kulov , who was released from prison following the storming of the white house , and who has been given his old portfolio back for now .
mr kulov was genuinely popular in the capital , and was jailed on what many believe were trumped up -lrb- or at least exaggerated -rrb- charges of misuse of power .
so is there a risk the old guard will take over ?
it may look like the return of the old guard .
but there is at least the possibility that the opposition leaders have learned from mr akayev 's mistakes and will try to build a genuine relationship with the public at large , and not just use old traditional clan structures and patrimony .
have the protests been influenced by events in georgia and ukraine ?
events in ukraine and georgia certainly provided a spur for those in kyrgyzstan dissatisfied with the government .
suddenly it was no longer impossible to dislodge well-entrenched regimes by popular protest .
but the kyrgyz opposition faced a different situation , and there is evidence that the kyrgyz protests have been more spontaneous and less organised than those in ukraine and georgia .
one big question now is to what degree the opposition leaders can control and channel the obvious anger of demonstrators .
what are the chances of other central asian leaders being overthrown ?
it is really too early to speculate about the effect on neighbouring republics .
certainly the authorities in neighbouring uzbekistan , kazakhstan and tajikistan will be very worried by what has happened .
does kyrgyzstan matter ?
is it strategically important ?
there are both us and russian air bases in kyrgyzstan .
kyrgyzstan was one of the two central asian states -lrb- the other is uzbekistan -rrb- to offer the us a base during the build-up for the anti-taleban war in afghanistan .
and the us and its allies are still there .
russia , afraid of the possible loss of its influence in a country which moscow sees as in ' its sphere of influence ' asked to set up its own air base only 40km from the us one .
so both countries have a very big interest in what goes on in bishkek .
mr akayev was generally seen as pro-russian , the opposition is partly ' pro-western ' , but there are a lot of kyrgyz who do not like either foreign base .

that is where his family is , and they still rely heavily on the $ 150 he sends them each week .
" they use this money for their daily consumption , for their necessities , " mr villalobos says .
money sent home by mexicans working abroad has become an efficient weapon in the country 's war against poverty , and not only at grassroots level .
development projects in mr villalobos ' home state of zacatecas receive support from the mexican migrant association he is a member of - the zacatecan federation of southern california .
in fact , remittances have become a vital source of income for the mexican economy as a whole .
last year , mexicans abroad sent back $ 16.6bn -lrb- £ 8.9bn -rrb- , making it the second largest source of income after oil .
that is up on $ 13.3bn a year earlier , confirming an upward trend seen across the developing world , where the importance of remittances is growing every year , and not only from rich to poor countries .
" remittances is not only a phenomena of fund flows from the developed countries into the underdeveloped ones , although this is what has been mostly described and documented , " points out bolivian academic maria del pilar ramirez .
government money mexico 's government is keen to channel the cash into public projects , such as improving the country 's infrastructure , or to support health and education projects .
to do so , the government is backing the so-called 3x1 initiative , under which every $ 1 injected by migrants is matched by a further $ 3 by local , state and federal governments .
the government hopes the initiative , which was originally conceived by returning migrants , will aid impoverished states , in particular zacatecas , jalisco and michoacan .
but according to the world bank there are problems .
much of the money sent back ends up in the coffers of fee-charging financiers ; then once it arrives it is spent in inefficient ways .
to alleviate this , the world bank has established a remittances programme that works with financial institutions to reduce the cost of sending money for migrants .
" it is important to bring the local financial system closer to the people who receive the money abroad , " explains pedro de vasconcelos , remittances coordinator , inter-american development bank .
commercial banks , eager to attract the migrant workers as customers , have responded well .
in january , bank of america said it would eliminate the fees for some customers who send money to mexico , while in june last year citigroup created a bi-national credit card that could be used by mexican migrants and their families or friends in mexico .
clever spending the world bank is also keen to ensure recipients take better advantage of the cash once they have received it .
" we do n't tell them where or how to invest the money they receive , but it is desirable that they have more options , " says mr de vasconcelos .
one way to make better use of the money would be to find a way of defining it as a safe monthly income which could help improve the credit rating of the recipients and thus aid the development of small businesses .
money laundering but while pushing costs down and removing red tape might be a force for development , it has also raised concerns that the system can be abused by criminals .
the us state department insists an identification card issued by the mexican consular offices for their citizens in the us , known as a matricula consular , is all it takes to carry out a money transfer .
" the rapid movement of such vast sums of money by persons of questionable identity leaves the new money transfer systems open to potential money laundering and exploitation by organised crime groups , " according to the us state department .
moreover , " reliance on remittances from the us is not a viable economic policy because this only increases dependence on the us and delays mexico 's full participation in the global economy " , according to the us ambassador to mexico , tony garza .

every year , millions of mexicans travel to the us to work that is where his family is , and they still rely heavily on the $ 150 he sends them each week .
" they use this money for their daily consumption , for their necessities , " mr villalobos says .
money sent home by mexicans working abroad has become an efficient weapon in the country 's war against poverty , and not only at grassroots level .
development projects in mr villalobos ' home state of zacatecas receive support from the mexican migrant association he is a member of - the zacatecan federation of southern california .
in fact , remittances have become a vital source of income for the mexican economy as a whole .
last year , mexicans abroad sent back $ 16.6bn -lrb- £ 8.9bn -rrb- , making it the second largest source of income after oil .
that is up on $ 13.3bn a year earlier , confirming an upward trend seen across the developing world , where the importance of remittances is growing every year , and not only from rich to poor countries .
" remittances is not only a phenomena of fund flows from the developed countries into the underdeveloped ones , although this is what has been mostly described and documented , " points out bolivian academic maria del pilar ramirez .
government money mexico 's government is keen to channel the cash into public projects , such as improving the country 's infrastructure , or to support health and education projects .
to do so , the government is backing the so-called 3x1 initiative , under which every $ 1 injected by migrants is matched by a further $ 3 by local , state and federal governments .
several financial institutions have responded well the government hopes the initiative , which was originally conceived by returning migrants , will aid impoverished states , in particular zacatecas , jalisco and michoacan .
but according to the world bank there are problems .
much of the money sent back ends up in the coffers of fee-charging financiers ; then once it arrives it is spent in inefficient ways .
to alleviate this , the world bank has established a remittances programme that works with financial institutions to reduce the cost of sending money for migrants .
" it is important to bring the local financial system closer to the people who receive the money abroad , " explains pedro de vasconcelos , remittances coordinator , inter-american development bank .
commercial banks , eager to attract the migrant workers as customers , have responded well .
in january , bank of america said it would eliminate the fees for some customers who send money to mexico , while in june last year citigroup created a bi-national credit card that could be used by mexican migrants and their families or friends in mexico .
clever spending the world bank is also keen to ensure recipients take better advantage of the cash once they have received it .
" we do n't tell them where or how to invest the money they receive , but it is desirable that they have more options , " says mr de vasconcelos .
one way to make better use of the money would be to find a way of defining it as a safe monthly income which could help improve the credit rating of the recipients and thus aid the development of small businesses .
money laundering but while pushing costs down and removing red tape might be a force for development , it has also raised concerns that the system can be abused by criminals .
money from abroad help develop many mexican communities the us state department insists an identification card issued by the mexican consular offices for their citizens in the us , known as a matricula consular , is all it takes to carry out a money transfer .
" the rapid movement of such vast sums of money by persons of questionable identity leaves the new money transfer systems open to potential money laundering and exploitation by organised crime groups , " according to the us state department .
moreover , " reliance on remittances from the us is not a viable economic policy because this only increases dependence on the us and delays mexico 's full participation in the global economy " , according to the us ambassador to mexico , tony garza .
