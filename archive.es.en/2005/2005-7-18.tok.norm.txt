no charges were pressed against him . the court found that the eu arrest warrant offered insufficient legal protection for german citizens and must now be implemented in accordance with a new german law that allows review by german judges of all extradition orders . prison releases expected the ruling will mean that all german citizens being held for extradition within the eu must be released until a new legislation is passed .
darkazanli is expected to be freed from a jail in the northern city of hamburg later monday . the court said an eu extradition order could be rejected in the future when , for example , a domestic probe failed to produce criminal charges against the suspect . germany only introduced a law against aiding and abetting a foreign terrorist organization in august 2002 , although supporting a domestic terror group has been illegal since 1976 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european arrest warrant is out of synch with the german law since the eu arrest warrant was passed in the wake of the sept .

darkazanli , 46 , was released from custody in hamburg a few hours later and climbed into a taxi without commenting . spain accuses him of being osama bin laden 's " permanent interlocutor and assistant " in europe and having provided the al qaeda network with logistical and financial support between 1997 and 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister brigitte zypries german justice minister brigitte zypries condemned the karlsruhe-based court 's decision as " another setback for the german government in the fight against international terrorism . " a spokesman for eu justice commissioner franco frattini said the decision was bad news for europe 's efforts to combat terrorism - which have again come under the spotlight since the july 7 attacks in london - but insisted it was up to germany to make the arrest warrant work . " the efficiency of the eu arrest warrant as such is not called into question , but it 's a matter of the german implementation law , " said friso roscam abbing . darkazanli was pictured on a 1999 wedding video alongside marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah , two of the suicide pilots in the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on the united states .
german authorities investigated darkazanli for several months after the attacks but never charged him . he was eventually detained in germany in october last year on an arrest warrant issued by high-profile spanish judge baltasar garzon .
but darkazanli 's lawyers argued that germans may be expelled and tried abroad only when the crimes they are accused of are not subject to prosecution at home . the government 's anger at the decision to free darkazanli reflects tensions between the authorities and the justice system over the prosecution in germany of suspects linked to the september 11 , 2001 attacks . several setbacks a moroccan man , mounir el motassadeq , who is accused of involvement in the attacks , is currently nearing the end of his retrial in hamburg .
motassadeq was sentenced in february 2003 to the maximum 15 years in prison on charges of membership of a terrorist organization and more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder for his alleged role in the so-called " hamburg cell " run by the lead september 11 hijacker , mohammed atta . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi , left , and mounir el motassadeq , right but a federal tribunal overturned the conviction and ordered a new trial .
a verdict is expected august 19 .
and another moroccan national , abdelghani mzoudi , who was tried on the same charges as motassadeq , was acquitted last october for lack of evidence . the karlsruhe-based federal court found that the new eu arrest warrant offered insufficient legal protection for german citizens and must now be implemented with a new german law that allows all extradition orders to be reviewed by german judges . the ruling will mean that all german citizens being held for extradition within the eu must be released until the new legislation is passed .
since the eu arrest warrant was passed in the wake of the september 11 attacks and implemented in august 2004 , at least 19 germans have been extradited to other eu member states for offences including drug dealing , child abuse and even nazi war crimes . investigators suspect darkazanli befriended al-shehhi , jarrah and atta in hamburg where they were studying .

bets are on that german president horst köhler will dissolve parliament and call for an early general election in september .
his decision will come this week in a tv broadcast . köhler has until july 22 to make the high-stakes decision about whether to approve or reject chancellor gerhard schröder 's scheme of prompting a national poll one year ahead of schedule . according to a report in der spiegel , köhler intends to make his decision known in a television broadcast .
but will it be a case of history repeating itself ? twenty-two years ago on jan .
7 , 1983 , then president karl carstens appeared on television to announce he was dissolving parliament .
the elections that followed cemented the 16-year rule of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- under helmut kohl . the word from insiders is that köhler has already internally signalled his readiness to call new elections .
if he does , he 'll be in step with opinions of the majority of german citizens .
in a forsa poll commissioned by the bild am sonntag , 75 percent of germans are in favor of an early election in september . schröder 's will bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earlier this month , schröder deliberately lost a no-confidence vote before parliament , in the hopes that a new election would secure him a renewed mandate for his reform agenda and silence critics within his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . meanwhile his challenger angela merkel , the first female chancellor candidate , is flying high in the polls and mobilizing her christian union bloc for a battle over who can pull germany out of its protracted economic slump . schröder gave an impassioned speech before parliament july 1 outlining his reasons for seeking a new mandate following a poll drubbing in may in the spd heartland of north rhine-westphalia , the country 's most populous state . " on may 22 , the question arose as to whether , with this election result , my policies and i are still fully able to function , " he said , describing the political gridlock he said had gripped the country and the shaky state of his center-left coalition with the greens party . immediately afterwards , he went to köhler to ask him to bring the election forward . spd with most to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel on the campaign trail , here visiting german bundeswehr soldiers in the town of prizren , kosovo on friday , july 15 , 2005 .
seeking guidance in his decision , which could still face a constitutional court challenge , köhler asked schröder to provide more evidence of his claim that he no longer enjoys the secure backing of his coalition . he replied last week with a 200-page dossier his spokesman bela anda said provided " a documentation of the difficulties of implementing his government program . " although most observers and all the main political parties expect köhler to grant schröder 's request and order new elections , an opinion poll released thursday indicated that the chancellor could have the most to lose . his social democrats scored just 27 percent versus 42 percent for merkel 's cdu / csu , according to the infratest dimap institute based on a survey conducted july 12-13 . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early german elections in legal limbo germany 's ruling coalition may have purposely lost a confidence vote to trigger early elections , but the country 's president or supreme court could yet kibosh the hopes of both politicians and the public for a new poll .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.07.2005 a swan song for german folk music ? 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heino wants to leave before the party 's over two icons of the german-speaking popular folk music scene are retiring this year : heino and karl moik .
what will their departure mean for the future of this genre ? after more than 50 years on stage , heino shocked the folk music world last month by announcing his retirement .
the platinum-blond singer with his trademark dark glasses is one of the most successful german recording artists , selling over 50 million records worldwide . at the same time , the famous folk music television show " musikantenstadl " informed host karl moik that it was not renewing his contract .
unofficially , the 67-year-old is being " sorted out " and will most likely be replaced with someone younger . one might think that the departures of these old stars could be part of a push to give folk music a younger face - and consequently , younger followers .
but stefan kahé , spokesman for record label koch universal , which holds a 70 percent market share in this sector , said it was simply a normal development . " it 's basically something very natural to retire , " said kahé . letting the sun in there are certainly enough young stars waiting to follow in heino 's and moik 's footsteps , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie hertel and stefan mross have been a couple professionally and privately for years the young dream couple of folk music , singer stefanie hertel and trumpeter stefan mross , have become extremely popular over the past few years . günter tolar , head of the working group for promoting musical entertainment in austria arge , which organizes the annual folk music competition " grand prix der volksmusik , " said heino and moik had been role models for a long time . " but one ca n't overlook what huge shadows such ' greats ' cast , which block the sun for the subsequent generation , " said tolar , a former presenter for austrian television channel orf . still , age was not the issue here .
" whether an interpreter is popular and attracts viewers doesn ’ t depend on their youth , but rather charisma and what message they are communicating in their songs , " said tolar . music with traditional ties many people may find it difficult to understand the long running popularity of folk music .
but it is a central element of german-speaking culture in europe . " folk music is not just a marginal phenomenon of music , " said dr. gisela probst-effah from the institute for musical folklore at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mountain landscape relates the feeling of an ideal world this genre mostly involves newly composed or adaptations of traditional music and songs .
they often generate regional associations , like yodeling , or contain texts with a hint of dialect and are preferably presented in a rural idyll in traditional costumes , like dirndls or lederhosen . " this look gives the appearance of ties to tradition , timelessness and independence from changing fashions , " said probst-effah . according to kahé , popular folk music is precisely about passing on tradition . " it 's about something preserving , something conservative , " he said . the concept of an " ideal world " also plays a role .
" these songs deal with topics like nature , heimat , happy love or an idealized childhood in an ideal world with intact social relationships , " said probst-effah . " i portray the ideal world in my songs because i want to have an ideal world , " heino has said in interviews .
" but it was clear to me that i would never get the nobel prize for my lyrics . "
heino said he is retiring to spend time with this wife , who suffered a heart attack last year . the media 's strong influence figures by the german association of the phonographic industry showed that last year , german pop schlager and folk music made up for 9.8 percent of the total sales of 1.75 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.19 billion -rrb- on the german market .
in comparison , pop music was responsible for 38.8 percent of sales , and rock for 18.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : folk music duo maria und margot hellwig have appeared in television shows for years but while these sales figures appear marginal , popular folk music 's true success lies in its media presence .
this genre would not be what it is without the media , in particular highly commercialized folk music shows on television .
programs such as " musikantenstadl " reach millions of viewers . while there may not be such a strong trend towards younger recording stars , there is " a changing of the guard " in the media sector , said kahé . mross , 29 , hosts a weekly show on german public television .
florian silbereisen , who started his career at age 10 playing the accordion on " musikantenstadl , " is now a regular presenter of various folk music shows .
at 24 , he is the youngest show master on german television . " you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening . " despite these young stars on screen , the viewers are mainly older .
according to the german music information center in bonn , over 40 percent of those who buy schlager and popular folk music recordings are over the age of 50 .
the average age of viewers of folk music shows are around 60 years old , said tolar . " still , older people would also like to have something nice to look at , " said kahé . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl moik is known to be outspoken at times in poor taste .
his calling italians " spaghetti gluttons " in a show was not received well moik presented " musikantenstadl " - which means " musician 's barn " - for the past 25 years .
it is one of the most popular folk music television shows , and not just in the german-speaking world . " musikantenstadl " has also given guest performances in non-german speaking cities , including moscow , toronto , cape town , beijing and dubai . moik said his show was aimed at older people . " the young public goes to the disco on saturday nights , " moik told the austrian paper kleine zeitung .
" we 're a show for people over 40 .
i am not going to do a show for 17-year-olds .
i 'm too old for that . " moik said he doubted whether a younger presenter could attract younger viewers . " no , you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening , " he said .
" you ca n't get it younger , not even with a younger host .

what will their departure mean for the future of this genre ? after more than 50 years on stage , heino shocked the folk music world last month by announcing his retirement .
the platinum-blond singer with his trademark dark glasses is one of the most successful german recording artists , selling over 50 million records worldwide . at the same time , the famous folk music television show " musikantenstadl " informed host karl moik that it was not renewing his contract .
unofficially , the 67-year-old is being " sorted out " and will most likely be replaced with someone younger . one might think that the departures of these old stars could be part of a push to give folk music a younger face - and consequently , younger followers .
but stefan kahé , spokesman for record label koch universal , which holds a 70 percent market share in this sector , said it was simply a normal development . " it 's basically something very natural to retire , " said kahé . letting the sun in there are certainly enough young stars waiting to follow in heino 's and moik 's footsteps , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie hertel and stefan mross have been a couple professionally and privately for years the young dream couple of folk music , singer stefanie hertel and trumpeter stefan mross , have become extremely popular over the past few years . günter tolar , head of the working group for promoting musical entertainment in austria arge , which organizes the annual folk music competition " grand prix der volksmusik , " said heino and moik had been role models for a long time . " but one ca n't overlook what huge shadows such ' greats ' cast , which block the sun for the subsequent generation , " said tolar , a former presenter for austrian television channel orf . still , age was not the issue here .
" whether an interpreter is popular and attracts viewers doesn ’ t depend on their youth , but rather charisma and what message they are communicating in their songs , " said tolar . music with traditional ties many people may find it difficult to understand the long running popularity of folk music .
but it is a central element of german-speaking culture in europe . " folk music is not just a marginal phenomenon of music , " said dr. gisela probst-effah from the institute for musical folklore at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mountain landscape relates the feeling of an ideal world this genre mostly involves newly composed or adaptations of traditional music and songs .
they often generate regional associations , like yodeling , or contain texts with a hint of dialect and are preferably presented in a rural idyll in traditional costumes , like dirndls or lederhosen . " this look gives the appearance of ties to tradition , timelessness and independence from changing fashions , " said probst-effah . according to kahé , popular folk music is precisely about passing on tradition . " it 's about something preserving , something conservative , " he said . the concept of an " ideal world " also plays a role .
" these songs deal with topics like nature , heimat , happy love or an idealized childhood in an ideal world with intact social relationships , " said probst-effah . " i portray the ideal world in my songs because i want to have an ideal world , " heino has said in interviews .
" but it was clear to me that i would never get the nobel prize for my lyrics . "
heino said he is retiring to spend time with this wife , who suffered a heart attack last year . the media 's strong influence figures by the german association of the phonographic industry showed that last year , german pop schlager and folk music made up for 9.8 percent of the total sales of 1.75 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.19 billion -rrb- on the german market .
in comparison , pop music was responsible for 38.8 percent of sales , and rock for 18.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : folk music duo maria und margot hellwig have appeared in television shows for years but while these sales figures appear marginal , popular folk music 's true success lies in its media presence .
this genre would not be what it is without the media , in particular highly commercialized folk music shows on television .
programs such as " musikantenstadl " reach millions of viewers . while there may not be such a strong trend towards younger recording stars , there is " a changing of the guard " in the media sector , said kahé . mross , 29 , hosts a weekly show on german public television .
florian silbereisen , who started his career at age 10 playing the accordion on " musikantenstadl , " is now a regular presenter of various folk music shows .
at 24 , he is the youngest show master on german television . " you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening . " despite these young stars on screen , the viewers are mainly older .
according to the german music information center in bonn , over 40 percent of those who buy schlager and popular folk music recordings are over the age of 50 .
the average age of viewers of folk music shows are around 60 years old , said tolar . " still , older people would also like to have something nice to look at , " said kahé . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl moik is known to be outspoken at times in poor taste .
his calling italians " spaghetti gluttons " in a show was not received well moik presented " musikantenstadl " - which means " musician 's barn " - for the past 25 years .
it is one of the most popular folk music television shows , and not just in the german-speaking world . " musikantenstadl " has also given guest performances in non-german speaking cities , including moscow , toronto , cape town , beijing and dubai . moik said his show was aimed at older people . " the young public goes to the disco on saturday nights , " moik told the austrian paper kleine zeitung .
" we 're a show for people over 40 .
i am not going to do a show for 17-year-olds .
i 'm too old for that . " moik said he doubted whether a younger presenter could attract younger viewers . " no , you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening , " he said .

fifteen years later , movie houses in europe are still fighting for survival . at the rex art-house cinema in bonn , a handful of film enthusiasts have gathered for the opening of the french film " l 'équipier . "
it 's a film about the relation between three people in a small coastal town in brittany .
it 's light on special effects star power , and it 's a film that wo n't run in most big cinemas outside of france , since it 's not designed for today 's mass market .

still , for many cinema operators in europe , like rex manager dieter hertel , the decision to carry a good percentage of european movies is n't entirely because of the eu money they guarantee . " the quality of a film is the most important aspect for me , " he said .

" cinemas which show european and smaller films , which perhaps are n't as well known , have to really work hard to get people into the theaters , " said cornelia hammelmann , who works with the eu 's film support project in germany .
" that is exactly what we are trying to do with the media program . " she decides which movie theater or which film in germany gets money from the media funds .

all over europe , theaters are reporting falling box office returns , and not just for smaller european movies .
german ticket sales are down 20 percent compared to the first six months of last year , with italy and spain registering double figure declines .
hertel used to be able to use the eu money for advertising .
now he needs it just to survive .
" this year will be the first time that we 'll be absolutely dependent on these subsidies , " he said .

what will their departure mean for the future of this genre ? after more than 50 years on stage , heino shocked the folk music world last month by announcing his retirement .
the platinum-blond singer with his trademark dark glasses is one of the most successful german recording artists , selling over 50 million records worldwide . at the same time , the famous folk music television show " musikantenstadl " informed host karl moik that it was not renewing his contract .
unofficially , the 67-year-old is being " sorted out " and will most likely be replaced with someone younger . one might think that the departures of these old stars could be part of a push to give folk music a younger face - and consequently , younger followers .
but stefan kahé , spokesman for record label koch universal , which holds a 70 percent market share in this sector , said it was simply a normal development . " it 's basically something very natural to retire , " said kahé . letting the sun in there are certainly enough young stars waiting to follow in heino 's and moik 's footsteps , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie hertel and stefan mross have been a couple professionally and privately for years the young dream couple of folk music , singer stefanie hertel and trumpeter stefan mross , have become extremely popular over the past few years . günter tolar , head of the working group for promoting musical entertainment in austria arge , which organizes the annual folk music competition " grand prix der volksmusik , " said heino and moik had been role models for a long time . " but one ca n't overlook what huge shadows such ' greats ' cast , which block the sun for the subsequent generation , " said tolar , a former presenter for austrian television channel orf . still , age was not the issue here .
" whether an interpreter is popular and attracts viewers doesn ’ t depend on their youth , but rather charisma and what message they are communicating in their songs , " said tolar . music with traditional ties many people may find it difficult to understand the long running popularity of folk music .
but it is a central element of german-speaking culture in europe . " folk music is not just a marginal phenomenon of music , " said dr. gisela probst-effah from the institute for musical folklore at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mountain landscape relates the feeling of an ideal world this genre mostly involves newly composed or adaptations of traditional music and songs .
they often generate regional associations , like yodeling , or contain texts with a hint of dialect and are preferably presented in a rural idyll in traditional costumes , like dirndls or lederhosen . " this look gives the appearance of ties to tradition , timelessness and independence from changing fashions , " said probst-effah . according to kahé , popular folk music is precisely about passing on tradition . " it 's about something preserving , something conservative , " he said . the concept of an " ideal world " also plays a role .
" these songs deal with topics like nature , heimat , happy love or an idealized childhood in an ideal world with intact social relationships , " said probst-effah . " i portray the ideal world in my songs because i want to have an ideal world , " heino has said in interviews .
" but it was clear to me that i would never get the nobel prize for my lyrics . "
heino said he is retiring to spend time with this wife , who suffered a heart attack last year . the media 's strong influence figures by the german association of the phonographic industry showed that last year , german pop schlager and folk music made up for 9.8 percent of the total sales of 1.75 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.19 billion -rrb- on the german market .
in comparison , pop music was responsible for 38.8 percent of sales , and rock for 18.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : folk music duo maria und margot hellwig have appeared in television shows for years but while these sales figures appear marginal , popular folk music 's true success lies in its media presence .
this genre would not be what it is without the media , in particular highly commercialized folk music shows on television .
programs such as " musikantenstadl " reach millions of viewers . while there may not be such a strong trend towards younger recording stars , there is " a changing of the guard " in the media sector , said kahé . mross , 29 , hosts a weekly show on german public television .
florian silbereisen , who started his career at age 10 playing the accordion on " musikantenstadl , " is now a regular presenter of various folk music shows .
at 24 , he is the youngest show master on german television . " you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening . " despite these young stars on screen , the viewers are mainly older .
according to the german music information center in bonn , over 40 percent of those who buy schlager and popular folk music recordings are over the age of 50 .
the average age of viewers of folk music shows are around 60 years old , said tolar . " still , older people would also like to have something nice to look at , " said kahé . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl moik is known to be outspoken at times in poor taste .
his calling italians " spaghetti gluttons " in a show was not received well moik presented " musikantenstadl " - which means " musician 's barn " - for the past 25 years .
it is one of the most popular folk music television shows , and not just in the german-speaking world . " musikantenstadl " has also given guest performances in non-german speaking cities , including moscow , toronto , cape town , beijing and dubai . moik said his show was aimed at older people . " the young public goes to the disco on saturday nights , " moik told the austrian paper kleine zeitung .
" we 're a show for people over 40 .
i am not going to do a show for 17-year-olds .
i 'm too old for that . " moik said he doubted whether a younger presenter could attract younger viewers . " no , you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening , " he said .

what will their departure mean for the future of this genre ? after more than 50 years on stage , heino shocked the folk music world last month by announcing his retirement .
the platinum-blond singer with his trademark dark glasses is one of the most successful german recording artists , selling over 50 million records worldwide . at the same time , the famous folk music television show " musikantenstadl " informed host karl moik that it was not renewing his contract .
unofficially , the 67-year-old is being " sorted out " and will most likely be replaced with someone younger . one might think that the departures of these old stars could be part of a push to give folk music a younger face - and consequently , younger followers .
but stefan kahé , spokesman for record label koch universal , which holds a 70 percent market share in this sector , said it was simply a normal development . " it 's basically something very natural to retire , " said kahé . letting the sun in there are certainly enough young stars waiting to follow in heino 's and moik 's footsteps , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie hertel and stefan mross have been a couple professionally and privately for years the young dream couple of folk music , singer stefanie hertel and trumpeter stefan mross , have become extremely popular over the past few years . günter tolar , head of the working group for promoting musical entertainment in austria arge , which organizes the annual folk music competition " grand prix der volksmusik , " said heino and moik had been role models for a long time . " but one ca n't overlook what huge shadows such ' greats ' cast , which block the sun for the subsequent generation , " said tolar , a former presenter for austrian television channel orf . still , age was not the issue here .
" whether an interpreter is popular and attracts viewers doesn ’ t depend on their youth , but rather charisma and what message they are communicating in their songs , " said tolar . music with traditional ties many people may find it difficult to understand the long running popularity of folk music .
but it is a central element of german-speaking culture in europe . " folk music is not just a marginal phenomenon of music , " said dr. gisela probst-effah from the institute for musical folklore at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mountain landscape relates the feeling of an ideal world this genre mostly involves newly composed or adaptations of traditional music and songs .
they often generate regional associations , like yodeling , or contain texts with a hint of dialect and are preferably presented in a rural idyll in traditional costumes , like dirndls or lederhosen . " this look gives the appearance of ties to tradition , timelessness and independence from changing fashions , " said probst-effah . according to kahé , popular folk music is precisely about passing on tradition . " it 's about something preserving , something conservative , " he said . the concept of an " ideal world " also plays a role .
" these songs deal with topics like nature , heimat , happy love or an idealized childhood in an ideal world with intact social relationships , " said probst-effah . " i portray the ideal world in my songs because i want to have an ideal world , " heino has said in interviews .
" but it was clear to me that i would never get the nobel prize for my lyrics . "
heino said he is retiring to spend time with this wife , who suffered a heart attack last year . the media 's strong influence figures by the german association of the phonographic industry showed that last year , german pop schlager and folk music made up for 9.8 percent of the total sales of 1.75 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.19 billion -rrb- on the german market .
in comparison , pop music was responsible for 38.8 percent of sales , and rock for 18.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : folk music duo maria und margot hellwig have appeared in television shows for years but while these sales figures appear marginal , popular folk music 's true success lies in its media presence .
this genre would not be what it is without the media , in particular highly commercialized folk music shows on television .
programs such as " musikantenstadl " reach millions of viewers . while there may not be such a strong trend towards younger recording stars , there is " a changing of the guard " in the media sector , said kahé . mross , 29 , hosts a weekly show on german public television .
florian silbereisen , who started his career at age 10 playing the accordion on " musikantenstadl , " is now a regular presenter of various folk music shows .
at 24 , he is the youngest show master on german television . " you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening . " despite these young stars on screen , the viewers are mainly older .
according to the german music information center in bonn , over 40 percent of those who buy schlager and popular folk music recordings are over the age of 50 .
the average age of viewers of folk music shows are around 60 years old , said tolar . " still , older people would also like to have something nice to look at , " said kahé . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl moik is known to be outspoken at times in poor taste .
his calling italians " spaghetti gluttons " in a show was not received well moik presented " musikantenstadl " - which means " musician 's barn " - for the past 25 years .
it is one of the most popular folk music television shows , and not just in the german-speaking world . " musikantenstadl " has also given guest performances in non-german speaking cities , including moscow , toronto , cape town , beijing and dubai . moik said his show was aimed at older people . " the young public goes to the disco on saturday nights , " moik told the austrian paper kleine zeitung .
" we 're a show for people over 40 .
i am not going to do a show for 17-year-olds .
i 'm too old for that . " moik said he doubted whether a younger presenter could attract younger viewers . " no , you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening , " he said .
" you ca n't get it younger , not even with a younger host .

darkazanli , 46 , was released from custody in hamburg a few hours later and climbed into a taxi without commenting . spain accuses him of being osama bin laden 's " permanent interlocutor and assistant " in europe and having provided the al qaeda network with logistical and financial support between 1997 and 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister brigitte zypries german justice minister brigitte zypries condemned the karlsruhe-based court 's decision as " another setback for the german government in the fight against international terrorism .

german authorities investigated darkazanli for several months after the attacks but never charged him . he was eventually detained in germany in october last year on an arrest warrant issued by high-profile spanish judge baltasar garzon .
but darkazanli 's lawyers argued that germans may be expelled and tried abroad only when the crimes they are accused of are not subject to prosecution at home . the government 's anger at the decision to free darkazanli reflects tensions between the authorities and the justice system over the prosecution in germany of suspects linked to the september 11 , 2001 attacks . several setbacks a moroccan man , mounir el motassadeq , who is accused of involvement in the attacks , is currently nearing the end of his retrial in hamburg .

darkazanli , 46 , was released from custody in hamburg a few hours later and climbed into a taxi without commenting . spain accuses him of being osama bin laden 's " permanent interlocutor and assistant " in europe and having provided the al qaeda network with logistical and financial support between 1997 and 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister brigitte zypries german justice minister brigitte zypries condemned the karlsruhe-based court 's decision as " another setback for the german government in the fight against international terrorism .

german authorities investigated darkazanli for several months after the attacks but never charged him . he was eventually detained in germany in october last year on an arrest warrant issued by high-profile spanish judge baltasar garzon .

since the eu arrest warrant was passed in the wake of the september 11 attacks and implemented in august 2004 , at least 19 germans have been extradited to other eu member states for offences including drug dealing , child abuse and even nazi war crimes . investigators suspect darkazanli befriended al-shehhi , jarrah and atta in hamburg where they were studying .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.07.2005 a swan song for german folk music ? 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heino wants to leave before the party 's over two icons of the german-speaking popular folk music scene are retiring this year : heino and karl moik .
what will their departure mean for the future of this genre ? after more than 50 years on stage , heino shocked the folk music world last month by announcing his retirement .
the platinum-blond singer with his trademark dark glasses is one of the most successful german recording artists , selling over 50 million records worldwide . at the same time , the famous folk music television show " musikantenstadl " informed host karl moik that it was not renewing his contract .
unofficially , the 67-year-old is being " sorted out " and will most likely be replaced with someone younger . one might think that the departures of these old stars could be part of a push to give folk music a younger face - and consequently , younger followers .
but stefan kahé , spokesman for record label koch universal , which holds a 70 percent market share in this sector , said it was simply a normal development . " it 's basically something very natural to retire , " said kahé . letting the sun in there are certainly enough young stars waiting to follow in heino 's and moik 's footsteps , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie hertel and stefan mross have been a couple professionally and privately for years the young dream couple of folk music , singer stefanie hertel and trumpeter stefan mross , have become extremely popular over the past few years . günter tolar , head of the working group for promoting musical entertainment in austria arge , which organizes the annual folk music competition " grand prix der volksmusik , " said heino and moik had been role models for a long time . " but one ca n't overlook what huge shadows such ' greats ' cast , which block the sun for the subsequent generation , " said tolar , a former presenter for austrian television channel orf . still , age was not the issue here .
" whether an interpreter is popular and attracts viewers doesn ’ t depend on their youth , but rather charisma and what message they are communicating in their songs , " said tolar . music with traditional ties many people may find it difficult to understand the long running popularity of folk music .
but it is a central element of german-speaking culture in europe . " folk music is not just a marginal phenomenon of music , " said dr. gisela probst-effah from the institute for musical folklore at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mountain landscape relates the feeling of an ideal world this genre mostly involves newly composed or adaptations of traditional music and songs .
they often generate regional associations , like yodeling , or contain texts with a hint of dialect and are preferably presented in a rural idyll in traditional costumes , like dirndls or lederhosen . " this look gives the appearance of ties to tradition , timelessness and independence from changing fashions , " said probst-effah . according to kahé , popular folk music is precisely about passing on tradition . " it 's about something preserving , something conservative , " he said . the concept of an " ideal world " also plays a role .
" these songs deal with topics like nature , heimat , happy love or an idealized childhood in an ideal world with intact social relationships , " said probst-effah . " i portray the ideal world in my songs because i want to have an ideal world , " heino has said in interviews .
" but it was clear to me that i would never get the nobel prize for my lyrics . "
heino said he is retiring to spend time with this wife , who suffered a heart attack last year . the media 's strong influence figures by the german association of the phonographic industry showed that last year , german pop schlager and folk music made up for 9.8 percent of the total sales of 1.75 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.19 billion -rrb- on the german market .
in comparison , pop music was responsible for 38.8 percent of sales , and rock for 18.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : folk music duo maria und margot hellwig have appeared in television shows for years but while these sales figures appear marginal , popular folk music 's true success lies in its media presence .
this genre would not be what it is without the media , in particular highly commercialized folk music shows on television .
programs such as " musikantenstadl " reach millions of viewers . while there may not be such a strong trend towards younger recording stars , there is " a changing of the guard " in the media sector , said kahé . mross , 29 , hosts a weekly show on german public television .
florian silbereisen , who started his career at age 10 playing the accordion on " musikantenstadl , " is now a regular presenter of various folk music shows .
at 24 , he is the youngest show master on german television . " you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening . " despite these young stars on screen , the viewers are mainly older .
according to the german music information center in bonn , over 40 percent of those who buy schlager and popular folk music recordings are over the age of 50 .
the average age of viewers of folk music shows are around 60 years old , said tolar . " still , older people would also like to have something nice to look at , " said kahé . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl moik is known to be outspoken at times in poor taste .
his calling italians " spaghetti gluttons " in a show was not received well moik presented " musikantenstadl " - which means " musician 's barn " - for the past 25 years .
it is one of the most popular folk music television shows , and not just in the german-speaking world . " musikantenstadl " has also given guest performances in non-german speaking cities , including moscow , toronto , cape town , beijing and dubai . moik said his show was aimed at older people . " the young public goes to the disco on saturday nights , " moik told the austrian paper kleine zeitung .
" we 're a show for people over 40 .
i am not going to do a show for 17-year-olds .
i 'm too old for that . " moik said he doubted whether a younger presenter could attract younger viewers . " no , you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening , " he said .
" you ca n't get it younger , not even with a younger host .

" it 's basically something very natural to retire , " said kahé . letting the sun in there are certainly enough young stars waiting to follow in heino 's and moik 's footsteps , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie hertel and stefan mross have been a couple professionally and privately for years the young dream couple of folk music , singer stefanie hertel and trumpeter stefan mross , have become extremely popular over the past few years . günter tolar , head of the working group for promoting musical entertainment in austria arge , which organizes the annual folk music competition " grand prix der volksmusik , " said heino and moik had been role models for a long time . " but one ca n't overlook what huge shadows such ' greats ' cast , which block the sun for the subsequent generation , " said tolar , a former presenter for austrian television channel orf . still , age was not the issue here .
" whether an interpreter is popular and attracts viewers doesn ’ t depend on their youth , but rather charisma and what message they are communicating in their songs , " said tolar . music with traditional ties many people may find it difficult to understand the long running popularity of folk music .
but it is a central element of german-speaking culture in europe . " folk music is not just a marginal phenomenon of music , " said dr. gisela probst-effah from the institute for musical folklore at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mountain landscape relates the feeling of an ideal world this genre mostly involves newly composed or adaptations of traditional music and songs .
they often generate regional associations , like yodeling , or contain texts with a hint of dialect and are preferably presented in a rural idyll in traditional costumes , like dirndls or lederhosen . " this look gives the appearance of ties to tradition , timelessness and independence from changing fashions , " said probst-effah . according to kahé , popular folk music is precisely about passing on tradition . " it 's about something preserving , something conservative , " he said . the concept of an " ideal world " also plays a role .
" these songs deal with topics like nature , heimat , happy love or an idealized childhood in an ideal world with intact social relationships , " said probst-effah . " i portray the ideal world in my songs because i want to have an ideal world , " heino has said in interviews .
" but it was clear to me that i would never get the nobel prize for my lyrics . "
heino said he is retiring to spend time with this wife , who suffered a heart attack last year . the media 's strong influence figures by the german association of the phonographic industry showed that last year , german pop schlager and folk music made up for 9.8 percent of the total sales of 1.75 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.19 billion -rrb- on the german market .
in comparison , pop music was responsible for 38.8 percent of sales , and rock for 18.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : folk music duo maria und margot hellwig have appeared in television shows for years but while these sales figures appear marginal , popular folk music 's true success lies in its media presence .
this genre would not be what it is without the media , in particular highly commercialized folk music shows on television .
programs such as " musikantenstadl " reach millions of viewers . while there may not be such a strong trend towards younger recording stars , there is " a changing of the guard " in the media sector , said kahé . mross , 29 , hosts a weekly show on german public television .
florian silbereisen , who started his career at age 10 playing the accordion on " musikantenstadl , " is now a regular presenter of various folk music shows .
at 24 , he is the youngest show master on german television . " you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening . " despite these young stars on screen , the viewers are mainly older .
according to the german music information center in bonn , over 40 percent of those who buy schlager and popular folk music recordings are over the age of 50 .
the average age of viewers of folk music shows are around 60 years old , said tolar . " still , older people would also like to have something nice to look at , " said kahé . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl moik is known to be outspoken at times in poor taste .
his calling italians " spaghetti gluttons " in a show was not received well moik presented " musikantenstadl " - which means " musician 's barn " - for the past 25 years .
it is one of the most popular folk music television shows , and not just in the german-speaking world . " musikantenstadl " has also given guest performances in non-german speaking cities , including moscow , toronto , cape town , beijing and dubai . moik said his show was aimed at older people . " the young public goes to the disco on saturday nights , " moik told the austrian paper kleine zeitung .
" we 're a show for people over 40 .
i am not going to do a show for 17-year-olds .

back to first page back 2/2 the importance of folk music kahé said the significance of popular folk music for all age groups should n't be underestimated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boy 's choir from tölz in bavaria has achieved worldwide fame " in southern germany , austria or the german-speaking parts of switzerland , this is serious music and older cultures in the villages cultivate it , " said kahé .
" many young people listen to it there , too . " in austria , popular folk music is in the top ten and sometimes even reached number one , with gold and platinum records , he added . " folk music is one of the most significant forms of entertainment in rural areas and this is where the next generation comes from , " said tolar .
but , he added , the artists don ’ t change the music . " they sing what the songwriters write for them or what the producers give them to interpret , " said tolar .
" but the singers are very significant as carriers , as they attract the public . " folk music will remain successful tolar said he found folk music 's popularity to be waning .
" a few stars , a few producers and a few good writers have given it a certain monotony , which the public is also beginning to slowly notice , " he said . not enough was being invested in the next generation , as producers were not willing to risk high production costs with no guarantee of success , he said . " on the other side , a lot of artistic junk is being produced , " said tolar .
this was evident in competitions like " grand prix der volksmusik . " " producers send in all of their shelf warmers in the hope that one or the other might get through , " he said .
" it 's very depressing to sit in that kind of jury . " he said the public did listen very selectively and would respond to bad songs in a television show by simply switching off . kahé , though , said that popular folk music will continue to be successful . " a music that comes from tradition has something in its origins , which moves people , " said kahé .

darkazanli , 46 , was released from custody in hamburg a few hours later and climbed into a taxi without commenting . spain accuses him of being osama bin laden 's " permanent interlocutor and assistant " in europe and having provided the al qaeda network with logistical and financial support between 1997 and 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister brigitte zypries german justice minister brigitte zypries condemned the karlsruhe-based court 's decision as " another setback for the german government in the fight against international terrorism . " a spokesman for eu justice commissioner franco frattini said the decision was bad news for europe 's efforts to combat terrorism - which have again come under the spotlight since the july 7 attacks in london - but insisted it was up to germany to make the arrest warrant work . " the efficiency of the eu arrest warrant as such is not called into question , but it 's a matter of the german implementation law , " said friso roscam abbing . darkazanli was pictured on a 1999 wedding video alongside marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah , two of the suicide pilots in the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on the united states .
german authorities investigated darkazanli for several months after the attacks but never charged him . he was eventually detained in germany in october last year on an arrest warrant issued by high-profile spanish judge baltasar garzon .
but darkazanli 's lawyers argued that germans may be expelled and tried abroad only when the crimes they are accused of are not subject to prosecution at home . the government 's anger at the decision to free darkazanli reflects tensions between the authorities and the justice system over the prosecution in germany of suspects linked to the september 11 , 2001 attacks . several setbacks a moroccan man , mounir el motassadeq , who is accused of involvement in the attacks , is currently nearing the end of his retrial in hamburg .
motassadeq was sentenced in february 2003 to the maximum 15 years in prison on charges of membership of a terrorist organization and more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder for his alleged role in the so-called " hamburg cell " run by the lead september 11 hijacker , mohammed atta . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi , left , and mounir el motassadeq , right but a federal tribunal overturned the conviction and ordered a new trial .
a verdict is expected august 19 .
and another moroccan national , abdelghani mzoudi , who was tried on the same charges as motassadeq , was acquitted last october for lack of evidence . the karlsruhe-based federal court found that the new eu arrest warrant offered insufficient legal protection for german citizens and must now be implemented with a new german law that allows all extradition orders to be reviewed by german judges . the ruling will mean that all german citizens being held for extradition within the eu must be released until the new legislation is passed .
since the eu arrest warrant was passed in the wake of the september 11 attacks and implemented in august 2004 , at least 19 germans have been extradited to other eu member states for offences including drug dealing , child abuse and even nazi war crimes . investigators suspect darkazanli befriended al-shehhi , jarrah and atta in hamburg where they were studying .
darkazanli denies any terrorist activity and said he knew the three hijackers casually .

" if everything goes well , we are ready to send monitors whenever the agreement is signed , " said the spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who is expected to visit indonesia next week . the mission , which would only be sent if the parties request it , would first seek the cooperation of the association of south east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- and its members in supervising the future accord . the indonesian government and the free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- announced on sunday after the latest round of negotiations in finland that they had reached a deal to end 30 years of fighting in the separatist province .
they plan to sign a memorandum of understanding next month . both sides agreed to establish a monitoring mission to check on progress and said they hoped it would be run by the eu and a number of asian countries .
the agreement aims to bring a " peaceful , comprehensive and sustainable solution " to end a conflict that has raged in the province since 1976 and cost nearly 15,000 lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an indonesian soldier mans his position on an armored vehicle during a patrol in the provincial capital of banda aceh , aceh province , tuesday , may 20 , 2003 .

" if everything goes well , we are ready to send monitors whenever the agreement is signed , " said the spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who is expected to visit indonesia next week . the mission , which would only be sent if the parties request it , would first seek the cooperation of the association of south east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- and its members in supervising the future accord . the indonesian government and the free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- announced on sunday after the latest round of negotiations in finland that they had reached a deal to end 30 years of fighting in the separatist province .
they plan to sign a memorandum of understanding next month . both sides agreed to establish a monitoring mission to check on progress and said they hoped it would be run by the eu and a number of asian countries .
the agreement aims to bring a " peaceful , comprehensive and sustainable solution " to end a conflict that has raged in the province since 1976 and cost nearly 15,000 lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an indonesian soldier mans his position on an armored vehicle during a patrol in the provincial capital of banda aceh , aceh province , tuesday , may 20 , 2003 .
gam gave up its demand for full independence and said it would disarm , while the government has announced it will withdraw its troops from the province once the rebels hand in their weapons .
participants agreed that a peace deal had seemed unthinkable after jakarta declared martial law and launched a major military offensive in aceh two years ago . after the tsunami but renewed efforts to make peace were prompted by a need for international aid to reach aceh , which bore the brunt of last december 's tsunami .
more than 131,000 people in the province were killed . in the conclusions of their meeting on monday , the eu ministers also pledged to continue to crack down on terrorism , promised new support for afghanistan and sudan 's troubled darfur region , and renewed condemnation of uzbekistan .
they said states must " have the necessary measures , as appropriate , in place to confront this threat , be they to track terrorists down , protect potential targets , prepare for an attack or prevent people turning to terrorism . " on afghanistan , the ministers welcomed the planned deployment of an eu monitoring mission for the september 18 general elections , in conclusions from their meeting .
" the eu stands ready to continue its efforts at establishing a sustainable democratic system in afghanistan for the lasting security of the afghan people , " they said . the ministers also appointed a special representative for sudan , former finnish cooperation and development minister pekka haavisto , and adopted a " joint-action " supporting the african union mission in darfur .
they also renewed their condemnation of uzbekistan for failing to fully investigate a massacre in the east of the country on may 13 . condemnation for uzbekistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general view of a rally in downtown andijan on friday , may 13 , 2005 .

bets are on that german president horst köhler will dissolve parliament and call for an early general election in september .
his decision will come this week in a tv broadcast . köhler has until july 22 to make the high-stakes decision about whether to approve or reject chancellor gerhard schröder 's scheme of prompting a national poll one year ahead of schedule . according to a report in der spiegel , köhler intends to make his decision known in a television broadcast .
but will it be a case of history repeating itself ? twenty-two years ago on jan .
7 , 1983 , then president karl carstens appeared on television to announce he was dissolving parliament .
the elections that followed cemented the 16-year rule of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- under helmut kohl . the word from insiders is that köhler has already internally signalled his readiness to call new elections .
if he does , he 'll be in step with opinions of the majority of german citizens .
in a forsa poll commissioned by the bild am sonntag , 75 percent of germans are in favor of an early election in september . schröder 's will bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earlier this month , schröder deliberately lost a no-confidence vote before parliament , in the hopes that a new election would secure him a renewed mandate for his reform agenda and silence critics within his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . meanwhile his challenger angela merkel , the first female chancellor candidate , is flying high in the polls and mobilizing her christian union bloc for a battle over who can pull germany out of its protracted economic slump . schröder gave an impassioned speech before parliament july 1 outlining his reasons for seeking a new mandate following a poll drubbing in may in the spd heartland of north rhine-westphalia , the country 's most populous state .

back to first page back 2/2 the importance of folk music kahé said the significance of popular folk music for all age groups should n't be underestimated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boy 's choir from tölz in bavaria has achieved worldwide fame " in southern germany , austria or the german-speaking parts of switzerland , this is serious music and older cultures in the villages cultivate it , " said kahé .
" many young people listen to it there , too . " in austria , popular folk music is in the top ten and sometimes even reached number one , with gold and platinum records , he added . " folk music is one of the most significant forms of entertainment in rural areas and this is where the next generation comes from , " said tolar .
but , he added , the artists don ’ t change the music . " they sing what the songwriters write for them or what the producers give them to interpret , " said tolar .
" but the singers are very significant as carriers , as they attract the public . " folk music will remain successful tolar said he found folk music 's popularity to be waning .
" a few stars , a few producers and a few good writers have given it a certain monotony , which the public is also beginning to slowly notice , " he said . not enough was being invested in the next generation , as producers were not willing to risk high production costs with no guarantee of success , he said . " on the other side , a lot of artistic junk is being produced , " said tolar .
this was evident in competitions like " grand prix der volksmusik . " " producers send in all of their shelf warmers in the hope that one or the other might get through , " he said .
" it 's very depressing to sit in that kind of jury . " he said the public did listen very selectively and would respond to bad songs in a television show by simply switching off . kahé , though , said that popular folk music will continue to be successful . " a music that comes from tradition has something in its origins , which moves people , " said kahé .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.07.2005 a swan song for german folk music ? 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heino wants to leave before the party 's over two icons of the german-speaking popular folk music scene are retiring this year : heino and karl moik .
what will their departure mean for the future of this genre ? after more than 50 years on stage , heino shocked the folk music world last month by announcing his retirement .
the platinum-blond singer with his trademark dark glasses is one of the most successful german recording artists , selling over 50 million records worldwide . at the same time , the famous folk music television show " musikantenstadl " informed host karl moik that it was not renewing his contract .
unofficially , the 67-year-old is being " sorted out " and will most likely be replaced with someone younger . one might think that the departures of these old stars could be part of a push to give folk music a younger face - and consequently , younger followers .
but stefan kahé , spokesman for record label koch universal , which holds a 70 percent market share in this sector , said it was simply a normal development . " it 's basically something very natural to retire , " said kahé . letting the sun in there are certainly enough young stars waiting to follow in heino 's and moik 's footsteps , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie hertel and stefan mross have been a couple professionally and privately for years the young dream couple of folk music , singer stefanie hertel and trumpeter stefan mross , have become extremely popular over the past few years . günter tolar , head of the working group for promoting musical entertainment in austria arge , which organizes the annual folk music competition " grand prix der volksmusik , " said heino and moik had been role models for a long time . " but one ca n't overlook what huge shadows such ' greats ' cast , which block the sun for the subsequent generation , " said tolar , a former presenter for austrian television channel orf . still , age was not the issue here .
" whether an interpreter is popular and attracts viewers doesn ’ t depend on their youth , but rather charisma and what message they are communicating in their songs , " said tolar . music with traditional ties many people may find it difficult to understand the long running popularity of folk music .
but it is a central element of german-speaking culture in europe . " folk music is not just a marginal phenomenon of music , " said dr. gisela probst-effah from the institute for musical folklore at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mountain landscape relates the feeling of an ideal world this genre mostly involves newly composed or adaptations of traditional music and songs .
they often generate regional associations , like yodeling , or contain texts with a hint of dialect and are preferably presented in a rural idyll in traditional costumes , like dirndls or lederhosen . " this look gives the appearance of ties to tradition , timelessness and independence from changing fashions , " said probst-effah . according to kahé , popular folk music is precisely about passing on tradition . " it 's about something preserving , something conservative , " he said . the concept of an " ideal world " also plays a role .
" these songs deal with topics like nature , heimat , happy love or an idealized childhood in an ideal world with intact social relationships , " said probst-effah . " i portray the ideal world in my songs because i want to have an ideal world , " heino has said in interviews .
" but it was clear to me that i would never get the nobel prize for my lyrics . "
heino said he is retiring to spend time with this wife , who suffered a heart attack last year . the media 's strong influence figures by the german association of the phonographic industry showed that last year , german pop schlager and folk music made up for 9.8 percent of the total sales of 1.75 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.19 billion -rrb- on the german market .
in comparison , pop music was responsible for 38.8 percent of sales , and rock for 18.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : folk music duo maria und margot hellwig have appeared in television shows for years but while these sales figures appear marginal , popular folk music 's true success lies in its media presence .
this genre would not be what it is without the media , in particular highly commercialized folk music shows on television .
programs such as " musikantenstadl " reach millions of viewers . while there may not be such a strong trend towards younger recording stars , there is " a changing of the guard " in the media sector , said kahé . mross , 29 , hosts a weekly show on german public television .
florian silbereisen , who started his career at age 10 playing the accordion on " musikantenstadl , " is now a regular presenter of various folk music shows .
at 24 , he is the youngest show master on german television . " you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening . " despite these young stars on screen , the viewers are mainly older .
according to the german music information center in bonn , over 40 percent of those who buy schlager and popular folk music recordings are over the age of 50 .
the average age of viewers of folk music shows are around 60 years old , said tolar . " still , older people would also like to have something nice to look at , " said kahé . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl moik is known to be outspoken at times in poor taste .
his calling italians " spaghetti gluttons " in a show was not received well moik presented " musikantenstadl " - which means " musician 's barn " - for the past 25 years .
it is one of the most popular folk music television shows , and not just in the german-speaking world . " musikantenstadl " has also given guest performances in non-german speaking cities , including moscow , toronto , cape town , beijing and dubai . moik said his show was aimed at older people . " the young public goes to the disco on saturday nights , " moik told the austrian paper kleine zeitung .
" we 're a show for people over 40 .
i am not going to do a show for 17-year-olds .
i 'm too old for that . " moik said he doubted whether a younger presenter could attract younger viewers . " no , you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening , " he said .
" you ca n't get it younger , not even with a younger host .

what will their departure mean for the future of this genre ? after more than 50 years on stage , heino shocked the folk music world last month by announcing his retirement .
the platinum-blond singer with his trademark dark glasses is one of the most successful german recording artists , selling over 50 million records worldwide . at the same time , the famous folk music television show " musikantenstadl " informed host karl moik that it was not renewing his contract .
unofficially , the 67-year-old is being " sorted out " and will most likely be replaced with someone younger . one might think that the departures of these old stars could be part of a push to give folk music a younger face - and consequently , younger followers .
but stefan kahé , spokesman for record label koch universal , which holds a 70 percent market share in this sector , said it was simply a normal development . " it 's basically something very natural to retire , " said kahé . letting the sun in there are certainly enough young stars waiting to follow in heino 's and moik 's footsteps , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie hertel and stefan mross have been a couple professionally and privately for years the young dream couple of folk music , singer stefanie hertel and trumpeter stefan mross , have become extremely popular over the past few years . günter tolar , head of the working group for promoting musical entertainment in austria arge , which organizes the annual folk music competition " grand prix der volksmusik , " said heino and moik had been role models for a long time . " but one ca n't overlook what huge shadows such ' greats ' cast , which block the sun for the subsequent generation , " said tolar , a former presenter for austrian television channel orf . still , age was not the issue here .
" whether an interpreter is popular and attracts viewers doesn ’ t depend on their youth , but rather charisma and what message they are communicating in their songs , " said tolar . music with traditional ties many people may find it difficult to understand the long running popularity of folk music .
but it is a central element of german-speaking culture in europe . " folk music is not just a marginal phenomenon of music , " said dr. gisela probst-effah from the institute for musical folklore at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mountain landscape relates the feeling of an ideal world this genre mostly involves newly composed or adaptations of traditional music and songs .
they often generate regional associations , like yodeling , or contain texts with a hint of dialect and are preferably presented in a rural idyll in traditional costumes , like dirndls or lederhosen . " this look gives the appearance of ties to tradition , timelessness and independence from changing fashions , " said probst-effah . according to kahé , popular folk music is precisely about passing on tradition . " it 's about something preserving , something conservative , " he said . the concept of an " ideal world " also plays a role .
" these songs deal with topics like nature , heimat , happy love or an idealized childhood in an ideal world with intact social relationships , " said probst-effah . " i portray the ideal world in my songs because i want to have an ideal world , " heino has said in interviews .
" but it was clear to me that i would never get the nobel prize for my lyrics . "
heino said he is retiring to spend time with this wife , who suffered a heart attack last year . the media 's strong influence figures by the german association of the phonographic industry showed that last year , german pop schlager and folk music made up for 9.8 percent of the total sales of 1.75 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.19 billion -rrb- on the german market .
in comparison , pop music was responsible for 38.8 percent of sales , and rock for 18.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : folk music duo maria und margot hellwig have appeared in television shows for years but while these sales figures appear marginal , popular folk music 's true success lies in its media presence .
this genre would not be what it is without the media , in particular highly commercialized folk music shows on television .
programs such as " musikantenstadl " reach millions of viewers . while there may not be such a strong trend towards younger recording stars , there is " a changing of the guard " in the media sector , said kahé . mross , 29 , hosts a weekly show on german public television .
florian silbereisen , who started his career at age 10 playing the accordion on " musikantenstadl , " is now a regular presenter of various folk music shows .
at 24 , he is the youngest show master on german television . " you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening . " despite these young stars on screen , the viewers are mainly older .
according to the german music information center in bonn , over 40 percent of those who buy schlager and popular folk music recordings are over the age of 50 .
the average age of viewers of folk music shows are around 60 years old , said tolar . " still , older people would also like to have something nice to look at , " said kahé . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl moik is known to be outspoken at times in poor taste .
his calling italians " spaghetti gluttons " in a show was not received well moik presented " musikantenstadl " - which means " musician 's barn " - for the past 25 years .
it is one of the most popular folk music television shows , and not just in the german-speaking world . " musikantenstadl " has also given guest performances in non-german speaking cities , including moscow , toronto , cape town , beijing and dubai . moik said his show was aimed at older people . " the young public goes to the disco on saturday nights , " moik told the austrian paper kleine zeitung .
" we 're a show for people over 40 .
i am not going to do a show for 17-year-olds .
i 'm too old for that . " moik said he doubted whether a younger presenter could attract younger viewers . " no , you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening , " he said .

what will their departure mean for the future of this genre ? after more than 50 years on stage , heino shocked the folk music world last month by announcing his retirement .
the platinum-blond singer with his trademark dark glasses is one of the most successful german recording artists , selling over 50 million records worldwide . at the same time , the famous folk music television show " musikantenstadl " informed host karl moik that it was not renewing his contract .
unofficially , the 67-year-old is being " sorted out " and will most likely be replaced with someone younger . one might think that the departures of these old stars could be part of a push to give folk music a younger face - and consequently , younger followers .
but stefan kahé , spokesman for record label koch universal , which holds a 70 percent market share in this sector , said it was simply a normal development . " it 's basically something very natural to retire , " said kahé . letting the sun in there are certainly enough young stars waiting to follow in heino 's and moik 's footsteps , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie hertel and stefan mross have been a couple professionally and privately for years the young dream couple of folk music , singer stefanie hertel and trumpeter stefan mross , have become extremely popular over the past few years . günter tolar , head of the working group for promoting musical entertainment in austria arge , which organizes the annual folk music competition " grand prix der volksmusik , " said heino and moik had been role models for a long time . " but one ca n't overlook what huge shadows such ' greats ' cast , which block the sun for the subsequent generation , " said tolar , a former presenter for austrian television channel orf . still , age was not the issue here .
" whether an interpreter is popular and attracts viewers doesn ’ t depend on their youth , but rather charisma and what message they are communicating in their songs , " said tolar . music with traditional ties many people may find it difficult to understand the long running popularity of folk music .
but it is a central element of german-speaking culture in europe . " folk music is not just a marginal phenomenon of music , " said dr. gisela probst-effah from the institute for musical folklore at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mountain landscape relates the feeling of an ideal world this genre mostly involves newly composed or adaptations of traditional music and songs .
they often generate regional associations , like yodeling , or contain texts with a hint of dialect and are preferably presented in a rural idyll in traditional costumes , like dirndls or lederhosen . " this look gives the appearance of ties to tradition , timelessness and independence from changing fashions , " said probst-effah . according to kahé , popular folk music is precisely about passing on tradition . " it 's about something preserving , something conservative , " he said . the concept of an " ideal world " also plays a role .
" these songs deal with topics like nature , heimat , happy love or an idealized childhood in an ideal world with intact social relationships , " said probst-effah . " i portray the ideal world in my songs because i want to have an ideal world , " heino has said in interviews .
" but it was clear to me that i would never get the nobel prize for my lyrics . "
heino said he is retiring to spend time with this wife , who suffered a heart attack last year . the media 's strong influence figures by the german association of the phonographic industry showed that last year , german pop schlager and folk music made up for 9.8 percent of the total sales of 1.75 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.19 billion -rrb- on the german market .
in comparison , pop music was responsible for 38.8 percent of sales , and rock for 18.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : folk music duo maria und margot hellwig have appeared in television shows for years but while these sales figures appear marginal , popular folk music 's true success lies in its media presence .
this genre would not be what it is without the media , in particular highly commercialized folk music shows on television .
programs such as " musikantenstadl " reach millions of viewers . while there may not be such a strong trend towards younger recording stars , there is " a changing of the guard " in the media sector , said kahé . mross , 29 , hosts a weekly show on german public television .
florian silbereisen , who started his career at age 10 playing the accordion on " musikantenstadl , " is now a regular presenter of various folk music shows .
at 24 , he is the youngest show master on german television . " you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening . " despite these young stars on screen , the viewers are mainly older .
according to the german music information center in bonn , over 40 percent of those who buy schlager and popular folk music recordings are over the age of 50 .
the average age of viewers of folk music shows are around 60 years old , said tolar . " still , older people would also like to have something nice to look at , " said kahé . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl moik is known to be outspoken at times in poor taste .
his calling italians " spaghetti gluttons " in a show was not received well moik presented " musikantenstadl " - which means " musician 's barn " - for the past 25 years .

what will their departure mean for the future of this genre ? after more than 50 years on stage , heino shocked the folk music world last month by announcing his retirement .
the platinum-blond singer with his trademark dark glasses is one of the most successful german recording artists , selling over 50 million records worldwide . at the same time , the famous folk music television show " musikantenstadl " informed host karl moik that it was not renewing his contract .
unofficially , the 67-year-old is being " sorted out " and will most likely be replaced with someone younger . one might think that the departures of these old stars could be part of a push to give folk music a younger face - and consequently , younger followers .
but stefan kahé , spokesman for record label koch universal , which holds a 70 percent market share in this sector , said it was simply a normal development . " it 's basically something very natural to retire , " said kahé . letting the sun in there are certainly enough young stars waiting to follow in heino 's and moik 's footsteps , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie hertel and stefan mross have been a couple professionally and privately for years the young dream couple of folk music , singer stefanie hertel and trumpeter stefan mross , have become extremely popular over the past few years . günter tolar , head of the working group for promoting musical entertainment in austria arge , which organizes the annual folk music competition " grand prix der volksmusik , " said heino and moik had been role models for a long time . " but one ca n't overlook what huge shadows such ' greats ' cast , which block the sun for the subsequent generation , " said tolar , a former presenter for austrian television channel orf . still , age was not the issue here .
" whether an interpreter is popular and attracts viewers doesn ’ t depend on their youth , but rather charisma and what message they are communicating in their songs , " said tolar . music with traditional ties many people may find it difficult to understand the long running popularity of folk music .
but it is a central element of german-speaking culture in europe . " folk music is not just a marginal phenomenon of music , " said dr. gisela probst-effah from the institute for musical folklore at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mountain landscape relates the feeling of an ideal world this genre mostly involves newly composed or adaptations of traditional music and songs .
they often generate regional associations , like yodeling , or contain texts with a hint of dialect and are preferably presented in a rural idyll in traditional costumes , like dirndls or lederhosen . " this look gives the appearance of ties to tradition , timelessness and independence from changing fashions , " said probst-effah . according to kahé , popular folk music is precisely about passing on tradition . " it 's about something preserving , something conservative , " he said . the concept of an " ideal world " also plays a role .
" these songs deal with topics like nature , heimat , happy love or an idealized childhood in an ideal world with intact social relationships , " said probst-effah . " i portray the ideal world in my songs because i want to have an ideal world , " heino has said in interviews .
" but it was clear to me that i would never get the nobel prize for my lyrics . "
heino said he is retiring to spend time with this wife , who suffered a heart attack last year . the media 's strong influence figures by the german association of the phonographic industry showed that last year , german pop schlager and folk music made up for 9.8 percent of the total sales of 1.75 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.19 billion -rrb- on the german market .
in comparison , pop music was responsible for 38.8 percent of sales , and rock for 18.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : folk music duo maria und margot hellwig have appeared in television shows for years but while these sales figures appear marginal , popular folk music 's true success lies in its media presence .
this genre would not be what it is without the media , in particular highly commercialized folk music shows on television .
programs such as " musikantenstadl " reach millions of viewers . while there may not be such a strong trend towards younger recording stars , there is " a changing of the guard " in the media sector , said kahé . mross , 29 , hosts a weekly show on german public television .
florian silbereisen , who started his career at age 10 playing the accordion on " musikantenstadl , " is now a regular presenter of various folk music shows .
at 24 , he is the youngest show master on german television . " you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening . " despite these young stars on screen , the viewers are mainly older .
according to the german music information center in bonn , over 40 percent of those who buy schlager and popular folk music recordings are over the age of 50 .
the average age of viewers of folk music shows are around 60 years old , said tolar . " still , older people would also like to have something nice to look at , " said kahé . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl moik is known to be outspoken at times in poor taste .
his calling italians " spaghetti gluttons " in a show was not received well moik presented " musikantenstadl " - which means " musician 's barn " - for the past 25 years .
it is one of the most popular folk music television shows , and not just in the german-speaking world . " musikantenstadl " has also given guest performances in non-german speaking cities , including moscow , toronto , cape town , beijing and dubai . moik said his show was aimed at older people . " the young public goes to the disco on saturday nights , " moik told the austrian paper kleine zeitung .
" we 're a show for people over 40 .
i am not going to do a show for 17-year-olds .
i 'm too old for that . " moik said he doubted whether a younger presenter could attract younger viewers . " no , you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening , " he said .
" you ca n't get it younger , not even with a younger host .

back to first page back 2/2 the importance of folk music kahé said the significance of popular folk music for all age groups should n't be underestimated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boy 's choir from tölz in bavaria has achieved worldwide fame " in southern germany , austria or the german-speaking parts of switzerland , this is serious music and older cultures in the villages cultivate it , " said kahé .
" many young people listen to it there , too . " in austria , popular folk music is in the top ten and sometimes even reached number one , with gold and platinum records , he added . " folk music is one of the most significant forms of entertainment in rural areas and this is where the next generation comes from , " said tolar .
but , he added , the artists don ’ t change the music . " they sing what the songwriters write for them or what the producers give them to interpret , " said tolar .
" but the singers are very significant as carriers , as they attract the public . " folk music will remain successful tolar said he found folk music 's popularity to be waning .
" a few stars , a few producers and a few good writers have given it a certain monotony , which the public is also beginning to slowly notice , " he said . not enough was being invested in the next generation , as producers were not willing to risk high production costs with no guarantee of success , he said . " on the other side , a lot of artistic junk is being produced , " said tolar .
this was evident in competitions like " grand prix der volksmusik . " " producers send in all of their shelf warmers in the hope that one or the other might get through , " he said .
" it 's very depressing to sit in that kind of jury . " he said the public did listen very selectively and would respond to bad songs in a television show by simply switching off . kahé , though , said that popular folk music will continue to be successful . " a music that comes from tradition has something in its origins , which moves people , " said kahé .

what will their departure mean for the future of this genre ? after more than 50 years on stage , heino shocked the folk music world last month by announcing his retirement .
the platinum-blond singer with his trademark dark glasses is one of the most successful german recording artists , selling over 50 million records worldwide . at the same time , the famous folk music television show " musikantenstadl " informed host karl moik that it was not renewing his contract .
unofficially , the 67-year-old is being " sorted out " and will most likely be replaced with someone younger . one might think that the departures of these old stars could be part of a push to give folk music a younger face - and consequently , younger followers .
but stefan kahé , spokesman for record label koch universal , which holds a 70 percent market share in this sector , said it was simply a normal development . " it 's basically something very natural to retire , " said kahé . letting the sun in there are certainly enough young stars waiting to follow in heino 's and moik 's footsteps , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie hertel and stefan mross have been a couple professionally and privately for years the young dream couple of folk music , singer stefanie hertel and trumpeter stefan mross , have become extremely popular over the past few years . günter tolar , head of the working group for promoting musical entertainment in austria arge , which organizes the annual folk music competition " grand prix der volksmusik , " said heino and moik had been role models for a long time . " but one ca n't overlook what huge shadows such ' greats ' cast , which block the sun for the subsequent generation , " said tolar , a former presenter for austrian television channel orf . still , age was not the issue here .
" whether an interpreter is popular and attracts viewers doesn ’ t depend on their youth , but rather charisma and what message they are communicating in their songs , " said tolar . music with traditional ties many people may find it difficult to understand the long running popularity of folk music .
but it is a central element of german-speaking culture in europe . " folk music is not just a marginal phenomenon of music , " said dr. gisela probst-effah from the institute for musical folklore at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mountain landscape relates the feeling of an ideal world this genre mostly involves newly composed or adaptations of traditional music and songs .

fifteen years later , movie houses in europe are still fighting for survival . at the rex art-house cinema in bonn , a handful of film enthusiasts have gathered for the opening of the french film " l 'équipier . "
it 's a film about the relation between three people in a small coastal town in brittany .
it 's light on special effects star power , and it 's a film that wo n't run in most big cinemas outside of france , since it 's not designed for today 's mass market .
but the european union wants to ensure that such smaller , more nuanced films continue to be made . for that reason , it started a program 15 years ago to support european films , which were losing the fight against big hollywood movies . bildunterschrift : a scene from " star wars : episode iii , revenge of the sith " with their multi-million-dollar marketing budgets and crowd-pleasing stunts and stories , the americans were driving european films out of movie houses from lisbon to moscow . in 1995 , the eu 's film support program , media , extended its subsidy reach to movie theaters as well .
for the 2001 - 2005 budget period , media 's budget was 400 million euros -lrb- $ 484 million -rrb- . the prerequisite for getting the money from brussels was simple : one-third of a theater 's film program had to consist of european films .
still , for many cinema operators in europe , like rex manager dieter hertel , the decision to carry a good percentage of european movies is n't entirely because of the eu money they guarantee . " the quality of a film is the most important aspect for me , " he said .
" the bottom line is that the quality of films in europe is higher , for example , than that of films produced in america . " drawing people in since 2002 , the rex cinema has been a member of the european cinemas group , an association of european art house theaters .
the group has almost 500 members in more than 260 european cities .
more and more are joining , although european films are not exactly big money makers . " cinemas which show european and smaller films , which perhaps are n't as well known , have to really work hard to get people into the theaters , " said cornelia hammelmann , who works with the eu 's film support project in germany .
" that is exactly what we are trying to do with the media program . " she decides which movie theater or which film in germany gets money from the media funds .
according to her , the support gives theater operators the confidence , and means , to put films into their program which do n't often attract big crowds .
still , she insisted there is an interest among the general public for european film . " there is always going to be a public , for every nationality , for every subject matter , " she said .
" but it 's also important to attract younger audiences . " making it on its own ? movie theaters can receive up to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 60,500 -rrb- per year from the eu film support coffers .
about a third of media 's money goes toward financing special projects aimed at younger people , such as special showings for school groups .
young people have to be helped toward european films so that they can learn to recognize their value , according to hammelmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her goal is that , one day , movie theaters showing european movies wo n't be dependent on eu subsidies , as many today are , for their very existence .
but she admits , that day could be far away , if it ever arrives . " it would be fantastic if we could someday say that the films are successful on their own , that they are able to bring people into the theaters without our help , " she said .
" but that is not the case . " for cinema operator hertel , right now that goal looks unreachable .
last year his ticket sales declined by 12 percent .
all over europe , theaters are reporting falling box office returns , and not just for smaller european movies .
german ticket sales are down 20 percent compared to the first six months of last year , with italy and spain registering double figure declines .
hertel used to be able to use the eu money for advertising .
now he needs it just to survive .
" this year will be the first time that we 'll be absolutely dependent on these subsidies , " he said .
at least the subsidies are n't threatened .

back to first page back 2/2 the importance of folk music kahé said the significance of popular folk music for all age groups should n't be underestimated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boy 's choir from tölz in bavaria has achieved worldwide fame " in southern germany , austria or the german-speaking parts of switzerland , this is serious music and older cultures in the villages cultivate it , " said kahé .
" many young people listen to it there , too . " in austria , popular folk music is in the top ten and sometimes even reached number one , with gold and platinum records , he added . " folk music is one of the most significant forms of entertainment in rural areas and this is where the next generation comes from , " said tolar .
but , he added , the artists don ’ t change the music . " they sing what the songwriters write for them or what the producers give them to interpret , " said tolar .
" but the singers are very significant as carriers , as they attract the public . " folk music will remain successful tolar said he found folk music 's popularity to be waning .
" a few stars , a few producers and a few good writers have given it a certain monotony , which the public is also beginning to slowly notice , " he said . not enough was being invested in the next generation , as producers were not willing to risk high production costs with no guarantee of success , he said . " on the other side , a lot of artistic junk is being produced , " said tolar .
this was evident in competitions like " grand prix der volksmusik . " " producers send in all of their shelf warmers in the hope that one or the other might get through , " he said .
" it 's very depressing to sit in that kind of jury . " he said the public did listen very selectively and would respond to bad songs in a television show by simply switching off . kahé , though , said that popular folk music will continue to be successful . " a music that comes from tradition has something in its origins , which moves people , " said kahé .

still , for many cinema operators in europe , like rex manager dieter hertel , the decision to carry a good percentage of european movies is n't entirely because of the eu money they guarantee . " the quality of a film is the most important aspect for me , " he said .
" the bottom line is that the quality of films in europe is higher , for example , than that of films produced in america . " drawing people in since 2002 , the rex cinema has been a member of the european cinemas group , an association of european art house theaters .
the group has almost 500 members in more than 260 european cities .
more and more are joining , although european films are not exactly big money makers . " cinemas which show european and smaller films , which perhaps are n't as well known , have to really work hard to get people into the theaters , " said cornelia hammelmann , who works with the eu 's film support project in germany .
" that is exactly what we are trying to do with the media program . " she decides which movie theater or which film in germany gets money from the media funds .
according to her , the support gives theater operators the confidence , and means , to put films into their program which do n't often attract big crowds .
still , she insisted there is an interest among the general public for european film . " there is always going to be a public , for every nationality , for every subject matter , " she said .
" but it 's also important to attract younger audiences . " making it on its own ? movie theaters can receive up to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 60,500 -rrb- per year from the eu film support coffers .
about a third of media 's money goes toward financing special projects aimed at younger people , such as special showings for school groups .
young people have to be helped toward european films so that they can learn to recognize their value , according to hammelmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her goal is that , one day , movie theaters showing european movies wo n't be dependent on eu subsidies , as many today are , for their very existence .
but she admits , that day could be far away , if it ever arrives . " it would be fantastic if we could someday say that the films are successful on their own , that they are able to bring people into the theaters without our help , " she said .
" but that is not the case . " for cinema operator hertel , right now that goal looks unreachable .
last year his ticket sales declined by 12 percent .
all over europe , theaters are reporting falling box office returns , and not just for smaller european movies .
german ticket sales are down 20 percent compared to the first six months of last year , with italy and spain registering double figure declines .
hertel used to be able to use the eu money for advertising .
now he needs it just to survive .
" this year will be the first time that we 'll be absolutely dependent on these subsidies , " he said .
at least the subsidies are n't threatened .
the eu commission has proposed that the media budget be doubled to one billion euros for the 2007 - 2013 period . silvia oster -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de where movie money meets euro talent the european film market may not have as much glitz or glamour as the rest of the berlinale , but it 's an important event where european filmmakers meet the people who can potentially guide them towards the red carpet .

what will their departure mean for the future of this genre ? after more than 50 years on stage , heino shocked the folk music world last month by announcing his retirement .
the platinum-blond singer with his trademark dark glasses is one of the most successful german recording artists , selling over 50 million records worldwide . at the same time , the famous folk music television show " musikantenstadl " informed host karl moik that it was not renewing his contract .
unofficially , the 67-year-old is being " sorted out " and will most likely be replaced with someone younger . one might think that the departures of these old stars could be part of a push to give folk music a younger face - and consequently , younger followers .
but stefan kahé , spokesman for record label koch universal , which holds a 70 percent market share in this sector , said it was simply a normal development . " it 's basically something very natural to retire , " said kahé . letting the sun in there are certainly enough young stars waiting to follow in heino 's and moik 's footsteps , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie hertel and stefan mross have been a couple professionally and privately for years the young dream couple of folk music , singer stefanie hertel and trumpeter stefan mross , have become extremely popular over the past few years . günter tolar , head of the working group for promoting musical entertainment in austria arge , which organizes the annual folk music competition " grand prix der volksmusik , " said heino and moik had been role models for a long time . " but one ca n't overlook what huge shadows such ' greats ' cast , which block the sun for the subsequent generation , " said tolar , a former presenter for austrian television channel orf . still , age was not the issue here .
" whether an interpreter is popular and attracts viewers doesn ’ t depend on their youth , but rather charisma and what message they are communicating in their songs , " said tolar . music with traditional ties many people may find it difficult to understand the long running popularity of folk music .
but it is a central element of german-speaking culture in europe . " folk music is not just a marginal phenomenon of music , " said dr. gisela probst-effah from the institute for musical folklore at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mountain landscape relates the feeling of an ideal world this genre mostly involves newly composed or adaptations of traditional music and songs .
they often generate regional associations , like yodeling , or contain texts with a hint of dialect and are preferably presented in a rural idyll in traditional costumes , like dirndls or lederhosen . " this look gives the appearance of ties to tradition , timelessness and independence from changing fashions , " said probst-effah . according to kahé , popular folk music is precisely about passing on tradition . " it 's about something preserving , something conservative , " he said . the concept of an " ideal world " also plays a role .
" these songs deal with topics like nature , heimat , happy love or an idealized childhood in an ideal world with intact social relationships , " said probst-effah . " i portray the ideal world in my songs because i want to have an ideal world , " heino has said in interviews .
" but it was clear to me that i would never get the nobel prize for my lyrics . "
heino said he is retiring to spend time with this wife , who suffered a heart attack last year . the media 's strong influence figures by the german association of the phonographic industry showed that last year , german pop schlager and folk music made up for 9.8 percent of the total sales of 1.75 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.19 billion -rrb- on the german market .
in comparison , pop music was responsible for 38.8 percent of sales , and rock for 18.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : folk music duo maria und margot hellwig have appeared in television shows for years but while these sales figures appear marginal , popular folk music 's true success lies in its media presence .
this genre would not be what it is without the media , in particular highly commercialized folk music shows on television .
programs such as " musikantenstadl " reach millions of viewers . while there may not be such a strong trend towards younger recording stars , there is " a changing of the guard " in the media sector , said kahé . mross , 29 , hosts a weekly show on german public television .
florian silbereisen , who started his career at age 10 playing the accordion on " musikantenstadl , " is now a regular presenter of various folk music shows .
at 24 , he is the youngest show master on german television . " you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening . " despite these young stars on screen , the viewers are mainly older .
according to the german music information center in bonn , over 40 percent of those who buy schlager and popular folk music recordings are over the age of 50 .
the average age of viewers of folk music shows are around 60 years old , said tolar . " still , older people would also like to have something nice to look at , " said kahé . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl moik is known to be outspoken at times in poor taste .
his calling italians " spaghetti gluttons " in a show was not received well moik presented " musikantenstadl " - which means " musician 's barn " - for the past 25 years .
it is one of the most popular folk music television shows , and not just in the german-speaking world . " musikantenstadl " has also given guest performances in non-german speaking cities , including moscow , toronto , cape town , beijing and dubai . moik said his show was aimed at older people . " the young public goes to the disco on saturday nights , " moik told the austrian paper kleine zeitung .
" we 're a show for people over 40 .

what will their departure mean for the future of this genre ? after more than 50 years on stage , heino shocked the folk music world last month by announcing his retirement .
the platinum-blond singer with his trademark dark glasses is one of the most successful german recording artists , selling over 50 million records worldwide . at the same time , the famous folk music television show " musikantenstadl " informed host karl moik that it was not renewing his contract .
unofficially , the 67-year-old is being " sorted out " and will most likely be replaced with someone younger . one might think that the departures of these old stars could be part of a push to give folk music a younger face - and consequently , younger followers .
but stefan kahé , spokesman for record label koch universal , which holds a 70 percent market share in this sector , said it was simply a normal development . " it 's basically something very natural to retire , " said kahé . letting the sun in there are certainly enough young stars waiting to follow in heino 's and moik 's footsteps , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie hertel and stefan mross have been a couple professionally and privately for years the young dream couple of folk music , singer stefanie hertel and trumpeter stefan mross , have become extremely popular over the past few years . günter tolar , head of the working group for promoting musical entertainment in austria arge , which organizes the annual folk music competition " grand prix der volksmusik , " said heino and moik had been role models for a long time . " but one ca n't overlook what huge shadows such ' greats ' cast , which block the sun for the subsequent generation , " said tolar , a former presenter for austrian television channel orf . still , age was not the issue here .
" whether an interpreter is popular and attracts viewers doesn ’ t depend on their youth , but rather charisma and what message they are communicating in their songs , " said tolar . music with traditional ties many people may find it difficult to understand the long running popularity of folk music .
but it is a central element of german-speaking culture in europe . " folk music is not just a marginal phenomenon of music , " said dr. gisela probst-effah from the institute for musical folklore at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mountain landscape relates the feeling of an ideal world this genre mostly involves newly composed or adaptations of traditional music and songs .
they often generate regional associations , like yodeling , or contain texts with a hint of dialect and are preferably presented in a rural idyll in traditional costumes , like dirndls or lederhosen . " this look gives the appearance of ties to tradition , timelessness and independence from changing fashions , " said probst-effah . according to kahé , popular folk music is precisely about passing on tradition . " it 's about something preserving , something conservative , " he said . the concept of an " ideal world " also plays a role .
" these songs deal with topics like nature , heimat , happy love or an idealized childhood in an ideal world with intact social relationships , " said probst-effah . " i portray the ideal world in my songs because i want to have an ideal world , " heino has said in interviews .
" but it was clear to me that i would never get the nobel prize for my lyrics . "
heino said he is retiring to spend time with this wife , who suffered a heart attack last year . the media 's strong influence figures by the german association of the phonographic industry showed that last year , german pop schlager and folk music made up for 9.8 percent of the total sales of 1.75 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.19 billion -rrb- on the german market .
in comparison , pop music was responsible for 38.8 percent of sales , and rock for 18.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : folk music duo maria und margot hellwig have appeared in television shows for years but while these sales figures appear marginal , popular folk music 's true success lies in its media presence .
this genre would not be what it is without the media , in particular highly commercialized folk music shows on television .
programs such as " musikantenstadl " reach millions of viewers . while there may not be such a strong trend towards younger recording stars , there is " a changing of the guard " in the media sector , said kahé . mross , 29 , hosts a weekly show on german public television .
florian silbereisen , who started his career at age 10 playing the accordion on " musikantenstadl , " is now a regular presenter of various folk music shows .
at 24 , he is the youngest show master on german television . " you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening . " despite these young stars on screen , the viewers are mainly older .
according to the german music information center in bonn , over 40 percent of those who buy schlager and popular folk music recordings are over the age of 50 .
the average age of viewers of folk music shows are around 60 years old , said tolar . " still , older people would also like to have something nice to look at , " said kahé . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl moik is known to be outspoken at times in poor taste .
his calling italians " spaghetti gluttons " in a show was not received well moik presented " musikantenstadl " - which means " musician 's barn " - for the past 25 years .
it is one of the most popular folk music television shows , and not just in the german-speaking world . " musikantenstadl " has also given guest performances in non-german speaking cities , including moscow , toronto , cape town , beijing and dubai . moik said his show was aimed at older people . " the young public goes to the disco on saturday nights , " moik told the austrian paper kleine zeitung .
" we 're a show for people over 40 .
i am not going to do a show for 17-year-olds .

what will their departure mean for the future of this genre ? after more than 50 years on stage , heino shocked the folk music world last month by announcing his retirement .
the platinum-blond singer with his trademark dark glasses is one of the most successful german recording artists , selling over 50 million records worldwide . at the same time , the famous folk music television show " musikantenstadl " informed host karl moik that it was not renewing his contract .
unofficially , the 67-year-old is being " sorted out " and will most likely be replaced with someone younger . one might think that the departures of these old stars could be part of a push to give folk music a younger face - and consequently , younger followers .
but stefan kahé , spokesman for record label koch universal , which holds a 70 percent market share in this sector , said it was simply a normal development . " it 's basically something very natural to retire , " said kahé . letting the sun in there are certainly enough young stars waiting to follow in heino 's and moik 's footsteps , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie hertel and stefan mross have been a couple professionally and privately for years the young dream couple of folk music , singer stefanie hertel and trumpeter stefan mross , have become extremely popular over the past few years . günter tolar , head of the working group for promoting musical entertainment in austria arge , which organizes the annual folk music competition " grand prix der volksmusik , " said heino and moik had been role models for a long time . " but one ca n't overlook what huge shadows such ' greats ' cast , which block the sun for the subsequent generation , " said tolar , a former presenter for austrian television channel orf . still , age was not the issue here .
" whether an interpreter is popular and attracts viewers doesn ’ t depend on their youth , but rather charisma and what message they are communicating in their songs , " said tolar . music with traditional ties many people may find it difficult to understand the long running popularity of folk music .
but it is a central element of german-speaking culture in europe . " folk music is not just a marginal phenomenon of music , " said dr. gisela probst-effah from the institute for musical folklore at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mountain landscape relates the feeling of an ideal world this genre mostly involves newly composed or adaptations of traditional music and songs .
they often generate regional associations , like yodeling , or contain texts with a hint of dialect and are preferably presented in a rural idyll in traditional costumes , like dirndls or lederhosen . " this look gives the appearance of ties to tradition , timelessness and independence from changing fashions , " said probst-effah . according to kahé , popular folk music is precisely about passing on tradition . " it 's about something preserving , something conservative , " he said . the concept of an " ideal world " also plays a role .
" these songs deal with topics like nature , heimat , happy love or an idealized childhood in an ideal world with intact social relationships , " said probst-effah . " i portray the ideal world in my songs because i want to have an ideal world , " heino has said in interviews .
" but it was clear to me that i would never get the nobel prize for my lyrics . "
heino said he is retiring to spend time with this wife , who suffered a heart attack last year . the media 's strong influence figures by the german association of the phonographic industry showed that last year , german pop schlager and folk music made up for 9.8 percent of the total sales of 1.75 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.19 billion -rrb- on the german market .
in comparison , pop music was responsible for 38.8 percent of sales , and rock for 18.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : folk music duo maria und margot hellwig have appeared in television shows for years but while these sales figures appear marginal , popular folk music 's true success lies in its media presence .
this genre would not be what it is without the media , in particular highly commercialized folk music shows on television .
programs such as " musikantenstadl " reach millions of viewers . while there may not be such a strong trend towards younger recording stars , there is " a changing of the guard " in the media sector , said kahé . mross , 29 , hosts a weekly show on german public television .
florian silbereisen , who started his career at age 10 playing the accordion on " musikantenstadl , " is now a regular presenter of various folk music shows .
at 24 , he is the youngest show master on german television . " you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening . " despite these young stars on screen , the viewers are mainly older .
according to the german music information center in bonn , over 40 percent of those who buy schlager and popular folk music recordings are over the age of 50 .
the average age of viewers of folk music shows are around 60 years old , said tolar . " still , older people would also like to have something nice to look at , " said kahé . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl moik is known to be outspoken at times in poor taste .
his calling italians " spaghetti gluttons " in a show was not received well moik presented " musikantenstadl " - which means " musician 's barn " - for the past 25 years .
it is one of the most popular folk music television shows , and not just in the german-speaking world . " musikantenstadl " has also given guest performances in non-german speaking cities , including moscow , toronto , cape town , beijing and dubai . moik said his show was aimed at older people . " the young public goes to the disco on saturday nights , " moik told the austrian paper kleine zeitung .
" we 're a show for people over 40 .
i am not going to do a show for 17-year-olds .
i 'm too old for that . " moik said he doubted whether a younger presenter could attract younger viewers . " no , you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening , " he said .

what will their departure mean for the future of this genre ? after more than 50 years on stage , heino shocked the folk music world last month by announcing his retirement .
the platinum-blond singer with his trademark dark glasses is one of the most successful german recording artists , selling over 50 million records worldwide . at the same time , the famous folk music television show " musikantenstadl " informed host karl moik that it was not renewing his contract .
unofficially , the 67-year-old is being " sorted out " and will most likely be replaced with someone younger . one might think that the departures of these old stars could be part of a push to give folk music a younger face - and consequently , younger followers .
but stefan kahé , spokesman for record label koch universal , which holds a 70 percent market share in this sector , said it was simply a normal development .

bets are on that german president horst köhler will dissolve parliament and call for an early general election in september .
his decision will come this week in a tv broadcast . köhler has until july 22 to make the high-stakes decision about whether to approve or reject chancellor gerhard schröder 's scheme of prompting a national poll one year ahead of schedule . according to a report in der spiegel , köhler intends to make his decision known in a television broadcast .
but will it be a case of history repeating itself ? twenty-two years ago on jan .
7 , 1983 , then president karl carstens appeared on television to announce he was dissolving parliament .
the elections that followed cemented the 16-year rule of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- under helmut kohl . the word from insiders is that köhler has already internally signalled his readiness to call new elections .
if he does , he 'll be in step with opinions of the majority of german citizens .
in a forsa poll commissioned by the bild am sonntag , 75 percent of germans are in favor of an early election in september . schröder 's will bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earlier this month , schröder deliberately lost a no-confidence vote before parliament , in the hopes that a new election would secure him a renewed mandate for his reform agenda and silence critics within his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . meanwhile his challenger angela merkel , the first female chancellor candidate , is flying high in the polls and mobilizing her christian union bloc for a battle over who can pull germany out of its protracted economic slump . schröder gave an impassioned speech before parliament july 1 outlining his reasons for seeking a new mandate following a poll drubbing in may in the spd heartland of north rhine-westphalia , the country 's most populous state . " on may 22 , the question arose as to whether , with this election result , my policies and i are still fully able to function , " he said , describing the political gridlock he said had gripped the country and the shaky state of his center-left coalition with the greens party . immediately afterwards , he went to köhler to ask him to bring the election forward . spd with most to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel on the campaign trail , here visiting german bundeswehr soldiers in the town of prizren , kosovo on friday , july 15 , 2005 .
seeking guidance in his decision , which could still face a constitutional court challenge , köhler asked schröder to provide more evidence of his claim that he no longer enjoys the secure backing of his coalition . he replied last week with a 200-page dossier his spokesman bela anda said provided " a documentation of the difficulties of implementing his government program . " although most observers and all the main political parties expect köhler to grant schröder 's request and order new elections , an opinion poll released thursday indicated that the chancellor could have the most to lose . his social democrats scored just 27 percent versus 42 percent for merkel 's cdu / csu , according to the infratest dimap institute based on a survey conducted july 12-13 . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early german elections in legal limbo germany 's ruling coalition may have purposely lost a confidence vote to trigger early elections , but the country 's president or supreme court could yet kibosh the hopes of both politicians and the public for a new poll .

but adeniji last week signaled au 's readiness to compromise on the issue of veto power . the g4 blueprint calls for boosting council membership from 15 members to 25 , with six new permanent seats without veto power , including two for africa , and four non-permanent seats . singh said the two sides had had a " useful , constructive and cordial meeting " and were committed to finding a way for " our differences not only to narrow , but to disappear . " he later flew to washington where he was to join his prime minister manmohan singh , who is beginning a us visit , including talks with president george w. bush on monday .

g4 diplomats said that if everything went smoothly , an acceptable compromise draft would be put to a vote , but not before july 29 . speaking for the au , the nigerian foreign minister adeniji said : " we were meeting for the first time .
we made as much progress as we can today . " nigeria is , along with south africa and egypt , one of the three strong contenders for the two permanent seats sought by africa on the security council . g4 diplomats said that during sunday 's session , nigeria was the au country most forthcoming in speaking in favor of reaching common ground with the g4 , while egypt was more aloof . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everybody prefers a front row seat at the security council the g4 countries see the support of the un 's 54-member african bloc as crucial for passage of their draft resolution , which has the backing of more than 30 countries , including france and britain .
a two-third majority is needed in the 191-member general assembly for adoption . " in all the discussions we have to consider that in the end we need a two-third majority , " said fischer .
" that should be our standard , " he said . making the un more relevant earlier the g4 ministers met with the president of the general assembly , jean ping , and then paid a courtesy call on un secretary general kofi annan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : listening to the african voices : german foreign minister joshka fischer soon before the meeting with ping , fischer rejected charges that the g4 was pursuing selfish interests with its plan for security council enlargement , which is strongly opposed by countries such as the united states , pakistan , algeria and canada . fischer said the accusations came from countries which have " no interest " in un reform or those which do not stand a chance of getting a permanent seat themselves . at present , britain , china , france , russia and the united states are the only permanent and veto-wielding members of the council , which also has 10 rotating non-permanent members without veto power . the proposed expansion of the security council is part of annan 's broader un reform plan to make the world body more relevant to today 's realities 60 years after its creation .
the un chief hopes it will be adopted at a world summit in september ahead of the annual general assembly . the package includes major reforms in areas such as human rights , the fight against terrorism , peace building , and preventing genocide . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un reform sparks heavy debate tensions ran high during the first day of debates at the united nations on security council enlargement .

his love for the game has n't let up since .
over the weekend , he opened a soccer exhibit - in the first floor of his office . most politicians like to wax rhapsodic about their athletic ability back in the day .
but gerhard schröder can actually back it up .
as a young man , the chancellor was known as an aggressive and hard-working striker in local leagues .
his talent , apparently , has not left him .
" the things he 's still able to do … " said jochen krannich , a schröder deputy assigned the job of overseeing sports issues . so it came as no surprise that the former player would open up a exhibit of german and world soccer history in the chancellery .
what soccer fan would n't want valuable soccer memorabilia in his office ? player jerseys , foosball the show " soccer and history - from bern 1954 to berlin 2006 " , opened last week in the first floor of the chancellery . surviving members of the legendary german side that captured the 1954 world cup in bern as well as german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger were on hand to open the exhibit with schröder . a mix of historical background , original player jerseys and trophies , the exhibit is designed to whet the appetites of german soccer fans a little under a year before the world cup starts .
the centrepiece is a full-sized goal that schröder wo n't be able to walk by without taking at least one shot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , together with horst eckel -lrb- l -rrb- und ottmar walter , the two surviving members of the 1954 world cup team that shocked the world by beating hungary in the final .
" i do n't think we can stop that , " said krannich .
" after all we want to show the world that we 're looking forward to the world cup . " schily scores one tourist and school groups will be able to take a tour of the collection , which includes a foosball table from the 1950s , by making an appointment .
the chancellery estimates that 40,000 people will do so in the coming year .
they wo n't be able to take a crack at the goal , though , and the foosball table was supposed to be off limits as well .
but at the time of the opening , the ball was missing from the table , courtesy of the german interior minister . " schily put that one in the goal , " said karl schlich , the chancellery spokesman . schlich said that not only the soccer , but the " rare " opportunity to get close to a seat of power would attract visitors .
as rare will be the life-size oil portraits of soccer legends like portugal 's eusebio , pele and franz beckenbauer .
they will hang in the chancellery until 2006 , said schlich , even should the less soccer-enthusiastic christian democratic union move in earlier than planned following early elections this fall . oliver samson -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schily says terror wo n't stop world cup germany 's interior minister otto schily issued a defiant statement in response to concerns that the 2006 world cup was in danger after the london bombings .
the world cup will go ahead in the face of terror , he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.07.2005 cinema on life support großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film attendance is down all over - for smaller films , that 's serious in 1990 , the eu launched the media program to provide support for european films , in danger of being driven to extinction by hollywood .
fifteen years later , movie houses in europe are still fighting for survival . at the rex art-house cinema in bonn , a handful of film enthusiasts have gathered for the opening of the french film " l 'équipier . "
it 's a film about the relation between three people in a small coastal town in brittany .
it 's light on special effects star power , and it 's a film that wo n't run in most big cinemas outside of france , since it 's not designed for today 's mass market .
but the european union wants to ensure that such smaller , more nuanced films continue to be made . for that reason , it started a program 15 years ago to support european films , which were losing the fight against big hollywood movies . bildunterschrift : a scene from " star wars : episode iii , revenge of the sith " with their multi-million-dollar marketing budgets and crowd-pleasing stunts and stories , the americans were driving european films out of movie houses from lisbon to moscow . in 1995 , the eu 's film support program , media , extended its subsidy reach to movie theaters as well .
for the 2001 - 2005 budget period , media 's budget was 400 million euros -lrb- $ 484 million -rrb- . the prerequisite for getting the money from brussels was simple : one-third of a theater 's film program had to consist of european films .
still , for many cinema operators in europe , like rex manager dieter hertel , the decision to carry a good percentage of european movies is n't entirely because of the eu money they guarantee . " the quality of a film is the most important aspect for me , " he said .
" the bottom line is that the quality of films in europe is higher , for example , than that of films produced in america . " drawing people in since 2002 , the rex cinema has been a member of the european cinemas group , an association of european art house theaters .
the group has almost 500 members in more than 260 european cities .
more and more are joining , although european films are not exactly big money makers . " cinemas which show european and smaller films , which perhaps are n't as well known , have to really work hard to get people into the theaters , " said cornelia hammelmann , who works with the eu 's film support project in germany .
" that is exactly what we are trying to do with the media program . " she decides which movie theater or which film in germany gets money from the media funds .
according to her , the support gives theater operators the confidence , and means , to put films into their program which do n't often attract big crowds .
still , she insisted there is an interest among the general public for european film . " there is always going to be a public , for every nationality , for every subject matter , " she said .
" but it 's also important to attract younger audiences . " making it on its own ? movie theaters can receive up to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 60,500 -rrb- per year from the eu film support coffers .
about a third of media 's money goes toward financing special projects aimed at younger people , such as special showings for school groups .
young people have to be helped toward european films so that they can learn to recognize their value , according to hammelmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her goal is that , one day , movie theaters showing european movies wo n't be dependent on eu subsidies , as many today are , for their very existence .
but she admits , that day could be far away , if it ever arrives . " it would be fantastic if we could someday say that the films are successful on their own , that they are able to bring people into the theaters without our help , " she said .
" but that is not the case . " for cinema operator hertel , right now that goal looks unreachable .
last year his ticket sales declined by 12 percent .
all over europe , theaters are reporting falling box office returns , and not just for smaller european movies .
german ticket sales are down 20 percent compared to the first six months of last year , with italy and spain registering double figure declines .
hertel used to be able to use the eu money for advertising .
now he needs it just to survive .
" this year will be the first time that we 'll be absolutely dependent on these subsidies , " he said .
at least the subsidies are n't threatened .
the eu commission has proposed that the media budget be doubled to one billion euros for the 2007 - 2013 period . silvia oster -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de where movie money meets euro talent the european film market may not have as much glitz or glamour as the rest of the berlinale , but it 's an important event where european filmmakers meet the people who can potentially guide them towards the red carpet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.07.2005 a swan song for german folk music ? 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heino wants to leave before the party 's over two icons of the german-speaking popular folk music scene are retiring this year : heino and karl moik .
what will their departure mean for the future of this genre ? after more than 50 years on stage , heino shocked the folk music world last month by announcing his retirement .
the platinum-blond singer with his trademark dark glasses is one of the most successful german recording artists , selling over 50 million records worldwide . at the same time , the famous folk music television show " musikantenstadl " informed host karl moik that it was not renewing his contract .
unofficially , the 67-year-old is being " sorted out " and will most likely be replaced with someone younger . one might think that the departures of these old stars could be part of a push to give folk music a younger face - and consequently , younger followers .
but stefan kahé , spokesman for record label koch universal , which holds a 70 percent market share in this sector , said it was simply a normal development . " it 's basically something very natural to retire , " said kahé . letting the sun in there are certainly enough young stars waiting to follow in heino 's and moik 's footsteps , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie hertel and stefan mross have been a couple professionally and privately for years the young dream couple of folk music , singer stefanie hertel and trumpeter stefan mross , have become extremely popular over the past few years . günter tolar , head of the working group for promoting musical entertainment in austria arge , which organizes the annual folk music competition " grand prix der volksmusik , " said heino and moik had been role models for a long time . " but one ca n't overlook what huge shadows such ' greats ' cast , which block the sun for the subsequent generation , " said tolar , a former presenter for austrian television channel orf . still , age was not the issue here .
" whether an interpreter is popular and attracts viewers doesn ’ t depend on their youth , but rather charisma and what message they are communicating in their songs , " said tolar . music with traditional ties many people may find it difficult to understand the long running popularity of folk music .
but it is a central element of german-speaking culture in europe . " folk music is not just a marginal phenomenon of music , " said dr. gisela probst-effah from the institute for musical folklore at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mountain landscape relates the feeling of an ideal world this genre mostly involves newly composed or adaptations of traditional music and songs .
they often generate regional associations , like yodeling , or contain texts with a hint of dialect and are preferably presented in a rural idyll in traditional costumes , like dirndls or lederhosen . " this look gives the appearance of ties to tradition , timelessness and independence from changing fashions , " said probst-effah . according to kahé , popular folk music is precisely about passing on tradition . " it 's about something preserving , something conservative , " he said . the concept of an " ideal world " also plays a role .
" these songs deal with topics like nature , heimat , happy love or an idealized childhood in an ideal world with intact social relationships , " said probst-effah . " i portray the ideal world in my songs because i want to have an ideal world , " heino has said in interviews .
" but it was clear to me that i would never get the nobel prize for my lyrics . "
heino said he is retiring to spend time with this wife , who suffered a heart attack last year . the media 's strong influence figures by the german association of the phonographic industry showed that last year , german pop schlager and folk music made up for 9.8 percent of the total sales of 1.75 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.19 billion -rrb- on the german market .
in comparison , pop music was responsible for 38.8 percent of sales , and rock for 18.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : folk music duo maria und margot hellwig have appeared in television shows for years but while these sales figures appear marginal , popular folk music 's true success lies in its media presence .
this genre would not be what it is without the media , in particular highly commercialized folk music shows on television .
programs such as " musikantenstadl " reach millions of viewers . while there may not be such a strong trend towards younger recording stars , there is " a changing of the guard " in the media sector , said kahé . mross , 29 , hosts a weekly show on german public television .
florian silbereisen , who started his career at age 10 playing the accordion on " musikantenstadl , " is now a regular presenter of various folk music shows .
at 24 , he is the youngest show master on german television . " you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening . " despite these young stars on screen , the viewers are mainly older .
according to the german music information center in bonn , over 40 percent of those who buy schlager and popular folk music recordings are over the age of 50 .
the average age of viewers of folk music shows are around 60 years old , said tolar . " still , older people would also like to have something nice to look at , " said kahé . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl moik is known to be outspoken at times in poor taste .
his calling italians " spaghetti gluttons " in a show was not received well moik presented " musikantenstadl " - which means " musician 's barn " - for the past 25 years .
it is one of the most popular folk music television shows , and not just in the german-speaking world . " musikantenstadl " has also given guest performances in non-german speaking cities , including moscow , toronto , cape town , beijing and dubai . moik said his show was aimed at older people . " the young public goes to the disco on saturday nights , " moik told the austrian paper kleine zeitung .
" we 're a show for people over 40 .
i am not going to do a show for 17-year-olds .
i 'm too old for that . " moik said he doubted whether a younger presenter could attract younger viewers . " no , you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening , " he said .
" you ca n't get it younger , not even with a younger host .

back to first page back 2/2 the importance of folk music kahé said the significance of popular folk music for all age groups should n't be underestimated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boy 's choir from tölz in bavaria has achieved worldwide fame " in southern germany , austria or the german-speaking parts of switzerland , this is serious music and older cultures in the villages cultivate it , " said kahé .
" many young people listen to it there , too . " in austria , popular folk music is in the top ten and sometimes even reached number one , with gold and platinum records , he added . " folk music is one of the most significant forms of entertainment in rural areas and this is where the next generation comes from , " said tolar .
but , he added , the artists don ’ t change the music . " they sing what the songwriters write for them or what the producers give them to interpret , " said tolar .
" but the singers are very significant as carriers , as they attract the public . " folk music will remain successful tolar said he found folk music 's popularity to be waning .
" a few stars , a few producers and a few good writers have given it a certain monotony , which the public is also beginning to slowly notice , " he said . not enough was being invested in the next generation , as producers were not willing to risk high production costs with no guarantee of success , he said . " on the other side , a lot of artistic junk is being produced , " said tolar .
this was evident in competitions like " grand prix der volksmusik . " " producers send in all of their shelf warmers in the hope that one or the other might get through , " he said .
" it 's very depressing to sit in that kind of jury . " he said the public did listen very selectively and would respond to bad songs in a television show by simply switching off . kahé , though , said that popular folk music will continue to be successful . " a music that comes from tradition has something in its origins , which moves people , " said kahé .
" the more it can convey this , the more successful it will be .

what will their departure mean for the future of this genre ? after more than 50 years on stage , heino shocked the folk music world last month by announcing his retirement .
the platinum-blond singer with his trademark dark glasses is one of the most successful german recording artists , selling over 50 million records worldwide . at the same time , the famous folk music television show " musikantenstadl " informed host karl moik that it was not renewing his contract .
unofficially , the 67-year-old is being " sorted out " and will most likely be replaced with someone younger . one might think that the departures of these old stars could be part of a push to give folk music a younger face - and consequently , younger followers .
but stefan kahé , spokesman for record label koch universal , which holds a 70 percent market share in this sector , said it was simply a normal development . " it 's basically something very natural to retire , " said kahé . letting the sun in there are certainly enough young stars waiting to follow in heino 's and moik 's footsteps , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie hertel and stefan mross have been a couple professionally and privately for years the young dream couple of folk music , singer stefanie hertel and trumpeter stefan mross , have become extremely popular over the past few years . günter tolar , head of the working group for promoting musical entertainment in austria arge , which organizes the annual folk music competition " grand prix der volksmusik , " said heino and moik had been role models for a long time . " but one ca n't overlook what huge shadows such ' greats ' cast , which block the sun for the subsequent generation , " said tolar , a former presenter for austrian television channel orf . still , age was not the issue here .
" whether an interpreter is popular and attracts viewers doesn ’ t depend on their youth , but rather charisma and what message they are communicating in their songs , " said tolar . music with traditional ties many people may find it difficult to understand the long running popularity of folk music .
but it is a central element of german-speaking culture in europe . " folk music is not just a marginal phenomenon of music , " said dr. gisela probst-effah from the institute for musical folklore at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mountain landscape relates the feeling of an ideal world this genre mostly involves newly composed or adaptations of traditional music and songs .
they often generate regional associations , like yodeling , or contain texts with a hint of dialect and are preferably presented in a rural idyll in traditional costumes , like dirndls or lederhosen . " this look gives the appearance of ties to tradition , timelessness and independence from changing fashions , " said probst-effah . according to kahé , popular folk music is precisely about passing on tradition . " it 's about something preserving , something conservative , " he said . the concept of an " ideal world " also plays a role .
" these songs deal with topics like nature , heimat , happy love or an idealized childhood in an ideal world with intact social relationships , " said probst-effah . " i portray the ideal world in my songs because i want to have an ideal world , " heino has said in interviews .
" but it was clear to me that i would never get the nobel prize for my lyrics . "
heino said he is retiring to spend time with this wife , who suffered a heart attack last year . the media 's strong influence figures by the german association of the phonographic industry showed that last year , german pop schlager and folk music made up for 9.8 percent of the total sales of 1.75 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.19 billion -rrb- on the german market .
in comparison , pop music was responsible for 38.8 percent of sales , and rock for 18.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : folk music duo maria und margot hellwig have appeared in television shows for years but while these sales figures appear marginal , popular folk music 's true success lies in its media presence .
this genre would not be what it is without the media , in particular highly commercialized folk music shows on television .
programs such as " musikantenstadl " reach millions of viewers . while there may not be such a strong trend towards younger recording stars , there is " a changing of the guard " in the media sector , said kahé . mross , 29 , hosts a weekly show on german public television .
florian silbereisen , who started his career at age 10 playing the accordion on " musikantenstadl , " is now a regular presenter of various folk music shows .
at 24 , he is the youngest show master on german television . " you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening . " despite these young stars on screen , the viewers are mainly older .
according to the german music information center in bonn , over 40 percent of those who buy schlager and popular folk music recordings are over the age of 50 .
the average age of viewers of folk music shows are around 60 years old , said tolar . " still , older people would also like to have something nice to look at , " said kahé . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl moik is known to be outspoken at times in poor taste .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.07.2005 cinema on life support großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film attendance is down all over - for smaller films , that 's serious in 1990 , the eu launched the media program to provide support for european films , in danger of being driven to extinction by hollywood .
fifteen years later , movie houses in europe are still fighting for survival . at the rex art-house cinema in bonn , a handful of film enthusiasts have gathered for the opening of the french film " l 'équipier . "
it 's a film about the relation between three people in a small coastal town in brittany .
it 's light on special effects star power , and it 's a film that wo n't run in most big cinemas outside of france , since it 's not designed for today 's mass market .
but the european union wants to ensure that such smaller , more nuanced films continue to be made . for that reason , it started a program 15 years ago to support european films , which were losing the fight against big hollywood movies . bildunterschrift : a scene from " star wars : episode iii , revenge of the sith " with their multi-million-dollar marketing budgets and crowd-pleasing stunts and stories , the americans were driving european films out of movie houses from lisbon to moscow . in 1995 , the eu 's film support program , media , extended its subsidy reach to movie theaters as well .
for the 2001 - 2005 budget period , media 's budget was 400 million euros -lrb- $ 484 million -rrb- . the prerequisite for getting the money from brussels was simple : one-third of a theater 's film program had to consist of european films .
still , for many cinema operators in europe , like rex manager dieter hertel , the decision to carry a good percentage of european movies is n't entirely because of the eu money they guarantee . " the quality of a film is the most important aspect for me , " he said .
" the bottom line is that the quality of films in europe is higher , for example , than that of films produced in america . " drawing people in since 2002 , the rex cinema has been a member of the european cinemas group , an association of european art house theaters .
the group has almost 500 members in more than 260 european cities .
more and more are joining , although european films are not exactly big money makers . " cinemas which show european and smaller films , which perhaps are n't as well known , have to really work hard to get people into the theaters , " said cornelia hammelmann , who works with the eu 's film support project in germany .
" that is exactly what we are trying to do with the media program . " she decides which movie theater or which film in germany gets money from the media funds .
according to her , the support gives theater operators the confidence , and means , to put films into their program which do n't often attract big crowds .
still , she insisted there is an interest among the general public for european film . " there is always going to be a public , for every nationality , for every subject matter , " she said .
" but it 's also important to attract younger audiences . " making it on its own ? movie theaters can receive up to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 60,500 -rrb- per year from the eu film support coffers .
about a third of media 's money goes toward financing special projects aimed at younger people , such as special showings for school groups .
young people have to be helped toward european films so that they can learn to recognize their value , according to hammelmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her goal is that , one day , movie theaters showing european movies wo n't be dependent on eu subsidies , as many today are , for their very existence .
but she admits , that day could be far away , if it ever arrives . " it would be fantastic if we could someday say that the films are successful on their own , that they are able to bring people into the theaters without our help , " she said .
" but that is not the case . " for cinema operator hertel , right now that goal looks unreachable .
last year his ticket sales declined by 12 percent .
all over europe , theaters are reporting falling box office returns , and not just for smaller european movies .
german ticket sales are down 20 percent compared to the first six months of last year , with italy and spain registering double figure declines .
hertel used to be able to use the eu money for advertising .
now he needs it just to survive .
" this year will be the first time that we 'll be absolutely dependent on these subsidies , " he said .
at least the subsidies are n't threatened .
the eu commission has proposed that the media budget be doubled to one billion euros for the 2007 - 2013 period . silvia oster -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de where movie money meets euro talent the european film market may not have as much glitz or glamour as the rest of the berlinale , but it 's an important event where european filmmakers meet the people who can potentially guide them towards the red carpet .

what will their departure mean for the future of this genre ? after more than 50 years on stage , heino shocked the folk music world last month by announcing his retirement .
the platinum-blond singer with his trademark dark glasses is one of the most successful german recording artists , selling over 50 million records worldwide . at the same time , the famous folk music television show " musikantenstadl " informed host karl moik that it was not renewing his contract .
unofficially , the 67-year-old is being " sorted out " and will most likely be replaced with someone younger . one might think that the departures of these old stars could be part of a push to give folk music a younger face - and consequently , younger followers .
but stefan kahé , spokesman for record label koch universal , which holds a 70 percent market share in this sector , said it was simply a normal development . " it 's basically something very natural to retire , " said kahé . letting the sun in there are certainly enough young stars waiting to follow in heino 's and moik 's footsteps , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie hertel and stefan mross have been a couple professionally and privately for years the young dream couple of folk music , singer stefanie hertel and trumpeter stefan mross , have become extremely popular over the past few years . günter tolar , head of the working group for promoting musical entertainment in austria arge , which organizes the annual folk music competition " grand prix der volksmusik , " said heino and moik had been role models for a long time . " but one ca n't overlook what huge shadows such ' greats ' cast , which block the sun for the subsequent generation , " said tolar , a former presenter for austrian television channel orf . still , age was not the issue here .
" whether an interpreter is popular and attracts viewers doesn ’ t depend on their youth , but rather charisma and what message they are communicating in their songs , " said tolar . music with traditional ties many people may find it difficult to understand the long running popularity of folk music .
but it is a central element of german-speaking culture in europe . " folk music is not just a marginal phenomenon of music , " said dr. gisela probst-effah from the institute for musical folklore at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mountain landscape relates the feeling of an ideal world this genre mostly involves newly composed or adaptations of traditional music and songs .
they often generate regional associations , like yodeling , or contain texts with a hint of dialect and are preferably presented in a rural idyll in traditional costumes , like dirndls or lederhosen . " this look gives the appearance of ties to tradition , timelessness and independence from changing fashions , " said probst-effah . according to kahé , popular folk music is precisely about passing on tradition . " it 's about something preserving , something conservative , " he said . the concept of an " ideal world " also plays a role .
" these songs deal with topics like nature , heimat , happy love or an idealized childhood in an ideal world with intact social relationships , " said probst-effah . " i portray the ideal world in my songs because i want to have an ideal world , " heino has said in interviews .
" but it was clear to me that i would never get the nobel prize for my lyrics . "
heino said he is retiring to spend time with this wife , who suffered a heart attack last year . the media 's strong influence figures by the german association of the phonographic industry showed that last year , german pop schlager and folk music made up for 9.8 percent of the total sales of 1.75 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.19 billion -rrb- on the german market .
in comparison , pop music was responsible for 38.8 percent of sales , and rock for 18.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : folk music duo maria und margot hellwig have appeared in television shows for years but while these sales figures appear marginal , popular folk music 's true success lies in its media presence .
this genre would not be what it is without the media , in particular highly commercialized folk music shows on television .
programs such as " musikantenstadl " reach millions of viewers . while there may not be such a strong trend towards younger recording stars , there is " a changing of the guard " in the media sector , said kahé . mross , 29 , hosts a weekly show on german public television .
florian silbereisen , who started his career at age 10 playing the accordion on " musikantenstadl , " is now a regular presenter of various folk music shows .
at 24 , he is the youngest show master on german television . " you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening . " despite these young stars on screen , the viewers are mainly older .
according to the german music information center in bonn , over 40 percent of those who buy schlager and popular folk music recordings are over the age of 50 .
the average age of viewers of folk music shows are around 60 years old , said tolar . " still , older people would also like to have something nice to look at , " said kahé . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl moik is known to be outspoken at times in poor taste .
his calling italians " spaghetti gluttons " in a show was not received well moik presented " musikantenstadl " - which means " musician 's barn " - for the past 25 years .
it is one of the most popular folk music television shows , and not just in the german-speaking world . " musikantenstadl " has also given guest performances in non-german speaking cities , including moscow , toronto , cape town , beijing and dubai . moik said his show was aimed at older people . " the young public goes to the disco on saturday nights , " moik told the austrian paper kleine zeitung .
" we 're a show for people over 40 .
i am not going to do a show for 17-year-olds .
i 'm too old for that . " moik said he doubted whether a younger presenter could attract younger viewers . " no , you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening , " he said .
" you ca n't get it younger , not even with a younger host .

back to first page back 2/2 the importance of folk music kahé said the significance of popular folk music for all age groups should n't be underestimated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boy 's choir from tölz in bavaria has achieved worldwide fame " in southern germany , austria or the german-speaking parts of switzerland , this is serious music and older cultures in the villages cultivate it , " said kahé .
" many young people listen to it there , too . " in austria , popular folk music is in the top ten and sometimes even reached number one , with gold and platinum records , he added . " folk music is one of the most significant forms of entertainment in rural areas and this is where the next generation comes from , " said tolar .
but , he added , the artists don ’ t change the music . " they sing what the songwriters write for them or what the producers give them to interpret , " said tolar .
" but the singers are very significant as carriers , as they attract the public . " folk music will remain successful tolar said he found folk music 's popularity to be waning .
" a few stars , a few producers and a few good writers have given it a certain monotony , which the public is also beginning to slowly notice , " he said . not enough was being invested in the next generation , as producers were not willing to risk high production costs with no guarantee of success , he said . " on the other side , a lot of artistic junk is being produced , " said tolar .
this was evident in competitions like " grand prix der volksmusik . " " producers send in all of their shelf warmers in the hope that one or the other might get through , " he said .
" it 's very depressing to sit in that kind of jury . " he said the public did listen very selectively and would respond to bad songs in a television show by simply switching off . kahé , though , said that popular folk music will continue to be successful .

back to first page back 2/2 the importance of folk music kahé said the significance of popular folk music for all age groups should n't be underestimated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boy 's choir from tölz in bavaria has achieved worldwide fame " in southern germany , austria or the german-speaking parts of switzerland , this is serious music and older cultures in the villages cultivate it , " said kahé .
" many young people listen to it there , too . " in austria , popular folk music is in the top ten and sometimes even reached number one , with gold and platinum records , he added . " folk music is one of the most significant forms of entertainment in rural areas and this is where the next generation comes from , " said tolar .
but , he added , the artists don ’ t change the music . " they sing what the songwriters write for them or what the producers give them to interpret , " said tolar .
" but the singers are very significant as carriers , as they attract the public . " folk music will remain successful tolar said he found folk music 's popularity to be waning .
" a few stars , a few producers and a few good writers have given it a certain monotony , which the public is also beginning to slowly notice , " he said . not enough was being invested in the next generation , as producers were not willing to risk high production costs with no guarantee of success , he said . " on the other side , a lot of artistic junk is being produced , " said tolar .
this was evident in competitions like " grand prix der volksmusik . " " producers send in all of their shelf warmers in the hope that one or the other might get through , " he said .
" it 's very depressing to sit in that kind of jury . " he said the public did listen very selectively and would respond to bad songs in a television show by simply switching off . kahé , though , said that popular folk music will continue to be successful . " a music that comes from tradition has something in its origins , which moves people , " said kahé .
" the more it can convey this , the more successful it will be .

his love for the game has n't let up since .
over the weekend , he opened a soccer exhibit - in the first floor of his office . most politicians like to wax rhapsodic about their athletic ability back in the day .
but gerhard schröder can actually back it up .
as a young man , the chancellor was known as an aggressive and hard-working striker in local leagues .
his talent , apparently , has not left him .
" the things he 's still able to do … " said jochen krannich , a schröder deputy assigned the job of overseeing sports issues . so it came as no surprise that the former player would open up a exhibit of german and world soccer history in the chancellery .
what soccer fan would n't want valuable soccer memorabilia in his office ? player jerseys , foosball the show " soccer and history - from bern 1954 to berlin 2006 " , opened last week in the first floor of the chancellery . surviving members of the legendary german side that captured the 1954 world cup in bern as well as german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger were on hand to open the exhibit with schröder . a mix of historical background , original player jerseys and trophies , the exhibit is designed to whet the appetites of german soccer fans a little under a year before the world cup starts .
the centrepiece is a full-sized goal that schröder wo n't be able to walk by without taking at least one shot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , together with horst eckel -lrb- l -rrb- und ottmar walter , the two surviving members of the 1954 world cup team that shocked the world by beating hungary in the final .
" i do n't think we can stop that , " said krannich .
" after all we want to show the world that we 're looking forward to the world cup . " schily scores one tourist and school groups will be able to take a tour of the collection , which includes a foosball table from the 1950s , by making an appointment .
the chancellery estimates that 40,000 people will do so in the coming year .
they wo n't be able to take a crack at the goal , though , and the foosball table was supposed to be off limits as well .
but at the time of the opening , the ball was missing from the table , courtesy of the german interior minister . " schily put that one in the goal , " said karl schlich , the chancellery spokesman . schlich said that not only the soccer , but the " rare " opportunity to get close to a seat of power would attract visitors .
as rare will be the life-size oil portraits of soccer legends like portugal 's eusebio , pele and franz beckenbauer .
they will hang in the chancellery until 2006 , said schlich , even should the less soccer-enthusiastic christian democratic union move in earlier than planned following early elections this fall . oliver samson -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schily says terror wo n't stop world cup germany 's interior minister otto schily issued a defiant statement in response to concerns that the 2006 world cup was in danger after the london bombings .
the world cup will go ahead in the face of terror , he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.07.2005 a swan song for german folk music ? 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heino wants to leave before the party 's over two icons of the german-speaking popular folk music scene are retiring this year : heino and karl moik .
what will their departure mean for the future of this genre ? after more than 50 years on stage , heino shocked the folk music world last month by announcing his retirement .
the platinum-blond singer with his trademark dark glasses is one of the most successful german recording artists , selling over 50 million records worldwide . at the same time , the famous folk music television show " musikantenstadl " informed host karl moik that it was not renewing his contract .
unofficially , the 67-year-old is being " sorted out " and will most likely be replaced with someone younger . one might think that the departures of these old stars could be part of a push to give folk music a younger face - and consequently , younger followers .
but stefan kahé , spokesman for record label koch universal , which holds a 70 percent market share in this sector , said it was simply a normal development . " it 's basically something very natural to retire , " said kahé . letting the sun in there are certainly enough young stars waiting to follow in heino 's and moik 's footsteps , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie hertel and stefan mross have been a couple professionally and privately for years the young dream couple of folk music , singer stefanie hertel and trumpeter stefan mross , have become extremely popular over the past few years . günter tolar , head of the working group for promoting musical entertainment in austria arge , which organizes the annual folk music competition " grand prix der volksmusik , " said heino and moik had been role models for a long time . " but one ca n't overlook what huge shadows such ' greats ' cast , which block the sun for the subsequent generation , " said tolar , a former presenter for austrian television channel orf . still , age was not the issue here .
" whether an interpreter is popular and attracts viewers doesn ’ t depend on their youth , but rather charisma and what message they are communicating in their songs , " said tolar . music with traditional ties many people may find it difficult to understand the long running popularity of folk music .
but it is a central element of german-speaking culture in europe . " folk music is not just a marginal phenomenon of music , " said dr. gisela probst-effah from the institute for musical folklore at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mountain landscape relates the feeling of an ideal world this genre mostly involves newly composed or adaptations of traditional music and songs .
they often generate regional associations , like yodeling , or contain texts with a hint of dialect and are preferably presented in a rural idyll in traditional costumes , like dirndls or lederhosen . " this look gives the appearance of ties to tradition , timelessness and independence from changing fashions , " said probst-effah . according to kahé , popular folk music is precisely about passing on tradition . " it 's about something preserving , something conservative , " he said . the concept of an " ideal world " also plays a role .
" these songs deal with topics like nature , heimat , happy love or an idealized childhood in an ideal world with intact social relationships , " said probst-effah . " i portray the ideal world in my songs because i want to have an ideal world , " heino has said in interviews .
" but it was clear to me that i would never get the nobel prize for my lyrics . "
heino said he is retiring to spend time with this wife , who suffered a heart attack last year . the media 's strong influence figures by the german association of the phonographic industry showed that last year , german pop schlager and folk music made up for 9.8 percent of the total sales of 1.75 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.19 billion -rrb- on the german market .
in comparison , pop music was responsible for 38.8 percent of sales , and rock for 18.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : folk music duo maria und margot hellwig have appeared in television shows for years but while these sales figures appear marginal , popular folk music 's true success lies in its media presence .
this genre would not be what it is without the media , in particular highly commercialized folk music shows on television .
programs such as " musikantenstadl " reach millions of viewers . while there may not be such a strong trend towards younger recording stars , there is " a changing of the guard " in the media sector , said kahé . mross , 29 , hosts a weekly show on german public television .
florian silbereisen , who started his career at age 10 playing the accordion on " musikantenstadl , " is now a regular presenter of various folk music shows .
at 24 , he is the youngest show master on german television . " you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening . " despite these young stars on screen , the viewers are mainly older .
according to the german music information center in bonn , over 40 percent of those who buy schlager and popular folk music recordings are over the age of 50 .
the average age of viewers of folk music shows are around 60 years old , said tolar . " still , older people would also like to have something nice to look at , " said kahé . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl moik is known to be outspoken at times in poor taste .
his calling italians " spaghetti gluttons " in a show was not received well moik presented " musikantenstadl " - which means " musician 's barn " - for the past 25 years .
it is one of the most popular folk music television shows , and not just in the german-speaking world . " musikantenstadl " has also given guest performances in non-german speaking cities , including moscow , toronto , cape town , beijing and dubai . moik said his show was aimed at older people . " the young public goes to the disco on saturday nights , " moik told the austrian paper kleine zeitung .
" we 're a show for people over 40 .
i am not going to do a show for 17-year-olds .
i 'm too old for that . " moik said he doubted whether a younger presenter could attract younger viewers . " no , you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening , " he said .
" you ca n't get it younger , not even with a younger host .

according to the german constitution , a chancellor can only call for new elections if facing a serious government crisis . constitution experts have spent the last few weeks debating whether or not schröder is allowed to use the constitutional clause as an instrument to seek a new mandate for his government . köhler , a member of the opposition christian democratic union party , was not pleased with the way in which the german constitution was being manipulated - with the approval of his own party - to force new elections . population behind early elections but he will likely decide to approve it , and the majority of the german population looks to be behind him .
a poll released on sunday indicated that 75 percent of the population is in favour of early elections , with only 18 percent against it . among those against is green party parliamentarian werner schulz , a lawyer who plans to file suit in the constitutional court in karlsruhe should köhler approve the measure .
" this move angers me ... because our parliamentarian democracy requires … transparency , clarity and truth , and such measures are dishonorable , " he wrote in the latest issue of der spiegel . experts say the court is not likely to agree with schulz 's call to stop the process . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany waits on early election decision will he or wo n't he ?
bets are on that german president horst köhler will dissolve parliament and call for an early general election in september .
his decision will come this week in a tv broadcast .

bets are on that german president horst köhler will dissolve parliament and call for an early general election in september .
his decision will come this week in a tv broadcast . köhler has until july 22 to make the high-stakes decision about whether to approve or reject chancellor gerhard schröder 's scheme of prompting a national poll one year ahead of schedule . according to a report in der spiegel , köhler intends to make his decision known in a television broadcast .
but will it be a case of history repeating itself ? twenty-two years ago on jan .
7 , 1983 , then president karl carstens appeared on television to announce he was dissolving parliament .
the elections that followed cemented the 16-year rule of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- under helmut kohl . the word from insiders is that köhler has already internally signalled his readiness to call new elections .
if he does , he 'll be in step with opinions of the majority of german citizens .
in a forsa poll commissioned by the bild am sonntag , 75 percent of germans are in favor of an early election in september . schröder 's will bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earlier this month , schröder deliberately lost a no-confidence vote before parliament , in the hopes that a new election would secure him a renewed mandate for his reform agenda and silence critics within his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . meanwhile his challenger angela merkel , the first female chancellor candidate , is flying high in the polls and mobilizing her christian union bloc for a battle over who can pull germany out of its protracted economic slump . schröder gave an impassioned speech before parliament july 1 outlining his reasons for seeking a new mandate following a poll drubbing in may in the spd heartland of north rhine-westphalia , the country 's most populous state . " on may 22 , the question arose as to whether , with this election result , my policies and i are still fully able to function , " he said , describing the political gridlock he said had gripped the country and the shaky state of his center-left coalition with the greens party . immediately afterwards , he went to köhler to ask him to bring the election forward . spd with most to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel on the campaign trail , here visiting german bundeswehr soldiers in the town of prizren , kosovo on friday , july 15 , 2005 .
seeking guidance in his decision , which could still face a constitutional court challenge , köhler asked schröder to provide more evidence of his claim that he no longer enjoys the secure backing of his coalition . he replied last week with a 200-page dossier his spokesman bela anda said provided " a documentation of the difficulties of implementing his government program . " although most observers and all the main political parties expect köhler to grant schröder 's request and order new elections , an opinion poll released thursday indicated that the chancellor could have the most to lose . his social democrats scored just 27 percent versus 42 percent for merkel 's cdu / csu , according to the infratest dimap institute based on a survey conducted july 12-13 . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early german elections in legal limbo germany 's ruling coalition may have purposely lost a confidence vote to trigger early elections , but the country 's president or supreme court could yet kibosh the hopes of both politicians and the public for a new poll .

should he surprise everyone with a no vote , the chancellor plans to continue to govern . those in the opposition hoping gerhard schröder would step down should köhler reject the bundestag 's motion for early federal elections this fall , will be disappointed .
the chancellor announced through his party 's chairman that he planned to continue to govern . chairman franz münterfering told the welt am sonntag that " it would not be good for the country " should köhler decide against new elections , but that schröder would nevertheless continue to govern until scheduled elections in september 2006 .
opposition to the schröder government 's economic reform agenda is widespread among germans , and the lack of a majority in germany 's upper house of parliament will mean schröder will spend his remaining year and a half as a " lame duck chancellor " should his call for new elections not go through . spiegel : köhler will approve new elections but he might not have to worry too much .
according to a report in der spiegel , köhler has already decided to approve the chancellor 's call for new elections , a decision he will announced this friday . in the three weeks since schröder intentionally lost a vote-of-confidence in the bundestag , köhler has been mulling whether to approve the chancellor 's highly unusual and controversial move .
according to the german constitution , a chancellor can only call for new elections if facing a serious government crisis . constitution experts have spent the last few weeks debating whether or not schröder is allowed to use the constitutional clause as an instrument to seek a new mandate for his government . köhler , a member of the opposition christian democratic union party , was not pleased with the way in which the german constitution was being manipulated - with the approval of his own party - to force new elections . population behind early elections but he will likely decide to approve it , and the majority of the german population looks to be behind him .
a poll released on sunday indicated that 75 percent of the population is in favour of early elections , with only 18 percent against it . among those against is green party parliamentarian werner schulz , a lawyer who plans to file suit in the constitutional court in karlsruhe should köhler approve the measure .
" this move angers me ... because our parliamentarian democracy requires … transparency , clarity and truth , and such measures are dishonorable , " he wrote in the latest issue of der spiegel . experts say the court is not likely to agree with schulz 's call to stop the process . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany waits on early election decision will he or wo n't he ?

as rare will be the life-size oil portraits of soccer legends like portugal 's eusebio , pele and franz beckenbauer .

what will their departure mean for the future of this genre ? after more than 50 years on stage , heino shocked the folk music world last month by announcing his retirement .
the platinum-blond singer with his trademark dark glasses is one of the most successful german recording artists , selling over 50 million records worldwide . at the same time , the famous folk music television show " musikantenstadl " informed host karl moik that it was not renewing his contract .
unofficially , the 67-year-old is being " sorted out " and will most likely be replaced with someone younger . one might think that the departures of these old stars could be part of a push to give folk music a younger face - and consequently , younger followers .
but stefan kahé , spokesman for record label koch universal , which holds a 70 percent market share in this sector , said it was simply a normal development . " it 's basically something very natural to retire , " said kahé . letting the sun in there are certainly enough young stars waiting to follow in heino 's and moik 's footsteps , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie hertel and stefan mross have been a couple professionally and privately for years the young dream couple of folk music , singer stefanie hertel and trumpeter stefan mross , have become extremely popular over the past few years . günter tolar , head of the working group for promoting musical entertainment in austria arge , which organizes the annual folk music competition " grand prix der volksmusik , " said heino and moik had been role models for a long time . " but one ca n't overlook what huge shadows such ' greats ' cast , which block the sun for the subsequent generation , " said tolar , a former presenter for austrian television channel orf . still , age was not the issue here .
" whether an interpreter is popular and attracts viewers doesn ’ t depend on their youth , but rather charisma and what message they are communicating in their songs , " said tolar . music with traditional ties many people may find it difficult to understand the long running popularity of folk music .
but it is a central element of german-speaking culture in europe . " folk music is not just a marginal phenomenon of music , " said dr. gisela probst-effah from the institute for musical folklore at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mountain landscape relates the feeling of an ideal world this genre mostly involves newly composed or adaptations of traditional music and songs .
they often generate regional associations , like yodeling , or contain texts with a hint of dialect and are preferably presented in a rural idyll in traditional costumes , like dirndls or lederhosen . " this look gives the appearance of ties to tradition , timelessness and independence from changing fashions , " said probst-effah . according to kahé , popular folk music is precisely about passing on tradition . " it 's about something preserving , something conservative , " he said . the concept of an " ideal world " also plays a role .
" these songs deal with topics like nature , heimat , happy love or an idealized childhood in an ideal world with intact social relationships , " said probst-effah . " i portray the ideal world in my songs because i want to have an ideal world , " heino has said in interviews .
" but it was clear to me that i would never get the nobel prize for my lyrics . "
heino said he is retiring to spend time with this wife , who suffered a heart attack last year . the media 's strong influence figures by the german association of the phonographic industry showed that last year , german pop schlager and folk music made up for 9.8 percent of the total sales of 1.75 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.19 billion -rrb- on the german market .
in comparison , pop music was responsible for 38.8 percent of sales , and rock for 18.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : folk music duo maria und margot hellwig have appeared in television shows for years but while these sales figures appear marginal , popular folk music 's true success lies in its media presence .
this genre would not be what it is without the media , in particular highly commercialized folk music shows on television .
programs such as " musikantenstadl " reach millions of viewers . while there may not be such a strong trend towards younger recording stars , there is " a changing of the guard " in the media sector , said kahé . mross , 29 , hosts a weekly show on german public television .
florian silbereisen , who started his career at age 10 playing the accordion on " musikantenstadl , " is now a regular presenter of various folk music shows .
at 24 , he is the youngest show master on german television . " you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening . " despite these young stars on screen , the viewers are mainly older .
according to the german music information center in bonn , over 40 percent of those who buy schlager and popular folk music recordings are over the age of 50 .
the average age of viewers of folk music shows are around 60 years old , said tolar . " still , older people would also like to have something nice to look at , " said kahé . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl moik is known to be outspoken at times in poor taste .
his calling italians " spaghetti gluttons " in a show was not received well moik presented " musikantenstadl " - which means " musician 's barn " - for the past 25 years .
it is one of the most popular folk music television shows , and not just in the german-speaking world . " musikantenstadl " has also given guest performances in non-german speaking cities , including moscow , toronto , cape town , beijing and dubai . moik said his show was aimed at older people . " the young public goes to the disco on saturday nights , " moik told the austrian paper kleine zeitung .
" we 're a show for people over 40 .
i am not going to do a show for 17-year-olds .
i 'm too old for that . " moik said he doubted whether a younger presenter could attract younger viewers . " no , you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening , " he said .

what will their departure mean for the future of this genre ? after more than 50 years on stage , heino shocked the folk music world last month by announcing his retirement .
the platinum-blond singer with his trademark dark glasses is one of the most successful german recording artists , selling over 50 million records worldwide . at the same time , the famous folk music television show " musikantenstadl " informed host karl moik that it was not renewing his contract .
unofficially , the 67-year-old is being " sorted out " and will most likely be replaced with someone younger . one might think that the departures of these old stars could be part of a push to give folk music a younger face - and consequently , younger followers .
but stefan kahé , spokesman for record label koch universal , which holds a 70 percent market share in this sector , said it was simply a normal development . " it 's basically something very natural to retire , " said kahé . letting the sun in there are certainly enough young stars waiting to follow in heino 's and moik 's footsteps , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie hertel and stefan mross have been a couple professionally and privately for years the young dream couple of folk music , singer stefanie hertel and trumpeter stefan mross , have become extremely popular over the past few years . günter tolar , head of the working group for promoting musical entertainment in austria arge , which organizes the annual folk music competition " grand prix der volksmusik , " said heino and moik had been role models for a long time . " but one ca n't overlook what huge shadows such ' greats ' cast , which block the sun for the subsequent generation , " said tolar , a former presenter for austrian television channel orf . still , age was not the issue here .
" whether an interpreter is popular and attracts viewers doesn ’ t depend on their youth , but rather charisma and what message they are communicating in their songs , " said tolar . music with traditional ties many people may find it difficult to understand the long running popularity of folk music .
but it is a central element of german-speaking culture in europe . " folk music is not just a marginal phenomenon of music , " said dr. gisela probst-effah from the institute for musical folklore at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mountain landscape relates the feeling of an ideal world this genre mostly involves newly composed or adaptations of traditional music and songs .
they often generate regional associations , like yodeling , or contain texts with a hint of dialect and are preferably presented in a rural idyll in traditional costumes , like dirndls or lederhosen . " this look gives the appearance of ties to tradition , timelessness and independence from changing fashions , " said probst-effah . according to kahé , popular folk music is precisely about passing on tradition . " it 's about something preserving , something conservative , " he said . the concept of an " ideal world " also plays a role .
" these songs deal with topics like nature , heimat , happy love or an idealized childhood in an ideal world with intact social relationships , " said probst-effah . " i portray the ideal world in my songs because i want to have an ideal world , " heino has said in interviews .
" but it was clear to me that i would never get the nobel prize for my lyrics . "
heino said he is retiring to spend time with this wife , who suffered a heart attack last year . the media 's strong influence figures by the german association of the phonographic industry showed that last year , german pop schlager and folk music made up for 9.8 percent of the total sales of 1.75 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.19 billion -rrb- on the german market .
in comparison , pop music was responsible for 38.8 percent of sales , and rock for 18.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : folk music duo maria und margot hellwig have appeared in television shows for years but while these sales figures appear marginal , popular folk music 's true success lies in its media presence .
this genre would not be what it is without the media , in particular highly commercialized folk music shows on television .
programs such as " musikantenstadl " reach millions of viewers . while there may not be such a strong trend towards younger recording stars , there is " a changing of the guard " in the media sector , said kahé . mross , 29 , hosts a weekly show on german public television .
florian silbereisen , who started his career at age 10 playing the accordion on " musikantenstadl , " is now a regular presenter of various folk music shows .
at 24 , he is the youngest show master on german television . " you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening . " despite these young stars on screen , the viewers are mainly older .
according to the german music information center in bonn , over 40 percent of those who buy schlager and popular folk music recordings are over the age of 50 .
the average age of viewers of folk music shows are around 60 years old , said tolar . " still , older people would also like to have something nice to look at , " said kahé . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl moik is known to be outspoken at times in poor taste .
his calling italians " spaghetti gluttons " in a show was not received well moik presented " musikantenstadl " - which means " musician 's barn " - for the past 25 years .
it is one of the most popular folk music television shows , and not just in the german-speaking world . " musikantenstadl " has also given guest performances in non-german speaking cities , including moscow , toronto , cape town , beijing and dubai . moik said his show was aimed at older people . " the young public goes to the disco on saturday nights , " moik told the austrian paper kleine zeitung .
" we 're a show for people over 40 .
i am not going to do a show for 17-year-olds .
i 'm too old for that . " moik said he doubted whether a younger presenter could attract younger viewers . " no , you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening , " he said .

fifteen years later , movie houses in europe are still fighting for survival . at the rex art-house cinema in bonn , a handful of film enthusiasts have gathered for the opening of the french film " l 'équipier . "
it 's a film about the relation between three people in a small coastal town in brittany .
it 's light on special effects star power , and it 's a film that wo n't run in most big cinemas outside of france , since it 's not designed for today 's mass market .
but the european union wants to ensure that such smaller , more nuanced films continue to be made . for that reason , it started a program 15 years ago to support european films , which were losing the fight against big hollywood movies . bildunterschrift : a scene from " star wars : episode iii , revenge of the sith " with their multi-million-dollar marketing budgets and crowd-pleasing stunts and stories , the americans were driving european films out of movie houses from lisbon to moscow . in 1995 , the eu 's film support program , media , extended its subsidy reach to movie theaters as well .
for the 2001 - 2005 budget period , media 's budget was 400 million euros -lrb- $ 484 million -rrb- . the prerequisite for getting the money from brussels was simple : one-third of a theater 's film program had to consist of european films .
still , for many cinema operators in europe , like rex manager dieter hertel , the decision to carry a good percentage of european movies is n't entirely because of the eu money they guarantee . " the quality of a film is the most important aspect for me , " he said .
" the bottom line is that the quality of films in europe is higher , for example , than that of films produced in america . " drawing people in since 2002 , the rex cinema has been a member of the european cinemas group , an association of european art house theaters .
the group has almost 500 members in more than 260 european cities .
more and more are joining , although european films are not exactly big money makers . " cinemas which show european and smaller films , which perhaps are n't as well known , have to really work hard to get people into the theaters , " said cornelia hammelmann , who works with the eu 's film support project in germany .
" that is exactly what we are trying to do with the media program . " she decides which movie theater or which film in germany gets money from the media funds .
according to her , the support gives theater operators the confidence , and means , to put films into their program which do n't often attract big crowds .
still , she insisted there is an interest among the general public for european film . " there is always going to be a public , for every nationality , for every subject matter , " she said .
" but it 's also important to attract younger audiences . " making it on its own ? movie theaters can receive up to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 60,500 -rrb- per year from the eu film support coffers .
about a third of media 's money goes toward financing special projects aimed at younger people , such as special showings for school groups .
young people have to be helped toward european films so that they can learn to recognize their value , according to hammelmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her goal is that , one day , movie theaters showing european movies wo n't be dependent on eu subsidies , as many today are , for their very existence .
but she admits , that day could be far away , if it ever arrives . " it would be fantastic if we could someday say that the films are successful on their own , that they are able to bring people into the theaters without our help , " she said .
" but that is not the case . " for cinema operator hertel , right now that goal looks unreachable .
last year his ticket sales declined by 12 percent .
all over europe , theaters are reporting falling box office returns , and not just for smaller european movies .
german ticket sales are down 20 percent compared to the first six months of last year , with italy and spain registering double figure declines .
hertel used to be able to use the eu money for advertising .
now he needs it just to survive .
" this year will be the first time that we 'll be absolutely dependent on these subsidies , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.07.2005 cinema on life support großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film attendance is down all over - for smaller films , that 's serious in 1990 , the eu launched the media program to provide support for european films , in danger of being driven to extinction by hollywood .
fifteen years later , movie houses in europe are still fighting for survival . at the rex art-house cinema in bonn , a handful of film enthusiasts have gathered for the opening of the french film " l 'équipier . "
it 's a film about the relation between three people in a small coastal town in brittany .
it 's light on special effects star power , and it 's a film that wo n't run in most big cinemas outside of france , since it 's not designed for today 's mass market .
but the european union wants to ensure that such smaller , more nuanced films continue to be made . for that reason , it started a program 15 years ago to support european films , which were losing the fight against big hollywood movies . bildunterschrift : a scene from " star wars : episode iii , revenge of the sith " with their multi-million-dollar marketing budgets and crowd-pleasing stunts and stories , the americans were driving european films out of movie houses from lisbon to moscow . in 1995 , the eu 's film support program , media , extended its subsidy reach to movie theaters as well .
for the 2001 - 2005 budget period , media 's budget was 400 million euros -lrb- $ 484 million -rrb- . the prerequisite for getting the money from brussels was simple : one-third of a theater 's film program had to consist of european films .
still , for many cinema operators in europe , like rex manager dieter hertel , the decision to carry a good percentage of european movies is n't entirely because of the eu money they guarantee . " the quality of a film is the most important aspect for me , " he said .
" the bottom line is that the quality of films in europe is higher , for example , than that of films produced in america . " drawing people in since 2002 , the rex cinema has been a member of the european cinemas group , an association of european art house theaters .
the group has almost 500 members in more than 260 european cities .
more and more are joining , although european films are not exactly big money makers . " cinemas which show european and smaller films , which perhaps are n't as well known , have to really work hard to get people into the theaters , " said cornelia hammelmann , who works with the eu 's film support project in germany .
" that is exactly what we are trying to do with the media program . " she decides which movie theater or which film in germany gets money from the media funds .
according to her , the support gives theater operators the confidence , and means , to put films into their program which do n't often attract big crowds .
still , she insisted there is an interest among the general public for european film . " there is always going to be a public , for every nationality , for every subject matter , " she said .
" but it 's also important to attract younger audiences . " making it on its own ? movie theaters can receive up to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 60,500 -rrb- per year from the eu film support coffers .
about a third of media 's money goes toward financing special projects aimed at younger people , such as special showings for school groups .
young people have to be helped toward european films so that they can learn to recognize their value , according to hammelmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her goal is that , one day , movie theaters showing european movies wo n't be dependent on eu subsidies , as many today are , for their very existence .
but she admits , that day could be far away , if it ever arrives . " it would be fantastic if we could someday say that the films are successful on their own , that they are able to bring people into the theaters without our help , " she said .
" but that is not the case . " for cinema operator hertel , right now that goal looks unreachable .
last year his ticket sales declined by 12 percent .
all over europe , theaters are reporting falling box office returns , and not just for smaller european movies .
german ticket sales are down 20 percent compared to the first six months of last year , with italy and spain registering double figure declines .
hertel used to be able to use the eu money for advertising .
now he needs it just to survive .
" this year will be the first time that we 'll be absolutely dependent on these subsidies , " he said .
at least the subsidies are n't threatened .

over the weekend , he opened a soccer exhibit - in the first floor of his office . most politicians like to wax rhapsodic about their athletic ability back in the day .
but gerhard schröder can actually back it up .
as a young man , the chancellor was known as an aggressive and hard-working striker in local leagues .
his talent , apparently , has not left him .
" the things he 's still able to do … " said jochen krannich , a schröder deputy assigned the job of overseeing sports issues . so it came as no surprise that the former player would open up a exhibit of german and world soccer history in the chancellery .
what soccer fan would n't want valuable soccer memorabilia in his office ? player jerseys , foosball the show " soccer and history - from bern 1954 to berlin 2006 " , opened last week in the first floor of the chancellery . surviving members of the legendary german side that captured the 1954 world cup in bern as well as german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger were on hand to open the exhibit with schröder . a mix of historical background , original player jerseys and trophies , the exhibit is designed to whet the appetites of german soccer fans a little under a year before the world cup starts .

" after all we want to show the world that we 're looking forward to the world cup . " schily scores one tourist and school groups will be able to take a tour of the collection , which includes a foosball table from the 1950s , by making an appointment .
the chancellery estimates that 40,000 people will do so in the coming year .
they wo n't be able to take a crack at the goal , though , and the foosball table was supposed to be off limits as well .
but at the time of the opening , the ball was missing from the table , courtesy of the german interior minister . " schily put that one in the goal , " said karl schlich , the chancellery spokesman . schlich said that not only the soccer , but the " rare " opportunity to get close to a seat of power would attract visitors .
as rare will be the life-size oil portraits of soccer legends like portugal 's eusebio , pele and franz beckenbauer .

darkazanli , 46 , was released from custody in hamburg a few hours later and climbed into a taxi without commenting . spain accuses him of being osama bin laden 's " permanent interlocutor and assistant " in europe and having provided the al qaeda network with logistical and financial support between 1997 and 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister brigitte zypries german justice minister brigitte zypries condemned the karlsruhe-based court 's decision as " another setback for the german government in the fight against international terrorism . " a spokesman for eu justice commissioner franco frattini said the decision was bad news for europe 's efforts to combat terrorism - which have again come under the spotlight since the july 7 attacks in london - but insisted it was up to germany to make the arrest warrant work . " the efficiency of the eu arrest warrant as such is not called into question , but it 's a matter of the german implementation law , " said friso roscam abbing . darkazanli was pictured on a 1999 wedding video alongside marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah , two of the suicide pilots in the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on the united states .
german authorities investigated darkazanli for several months after the attacks but never charged him . he was eventually detained in germany in october last year on an arrest warrant issued by high-profile spanish judge baltasar garzon .
but darkazanli 's lawyers argued that germans may be expelled and tried abroad only when the crimes they are accused of are not subject to prosecution at home . the government 's anger at the decision to free darkazanli reflects tensions between the authorities and the justice system over the prosecution in germany of suspects linked to the september 11 , 2001 attacks . several setbacks a moroccan man , mounir el motassadeq , who is accused of involvement in the attacks , is currently nearing the end of his retrial in hamburg .
motassadeq was sentenced in february 2003 to the maximum 15 years in prison on charges of membership of a terrorist organization and more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder for his alleged role in the so-called " hamburg cell " run by the lead september 11 hijacker , mohammed atta . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi , left , and mounir el motassadeq , right but a federal tribunal overturned the conviction and ordered a new trial .
a verdict is expected august 19 .
and another moroccan national , abdelghani mzoudi , who was tried on the same charges as motassadeq , was acquitted last october for lack of evidence . the karlsruhe-based federal court found that the new eu arrest warrant offered insufficient legal protection for german citizens and must now be implemented with a new german law that allows all extradition orders to be reviewed by german judges . the ruling will mean that all german citizens being held for extradition within the eu must be released until the new legislation is passed .
since the eu arrest warrant was passed in the wake of the september 11 attacks and implemented in august 2004 , at least 19 germans have been extradited to other eu member states for offences including drug dealing , child abuse and even nazi war crimes . investigators suspect darkazanli befriended al-shehhi , jarrah and atta in hamburg where they were studying .
darkazanli denies any terrorist activity and said he knew the three hijackers casually .

darkazanli , 46 , was released from custody in hamburg a few hours later and climbed into a taxi without commenting . spain accuses him of being osama bin laden 's " permanent interlocutor and assistant " in europe and having provided the al qaeda network with logistical and financial support between 1997 and 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister brigitte zypries german justice minister brigitte zypries condemned the karlsruhe-based court 's decision as " another setback for the german government in the fight against international terrorism .

german authorities investigated darkazanli for several months after the attacks but never charged him . he was eventually detained in germany in october last year on an arrest warrant issued by high-profile spanish judge baltasar garzon .
but darkazanli 's lawyers argued that germans may be expelled and tried abroad only when the crimes they are accused of are not subject to prosecution at home . the government 's anger at the decision to free darkazanli reflects tensions between the authorities and the justice system over the prosecution in germany of suspects linked to the september 11 , 2001 attacks . several setbacks a moroccan man , mounir el motassadeq , who is accused of involvement in the attacks , is currently nearing the end of his retrial in hamburg .

and another moroccan national , abdelghani mzoudi , who was tried on the same charges as motassadeq , was acquitted last october for lack of evidence . the karlsruhe-based federal court found that the new eu arrest warrant offered insufficient legal protection for german citizens and must now be implemented with a new german law that allows all extradition orders to be reviewed by german judges . the ruling will mean that all german citizens being held for extradition within the eu must be released until the new legislation is passed .
since the eu arrest warrant was passed in the wake of the september 11 attacks and implemented in august 2004 , at least 19 germans have been extradited to other eu member states for offences including drug dealing , child abuse and even nazi war crimes . investigators suspect darkazanli befriended al-shehhi , jarrah and atta in hamburg where they were studying .

darkazanli , 46 , was released from custody in hamburg a few hours later and climbed into a taxi without commenting . spain accuses him of being osama bin laden 's " permanent interlocutor and assistant " in europe and having provided the al qaeda network with logistical and financial support between 1997 and 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister brigitte zypries german justice minister brigitte zypries condemned the karlsruhe-based court 's decision as " another setback for the german government in the fight against international terrorism . " a spokesman for eu justice commissioner franco frattini said the decision was bad news for europe 's efforts to combat terrorism - which have again come under the spotlight since the july 7 attacks in london - but insisted it was up to germany to make the arrest warrant work .

darkazanli , 46 , was released from custody in hamburg a few hours later and climbed into a taxi without commenting . spain accuses him of being osama bin laden 's " permanent interlocutor and assistant " in europe and having provided the al qaeda network with logistical and financial support between 1997 and 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister brigitte zypries german justice minister brigitte zypries condemned the karlsruhe-based court 's decision as " another setback for the german government in the fight against international terrorism . " a spokesman for eu justice commissioner franco frattini said the decision was bad news for europe 's efforts to combat terrorism - which have again come under the spotlight since the july 7 attacks in london - but insisted it was up to germany to make the arrest warrant work . " the efficiency of the eu arrest warrant as such is not called into question , but it 's a matter of the german implementation law , " said friso roscam abbing . darkazanli was pictured on a 1999 wedding video alongside marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah , two of the suicide pilots in the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on the united states .
german authorities investigated darkazanli for several months after the attacks but never charged him . he was eventually detained in germany in october last year on an arrest warrant issued by high-profile spanish judge baltasar garzon .
but darkazanli 's lawyers argued that germans may be expelled and tried abroad only when the crimes they are accused of are not subject to prosecution at home . the government 's anger at the decision to free darkazanli reflects tensions between the authorities and the justice system over the prosecution in germany of suspects linked to the september 11 , 2001 attacks . several setbacks a moroccan man , mounir el motassadeq , who is accused of involvement in the attacks , is currently nearing the end of his retrial in hamburg .
motassadeq was sentenced in february 2003 to the maximum 15 years in prison on charges of membership of a terrorist organization and more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder for his alleged role in the so-called " hamburg cell " run by the lead september 11 hijacker , mohammed atta . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi , left , and mounir el motassadeq , right but a federal tribunal overturned the conviction and ordered a new trial .
a verdict is expected august 19 .
and another moroccan national , abdelghani mzoudi , who was tried on the same charges as motassadeq , was acquitted last october for lack of evidence . the karlsruhe-based federal court found that the new eu arrest warrant offered insufficient legal protection for german citizens and must now be implemented with a new german law that allows all extradition orders to be reviewed by german judges . the ruling will mean that all german citizens being held for extradition within the eu must be released until the new legislation is passed .
since the eu arrest warrant was passed in the wake of the september 11 attacks and implemented in august 2004 , at least 19 germans have been extradited to other eu member states for offences including drug dealing , child abuse and even nazi war crimes . investigators suspect darkazanli befriended al-shehhi , jarrah and atta in hamburg where they were studying .
darkazanli denies any terrorist activity and said he knew the three hijackers casually .

darkazanli , 46 , was released from custody in hamburg a few hours later and climbed into a taxi without commenting . spain accuses him of being osama bin laden 's " permanent interlocutor and assistant " in europe and having provided the al qaeda network with logistical and financial support between 1997 and 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister brigitte zypries german justice minister brigitte zypries condemned the karlsruhe-based court 's decision as " another setback for the german government in the fight against international terrorism . " a spokesman for eu justice commissioner franco frattini said the decision was bad news for europe 's efforts to combat terrorism - which have again come under the spotlight since the july 7 attacks in london - but insisted it was up to germany to make the arrest warrant work .

" if everything goes well , we are ready to send monitors whenever the agreement is signed , " said the spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who is expected to visit indonesia next week . the mission , which would only be sent if the parties request it , would first seek the cooperation of the association of south east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- and its members in supervising the future accord . the indonesian government and the free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- announced on sunday after the latest round of negotiations in finland that they had reached a deal to end 30 years of fighting in the separatist province .
they plan to sign a memorandum of understanding next month . both sides agreed to establish a monitoring mission to check on progress and said they hoped it would be run by the eu and a number of asian countries .
the agreement aims to bring a " peaceful , comprehensive and sustainable solution " to end a conflict that has raged in the province since 1976 and cost nearly 15,000 lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an indonesian soldier mans his position on an armored vehicle during a patrol in the provincial capital of banda aceh , aceh province , tuesday , may 20 , 2003 .
gam gave up its demand for full independence and said it would disarm , while the government has announced it will withdraw its troops from the province once the rebels hand in their weapons .
participants agreed that a peace deal had seemed unthinkable after jakarta declared martial law and launched a major military offensive in aceh two years ago . after the tsunami but renewed efforts to make peace were prompted by a need for international aid to reach aceh , which bore the brunt of last december 's tsunami .
more than 131,000 people in the province were killed . in the conclusions of their meeting on monday , the eu ministers also pledged to continue to crack down on terrorism , promised new support for afghanistan and sudan 's troubled darfur region , and renewed condemnation of uzbekistan .
they said states must " have the necessary measures , as appropriate , in place to confront this threat , be they to track terrorists down , protect potential targets , prepare for an attack or prevent people turning to terrorism . " on afghanistan , the ministers welcomed the planned deployment of an eu monitoring mission for the september 18 general elections , in conclusions from their meeting .
" the eu stands ready to continue its efforts at establishing a sustainable democratic system in afghanistan for the lasting security of the afghan people , " they said . the ministers also appointed a special representative for sudan , former finnish cooperation and development minister pekka haavisto , and adopted a " joint-action " supporting the african union mission in darfur .
they also renewed their condemnation of uzbekistan for failing to fully investigate a massacre in the east of the country on may 13 . condemnation for uzbekistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general view of a rally in downtown andijan on friday , may 13 , 2005 .
armed protesters freed inmates from a prison and clashed with police and security forces friday as protests over a trial of muslim businessmen exploded into unrest in an eastern uzbek city , leaving at least nine people killed and 34 wounded .
-lrb- ap photo / efrem lukatsky -rrb- " the council remains profoundly concerned about the situation in uzbekistan and condemns the uzbek authorities ' refusal to allow an independent international inquiry into the recent events in andijan , " they said . they said the bloc was considering launching a mission with the united nations and the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , using the osce 's so-called moscow mechanism .
the mechanism allows for an ad hoc team of experts to be established and sent to an osce member states to assist in resolving its problems . according to a un report , the crackdown by uzbek forces on demonstrators in andijan may have been a " mass killing " in which between 200 and 700 people died in a single shooting .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.07.2005 -pipe- 12:00 utc a german may not replace ecb 's issing the european central bank 's chief economist otmar issing need not automatically be replaced by a german when he retires from the bank 's six-strong executive board next year , luxembourg central bank chief yves mersch said on monday .
" let 's keep to the -lrb- maastricht -rrb- treaty .
there 's nothing automatic in the process .
the eu treaty states that the best man for the job should be appointed , " mersch told the news agency dpa-afx .
issing , who came to the ecb from the bundesbank and is widely regarded as one of the most influential people on the executive board , is scheduled to retire in 2006 .
although germany is likely to want another german to replace him , smaller euro-zone countries argue it is their turn to have a seat on the board , which is responsible for the day-to-day running of the world 's second most important central bank , after the us federal reserve .

darkazanli , 46 , was released from custody in hamburg a few hours later and climbed into a taxi without commenting . spain accuses him of being osama bin laden 's " permanent interlocutor and assistant " in europe and having provided the al qaeda network with logistical and financial support between 1997 and 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister brigitte zypries german justice minister brigitte zypries condemned the karlsruhe-based court 's decision as " another setback for the german government in the fight against international terrorism .

german authorities investigated darkazanli for several months after the attacks but never charged him . he was eventually detained in germany in october last year on an arrest warrant issued by high-profile spanish judge baltasar garzon .
but darkazanli 's lawyers argued that germans may be expelled and tried abroad only when the crimes they are accused of are not subject to prosecution at home . the government 's anger at the decision to free darkazanli reflects tensions between the authorities and the justice system over the prosecution in germany of suspects linked to the september 11 , 2001 attacks . several setbacks a moroccan man , mounir el motassadeq , who is accused of involvement in the attacks , is currently nearing the end of his retrial in hamburg .

since the eu arrest warrant was passed in the wake of the september 11 attacks and implemented in august 2004 , at least 19 germans have been extradited to other eu member states for offences including drug dealing , child abuse and even nazi war crimes . investigators suspect darkazanli befriended al-shehhi , jarrah and atta in hamburg where they were studying .

but darkazanli 's lawyers argued that germans may be expelled and tried abroad only when the crimes they are accused of are not subject to prosecution at home . the government 's anger at the decision to free darkazanli reflects tensions between the authorities and the justice system over the prosecution in germany of suspects linked to the september 11 , 2001 attacks . several setbacks a moroccan man , mounir el motassadeq , who is accused of involvement in the attacks , is currently nearing the end of his retrial in hamburg .
motassadeq was sentenced in february 2003 to the maximum 15 years in prison on charges of membership of a terrorist organization and more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder for his alleged role in the so-called " hamburg cell " run by the lead september 11 hijacker , mohammed atta . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi , left , and mounir el motassadeq , right but a federal tribunal overturned the conviction and ordered a new trial .
a verdict is expected august 19 .
and another moroccan national , abdelghani mzoudi , who was tried on the same charges as motassadeq , was acquitted last october for lack of evidence . the karlsruhe-based federal court found that the new eu arrest warrant offered insufficient legal protection for german citizens and must now be implemented with a new german law that allows all extradition orders to be reviewed by german judges . the ruling will mean that all german citizens being held for extradition within the eu must be released until the new legislation is passed .
since the eu arrest warrant was passed in the wake of the september 11 attacks and implemented in august 2004 , at least 19 germans have been extradited to other eu member states for offences including drug dealing , child abuse and even nazi war crimes . investigators suspect darkazanli befriended al-shehhi , jarrah and atta in hamburg where they were studying .
darkazanli denies any terrorist activity and said he knew the three hijackers casually .

" let 's keep to the -lrb- maastricht -rrb- treaty .
there 's nothing automatic in the process .
the eu treaty states that the best man for the job should be appointed , " mersch told the news agency dpa-afx .
issing , who came to the ecb from the bundesbank and is widely regarded as one of the most influential people on the executive board , is scheduled to retire in 2006 .
although germany is likely to want another german to replace him , smaller euro-zone countries argue it is their turn to have a seat on the board , which is responsible for the day-to-day running of the world 's second most important central bank , after the us federal reserve .
however , mersch added that " as a luxembourger , i 'm a realist . "
and so far , the euro zone 's three biggest economies , france , germany and italy , had always held a seat on the board .
as head of luxembourg 's central bank , mersch sits on the ecb 's decision-making governing council , which is consulted when executive board members are appointed .
but the final decision rests with the eu heads of government . dw-world.de eads finds way out of crisis the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- on saturday resolved months of wrangling between shareholders and named the group 's new leaders , giving a german the nod for the first time to oversee airbus .

should he surprise everyone with a no vote , the chancellor plans to continue to govern . those in the opposition hoping gerhard schröder would step down should köhler reject the bundestag 's motion for early federal elections this fall , will be disappointed .
the chancellor announced through his party 's chairman that he planned to continue to govern . chairman franz münterfering told the welt am sonntag that " it would not be good for the country " should köhler decide against new elections , but that schröder would nevertheless continue to govern until scheduled elections in september 2006 .
opposition to the schröder government 's economic reform agenda is widespread among germans , and the lack of a majority in germany 's upper house of parliament will mean schröder will spend his remaining year and a half as a " lame duck chancellor " should his call for new elections not go through . spiegel : köhler will approve new elections but he might not have to worry too much .
according to a report in der spiegel , köhler has already decided to approve the chancellor 's call for new elections , a decision he will announced this friday . in the three weeks since schröder intentionally lost a vote-of-confidence in the bundestag , köhler has been mulling whether to approve the chancellor 's highly unusual and controversial move .
according to the german constitution , a chancellor can only call for new elections if facing a serious government crisis . constitution experts have spent the last few weeks debating whether or not schröder is allowed to use the constitutional clause as an instrument to seek a new mandate for his government . köhler , a member of the opposition christian democratic union party , was not pleased with the way in which the german constitution was being manipulated - with the approval of his own party - to force new elections . population behind early elections but he will likely decide to approve it , and the majority of the german population looks to be behind him .
a poll released on sunday indicated that 75 percent of the population is in favour of early elections , with only 18 percent against it . among those against is green party parliamentarian werner schulz , a lawyer who plans to file suit in the constitutional court in karlsruhe should köhler approve the measure .
" this move angers me ... because our parliamentarian democracy requires … transparency , clarity and truth , and such measures are dishonorable , " he wrote in the latest issue of der spiegel . experts say the court is not likely to agree with schulz 's call to stop the process . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany waits on early election decision will he or wo n't he ?

the agreement aims to bring a " peaceful , comprehensive and sustainable solution " to end a conflict that has raged in the province since 1976 and cost nearly 15,000 lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an indonesian soldier mans his position on an armored vehicle during a patrol in the provincial capital of banda aceh , aceh province , tuesday , may 20 , 2003 .
gam gave up its demand for full independence and said it would disarm , while the government has announced it will withdraw its troops from the province once the rebels hand in their weapons .
participants agreed that a peace deal had seemed unthinkable after jakarta declared martial law and launched a major military offensive in aceh two years ago . after the tsunami but renewed efforts to make peace were prompted by a need for international aid to reach aceh , which bore the brunt of last december 's tsunami .
more than 131,000 people in the province were killed . in the conclusions of their meeting on monday , the eu ministers also pledged to continue to crack down on terrorism , promised new support for afghanistan and sudan 's troubled darfur region , and renewed condemnation of uzbekistan .
they said states must " have the necessary measures , as appropriate , in place to confront this threat , be they to track terrorists down , protect potential targets , prepare for an attack or prevent people turning to terrorism . " on afghanistan , the ministers welcomed the planned deployment of an eu monitoring mission for the september 18 general elections , in conclusions from their meeting .
" the eu stands ready to continue its efforts at establishing a sustainable democratic system in afghanistan for the lasting security of the afghan people , " they said . the ministers also appointed a special representative for sudan , former finnish cooperation and development minister pekka haavisto , and adopted a " joint-action " supporting the african union mission in darfur .
they also renewed their condemnation of uzbekistan for failing to fully investigate a massacre in the east of the country on may 13 . condemnation for uzbekistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general view of a rally in downtown andijan on friday , may 13 , 2005 .

the mechanism allows for an ad hoc team of experts to be established and sent to an osce member states to assist in resolving its problems . according to a un report , the crackdown by uzbek forces on demonstrators in andijan may have been a " mass killing " in which between 200 and 700 people died in a single shooting .
uzbekistan has fixed the death toll at 187 and blamed islamic militants . solana was also to report on his middle east visit , with the ministers likely to confirm their support for the israeli withdrawal from the gaza strip .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.07.2005 a swan song for german folk music ? 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heino wants to leave before the party 's over two icons of the german-speaking popular folk music scene are retiring this year : heino and karl moik .
what will their departure mean for the future of this genre ? after more than 50 years on stage , heino shocked the folk music world last month by announcing his retirement .
the platinum-blond singer with his trademark dark glasses is one of the most successful german recording artists , selling over 50 million records worldwide . at the same time , the famous folk music television show " musikantenstadl " informed host karl moik that it was not renewing his contract .
unofficially , the 67-year-old is being " sorted out " and will most likely be replaced with someone younger . one might think that the departures of these old stars could be part of a push to give folk music a younger face - and consequently , younger followers .
but stefan kahé , spokesman for record label koch universal , which holds a 70 percent market share in this sector , said it was simply a normal development . " it 's basically something very natural to retire , " said kahé . letting the sun in there are certainly enough young stars waiting to follow in heino 's and moik 's footsteps , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie hertel and stefan mross have been a couple professionally and privately for years the young dream couple of folk music , singer stefanie hertel and trumpeter stefan mross , have become extremely popular over the past few years . günter tolar , head of the working group for promoting musical entertainment in austria arge , which organizes the annual folk music competition " grand prix der volksmusik , " said heino and moik had been role models for a long time . " but one ca n't overlook what huge shadows such ' greats ' cast , which block the sun for the subsequent generation , " said tolar , a former presenter for austrian television channel orf . still , age was not the issue here .
" whether an interpreter is popular and attracts viewers doesn ’ t depend on their youth , but rather charisma and what message they are communicating in their songs , " said tolar . music with traditional ties many people may find it difficult to understand the long running popularity of folk music .
but it is a central element of german-speaking culture in europe . " folk music is not just a marginal phenomenon of music , " said dr. gisela probst-effah from the institute for musical folklore at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mountain landscape relates the feeling of an ideal world this genre mostly involves newly composed or adaptations of traditional music and songs .
they often generate regional associations , like yodeling , or contain texts with a hint of dialect and are preferably presented in a rural idyll in traditional costumes , like dirndls or lederhosen . " this look gives the appearance of ties to tradition , timelessness and independence from changing fashions , " said probst-effah . according to kahé , popular folk music is precisely about passing on tradition . " it 's about something preserving , something conservative , " he said . the concept of an " ideal world " also plays a role .
" these songs deal with topics like nature , heimat , happy love or an idealized childhood in an ideal world with intact social relationships , " said probst-effah . " i portray the ideal world in my songs because i want to have an ideal world , " heino has said in interviews .
" but it was clear to me that i would never get the nobel prize for my lyrics . "
heino said he is retiring to spend time with this wife , who suffered a heart attack last year . the media 's strong influence figures by the german association of the phonographic industry showed that last year , german pop schlager and folk music made up for 9.8 percent of the total sales of 1.75 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.19 billion -rrb- on the german market .
in comparison , pop music was responsible for 38.8 percent of sales , and rock for 18.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : folk music duo maria und margot hellwig have appeared in television shows for years but while these sales figures appear marginal , popular folk music 's true success lies in its media presence .
this genre would not be what it is without the media , in particular highly commercialized folk music shows on television .
programs such as " musikantenstadl " reach millions of viewers . while there may not be such a strong trend towards younger recording stars , there is " a changing of the guard " in the media sector , said kahé . mross , 29 , hosts a weekly show on german public television .
florian silbereisen , who started his career at age 10 playing the accordion on " musikantenstadl , " is now a regular presenter of various folk music shows .
at 24 , he is the youngest show master on german television . " you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening . " despite these young stars on screen , the viewers are mainly older .
according to the german music information center in bonn , over 40 percent of those who buy schlager and popular folk music recordings are over the age of 50 .
the average age of viewers of folk music shows are around 60 years old , said tolar . " still , older people would also like to have something nice to look at , " said kahé . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl moik is known to be outspoken at times in poor taste .
his calling italians " spaghetti gluttons " in a show was not received well moik presented " musikantenstadl " - which means " musician 's barn " - for the past 25 years .
it is one of the most popular folk music television shows , and not just in the german-speaking world . " musikantenstadl " has also given guest performances in non-german speaking cities , including moscow , toronto , cape town , beijing and dubai . moik said his show was aimed at older people . " the young public goes to the disco on saturday nights , " moik told the austrian paper kleine zeitung .
" we 're a show for people over 40 .
i am not going to do a show for 17-year-olds .
i 'm too old for that . " moik said he doubted whether a younger presenter could attract younger viewers . " no , you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening , " he said .

" if everything goes well , we are ready to send monitors whenever the agreement is signed , " said the spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who is expected to visit indonesia next week . the mission , which would only be sent if the parties request it , would first seek the cooperation of the association of south east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- and its members in supervising the future accord . the indonesian government and the free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- announced on sunday after the latest round of negotiations in finland that they had reached a deal to end 30 years of fighting in the separatist province .
they plan to sign a memorandum of understanding next month . both sides agreed to establish a monitoring mission to check on progress and said they hoped it would be run by the eu and a number of asian countries .
the agreement aims to bring a " peaceful , comprehensive and sustainable solution " to end a conflict that has raged in the province since 1976 and cost nearly 15,000 lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an indonesian soldier mans his position on an armored vehicle during a patrol in the provincial capital of banda aceh , aceh province , tuesday , may 20 , 2003 .
gam gave up its demand for full independence and said it would disarm , while the government has announced it will withdraw its troops from the province once the rebels hand in their weapons .
participants agreed that a peace deal had seemed unthinkable after jakarta declared martial law and launched a major military offensive in aceh two years ago . after the tsunami but renewed efforts to make peace were prompted by a need for international aid to reach aceh , which bore the brunt of last december 's tsunami .
more than 131,000 people in the province were killed . in the conclusions of their meeting on monday , the eu ministers also pledged to continue to crack down on terrorism , promised new support for afghanistan and sudan 's troubled darfur region , and renewed condemnation of uzbekistan .
they said states must " have the necessary measures , as appropriate , in place to confront this threat , be they to track terrorists down , protect potential targets , prepare for an attack or prevent people turning to terrorism . " on afghanistan , the ministers welcomed the planned deployment of an eu monitoring mission for the september 18 general elections , in conclusions from their meeting .
" the eu stands ready to continue its efforts at establishing a sustainable democratic system in afghanistan for the lasting security of the afghan people , " they said . the ministers also appointed a special representative for sudan , former finnish cooperation and development minister pekka haavisto , and adopted a " joint-action " supporting the african union mission in darfur .
they also renewed their condemnation of uzbekistan for failing to fully investigate a massacre in the east of the country on may 13 . condemnation for uzbekistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general view of a rally in downtown andijan on friday , may 13 , 2005 .

-lrb- ap photo / efrem lukatsky -rrb- " the council remains profoundly concerned about the situation in uzbekistan and condemns the uzbek authorities ' refusal to allow an independent international inquiry into the recent events in andijan , " they said . they said the bloc was considering launching a mission with the united nations and the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , using the osce 's so-called moscow mechanism .
the mechanism allows for an ad hoc team of experts to be established and sent to an osce member states to assist in resolving its problems . according to a un report , the crackdown by uzbek forces on demonstrators in andijan may have been a " mass killing " in which between 200 and 700 people died in a single shooting .
uzbekistan has fixed the death toll at 187 and blamed islamic militants . solana was also to report on his middle east visit , with the ministers likely to confirm their support for the israeli withdrawal from the gaza strip .

what will their departure mean for the future of this genre ? after more than 50 years on stage , heino shocked the folk music world last month by announcing his retirement .
the platinum-blond singer with his trademark dark glasses is one of the most successful german recording artists , selling over 50 million records worldwide . at the same time , the famous folk music television show " musikantenstadl " informed host karl moik that it was not renewing his contract .
unofficially , the 67-year-old is being " sorted out " and will most likely be replaced with someone younger . one might think that the departures of these old stars could be part of a push to give folk music a younger face - and consequently , younger followers .
but stefan kahé , spokesman for record label koch universal , which holds a 70 percent market share in this sector , said it was simply a normal development . " it 's basically something very natural to retire , " said kahé . letting the sun in there are certainly enough young stars waiting to follow in heino 's and moik 's footsteps , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie hertel and stefan mross have been a couple professionally and privately for years the young dream couple of folk music , singer stefanie hertel and trumpeter stefan mross , have become extremely popular over the past few years . günter tolar , head of the working group for promoting musical entertainment in austria arge , which organizes the annual folk music competition " grand prix der volksmusik , " said heino and moik had been role models for a long time . " but one ca n't overlook what huge shadows such ' greats ' cast , which block the sun for the subsequent generation , " said tolar , a former presenter for austrian television channel orf . still , age was not the issue here .
" whether an interpreter is popular and attracts viewers doesn ’ t depend on their youth , but rather charisma and what message they are communicating in their songs , " said tolar . music with traditional ties many people may find it difficult to understand the long running popularity of folk music .
but it is a central element of german-speaking culture in europe . " folk music is not just a marginal phenomenon of music , " said dr. gisela probst-effah from the institute for musical folklore at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mountain landscape relates the feeling of an ideal world this genre mostly involves newly composed or adaptations of traditional music and songs .
they often generate regional associations , like yodeling , or contain texts with a hint of dialect and are preferably presented in a rural idyll in traditional costumes , like dirndls or lederhosen . " this look gives the appearance of ties to tradition , timelessness and independence from changing fashions , " said probst-effah . according to kahé , popular folk music is precisely about passing on tradition . " it 's about something preserving , something conservative , " he said . the concept of an " ideal world " also plays a role .
" these songs deal with topics like nature , heimat , happy love or an idealized childhood in an ideal world with intact social relationships , " said probst-effah . " i portray the ideal world in my songs because i want to have an ideal world , " heino has said in interviews .
" but it was clear to me that i would never get the nobel prize for my lyrics . "
heino said he is retiring to spend time with this wife , who suffered a heart attack last year . the media 's strong influence figures by the german association of the phonographic industry showed that last year , german pop schlager and folk music made up for 9.8 percent of the total sales of 1.75 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.19 billion -rrb- on the german market .

what will their departure mean for the future of this genre ? after more than 50 years on stage , heino shocked the folk music world last month by announcing his retirement .
the platinum-blond singer with his trademark dark glasses is one of the most successful german recording artists , selling over 50 million records worldwide . at the same time , the famous folk music television show " musikantenstadl " informed host karl moik that it was not renewing his contract .
unofficially , the 67-year-old is being " sorted out " and will most likely be replaced with someone younger . one might think that the departures of these old stars could be part of a push to give folk music a younger face - and consequently , younger followers .
but stefan kahé , spokesman for record label koch universal , which holds a 70 percent market share in this sector , said it was simply a normal development . " it 's basically something very natural to retire , " said kahé . letting the sun in there are certainly enough young stars waiting to follow in heino 's and moik 's footsteps , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie hertel and stefan mross have been a couple professionally and privately for years the young dream couple of folk music , singer stefanie hertel and trumpeter stefan mross , have become extremely popular over the past few years . günter tolar , head of the working group for promoting musical entertainment in austria arge , which organizes the annual folk music competition " grand prix der volksmusik , " said heino and moik had been role models for a long time . " but one ca n't overlook what huge shadows such ' greats ' cast , which block the sun for the subsequent generation , " said tolar , a former presenter for austrian television channel orf . still , age was not the issue here .
" whether an interpreter is popular and attracts viewers doesn ’ t depend on their youth , but rather charisma and what message they are communicating in their songs , " said tolar . music with traditional ties many people may find it difficult to understand the long running popularity of folk music .
but it is a central element of german-speaking culture in europe . " folk music is not just a marginal phenomenon of music , " said dr. gisela probst-effah from the institute for musical folklore at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mountain landscape relates the feeling of an ideal world this genre mostly involves newly composed or adaptations of traditional music and songs .
they often generate regional associations , like yodeling , or contain texts with a hint of dialect and are preferably presented in a rural idyll in traditional costumes , like dirndls or lederhosen . " this look gives the appearance of ties to tradition , timelessness and independence from changing fashions , " said probst-effah . according to kahé , popular folk music is precisely about passing on tradition . " it 's about something preserving , something conservative , " he said . the concept of an " ideal world " also plays a role .
" these songs deal with topics like nature , heimat , happy love or an idealized childhood in an ideal world with intact social relationships , " said probst-effah . " i portray the ideal world in my songs because i want to have an ideal world , " heino has said in interviews .
" but it was clear to me that i would never get the nobel prize for my lyrics . "
heino said he is retiring to spend time with this wife , who suffered a heart attack last year . the media 's strong influence figures by the german association of the phonographic industry showed that last year , german pop schlager and folk music made up for 9.8 percent of the total sales of 1.75 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.19 billion -rrb- on the german market .
in comparison , pop music was responsible for 38.8 percent of sales , and rock for 18.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : folk music duo maria und margot hellwig have appeared in television shows for years but while these sales figures appear marginal , popular folk music 's true success lies in its media presence .
this genre would not be what it is without the media , in particular highly commercialized folk music shows on television .
programs such as " musikantenstadl " reach millions of viewers . while there may not be such a strong trend towards younger recording stars , there is " a changing of the guard " in the media sector , said kahé . mross , 29 , hosts a weekly show on german public television .
florian silbereisen , who started his career at age 10 playing the accordion on " musikantenstadl , " is now a regular presenter of various folk music shows .
at 24 , he is the youngest show master on german television . " you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening . " despite these young stars on screen , the viewers are mainly older .
according to the german music information center in bonn , over 40 percent of those who buy schlager and popular folk music recordings are over the age of 50 .
the average age of viewers of folk music shows are around 60 years old , said tolar . " still , older people would also like to have something nice to look at , " said kahé . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl moik is known to be outspoken at times in poor taste .
his calling italians " spaghetti gluttons " in a show was not received well moik presented " musikantenstadl " - which means " musician 's barn " - for the past 25 years .
it is one of the most popular folk music television shows , and not just in the german-speaking world . " musikantenstadl " has also given guest performances in non-german speaking cities , including moscow , toronto , cape town , beijing and dubai . moik said his show was aimed at older people . " the young public goes to the disco on saturday nights , " moik told the austrian paper kleine zeitung .
" we 're a show for people over 40 .
i am not going to do a show for 17-year-olds .
i 'm too old for that . " moik said he doubted whether a younger presenter could attract younger viewers . " no , you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening , " he said .

should he surprise everyone with a no vote , the chancellor plans to continue to govern . those in the opposition hoping gerhard schröder would step down should köhler reject the bundestag 's motion for early federal elections this fall , will be disappointed .
the chancellor announced through his party 's chairman that he planned to continue to govern . chairman franz münterfering told the welt am sonntag that " it would not be good for the country " should köhler decide against new elections , but that schröder would nevertheless continue to govern until scheduled elections in september 2006 .
opposition to the schröder government 's economic reform agenda is widespread among germans , and the lack of a majority in germany 's upper house of parliament will mean schröder will spend his remaining year and a half as a " lame duck chancellor " should his call for new elections not go through . spiegel : köhler will approve new elections but he might not have to worry too much .

his love for the game has n't let up since .
over the weekend , he opened a soccer exhibit - in the first floor of his office . most politicians like to wax rhapsodic about their athletic ability back in the day .
but gerhard schröder can actually back it up .
as a young man , the chancellor was known as an aggressive and hard-working striker in local leagues .
his talent , apparently , has not left him .
" the things he 's still able to do … " said jochen krannich , a schröder deputy assigned the job of overseeing sports issues . so it came as no surprise that the former player would open up a exhibit of german and world soccer history in the chancellery .
what soccer fan would n't want valuable soccer memorabilia in his office ? player jerseys , foosball the show " soccer and history - from bern 1954 to berlin 2006 " , opened last week in the first floor of the chancellery . surviving members of the legendary german side that captured the 1954 world cup in bern as well as german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger were on hand to open the exhibit with schröder . a mix of historical background , original player jerseys and trophies , the exhibit is designed to whet the appetites of german soccer fans a little under a year before the world cup starts .

" after all we want to show the world that we 're looking forward to the world cup . " schily scores one tourist and school groups will be able to take a tour of the collection , which includes a foosball table from the 1950s , by making an appointment .
the chancellery estimates that 40,000 people will do so in the coming year .
they wo n't be able to take a crack at the goal , though , and the foosball table was supposed to be off limits as well .
but at the time of the opening , the ball was missing from the table , courtesy of the german interior minister . " schily put that one in the goal , " said karl schlich , the chancellery spokesman . schlich said that not only the soccer , but the " rare " opportunity to get close to a seat of power would attract visitors .
as rare will be the life-size oil portraits of soccer legends like portugal 's eusebio , pele and franz beckenbauer .
they will hang in the chancellery until 2006 , said schlich , even should the less soccer-enthusiastic christian democratic union move in earlier than planned following early elections this fall . oliver samson -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schily says terror wo n't stop world cup germany 's interior minister otto schily issued a defiant statement in response to concerns that the 2006 world cup was in danger after the london bombings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.07.2005 cinema on life support großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film attendance is down all over - for smaller films , that 's serious in 1990 , the eu launched the media program to provide support for european films , in danger of being driven to extinction by hollywood .
fifteen years later , movie houses in europe are still fighting for survival . at the rex art-house cinema in bonn , a handful of film enthusiasts have gathered for the opening of the french film " l 'équipier . "
it 's a film about the relation between three people in a small coastal town in brittany .
it 's light on special effects star power , and it 's a film that wo n't run in most big cinemas outside of france , since it 's not designed for today 's mass market .
but the european union wants to ensure that such smaller , more nuanced films continue to be made . for that reason , it started a program 15 years ago to support european films , which were losing the fight against big hollywood movies . bildunterschrift : a scene from " star wars : episode iii , revenge of the sith " with their multi-million-dollar marketing budgets and crowd-pleasing stunts and stories , the americans were driving european films out of movie houses from lisbon to moscow . in 1995 , the eu 's film support program , media , extended its subsidy reach to movie theaters as well .
for the 2001 - 2005 budget period , media 's budget was 400 million euros -lrb- $ 484 million -rrb- . the prerequisite for getting the money from brussels was simple : one-third of a theater 's film program had to consist of european films .
still , for many cinema operators in europe , like rex manager dieter hertel , the decision to carry a good percentage of european movies is n't entirely because of the eu money they guarantee . " the quality of a film is the most important aspect for me , " he said .
" the bottom line is that the quality of films in europe is higher , for example , than that of films produced in america . " drawing people in since 2002 , the rex cinema has been a member of the european cinemas group , an association of european art house theaters .
the group has almost 500 members in more than 260 european cities .
more and more are joining , although european films are not exactly big money makers . " cinemas which show european and smaller films , which perhaps are n't as well known , have to really work hard to get people into the theaters , " said cornelia hammelmann , who works with the eu 's film support project in germany .
" that is exactly what we are trying to do with the media program . " she decides which movie theater or which film in germany gets money from the media funds .
according to her , the support gives theater operators the confidence , and means , to put films into their program which do n't often attract big crowds .
still , she insisted there is an interest among the general public for european film . " there is always going to be a public , for every nationality , for every subject matter , " she said .
" but it 's also important to attract younger audiences . " making it on its own ? movie theaters can receive up to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 60,500 -rrb- per year from the eu film support coffers .
about a third of media 's money goes toward financing special projects aimed at younger people , such as special showings for school groups .
young people have to be helped toward european films so that they can learn to recognize their value , according to hammelmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her goal is that , one day , movie theaters showing european movies wo n't be dependent on eu subsidies , as many today are , for their very existence .
but she admits , that day could be far away , if it ever arrives . " it would be fantastic if we could someday say that the films are successful on their own , that they are able to bring people into the theaters without our help , " she said .
" but that is not the case . " for cinema operator hertel , right now that goal looks unreachable .
last year his ticket sales declined by 12 percent .
all over europe , theaters are reporting falling box office returns , and not just for smaller european movies .
german ticket sales are down 20 percent compared to the first six months of last year , with italy and spain registering double figure declines .

bets are on that german president horst köhler will dissolve parliament and call for an early general election in september .
his decision will come this week in a tv broadcast . köhler has until july 22 to make the high-stakes decision about whether to approve or reject chancellor gerhard schröder 's scheme of prompting a national poll one year ahead of schedule . according to a report in der spiegel , köhler intends to make his decision known in a television broadcast .

fifteen years later , movie houses in europe are still fighting for survival . at the rex art-house cinema in bonn , a handful of film enthusiasts have gathered for the opening of the french film " l 'équipier . "
it 's a film about the relation between three people in a small coastal town in brittany .
it 's light on special effects star power , and it 's a film that wo n't run in most big cinemas outside of france , since it 's not designed for today 's mass market .
but the european union wants to ensure that such smaller , more nuanced films continue to be made . for that reason , it started a program 15 years ago to support european films , which were losing the fight against big hollywood movies . bildunterschrift : a scene from " star wars : episode iii , revenge of the sith " with their multi-million-dollar marketing budgets and crowd-pleasing stunts and stories , the americans were driving european films out of movie houses from lisbon to moscow . in 1995 , the eu 's film support program , media , extended its subsidy reach to movie theaters as well .

about a third of media 's money goes toward financing special projects aimed at younger people , such as special showings for school groups .
young people have to be helped toward european films so that they can learn to recognize their value , according to hammelmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her goal is that , one day , movie theaters showing european movies wo n't be dependent on eu subsidies , as many today are , for their very existence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.07.2005 cinema on life support großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : film attendance is down all over - for smaller films , that 's serious in 1990 , the eu launched the media program to provide support for european films , in danger of being driven to extinction by hollywood .
fifteen years later , movie houses in europe are still fighting for survival . at the rex art-house cinema in bonn , a handful of film enthusiasts have gathered for the opening of the french film " l 'équipier . "
it 's a film about the relation between three people in a small coastal town in brittany .
it 's light on special effects star power , and it 's a film that wo n't run in most big cinemas outside of france , since it 's not designed for today 's mass market .
but the european union wants to ensure that such smaller , more nuanced films continue to be made . for that reason , it started a program 15 years ago to support european films , which were losing the fight against big hollywood movies . bildunterschrift : a scene from " star wars : episode iii , revenge of the sith " with their multi-million-dollar marketing budgets and crowd-pleasing stunts and stories , the americans were driving european films out of movie houses from lisbon to moscow . in 1995 , the eu 's film support program , media , extended its subsidy reach to movie theaters as well .
for the 2001 - 2005 budget period , media 's budget was 400 million euros -lrb- $ 484 million -rrb- . the prerequisite for getting the money from brussels was simple : one-third of a theater 's film program had to consist of european films .
still , for many cinema operators in europe , like rex manager dieter hertel , the decision to carry a good percentage of european movies is n't entirely because of the eu money they guarantee . " the quality of a film is the most important aspect for me , " he said .
" the bottom line is that the quality of films in europe is higher , for example , than that of films produced in america . " drawing people in since 2002 , the rex cinema has been a member of the european cinemas group , an association of european art house theaters .
the group has almost 500 members in more than 260 european cities .
more and more are joining , although european films are not exactly big money makers . " cinemas which show european and smaller films , which perhaps are n't as well known , have to really work hard to get people into the theaters , " said cornelia hammelmann , who works with the eu 's film support project in germany .
" that is exactly what we are trying to do with the media program . " she decides which movie theater or which film in germany gets money from the media funds .
according to her , the support gives theater operators the confidence , and means , to put films into their program which do n't often attract big crowds .
still , she insisted there is an interest among the general public for european film . " there is always going to be a public , for every nationality , for every subject matter , " she said .
" but it 's also important to attract younger audiences . " making it on its own ? movie theaters can receive up to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 60,500 -rrb- per year from the eu film support coffers .
about a third of media 's money goes toward financing special projects aimed at younger people , such as special showings for school groups .
young people have to be helped toward european films so that they can learn to recognize their value , according to hammelmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her goal is that , one day , movie theaters showing european movies wo n't be dependent on eu subsidies , as many today are , for their very existence .
but she admits , that day could be far away , if it ever arrives . " it would be fantastic if we could someday say that the films are successful on their own , that they are able to bring people into the theaters without our help , " she said .
" but that is not the case . " for cinema operator hertel , right now that goal looks unreachable .
last year his ticket sales declined by 12 percent .
all over europe , theaters are reporting falling box office returns , and not just for smaller european movies .
german ticket sales are down 20 percent compared to the first six months of last year , with italy and spain registering double figure declines .
hertel used to be able to use the eu money for advertising .
now he needs it just to survive .
" this year will be the first time that we 'll be absolutely dependent on these subsidies , " he said .
at least the subsidies are n't threatened .
the eu commission has proposed that the media budget be doubled to one billion euros for the 2007 - 2013 period . silvia oster -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de where movie money meets euro talent the european film market may not have as much glitz or glamour as the rest of the berlinale , but it 's an important event where european filmmakers meet the people who can potentially guide them towards the red carpet .

his love for the game has n't let up since .
over the weekend , he opened a soccer exhibit - in the first floor of his office . most politicians like to wax rhapsodic about their athletic ability back in the day .
but gerhard schröder can actually back it up .
as a young man , the chancellor was known as an aggressive and hard-working striker in local leagues .
his talent , apparently , has not left him .
" the things he 's still able to do … " said jochen krannich , a schröder deputy assigned the job of overseeing sports issues . so it came as no surprise that the former player would open up a exhibit of german and world soccer history in the chancellery .
what soccer fan would n't want valuable soccer memorabilia in his office ? player jerseys , foosball the show " soccer and history - from bern 1954 to berlin 2006 " , opened last week in the first floor of the chancellery . surviving members of the legendary german side that captured the 1954 world cup in bern as well as german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger were on hand to open the exhibit with schröder . a mix of historical background , original player jerseys and trophies , the exhibit is designed to whet the appetites of german soccer fans a little under a year before the world cup starts .
the centrepiece is a full-sized goal that schröder wo n't be able to walk by without taking at least one shot . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , together with horst eckel -lrb- l -rrb- und ottmar walter , the two surviving members of the 1954 world cup team that shocked the world by beating hungary in the final .
" i do n't think we can stop that , " said krannich .
" after all we want to show the world that we 're looking forward to the world cup . " schily scores one tourist and school groups will be able to take a tour of the collection , which includes a foosball table from the 1950s , by making an appointment .
the chancellery estimates that 40,000 people will do so in the coming year .
they wo n't be able to take a crack at the goal , though , and the foosball table was supposed to be off limits as well .
but at the time of the opening , the ball was missing from the table , courtesy of the german interior minister . " schily put that one in the goal , " said karl schlich , the chancellery spokesman . schlich said that not only the soccer , but the " rare " opportunity to get close to a seat of power would attract visitors .
as rare will be the life-size oil portraits of soccer legends like portugal 's eusebio , pele and franz beckenbauer .
they will hang in the chancellery until 2006 , said schlich , even should the less soccer-enthusiastic christian democratic union move in earlier than planned following early elections this fall . oliver samson -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schily says terror wo n't stop world cup germany 's interior minister otto schily issued a defiant statement in response to concerns that the 2006 world cup was in danger after the london bombings .
the world cup will go ahead in the face of terror , he said .

darkazanli , 46 , was released from custody in hamburg a few hours later and climbed into a taxi without commenting . spain accuses him of being osama bin laden 's " permanent interlocutor and assistant " in europe and having provided the al qaeda network with logistical and financial support between 1997 and 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister brigitte zypries german justice minister brigitte zypries condemned the karlsruhe-based court 's decision as " another setback for the german government in the fight against international terrorism . " a spokesman for eu justice commissioner franco frattini said the decision was bad news for europe 's efforts to combat terrorism - which have again come under the spotlight since the july 7 attacks in london - but insisted it was up to germany to make the arrest warrant work . " the efficiency of the eu arrest warrant as such is not called into question , but it 's a matter of the german implementation law , " said friso roscam abbing . darkazanli was pictured on a 1999 wedding video alongside marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah , two of the suicide pilots in the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on the united states .
german authorities investigated darkazanli for several months after the attacks but never charged him . he was eventually detained in germany in october last year on an arrest warrant issued by high-profile spanish judge baltasar garzon .
but darkazanli 's lawyers argued that germans may be expelled and tried abroad only when the crimes they are accused of are not subject to prosecution at home . the government 's anger at the decision to free darkazanli reflects tensions between the authorities and the justice system over the prosecution in germany of suspects linked to the september 11 , 2001 attacks . several setbacks a moroccan man , mounir el motassadeq , who is accused of involvement in the attacks , is currently nearing the end of his retrial in hamburg .
motassadeq was sentenced in february 2003 to the maximum 15 years in prison on charges of membership of a terrorist organization and more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder for his alleged role in the so-called " hamburg cell " run by the lead september 11 hijacker , mohammed atta . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi , left , and mounir el motassadeq , right but a federal tribunal overturned the conviction and ordered a new trial .
a verdict is expected august 19 .
and another moroccan national , abdelghani mzoudi , who was tried on the same charges as motassadeq , was acquitted last october for lack of evidence . the karlsruhe-based federal court found that the new eu arrest warrant offered insufficient legal protection for german citizens and must now be implemented with a new german law that allows all extradition orders to be reviewed by german judges . the ruling will mean that all german citizens being held for extradition within the eu must be released until the new legislation is passed .
since the eu arrest warrant was passed in the wake of the september 11 attacks and implemented in august 2004 , at least 19 germans have been extradited to other eu member states for offences including drug dealing , child abuse and even nazi war crimes . investigators suspect darkazanli befriended al-shehhi , jarrah and atta in hamburg where they were studying .
darkazanli denies any terrorist activity and said he knew the three hijackers casually .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.07.2005 a swan song for german folk music ? 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heino wants to leave before the party 's over two icons of the german-speaking popular folk music scene are retiring this year : heino and karl moik .
what will their departure mean for the future of this genre ? after more than 50 years on stage , heino shocked the folk music world last month by announcing his retirement .
the platinum-blond singer with his trademark dark glasses is one of the most successful german recording artists , selling over 50 million records worldwide . at the same time , the famous folk music television show " musikantenstadl " informed host karl moik that it was not renewing his contract .
unofficially , the 67-year-old is being " sorted out " and will most likely be replaced with someone younger . one might think that the departures of these old stars could be part of a push to give folk music a younger face - and consequently , younger followers .
but stefan kahé , spokesman for record label koch universal , which holds a 70 percent market share in this sector , said it was simply a normal development . " it 's basically something very natural to retire , " said kahé . letting the sun in there are certainly enough young stars waiting to follow in heino 's and moik 's footsteps , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie hertel and stefan mross have been a couple professionally and privately for years the young dream couple of folk music , singer stefanie hertel and trumpeter stefan mross , have become extremely popular over the past few years . günter tolar , head of the working group for promoting musical entertainment in austria arge , which organizes the annual folk music competition " grand prix der volksmusik , " said heino and moik had been role models for a long time . " but one ca n't overlook what huge shadows such ' greats ' cast , which block the sun for the subsequent generation , " said tolar , a former presenter for austrian television channel orf . still , age was not the issue here .
" whether an interpreter is popular and attracts viewers doesn ’ t depend on their youth , but rather charisma and what message they are communicating in their songs , " said tolar . music with traditional ties many people may find it difficult to understand the long running popularity of folk music .
but it is a central element of german-speaking culture in europe . " folk music is not just a marginal phenomenon of music , " said dr. gisela probst-effah from the institute for musical folklore at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mountain landscape relates the feeling of an ideal world this genre mostly involves newly composed or adaptations of traditional music and songs .
they often generate regional associations , like yodeling , or contain texts with a hint of dialect and are preferably presented in a rural idyll in traditional costumes , like dirndls or lederhosen . " this look gives the appearance of ties to tradition , timelessness and independence from changing fashions , " said probst-effah . according to kahé , popular folk music is precisely about passing on tradition . " it 's about something preserving , something conservative , " he said . the concept of an " ideal world " also plays a role .
" these songs deal with topics like nature , heimat , happy love or an idealized childhood in an ideal world with intact social relationships , " said probst-effah . " i portray the ideal world in my songs because i want to have an ideal world , " heino has said in interviews .
" but it was clear to me that i would never get the nobel prize for my lyrics . "
heino said he is retiring to spend time with this wife , who suffered a heart attack last year . the media 's strong influence figures by the german association of the phonographic industry showed that last year , german pop schlager and folk music made up for 9.8 percent of the total sales of 1.75 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.19 billion -rrb- on the german market .
in comparison , pop music was responsible for 38.8 percent of sales , and rock for 18.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : folk music duo maria und margot hellwig have appeared in television shows for years but while these sales figures appear marginal , popular folk music 's true success lies in its media presence .
this genre would not be what it is without the media , in particular highly commercialized folk music shows on television .
programs such as " musikantenstadl " reach millions of viewers . while there may not be such a strong trend towards younger recording stars , there is " a changing of the guard " in the media sector , said kahé . mross , 29 , hosts a weekly show on german public television .
florian silbereisen , who started his career at age 10 playing the accordion on " musikantenstadl , " is now a regular presenter of various folk music shows .
at 24 , he is the youngest show master on german television . " you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening . " despite these young stars on screen , the viewers are mainly older .
according to the german music information center in bonn , over 40 percent of those who buy schlager and popular folk music recordings are over the age of 50 .
the average age of viewers of folk music shows are around 60 years old , said tolar . " still , older people would also like to have something nice to look at , " said kahé . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl moik is known to be outspoken at times in poor taste .
his calling italians " spaghetti gluttons " in a show was not received well moik presented " musikantenstadl " - which means " musician 's barn " - for the past 25 years .
it is one of the most popular folk music television shows , and not just in the german-speaking world . " musikantenstadl " has also given guest performances in non-german speaking cities , including moscow , toronto , cape town , beijing and dubai . moik said his show was aimed at older people . " the young public goes to the disco on saturday nights , " moik told the austrian paper kleine zeitung .
" we 're a show for people over 40 .
i am not going to do a show for 17-year-olds .
i 'm too old for that . " moik said he doubted whether a younger presenter could attract younger viewers . " no , you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening , " he said .
" you ca n't get it younger , not even with a younger host .

darkazanli , 46 , was released from custody in hamburg a few hours later and climbed into a taxi without commenting . spain accuses him of being osama bin laden 's " permanent interlocutor and assistant " in europe and having provided the al qaeda network with logistical and financial support between 1997 and 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister brigitte zypries german justice minister brigitte zypries condemned the karlsruhe-based court 's decision as " another setback for the german government in the fight against international terrorism . " a spokesman for eu justice commissioner franco frattini said the decision was bad news for europe 's efforts to combat terrorism - which have again come under the spotlight since the july 7 attacks in london - but insisted it was up to germany to make the arrest warrant work . " the efficiency of the eu arrest warrant as such is not called into question , but it 's a matter of the german implementation law , " said friso roscam abbing . darkazanli was pictured on a 1999 wedding video alongside marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah , two of the suicide pilots in the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on the united states .
german authorities investigated darkazanli for several months after the attacks but never charged him . he was eventually detained in germany in october last year on an arrest warrant issued by high-profile spanish judge baltasar garzon .
but darkazanli 's lawyers argued that germans may be expelled and tried abroad only when the crimes they are accused of are not subject to prosecution at home . the government 's anger at the decision to free darkazanli reflects tensions between the authorities and the justice system over the prosecution in germany of suspects linked to the september 11 , 2001 attacks . several setbacks a moroccan man , mounir el motassadeq , who is accused of involvement in the attacks , is currently nearing the end of his retrial in hamburg .
motassadeq was sentenced in february 2003 to the maximum 15 years in prison on charges of membership of a terrorist organization and more than 3,000 counts of accessory to murder for his alleged role in the so-called " hamburg cell " run by the lead september 11 hijacker , mohammed atta . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi , left , and mounir el motassadeq , right but a federal tribunal overturned the conviction and ordered a new trial .
a verdict is expected august 19 .
and another moroccan national , abdelghani mzoudi , who was tried on the same charges as motassadeq , was acquitted last october for lack of evidence . the karlsruhe-based federal court found that the new eu arrest warrant offered insufficient legal protection for german citizens and must now be implemented with a new german law that allows all extradition orders to be reviewed by german judges . the ruling will mean that all german citizens being held for extradition within the eu must be released until the new legislation is passed .
since the eu arrest warrant was passed in the wake of the september 11 attacks and implemented in august 2004 , at least 19 germans have been extradited to other eu member states for offences including drug dealing , child abuse and even nazi war crimes . investigators suspect darkazanli befriended al-shehhi , jarrah and atta in hamburg where they were studying .

" a spokesman for eu justice commissioner franco frattini said the decision was bad news for europe 's efforts to combat terrorism - which have again come under the spotlight since the july 7 attacks in london - but insisted it was up to germany to make the arrest warrant work . " the efficiency of the eu arrest warrant as such is not called into question , but it 's a matter of the german implementation law , " said friso roscam abbing . darkazanli was pictured on a 1999 wedding video alongside marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah , two of the suicide pilots in the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on the united states .
german authorities investigated darkazanli for several months after the attacks but never charged him . he was eventually detained in germany in october last year on an arrest warrant issued by high-profile spanish judge baltasar garzon .
but darkazanli 's lawyers argued that germans may be expelled and tried abroad only when the crimes they are accused of are not subject to prosecution at home . the government 's anger at the decision to free darkazanli reflects tensions between the authorities and the justice system over the prosecution in germany of suspects linked to the september 11 , 2001 attacks . several setbacks a moroccan man , mounir el motassadeq , who is accused of involvement in the attacks , is currently nearing the end of his retrial in hamburg .

and another moroccan national , abdelghani mzoudi , who was tried on the same charges as motassadeq , was acquitted last october for lack of evidence . the karlsruhe-based federal court found that the new eu arrest warrant offered insufficient legal protection for german citizens and must now be implemented with a new german law that allows all extradition orders to be reviewed by german judges . the ruling will mean that all german citizens being held for extradition within the eu must be released until the new legislation is passed .
since the eu arrest warrant was passed in the wake of the september 11 attacks and implemented in august 2004 , at least 19 germans have been extradited to other eu member states for offences including drug dealing , child abuse and even nazi war crimes . investigators suspect darkazanli befriended al-shehhi , jarrah and atta in hamburg where they were studying .

but adeniji last week signaled au 's readiness to compromise on the issue of veto power . the g4 blueprint calls for boosting council membership from 15 members to 25 , with six new permanent seats without veto power , including two for africa , and four non-permanent seats . singh said the two sides had had a " useful , constructive and cordial meeting " and were committed to finding a way for " our differences not only to narrow , but to disappear . " he later flew to washington where he was to join his prime minister manmohan singh , who is beginning a us visit , including talks with president george w. bush on monday . " we are working together , trying to work out our differences which are smaller than our similarities , " said brazillian foreign minister amorim . smoothing out the differences bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazillian foreign minister celso amorim announced that the negotiations would continue amorim announced creation of a follow-up mechanism grouping representatives of the g4 and the au " in order to reach an outcome acceptable to all , " which will then be examined by their foreign ministers around july 25 in geneva or another city . the smaller follow-up task force is expected to put forward recommendations by next friday .
g4 diplomats said that if everything went smoothly , an acceptable compromise draft would be put to a vote , but not before july 29 . speaking for the au , the nigerian foreign minister adeniji said : " we were meeting for the first time .
we made as much progress as we can today . " nigeria is , along with south africa and egypt , one of the three strong contenders for the two permanent seats sought by africa on the security council . g4 diplomats said that during sunday 's session , nigeria was the au country most forthcoming in speaking in favor of reaching common ground with the g4 , while egypt was more aloof . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everybody prefers a front row seat at the security council the g4 countries see the support of the un 's 54-member african bloc as crucial for passage of their draft resolution , which has the backing of more than 30 countries , including france and britain .
a two-third majority is needed in the 191-member general assembly for adoption . " in all the discussions we have to consider that in the end we need a two-third majority , " said fischer .
" that should be our standard , " he said . making the un more relevant earlier the g4 ministers met with the president of the general assembly , jean ping , and then paid a courtesy call on un secretary general kofi annan . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : listening to the african voices : german foreign minister joshka fischer soon before the meeting with ping , fischer rejected charges that the g4 was pursuing selfish interests with its plan for security council enlargement , which is strongly opposed by countries such as the united states , pakistan , algeria and canada . fischer said the accusations came from countries which have " no interest " in un reform or those which do not stand a chance of getting a permanent seat themselves . at present , britain , china , france , russia and the united states are the only permanent and veto-wielding members of the council , which also has 10 rotating non-permanent members without veto power . the proposed expansion of the security council is part of annan 's broader un reform plan to make the world body more relevant to today 's realities 60 years after its creation .

" if everything goes well , we are ready to send monitors whenever the agreement is signed , " said the spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who is expected to visit indonesia next week . the mission , which would only be sent if the parties request it , would first seek the cooperation of the association of south east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- and its members in supervising the future accord . the indonesian government and the free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- announced on sunday after the latest round of negotiations in finland that they had reached a deal to end 30 years of fighting in the separatist province .
they plan to sign a memorandum of understanding next month . both sides agreed to establish a monitoring mission to check on progress and said they hoped it would be run by the eu and a number of asian countries .
the agreement aims to bring a " peaceful , comprehensive and sustainable solution " to end a conflict that has raged in the province since 1976 and cost nearly 15,000 lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an indonesian soldier mans his position on an armored vehicle during a patrol in the provincial capital of banda aceh , aceh province , tuesday , may 20 , 2003 .
gam gave up its demand for full independence and said it would disarm , while the government has announced it will withdraw its troops from the province once the rebels hand in their weapons .
participants agreed that a peace deal had seemed unthinkable after jakarta declared martial law and launched a major military offensive in aceh two years ago . after the tsunami but renewed efforts to make peace were prompted by a need for international aid to reach aceh , which bore the brunt of last december 's tsunami .
more than 131,000 people in the province were killed . in the conclusions of their meeting on monday , the eu ministers also pledged to continue to crack down on terrorism , promised new support for afghanistan and sudan 's troubled darfur region , and renewed condemnation of uzbekistan .
they said states must " have the necessary measures , as appropriate , in place to confront this threat , be they to track terrorists down , protect potential targets , prepare for an attack or prevent people turning to terrorism . " on afghanistan , the ministers welcomed the planned deployment of an eu monitoring mission for the september 18 general elections , in conclusions from their meeting .
" the eu stands ready to continue its efforts at establishing a sustainable democratic system in afghanistan for the lasting security of the afghan people , " they said . the ministers also appointed a special representative for sudan , former finnish cooperation and development minister pekka haavisto , and adopted a " joint-action " supporting the african union mission in darfur .
they also renewed their condemnation of uzbekistan for failing to fully investigate a massacre in the east of the country on may 13 . condemnation for uzbekistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general view of a rally in downtown andijan on friday , may 13 , 2005 .
armed protesters freed inmates from a prison and clashed with police and security forces friday as protests over a trial of muslim businessmen exploded into unrest in an eastern uzbek city , leaving at least nine people killed and 34 wounded .
-lrb- ap photo / efrem lukatsky -rrb- " the council remains profoundly concerned about the situation in uzbekistan and condemns the uzbek authorities ' refusal to allow an independent international inquiry into the recent events in andijan , " they said . they said the bloc was considering launching a mission with the united nations and the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , using the osce 's so-called moscow mechanism .
the mechanism allows for an ad hoc team of experts to be established and sent to an osce member states to assist in resolving its problems . according to a un report , the crackdown by uzbek forces on demonstrators in andijan may have been a " mass killing " in which between 200 and 700 people died in a single shooting .
uzbekistan has fixed the death toll at 187 and blamed islamic militants . solana was also to report on his middle east visit , with the ministers likely to confirm their support for the israeli withdrawal from the gaza strip .

fifteen years later , movie houses in europe are still fighting for survival . at the rex art-house cinema in bonn , a handful of film enthusiasts have gathered for the opening of the french film " l 'équipier . "
it 's a film about the relation between three people in a small coastal town in brittany .
it 's light on special effects star power , and it 's a film that wo n't run in most big cinemas outside of france , since it 's not designed for today 's mass market .
but the european union wants to ensure that such smaller , more nuanced films continue to be made . for that reason , it started a program 15 years ago to support european films , which were losing the fight against big hollywood movies . bildunterschrift : a scene from " star wars : episode iii , revenge of the sith " with their multi-million-dollar marketing budgets and crowd-pleasing stunts and stories , the americans were driving european films out of movie houses from lisbon to moscow . in 1995 , the eu 's film support program , media , extended its subsidy reach to movie theaters as well .
for the 2001 - 2005 budget period , media 's budget was 400 million euros -lrb- $ 484 million -rrb- . the prerequisite for getting the money from brussels was simple : one-third of a theater 's film program had to consist of european films .
still , for many cinema operators in europe , like rex manager dieter hertel , the decision to carry a good percentage of european movies is n't entirely because of the eu money they guarantee . " the quality of a film is the most important aspect for me , " he said .
" the bottom line is that the quality of films in europe is higher , for example , than that of films produced in america . " drawing people in since 2002 , the rex cinema has been a member of the european cinemas group , an association of european art house theaters .
the group has almost 500 members in more than 260 european cities .
more and more are joining , although european films are not exactly big money makers . " cinemas which show european and smaller films , which perhaps are n't as well known , have to really work hard to get people into the theaters , " said cornelia hammelmann , who works with the eu 's film support project in germany .
" that is exactly what we are trying to do with the media program . " she decides which movie theater or which film in germany gets money from the media funds .
according to her , the support gives theater operators the confidence , and means , to put films into their program which do n't often attract big crowds .
still , she insisted there is an interest among the general public for european film . " there is always going to be a public , for every nationality , for every subject matter , " she said .
" but it 's also important to attract younger audiences . " making it on its own ? movie theaters can receive up to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 60,500 -rrb- per year from the eu film support coffers .
about a third of media 's money goes toward financing special projects aimed at younger people , such as special showings for school groups .
young people have to be helped toward european films so that they can learn to recognize their value , according to hammelmann . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : her goal is that , one day , movie theaters showing european movies wo n't be dependent on eu subsidies , as many today are , for their very existence .
but she admits , that day could be far away , if it ever arrives . " it would be fantastic if we could someday say that the films are successful on their own , that they are able to bring people into the theaters without our help , " she said .
" but that is not the case . " for cinema operator hertel , right now that goal looks unreachable .
last year his ticket sales declined by 12 percent .
all over europe , theaters are reporting falling box office returns , and not just for smaller european movies .
german ticket sales are down 20 percent compared to the first six months of last year , with italy and spain registering double figure declines .
hertel used to be able to use the eu money for advertising .
now he needs it just to survive .
" this year will be the first time that we 'll be absolutely dependent on these subsidies , " he said .
at least the subsidies are n't threatened .

back to first page back 2/2 the importance of folk music kahé said the significance of popular folk music for all age groups should n't be underestimated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the boy 's choir from tölz in bavaria has achieved worldwide fame " in southern germany , austria or the german-speaking parts of switzerland , this is serious music and older cultures in the villages cultivate it , " said kahé .
" many young people listen to it there , too . " in austria , popular folk music is in the top ten and sometimes even reached number one , with gold and platinum records , he added . " folk music is one of the most significant forms of entertainment in rural areas and this is where the next generation comes from , " said tolar .
but , he added , the artists don ’ t change the music . " they sing what the songwriters write for them or what the producers give them to interpret , " said tolar .
" but the singers are very significant as carriers , as they attract the public . " folk music will remain successful tolar said he found folk music 's popularity to be waning .
" a few stars , a few producers and a few good writers have given it a certain monotony , which the public is also beginning to slowly notice , " he said . not enough was being invested in the next generation , as producers were not willing to risk high production costs with no guarantee of success , he said . " on the other side , a lot of artistic junk is being produced , " said tolar .
this was evident in competitions like " grand prix der volksmusik . " " producers send in all of their shelf warmers in the hope that one or the other might get through , " he said .
" it 's very depressing to sit in that kind of jury . " he said the public did listen very selectively and would respond to bad songs in a television show by simply switching off . kahé , though , said that popular folk music will continue to be successful . " a music that comes from tradition has something in its origins , which moves people , " said kahé .

what will their departure mean for the future of this genre ? after more than 50 years on stage , heino shocked the folk music world last month by announcing his retirement .
the platinum-blond singer with his trademark dark glasses is one of the most successful german recording artists , selling over 50 million records worldwide . at the same time , the famous folk music television show " musikantenstadl " informed host karl moik that it was not renewing his contract .
unofficially , the 67-year-old is being " sorted out " and will most likely be replaced with someone younger . one might think that the departures of these old stars could be part of a push to give folk music a younger face - and consequently , younger followers .
but stefan kahé , spokesman for record label koch universal , which holds a 70 percent market share in this sector , said it was simply a normal development . " it 's basically something very natural to retire , " said kahé . letting the sun in there are certainly enough young stars waiting to follow in heino 's and moik 's footsteps , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie hertel and stefan mross have been a couple professionally and privately for years the young dream couple of folk music , singer stefanie hertel and trumpeter stefan mross , have become extremely popular over the past few years . günter tolar , head of the working group for promoting musical entertainment in austria arge , which organizes the annual folk music competition " grand prix der volksmusik , " said heino and moik had been role models for a long time . " but one ca n't overlook what huge shadows such ' greats ' cast , which block the sun for the subsequent generation , " said tolar , a former presenter for austrian television channel orf . still , age was not the issue here .
" whether an interpreter is popular and attracts viewers doesn ’ t depend on their youth , but rather charisma and what message they are communicating in their songs , " said tolar . music with traditional ties many people may find it difficult to understand the long running popularity of folk music .
but it is a central element of german-speaking culture in europe . " folk music is not just a marginal phenomenon of music , " said dr. gisela probst-effah from the institute for musical folklore at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mountain landscape relates the feeling of an ideal world this genre mostly involves newly composed or adaptations of traditional music and songs .
they often generate regional associations , like yodeling , or contain texts with a hint of dialect and are preferably presented in a rural idyll in traditional costumes , like dirndls or lederhosen . " this look gives the appearance of ties to tradition , timelessness and independence from changing fashions , " said probst-effah . according to kahé , popular folk music is precisely about passing on tradition . " it 's about something preserving , something conservative , " he said . the concept of an " ideal world " also plays a role .
" these songs deal with topics like nature , heimat , happy love or an idealized childhood in an ideal world with intact social relationships , " said probst-effah . " i portray the ideal world in my songs because i want to have an ideal world , " heino has said in interviews .
" but it was clear to me that i would never get the nobel prize for my lyrics . "
heino said he is retiring to spend time with this wife , who suffered a heart attack last year . the media 's strong influence figures by the german association of the phonographic industry showed that last year , german pop schlager and folk music made up for 9.8 percent of the total sales of 1.75 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.19 billion -rrb- on the german market .
in comparison , pop music was responsible for 38.8 percent of sales , and rock for 18.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : folk music duo maria und margot hellwig have appeared in television shows for years but while these sales figures appear marginal , popular folk music 's true success lies in its media presence .
this genre would not be what it is without the media , in particular highly commercialized folk music shows on television .
programs such as " musikantenstadl " reach millions of viewers . while there may not be such a strong trend towards younger recording stars , there is " a changing of the guard " in the media sector , said kahé . mross , 29 , hosts a weekly show on german public television .
florian silbereisen , who started his career at age 10 playing the accordion on " musikantenstadl , " is now a regular presenter of various folk music shows .
at 24 , he is the youngest show master on german television . " you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening . " despite these young stars on screen , the viewers are mainly older .
according to the german music information center in bonn , over 40 percent of those who buy schlager and popular folk music recordings are over the age of 50 .
the average age of viewers of folk music shows are around 60 years old , said tolar . " still , older people would also like to have something nice to look at , " said kahé . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl moik is known to be outspoken at times in poor taste .
his calling italians " spaghetti gluttons " in a show was not received well moik presented " musikantenstadl " - which means " musician 's barn " - for the past 25 years .
it is one of the most popular folk music television shows , and not just in the german-speaking world . " musikantenstadl " has also given guest performances in non-german speaking cities , including moscow , toronto , cape town , beijing and dubai . moik said his show was aimed at older people . " the young public goes to the disco on saturday nights , " moik told the austrian paper kleine zeitung .
" we 're a show for people over 40 .
i am not going to do a show for 17-year-olds .
i 'm too old for that . " moik said he doubted whether a younger presenter could attract younger viewers . " no , you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening , " he said .
" you ca n't get it younger , not even with a younger host .

" if everything goes well , we are ready to send monitors whenever the agreement is signed , " said the spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana , who is expected to visit indonesia next week . the mission , which would only be sent if the parties request it , would first seek the cooperation of the association of south east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- and its members in supervising the future accord . the indonesian government and the free aceh movement -lrb- gam -rrb- announced on sunday after the latest round of negotiations in finland that they had reached a deal to end 30 years of fighting in the separatist province .
they plan to sign a memorandum of understanding next month . both sides agreed to establish a monitoring mission to check on progress and said they hoped it would be run by the eu and a number of asian countries .
the agreement aims to bring a " peaceful , comprehensive and sustainable solution " to end a conflict that has raged in the province since 1976 and cost nearly 15,000 lives . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an indonesian soldier mans his position on an armored vehicle during a patrol in the provincial capital of banda aceh , aceh province , tuesday , may 20 , 2003 .
gam gave up its demand for full independence and said it would disarm , while the government has announced it will withdraw its troops from the province once the rebels hand in their weapons .
participants agreed that a peace deal had seemed unthinkable after jakarta declared martial law and launched a major military offensive in aceh two years ago . after the tsunami but renewed efforts to make peace were prompted by a need for international aid to reach aceh , which bore the brunt of last december 's tsunami .
more than 131,000 people in the province were killed . in the conclusions of their meeting on monday , the eu ministers also pledged to continue to crack down on terrorism , promised new support for afghanistan and sudan 's troubled darfur region , and renewed condemnation of uzbekistan .
they said states must " have the necessary measures , as appropriate , in place to confront this threat , be they to track terrorists down , protect potential targets , prepare for an attack or prevent people turning to terrorism . " on afghanistan , the ministers welcomed the planned deployment of an eu monitoring mission for the september 18 general elections , in conclusions from their meeting .
" the eu stands ready to continue its efforts at establishing a sustainable democratic system in afghanistan for the lasting security of the afghan people , " they said . the ministers also appointed a special representative for sudan , former finnish cooperation and development minister pekka haavisto , and adopted a " joint-action " supporting the african union mission in darfur .
they also renewed their condemnation of uzbekistan for failing to fully investigate a massacre in the east of the country on may 13 . condemnation for uzbekistan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : general view of a rally in downtown andijan on friday , may 13 , 2005 .

-lrb- ap photo / efrem lukatsky -rrb- " the council remains profoundly concerned about the situation in uzbekistan and condemns the uzbek authorities ' refusal to allow an independent international inquiry into the recent events in andijan , " they said . they said the bloc was considering launching a mission with the united nations and the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , using the osce 's so-called moscow mechanism .
the mechanism allows for an ad hoc team of experts to be established and sent to an osce member states to assist in resolving its problems . according to a un report , the crackdown by uzbek forces on demonstrators in andijan may have been a " mass killing " in which between 200 and 700 people died in a single shooting .
uzbekistan has fixed the death toll at 187 and blamed islamic militants . solana was also to report on his middle east visit , with the ministers likely to confirm their support for the israeli withdrawal from the gaza strip .

darkazanli , 46 , was released from custody in hamburg a few hours later and climbed into a taxi without commenting . spain accuses him of being osama bin laden 's " permanent interlocutor and assistant " in europe and having provided the al qaeda network with logistical and financial support between 1997 and 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister brigitte zypries german justice minister brigitte zypries condemned the karlsruhe-based court 's decision as " another setback for the german government in the fight against international terrorism .

german authorities investigated darkazanli for several months after the attacks but never charged him . he was eventually detained in germany in october last year on an arrest warrant issued by high-profile spanish judge baltasar garzon .

since the eu arrest warrant was passed in the wake of the september 11 attacks and implemented in august 2004 , at least 19 germans have been extradited to other eu member states for offences including drug dealing , child abuse and even nazi war crimes . investigators suspect darkazanli befriended al-shehhi , jarrah and atta in hamburg where they were studying .

what will their departure mean for the future of this genre ? after more than 50 years on stage , heino shocked the folk music world last month by announcing his retirement .
the platinum-blond singer with his trademark dark glasses is one of the most successful german recording artists , selling over 50 million records worldwide . at the same time , the famous folk music television show " musikantenstadl " informed host karl moik that it was not renewing his contract .
unofficially , the 67-year-old is being " sorted out " and will most likely be replaced with someone younger . one might think that the departures of these old stars could be part of a push to give folk music a younger face - and consequently , younger followers .
but stefan kahé , spokesman for record label koch universal , which holds a 70 percent market share in this sector , said it was simply a normal development . " it 's basically something very natural to retire , " said kahé . letting the sun in there are certainly enough young stars waiting to follow in heino 's and moik 's footsteps , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie hertel and stefan mross have been a couple professionally and privately for years the young dream couple of folk music , singer stefanie hertel and trumpeter stefan mross , have become extremely popular over the past few years . günter tolar , head of the working group for promoting musical entertainment in austria arge , which organizes the annual folk music competition " grand prix der volksmusik , " said heino and moik had been role models for a long time . " but one ca n't overlook what huge shadows such ' greats ' cast , which block the sun for the subsequent generation , " said tolar , a former presenter for austrian television channel orf . still , age was not the issue here .
" whether an interpreter is popular and attracts viewers doesn ’ t depend on their youth , but rather charisma and what message they are communicating in their songs , " said tolar . music with traditional ties many people may find it difficult to understand the long running popularity of folk music .
but it is a central element of german-speaking culture in europe . " folk music is not just a marginal phenomenon of music , " said dr. gisela probst-effah from the institute for musical folklore at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mountain landscape relates the feeling of an ideal world this genre mostly involves newly composed or adaptations of traditional music and songs .
they often generate regional associations , like yodeling , or contain texts with a hint of dialect and are preferably presented in a rural idyll in traditional costumes , like dirndls or lederhosen . " this look gives the appearance of ties to tradition , timelessness and independence from changing fashions , " said probst-effah . according to kahé , popular folk music is precisely about passing on tradition . " it 's about something preserving , something conservative , " he said . the concept of an " ideal world " also plays a role .
" these songs deal with topics like nature , heimat , happy love or an idealized childhood in an ideal world with intact social relationships , " said probst-effah . " i portray the ideal world in my songs because i want to have an ideal world , " heino has said in interviews .
" but it was clear to me that i would never get the nobel prize for my lyrics . "
heino said he is retiring to spend time with this wife , who suffered a heart attack last year . the media 's strong influence figures by the german association of the phonographic industry showed that last year , german pop schlager and folk music made up for 9.8 percent of the total sales of 1.75 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.19 billion -rrb- on the german market .
in comparison , pop music was responsible for 38.8 percent of sales , and rock for 18.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : folk music duo maria und margot hellwig have appeared in television shows for years but while these sales figures appear marginal , popular folk music 's true success lies in its media presence .
this genre would not be what it is without the media , in particular highly commercialized folk music shows on television .
programs such as " musikantenstadl " reach millions of viewers . while there may not be such a strong trend towards younger recording stars , there is " a changing of the guard " in the media sector , said kahé . mross , 29 , hosts a weekly show on german public television .
florian silbereisen , who started his career at age 10 playing the accordion on " musikantenstadl , " is now a regular presenter of various folk music shows .
at 24 , he is the youngest show master on german television . " you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening . " despite these young stars on screen , the viewers are mainly older .
according to the german music information center in bonn , over 40 percent of those who buy schlager and popular folk music recordings are over the age of 50 .
the average age of viewers of folk music shows are around 60 years old , said tolar . " still , older people would also like to have something nice to look at , " said kahé . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl moik is known to be outspoken at times in poor taste .
his calling italians " spaghetti gluttons " in a show was not received well moik presented " musikantenstadl " - which means " musician 's barn " - for the past 25 years .
it is one of the most popular folk music television shows , and not just in the german-speaking world . " musikantenstadl " has also given guest performances in non-german speaking cities , including moscow , toronto , cape town , beijing and dubai . moik said his show was aimed at older people . " the young public goes to the disco on saturday nights , " moik told the austrian paper kleine zeitung .
" we 're a show for people over 40 .
i am not going to do a show for 17-year-olds .
i 'm too old for that . " moik said he doubted whether a younger presenter could attract younger viewers . " no , you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening , " he said .
" you ca n't get it younger , not even with a younger host .

" but one ca n't overlook what huge shadows such ' greats ' cast , which block the sun for the subsequent generation , " said tolar , a former presenter for austrian television channel orf . still , age was not the issue here .
" whether an interpreter is popular and attracts viewers doesn ’ t depend on their youth , but rather charisma and what message they are communicating in their songs , " said tolar . music with traditional ties many people may find it difficult to understand the long running popularity of folk music .
but it is a central element of german-speaking culture in europe . " folk music is not just a marginal phenomenon of music , " said dr. gisela probst-effah from the institute for musical folklore at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mountain landscape relates the feeling of an ideal world this genre mostly involves newly composed or adaptations of traditional music and songs .
they often generate regional associations , like yodeling , or contain texts with a hint of dialect and are preferably presented in a rural idyll in traditional costumes , like dirndls or lederhosen . " this look gives the appearance of ties to tradition , timelessness and independence from changing fashions , " said probst-effah . according to kahé , popular folk music is precisely about passing on tradition . " it 's about something preserving , something conservative , " he said . the concept of an " ideal world " also plays a role .
" these songs deal with topics like nature , heimat , happy love or an idealized childhood in an ideal world with intact social relationships , " said probst-effah . " i portray the ideal world in my songs because i want to have an ideal world , " heino has said in interviews .
" but it was clear to me that i would never get the nobel prize for my lyrics . "
heino said he is retiring to spend time with this wife , who suffered a heart attack last year . the media 's strong influence figures by the german association of the phonographic industry showed that last year , german pop schlager and folk music made up for 9.8 percent of the total sales of 1.75 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.19 billion -rrb- on the german market .
in comparison , pop music was responsible for 38.8 percent of sales , and rock for 18.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : folk music duo maria und margot hellwig have appeared in television shows for years but while these sales figures appear marginal , popular folk music 's true success lies in its media presence .
this genre would not be what it is without the media , in particular highly commercialized folk music shows on television .
programs such as " musikantenstadl " reach millions of viewers . while there may not be such a strong trend towards younger recording stars , there is " a changing of the guard " in the media sector , said kahé . mross , 29 , hosts a weekly show on german public television .
florian silbereisen , who started his career at age 10 playing the accordion on " musikantenstadl , " is now a regular presenter of various folk music shows .
at 24 , he is the youngest show master on german television . " you ca n't revolutionize saturday evening . " despite these young stars on screen , the viewers are mainly older .
according to the german music information center in bonn , over 40 percent of those who buy schlager and popular folk music recordings are over the age of 50 .
the average age of viewers of folk music shows are around 60 years old , said tolar . " still , older people would also like to have something nice to look at , " said kahé . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karl moik is known to be outspoken at times in poor taste .
his calling italians " spaghetti gluttons " in a show was not received well moik presented " musikantenstadl " - which means " musician 's barn " - for the past 25 years .
it is one of the most popular folk music television shows , and not just in the german-speaking world . " musikantenstadl " has also given guest performances in non-german speaking cities , including moscow , toronto , cape town , beijing and dubai . moik said his show was aimed at older people . " the young public goes to the disco on saturday nights , " moik told the austrian paper kleine zeitung .
" we 're a show for people over 40 .
i am not going to do a show for 17-year-olds .

what will their departure mean for the future of this genre ? after more than 50 years on stage , heino shocked the folk music world last month by announcing his retirement .
the platinum-blond singer with his trademark dark glasses is one of the most successful german recording artists , selling over 50 million records worldwide . at the same time , the famous folk music television show " musikantenstadl " informed host karl moik that it was not renewing his contract .
unofficially , the 67-year-old is being " sorted out " and will most likely be replaced with someone younger . one might think that the departures of these old stars could be part of a push to give folk music a younger face - and consequently , younger followers .
but stefan kahé , spokesman for record label koch universal , which holds a 70 percent market share in this sector , said it was simply a normal development . " it 's basically something very natural to retire , " said kahé . letting the sun in there are certainly enough young stars waiting to follow in heino 's and moik 's footsteps , though . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie hertel and stefan mross have been a couple professionally and privately for years the young dream couple of folk music , singer stefanie hertel and trumpeter stefan mross , have become extremely popular over the past few years . günter tolar , head of the working group for promoting musical entertainment in austria arge , which organizes the annual folk music competition " grand prix der volksmusik , " said heino and moik had been role models for a long time . " but one ca n't overlook what huge shadows such ' greats ' cast , which block the sun for the subsequent generation , " said tolar , a former presenter for austrian television channel orf . still , age was not the issue here .
" whether an interpreter is popular and attracts viewers doesn ’ t depend on their youth , but rather charisma and what message they are communicating in their songs , " said tolar . music with traditional ties many people may find it difficult to understand the long running popularity of folk music .
but it is a central element of german-speaking culture in europe . " folk music is not just a marginal phenomenon of music , " said dr. gisela probst-effah from the institute for musical folklore at the university of cologne . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mountain landscape relates the feeling of an ideal world this genre mostly involves newly composed or adaptations of traditional music and songs .
they often generate regional associations , like yodeling , or contain texts with a hint of dialect and are preferably presented in a rural idyll in traditional costumes , like dirndls or lederhosen . " this look gives the appearance of ties to tradition , timelessness and independence from changing fashions , " said probst-effah . according to kahé , popular folk music is precisely about passing on tradition . " it 's about something preserving , something conservative , " he said . the concept of an " ideal world " also plays a role .
" these songs deal with topics like nature , heimat , happy love or an idealized childhood in an ideal world with intact social relationships , " said probst-effah . " i portray the ideal world in my songs because i want to have an ideal world , " heino has said in interviews .
" but it was clear to me that i would never get the nobel prize for my lyrics . "
heino said he is retiring to spend time with this wife , who suffered a heart attack last year . the media 's strong influence figures by the german association of the phonographic industry showed that last year , german pop schlager and folk music made up for 9.8 percent of the total sales of 1.75 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.19 billion -rrb- on the german market .
in comparison , pop music was responsible for 38.8 percent of sales , and rock for 18.5 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : folk music duo maria und margot hellwig have appeared in television shows for years but while these sales figures appear marginal , popular folk music 's true success lies in its media presence .
this genre would not be what it is without the media , in particular highly commercialized folk music shows on television .
programs such as " musikantenstadl " reach millions of viewers . while there may not be such a strong trend towards younger recording stars , there is " a changing of the guard " in the media sector , said kahé . mross , 29 , hosts a weekly show on german public television .

his love for the game has n't let up since .
over the weekend , he opened a soccer exhibit - in the first floor of his office . most politicians like to wax rhapsodic about their athletic ability back in the day .
but gerhard schröder can actually back it up .
as a young man , the chancellor was known as an aggressive and hard-working striker in local leagues .
his talent , apparently , has not left him .
" the things he 's still able to do … " said jochen krannich , a schröder deputy assigned the job of overseeing sports issues . so it came as no surprise that the former player would open up a exhibit of german and world soccer history in the chancellery .
what soccer fan would n't want valuable soccer memorabilia in his office ? player jerseys , foosball the show " soccer and history - from bern 1954 to berlin 2006 " , opened last week in the first floor of the chancellery . surviving members of the legendary german side that captured the 1954 world cup in bern as well as german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger were on hand to open the exhibit with schröder . a mix of historical background , original player jerseys and trophies , the exhibit is designed to whet the appetites of german soccer fans a little under a year before the world cup starts .

" after all we want to show the world that we 're looking forward to the world cup . " schily scores one tourist and school groups will be able to take a tour of the collection , which includes a foosball table from the 1950s , by making an appointment .
the chancellery estimates that 40,000 people will do so in the coming year .
they wo n't be able to take a crack at the goal , though , and the foosball table was supposed to be off limits as well .
but at the time of the opening , the ball was missing from the table , courtesy of the german interior minister . " schily put that one in the goal , " said karl schlich , the chancellery spokesman . schlich said that not only the soccer , but the " rare " opportunity to get close to a seat of power would attract visitors .
as rare will be the life-size oil portraits of soccer legends like portugal 's eusebio , pele and franz beckenbauer .
they will hang in the chancellery until 2006 , said schlich , even should the less soccer-enthusiastic christian democratic union move in earlier than planned following early elections this fall . oliver samson -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schily says terror wo n't stop world cup germany 's interior minister otto schily issued a defiant statement in response to concerns that the 2006 world cup was in danger after the london bombings .

bets are on that german president horst köhler will dissolve parliament and call for an early general election in september .
his decision will come this week in a tv broadcast . köhler has until july 22 to make the high-stakes decision about whether to approve or reject chancellor gerhard schröder 's scheme of prompting a national poll one year ahead of schedule . according to a report in der spiegel , köhler intends to make his decision known in a television broadcast .
but will it be a case of history repeating itself ? twenty-two years ago on jan .
7 , 1983 , then president karl carstens appeared on television to announce he was dissolving parliament .
the elections that followed cemented the 16-year rule of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- under helmut kohl . the word from insiders is that köhler has already internally signalled his readiness to call new elections .
if he does , he 'll be in step with opinions of the majority of german citizens .
in a forsa poll commissioned by the bild am sonntag , 75 percent of germans are in favor of an early election in september . schröder 's will bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : earlier this month , schröder deliberately lost a no-confidence vote before parliament , in the hopes that a new election would secure him a renewed mandate for his reform agenda and silence critics within his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- . meanwhile his challenger angela merkel , the first female chancellor candidate , is flying high in the polls and mobilizing her christian union bloc for a battle over who can pull germany out of its protracted economic slump . schröder gave an impassioned speech before parliament july 1 outlining his reasons for seeking a new mandate following a poll drubbing in may in the spd heartland of north rhine-westphalia , the country 's most populous state . " on may 22 , the question arose as to whether , with this election result , my policies and i are still fully able to function , " he said , describing the political gridlock he said had gripped the country and the shaky state of his center-left coalition with the greens party . immediately afterwards , he went to köhler to ask him to bring the election forward . spd with most to lose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu chancellor candidate angela merkel on the campaign trail , here visiting german bundeswehr soldiers in the town of prizren , kosovo on friday , july 15 , 2005 .
seeking guidance in his decision , which could still face a constitutional court challenge , köhler asked schröder to provide more evidence of his claim that he no longer enjoys the secure backing of his coalition . he replied last week with a 200-page dossier his spokesman bela anda said provided " a documentation of the difficulties of implementing his government program . " although most observers and all the main political parties expect köhler to grant schröder 's request and order new elections , an opinion poll released thursday indicated that the chancellor could have the most to lose . his social democrats scored just 27 percent versus 42 percent for merkel 's cdu / csu , according to the infratest dimap institute based on a survey conducted july 12-13 . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de early german elections in legal limbo germany 's ruling coalition may have purposely lost a confidence vote to trigger early elections , but the country 's president or supreme court could yet kibosh the hopes of both politicians and the public for a new poll .

should he surprise everyone with a no vote , the chancellor plans to continue to govern . those in the opposition hoping gerhard schröder would step down should köhler reject the bundestag 's motion for early federal elections this fall , will be disappointed .
the chancellor announced through his party 's chairman that he planned to continue to govern . chairman franz münterfering told the welt am sonntag that " it would not be good for the country " should köhler decide against new elections , but that schröder would nevertheless continue to govern until scheduled elections in september 2006 .
opposition to the schröder government 's economic reform agenda is widespread among germans , and the lack of a majority in germany 's upper house of parliament will mean schröder will spend his remaining year and a half as a " lame duck chancellor " should his call for new elections not go through . spiegel : köhler will approve new elections but he might not have to worry too much .

according to the german constitution , a chancellor can only call for new elections if facing a serious government crisis . constitution experts have spent the last few weeks debating whether or not schröder is allowed to use the constitutional clause as an instrument to seek a new mandate for his government . köhler , a member of the opposition christian democratic union party , was not pleased with the way in which the german constitution was being manipulated - with the approval of his own party - to force new elections . population behind early elections but he will likely decide to approve it , and the majority of the german population looks to be behind him .
a poll released on sunday indicated that 75 percent of the population is in favour of early elections , with only 18 percent against it . among those against is green party parliamentarian werner schulz , a lawyer who plans to file suit in the constitutional court in karlsruhe should köhler approve the measure .
" this move angers me ... because our parliamentarian democracy requires … transparency , clarity and truth , and such measures are dishonorable , " he wrote in the latest issue of der spiegel . experts say the court is not likely to agree with schulz 's call to stop the process . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany waits on early election decision will he or wo n't he ?

ballack has just a year left on his contract with bayern and has said recently that he would like to join a ' great european club ' in the near future .

his successor lady thatcher said he was a " political giant " and " in every sense the first modern conservative leader " .
sir edward , who was knighted in 1992 , won his first seat for the tories in bexley in 1950 and led the 1970-74 conservative government .
he took britain into what was then the european economic community , but lost his leadership of the tory party to margaret thatcher in 1975 .
lady thatcher said he was the first modern leader for the party , " by his humble background , by his grammar school education and by the fact of his democratic election " .
he represented the sensible wing of the tory party denis healey , former labour chancellor send your tributes ' political giant ' remembered prime minister tony blair said : " he was a man of great integrity and beliefs he held firmly from which he never wavered .
" he will be remembered by all who knew him as a political leader of great stature and significance . "
earlier on sunday sir edward 's spokesman had revealed he was gravely ill and receiving medical attention at home .
the former premier had celebrated his 89th birthday with a party at his home in salisbury a week ago .
" enormous patriot " sir edward 's term in office was blighted by industrial action and problems with the economy .
with the country on a three-day week and rubbish piling up in the streets , the miners threatened to bring his government down .
industrial unrest , combined with economic difficulties , led to the tories being pushed from power in february 1974 .
sir edward never forgave mrs thatcher for ousting him as leader and refused to serve in her cabinet .
sir edward , seen with prime minister harold macmillan , retired in 2001 when asked in a tv interview if it was true that when mrs thatcher was herself deposed he said " rejoice , rejoice , " he joked : " i think i said it three times . "
after more than 50 years as an mp he retired from politics in 2001 .
his former colleague lord walker said history would " give him a high rating " , adding that he was a " very great man and an enormous patriot " .
former labour chancellor denis healey said sir edward had been a friend for many years after the pair met at oxford university .
" i liked him very much and i think he represented the sensible wing of the tory party but of course like others , ken clarke and geoffrey howe in particular , they could just not win over the extreme right-wing conservatives . "
in 2003 , sir edward 's health deteriorated while he was on holiday in austria .
he was being treated for a minor stomach upset at salzburg 's main hospital when tests revealed he was suffering from a pulmonary embolism - a blood clot on the lung .
sir edward , a bachelor , was famed for his love of music and sailing , in which he competed at international level .

members of a lecturers ' union at the university of wales institute in cardiff -lrb- uwic -rrb- passed the motion on tony chapman by 93 % to 7 % .
lecturers said they were unhappy with the way tony chapman is aiming for a merger with another university .
gordon harrhy , uwic board of governors ' chairman said he had confidence in the vice-chancellor .
members of lecturers ' union natfhe passed the vote of no confidence in the strategic leadership of mr chapman with 56 % of ballot papers returned .
of those papers returned , 93 % -lrb- 157 -rrb- voted in favour of the motion of no confidence , with 7 % -lrb- 11 -rrb- against .
lecturers have returned a no-confidence vote on tony chapman margaret phelan , natfhe regional official for wales , said : " july is an awkward time for an academic union to ballot its members as many have started their annual leave .
" therefore a 56 % return rate on a postal ballot evidences the real frustration and anger felt by our membership . "
the union said anger had been building among its members since plans to merge uwic and the university of glamorgan were abandoned in 2003 .
the union said plans to join glamorgan had been replaced with a scheme to merge with the university of wales , newport , which lecturers fear will attract less substantial funding .
' total confidence ' ms phelan added : " time is running out to secure significant new investment to start to repair the years of under funding in these three higher education institutions in south east wales . "
but gordon harrhy , chairman of uwic 's board of governors , said he had total confidence in mr chapman 's leadership .
he added : " for some time uwic has sought to meet the challenge of a changing higher education sector addressing the needs of a changing world .
" it is both regrettable and disappointing that as we drive forward with the strategic development of uwic for the benefit of our students and higher education in wales , there are still those who have yet to recognise that at the heart of the board 's strategy is uwic 's continuing work to meet this agenda .
" i have total confidence in the vice-chancellor and his management team as they seek to deliver the board 's policies . "
' put aside differences ' education minister jane davidson said : " the assembly government strongly supports the outcomes of the report by cooke and bull on the future of post-92 higher education in south east wales .

charman sits back in his chair , his legs resting on the handle bars of his bright orange motorised rickshaw .
he 's third in the queue at one of jakarta 's busiest petrol stations .
in front there 's a saloon car and a motorbike ; behind are a couple of taxis another rickshaw and a few more private cars .
" this is becoming a real problem " , he said .
" the pumps keep running out and sometimes i 've had to wait for up to half an hour for petrol .
all that time i 'm waiting , i ca n't take any passengers . "
on a good day charman makes about thirty thousand rupiah per day , about three us dollars .
but the petrol shortages which have spread across the country in the past two weeks have begun to eat into his meagre profits .
oil producer indonesia is an oil producer , the only member of opec in east asia .
indonesia expors large amounts of oil and natural gas but a lack of investment in the oil sector over the past decade , coupled with a rapid increase in domestic demand has meant that indonesia now has to import extra fuel to make up the difference .
recent parliamentary delays in approving a revised budget meant that the state oil company , pertamina , did n't have enough money to maintain reserves .
so supplies began to run short .
ari soermarno , senior vice president of pertamina , is clearly frustrated .
" we warned various parties a couple of months ago that if the money was n't paid on time , we would have problems , " he said .
" finally , now everybody realises that it is a real crisis .
i think the bureaucracy fails to recognise the impact of rising oil prices . "
that is the crux of the problem .
the budget was calculated on the assumption that international oil prices would stay at around $ 45 per barrel .
but prices have risen to nearer $ 60 per barrel which means the money the finance ministry gives to pertamina to buy fuel does n't go as far as it used to .
energy-saving president susilo bambang yudhoyono has responded to the crisis by calling for a more responsible , thrifty , approach to the use of energy .
the government is afraid to reduce its massive fuel subsidies civil servants have been told to go easy on the air conditioning and some street lights in major cities are being switched off .
television and radio stations have been asked to close down overnight -lrb- although there is an exemption for european football games ! -rrb- and ministerial motorcades will be reduced , all in a bid to save power .
but a growing number of economists and business leaders are sceptical that such energy conservation measures will have a major impact .
huge subsidies the real issue at the heart of the problem , they say , is the ballooning subsidies the government pays to keep fuel prices low .
as oil prices rise , so does the cost of the subsidies .
" the subsidies only benefit the middle and upper classes " , said chatib basri , director of the institute for economic and social research in jakarta .
" but this middle class has a powerful voice , especially when protecting their own interests .
if you ask me , fuel prices have to go up .
so the question is really whether that idea , which is economically sound , is politically acceptable or not . "
the trouble is , the government has already raised fuel prices once in march , and it promised not to do so again this year .
tofu-makers worries in a dimly lit concrete and brick shed in a back street of jakarta , about thirty people are hard at work .
turkino is worried his costs will rise some are stirring big vats of greyish white , bubbling liquid .
others are scooping up the thickened curd that 's already been boiled , wrapping it in bits of cotton , and putting it the small packages into wooden trays divided into squares .
this is one of indonesia 's hundreds of tofu factories , a cottage industry supplying the local community with one of its staple foods .
turkino has been making tofu for more than thirty years .
the process uses a lot of kerosene -lrb- paraffin -rrb- .
talk of fuel price rises makes turkino nervous .
he currently employs nine staff , and is determined that he wo n't lay anybody off .
but other options are limited .
" i ca n't really raise the price of the tofu , because then people wo n't buy as much , " he said .
" maybe we 'll just have to make the blocks smaller .
but really i do n't understand how we can be in this situation in these modern times .
we do n't ask much .
we just want the government to meet our basic needs . "
subsidies vs. development but the government has less and less to spend on people 's needs , such as health care or education , because it 's spending so much on subsidising the cost of fuel .
if international oil prices stay at current levels , the subsidy bill by the end of the year will be in the region of $ 11bn -lrb- £ 6bn -rrb- .
that 's almost twice the amount that experts say will be needed to rebuild the tsunami ravaged province of aceh .
indonesia simply ca n't afford cheap fuel anymore , but it will take a lot of courage for the politicians to say that publicly .

professor lawrence lessig , a champion of so-called " free culture " , told the bbc digital technology was inspiring new forms of creativity .
blogs , podcasts and digital photos are examples of amateur culture , he said .
" digital tools are inspiring creativity in a way that i do not think we have seen in a very long time , " he said .
professor lessig , who teaches law at stanford university in the us , is a founder of creative commons , a set of copyright licenses which help creators share and protect their works .
he said : " if you think of the 20th century as this period of professionalising creativity - you 've got the film and recording industries which become the professional creators , separating and stifling in many ways the popular culture .
amateur culture - tv shows made out of video games are growing in popularity " i do not think you are going to see the elimination of the professional creators but you are going to see it complemented by a much wider range of amateur culture in the original sense of the word amateur - in that people do it purely for the love of creating . "
millions of people now have blogs - websites which are created using simple and free tools - and thousands of people are now podcasting , creating radio-style programmes which are distributed over the internet and can be transferred to mp3 players .
participatory culture there are a reported 60 million bloggers - writing everything from personal diaries to influential political rhetoric - and research firm the duffusion group recently predicted there will be 60 million podcasters in the us by 2010 .
we see moving image and audio as having the same potential for contributing to people 's live as books paul gerhardt , bbc creative archive thousands of other people are remixing songs , making their own films and tv programmes and generally participating in culture rather than being passive consumers .
professor lessig said this rise in amateur culture was not without its problems as the desire to be creative often clashes with that of traditional creators and content distributors .
' extraordinary potential ' " many of the professional creators do n't get it - they ca n't imagine a world where creativity is not controlled , " he said .
" but they should recognise this amateur creativity has extraordinary potential for them too . "
all the copy protection in the world wo n't stop ukrainian pirate gangs from stamping out millions of high-quality counterfeits a month cory doctorow cory doctorow , a campaigner for digital rights with lobby group electronic frontier foundation , agreed .
" we are in a pretty pitched battle on many , many fronts , " he said .
big media companies are imposing copy protection restrictions on what consumers can do with their purchases - whether they are cds , dvds , or digital songs - in an effort to prevent piracy .
but mr doctorow said : " all the copy protection in the world wo n't stop ukrainian pirate gangs from stamping out millions of high-quality counterfeits a month . "
professor lessig and mr doctorow believe the attitude of big business is stifling amateur creativity .
remix they want to see consumers take professional creative works they have bought and then alter them and share them with other people .
professor lessig gave an example of how it could work with the television industry .
" imagine you are channel 4 and you have a new series to be released .
" what you do is each week put the latest episode online and invite people to remix it .
" so you create this huge community of people remixing your content and you create this huge community of people watching your programme each week . "
the bbc is undertaking a long-term project to release hundreds of hours of its tv and radio archive online so that people can use it in creative ways .
paul gerhardt , head of the bbc 's creative archive scheme , said : " we see moving image and audio as having the same potential for contributing to people 's lives as books and the written word did .
' inspired ' " in other words , we all get inspired by what we read and we share it with others and we think nothing of quoting from it or building our creativity on it .
" yet it is almost impossible to access moving images or audio with the same ease and to use it in the same way . "
mr doctorow said the digital age - plus the growth in use of the creative commons license - was also fuelling collaborations between artists and authors , some of whom may never have met in real life .
creative commons is a licence which sets out in simple terms what others can or can not do with any creative work .
" we wanted a set of tools that would make it easy for artists to mark their creativity with the freedoms that they intended to carry , " said professor lessig .
" just as apple and microsoft provide tools for people to make music or documents we provide tools for people to solve legal problems .
" some creators will be happy for people to make non-commercial use of their work and we have a simple way of showing that .
" others are happy for people to make commercial use and we have simple way for them to enforce that . "

professor lessig , who teaches law at stanford university in the us , is a founder of creative commons , a set of copyright licenses which help creators share and protect their works .
he said : " if you think of the 20th century as this period of professionalising creativity - you 've got the film and recording industries which become the professional creators , separating and stifling in many ways the popular culture .
amateur culture - tv shows made out of video games are growing in popularity " i do not think you are going to see the elimination of the professional creators but you are going to see it complemented by a much wider range of amateur culture in the original sense of the word amateur - in that people do it purely for the love of creating . "
millions of people now have blogs - websites which are created using simple and free tools - and thousands of people are now podcasting , creating radio-style programmes which are distributed over the internet and can be transferred to mp3 players .

professor lessig said this rise in amateur culture was not without its problems as the desire to be creative often clashes with that of traditional creators and content distributors .
' extraordinary potential ' " many of the professional creators do n't get it - they ca n't imagine a world where creativity is not controlled , " he said .
" but they should recognise this amateur creativity has extraordinary potential for them too . "
all the copy protection in the world wo n't stop ukrainian pirate gangs from stamping out millions of high-quality counterfeits a month cory doctorow cory doctorow , a campaigner for digital rights with lobby group electronic frontier foundation , agreed .
" we are in a pretty pitched battle on many , many fronts , " he said .
big media companies are imposing copy protection restrictions on what consumers can do with their purchases - whether they are cds , dvds , or digital songs - in an effort to prevent piracy .
but mr doctorow said : " all the copy protection in the world wo n't stop ukrainian pirate gangs from stamping out millions of high-quality counterfeits a month . "
professor lessig and mr doctorow believe the attitude of big business is stifling amateur creativity .
remix they want to see consumers take professional creative works they have bought and then alter them and share them with other people .
professor lessig gave an example of how it could work with the television industry .
" imagine you are channel 4 and you have a new series to be released .
" what you do is each week put the latest episode online and invite people to remix it .
" so you create this huge community of people remixing your content and you create this huge community of people watching your programme each week . "
the bbc is undertaking a long-term project to release hundreds of hours of its tv and radio archive online so that people can use it in creative ways .
paul gerhardt , head of the bbc 's creative archive scheme , said : " we see moving image and audio as having the same potential for contributing to people 's lives as books and the written word did .
' inspired ' " in other words , we all get inspired by what we read and we share it with others and we think nothing of quoting from it or building our creativity on it .
" yet it is almost impossible to access moving images or audio with the same ease and to use it in the same way . "
mr doctorow said the digital age - plus the growth in use of the creative commons license - was also fuelling collaborations between artists and authors , some of whom may never have met in real life .
creative commons is a licence which sets out in simple terms what others can or can not do with any creative work .
" we wanted a set of tools that would make it easy for artists to mark their creativity with the freedoms that they intended to carry , " said professor lessig .
" just as apple and microsoft provide tools for people to make music or documents we provide tools for people to solve legal problems .
" some creators will be happy for people to make non-commercial use of their work and we have a simple way of showing that .

the healthcare commission highlighted overcrowding , dirty toilets , a shortage of midwives and inadequate organisation after investigations at three units .
health minister liam bryne admitted services were " not yet good enough " and said an action plan was being drawn up .
the commission blamed bad management for the problems .
it is due to publish a broader report on the nhs on monday .
units investigated northwick park , north london : 10 women died during or after birth over two years new cross hospital , wolverhampton : a review of 20 deaths between 2001 and 2003 found that half might have lived with better care ashford and st peter 's nhs trust , surrey : " feuding " between consultants was jeopardising patient care ' my care was sub-standard ' the investigations - at three units that have suffered high mortality rates in the last two years - also found doctors who did not explain what was happening to patients , and staff too busy to advise on feeding and bathing of new babies .
sir ian kennedy , who chaired the report , called on nhs trusts in england and wales to review their maternity services because of huge differences between the best and worst .
poor practice he blamed a lack of effective leadership and management in units which were failing to achieve high standards .
staff training and the ability to work in teams was also lacking .
" i find it surprising that a service like the nhs , with so many dedicated people working in it , can have pockets of really poor practice , where we have not learned from the wisdom and knowledge and experience that has been put around for a long time as to how to deliver babies in a safe manner , and how to look after mothers .
" we are still not doing it as well as we should , and it is a matter that we need to get a grip on . "
the majority of the 650,000-plus births every year in the uk take place in nhs hospitals .
services are not yet good enough to meet the needs of all women and babies health minister liam bryne mr byrne said : " we welcome his acknowledgement that giving birth is safer now than ever before and that very few babies or mothers die .
" however services are not yet good enough to meet the needs of all women and babies , wherever they live and whoever they are , and that is why the government continues in reforming , as well as investing in , maternity services in the uk . "
shadow health secretary andrew lansley said : " these findings from the healthcare commission are deeply worrying .
" they show that despite increasing resources for the nhs , a lack of genuine reform means resources are wasted and services are not held accountable for the standards they meet and to the wishes of patients . "
mikaela morris , a senior midwife at st peter 's hospital in surrey , which was investigated by the commission , said her unit had suffered from a shortage of midwives .
at one stage they were operating with about 70 when they needed 100 .
" it is a big national problem .
we have not had enough people wanting to become midwives . "
but she urged people to join the profession , saying while it could have " tragic moments " it was " very very rewarding " .
the report into the broader nhs is expected to show that staff shortages , aged buildings , poor training and weak management are hitting standards .

" however services are not yet good enough to meet the needs of all women and babies , wherever they live and whoever they are , and that is why the government continues in reforming , as well as investing in , maternity services in the uk . "
shadow health secretary andrew lansley said : " these findings from the healthcare commission are deeply worrying .
" they show that despite increasing resources for the nhs , a lack of genuine reform means resources are wasted and services are not held accountable for the standards they meet and to the wishes of patients . "
mikaela morris , a senior midwife at st peter 's hospital in surrey , which was investigated by the commission , said her unit had suffered from a shortage of midwives .
at one stage they were operating with about 70 when they needed 100 .
" it is a big national problem .
we have not had enough people wanting to become midwives . "
but she urged people to join the profession , saying while it could have " tragic moments " it was " very very rewarding " .
the report into the broader nhs is expected to show that staff shortages , aged buildings , poor training and weak management are hitting standards .
