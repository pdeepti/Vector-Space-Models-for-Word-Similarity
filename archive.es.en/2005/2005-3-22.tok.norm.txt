germany feels it 's inched closer to reaching its goal of a permanent seat on the un security council . calling for action , not more words , to fulfil pledges already made , un secretary general kofi annan presented his plan for overhauling the un to the general assembly on monday . if acted on , the proposals - ranging from a nine-member increase in the security council 's membership to the establishment of a new human rights council - would mark the most wide-ranging reforms since the un was founded 60 years ago .

" it matters a lot in which way you ’ re trying to make yourself part of the equation .
i personally believe that our campaign for a permanent seat on the un security council has been a bit too brash and self-complacent at times , " said claudia nolte , foreign affairs spokeswoman for the christian democrats . " this may have turned potential supporters into opponents .
secondly , the german government should state more clearly why it thinks it deserves a permanent seat and in which way it ’ ll live up to greater responsibilities .
people here and abroad have a right to know this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sources close to the us administration believe that germany ’ s hopes for a permanent seat will be dashed by what they view as the country ’ s failure to do enough for iraq ’ s post-war reconstruction .
in addition , they say , germany might not be able to live up to its greater responsibility financially , given its economic woes at present . in fact , kofi annan himself made it clear that a country ’ s financial contributions to the world body would play no small role in deciding which new members to accept on the council .
consequently , government spokesman thomas steg said on tuesday that official development assistance had to be increased substantially in order to move closer to the aim of allocating 0.7 percent of gdp to development aid by 2015 , as laid down in the un millennium goals .
at present , germany only spends 0.29 percent of gdp for this purpose - too little to impress anyone in the world body . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany says un record a success germany 's two-year stint as a non-permanent member of the un security council ended at the end of last year .

but , in reality , the pact will have degenerated into an arbitrary document .
the european commission - which is meant to police compliance to the deficit caps - will be instructed to take into account exceptional circumstances when they consider exacting disciplinary measures for deficit breaches .
thus , the german finance minister , for example , will be able to claim the costs of developing eastern germany as a special burden - and other states will follow and use their imaginations to devise new exceptional circumstances . loosening the stability pact is n't a license to make debts , says germany 's finance minister - but that 's how it will be understood in the euro zone .

" parties that make no secret of their racist , xenophobic or neo-nazi leanings should be banned , " he said . the report on racism , xenophobia and discrimination placed a special focus on extreme right parties in eastern germany , saying that it was " particularly worrying " that rightwing extremist parties such as the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- increased public support in recent state elections through racist slogans . also highlighting racist violence in russia and elsewhere , the report called on the 25 " to take account of its ethnic , cultural and religious pluralism . " german foreign minister joschka fischer , visiting the commission tuesday did not directly address the issue but said that " human rights violations in particular countries must be called so by name . " harry 's nazi gaffe sparks uproar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a copy of tabloid ' the sun ' , whose front page shows a picture of britain 's prince harry wearing a nazi soldier 's uniform to a fancy dress party .
the push to highlight racism follows increased attempts by eu member states to push for an eu-wide ban on neo-nazi symbols after prince harry of england caused an uproar when appearing at a costume party in a nazi uniform . the initiative was squashed by britain and italy because of concerns that such a ban would limit the basic right of freedom of expression .
but eu ministers did agree last month to reanimate a sleeping debate on regulating racism and xenophobia .
in this case , great britain and italy dropped up their blockade-like reaction .
among other things , the agreement would make it punishable by law to deny the holocaust or other crimes against humanity . meanwhile , the german upper house of parliament passed legislation last week in another attempt to crack down on far right parties : the initiative seeks to curb neo-nazi marches amid concerns the extreme-right will target celebrations to mark the end of the war in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : among some 6,000 sympathizers of the national party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- attended a neo-nazi meeting in the eastern german city of leipzig in 1998 .
the far right , led by the npd , is planning to march past the new holocaust memorial in berlin and to the brandenburg gate on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of germany 's capitulation .

the industry has n't been this excited since a girl named nena sang about 99 red balloons more than 20 years ago . were it not for the german-speaking djs and ads , there would be nothing to distinguish german radio of the past few years with stations in britain and america .
the playlists read like they were copied from the us billboard top 20 charts , the main artists , world stars like puff daddy and christina aguilera .
then a berlin rock band with a female vocalist and the modest name " wir sind helden " - we are heroes - exploded onto the scene last summer , riding to the top of the german charts and selling a stupendous 500,000 records .
suddenly , rock auf deutsch was all the rage - again .
" they opened the gate , " said hannes ross , pop music critic at stern , the magazine with the largest circulation in germany .
" all of a sudden the record companies were waiting in line , wondering , ' why do n't we have a band like that under contract ?
we also need a german band ' ! "
since then , german bands have stormed the charts .
a combination of weariness with the mainstream pop piped in from america and songs that promoters and radio programmers say are more intelligent and polished than in the past has led to a flood of media coverage - and improved sales .
german music steps up though illegal downloads and stingy german consumers still meant music sales in 2004 were down 3 percent from 2003 , the figure was a far cry from the 20 percent decrease in sales between 2002 and 2003 , according to the german office of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- .
german music " had a big part in that " turnaround , said hartmut spiesecke , spokesman for ifpi germany .
bands like silbermond -lrb- photo -rrb- , from the eastern german town of bautzen , and juli , from the city of giessen , near frankfurt , have sold hundreds of thousands of albums .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " silbermond " from the east german town of bautzen -lrb- left to right -rrb- : thomas stolle -lrb- 20 , guitar -rrb- , stefanie kloss -lrb- 19 , vocals -rrb- , andreas nowak -lrb- 21 , drums -rrb- and johannes stolle -lrb- 21 , bass -rrb- releases by german bands made up 30.3 percent of the albums on the charts in 2004 , the highest percentage ever , said spiesecke .
singles by german artists made up more than half of the singles on the charts , the second-highest in history .
" it is really amazing , " said aditya sharma , director of programming at the berlin radio station fritz .
" what the bands have done is make people believe that the german language and pop music are compatible . "
deutsch suddenly cool again fritz 's young listeners by and large rejected german music in the past , said sharma .
the reason : music in english sounded , well , cooler .
then came wir sind helden , whose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva briegel , lead singer of the band juli which , like other popular german bands at the moment , features a female lead vocalist and a bunch of guys playing back up debut album , " die reklamation , " or " the claim , " packed lyrics about being young in an economically-downtrodden germany with an upbeat mix of guitar and electronic sound .
ross said the band " hit a nerve " among students and other young people .
alternative radio stations in germany , like sharma 's , began playing wsh 's music in 2004 .
before long , the band had cobbled together 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,300 -rrb- to produce a video that got regular airtime on mtv .
" they came from the underground , and if the lyrics are good and people connect to it , why should n't they be successful ? " said matthias reimann , whose company was the first to heavily promote wir sind helden , sending a representative to radio stations across germany with a small bundle of cds .
juli and silbermond followed with double plantinum albums of their own .
for all the hype , germany 's pop phenomenon is n't expected to jump the atlantic , as british and french pop songs sometimes have , finding success in the us .
national , but not international , success # b # " the competition -lrb- in the international pop scene -rrb- is too tough , " said reimann .
" especially the pop music that comes out of america .
it 's much more polished , and the quality is higher . "
retaining supremacy in the national music market is more likely .
the test will come in the next few months , when bands like wir sind helden and silbermond release their second albums .
but things are looking good .
industry insiders said there has n't been this much hype surrounding german pop since a teenager named nena sang about 99 red balloons in 1984 .
" the last time things were this big was the neue deutsche welle , 20 years ago , " said sharma , referring to the string of german bands that made names for themselves internationally in the mid-1980s .
" and the bands nowadays - at least their lyrics - are much better .

but in doing so , the floodgates have been opened for reinterpreting the regulations meant to ensure budgetary discipline and a stable currency . let 's be honest .
rarely do sinners decide to punish themselves .
in that respect , establishing the european stability and growth pact - which germany successfully made a condition for abolishing the deutsche mark - was defective from the start , for there were and are many sinners .
countries like greece or italy would never have been allowed to join the euro club if the maastricht treaty 's convergence criteria had been applied verbatim .
france violated the treaty from 2002-2004 .
portugal did so in 2001 .
the netherlands breached it in 2003 .
greece swindled its way through every year .
and germany , the pact 's initiator , has n't kept its public debts below the ceiling of 3 percent of gdp since 2002 . if the heads of government sign the deal their finance ministers agreed to monday evening , the stability pact will remain formally valid - the 3 percent cap and the deficit limit of 60 percent of gdp annually will go untouched .
but , in reality , the pact will have degenerated into an arbitrary document .
the european commission - which is meant to police compliance to the deficit caps - will be instructed to take into account exceptional circumstances when they consider exacting disciplinary measures for deficit breaches .
thus , the german finance minister , for example , will be able to claim the costs of developing eastern germany as a special burden - and other states will follow and use their imaginations to devise new exceptional circumstances . loosening the stability pact is n't a license to make debts , says germany 's finance minister - but that 's how it will be understood in the euro zone .
the idea of the stability pact is dead .
the idea was that the maastricht treaty 's admission criteria would be made permanent to encourage budgetary discipline .
the idea was that future generations would n't be left with a mountain of debt .
the idea was to show the rest of the world that the euro zone had an elementary interest in ensuring a strong and stable euro . little remains of these ideas .
and you do n't need much imagination to predict where political discussions will take us in the coming years , namely , examining what can be considered euro-zone admission criteria .
ca n't spending on research and education be included ?
can france bring to bear its developmental aid ?
do n't investments in infrastructure count since they 're meant to serve future generations ?
the floodgates are open for wrangling in brussels . all the same , the euro zone can point to the fact that its currency has become strong and stable - even without budgetary discipline on the part of its member countries .
however , this impression is misleading .
the euro is currently sought-after on the currency markets only because many investors are concerned about the us twin deficit and are consequently avoiding the dollar .
but they certainly are n't asking for the euro because they 're impressed by the euro zone 's budgetary discipline .
for that is surely nothing to marvel at . rolf wenkel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mixed reactions to stability pact rewrite in the wake of sunday 's decision to loosen the rules of the stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , opposition voices in germany are crying foul .

another issue up for debate is america 's controversial nomination of paul wolfowitz as head of the world bank . the spring economic summit beginning tuesday in brussels will likely start off with a quick approval of a reform of the eu 's stability and growth pact , which eu finance ministers agreed upon on sunday . according to luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude junker , who will chair the meeting , there will be little discussion and " certainly not any tough debate " on the loosening of the eu deficit rules , which was passed largely thanks to germany 's fierce lobbying efforts . the rules governing the euro , namely that countries should keep their deficits under three percent of gross domestic product , have not been scrapped .
however , the reform will allow the rules to be interpreted more loosely and give governments space to spend more in order to get their economies moving . starting the motor summit participants aim to focus on europe 's sclerotic economy and look at ways of revving up a motor that has been sputtering for some time now .
leaders say they hope to agree on more business-friendly measures and increased research spending to boost long-term growth . in 2000 , eu heads drew up the " lisbon agenda , " a strategy paper that has the ambitious goal of europe becoming the world 's most dynamic economy by 2010 .
the brussels meeting will take another look at that plan at its half-way mark .
the judgment wo n't likely be too positive .
already last month , the eu admitted that its underperforming economy had made the lisbon agreement 's 2010 deadline impossible to achieve . contention one divisive issue that could cloud the summit is the proposed eu services directive , introduced by former internal market commissioner frits bolkestein .
the directive , which would greatly liberalize the eu 's services market , has run into a wall of protest , both from leaders and the public . on monday , french president jacques chirac repeated his vocal critique of the directive and germany 's chancellor gerhard schröder has expressed fears that were the directive to go into effect , it would lead to wage dumping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man shows his shirt slogan as he marches , together with an estimated 50,000 protesters , during a demonstration in downtown brussels on march 19 on saturday , 50,000 people demonstrated against the plan in brussels , arguing the directive will destroy many well-paid jobs in the western part of the eu and end the traditional ways in many professions . world politics could also invade the economic roundtable as the issue of lifting the eu ban on selling arms to china is called into question again .
britain once against cast doubt on the wisdom of such a move , although abolishing the ban is supported by fellow eu heavyweights germany and france . china 's recent assertion that it would use force if taiwan - which the mainland considers a breakaway province - formally declared its independence has made it more difficult for the eu to lift the arms embargo , uk foreign secretary jack straw said . controversial nomination the nomination by us president george w. bush to head the world bank will also be discussed by european leaders .
when the us leader announced the nomination of paul wolfowitz , deputy defense secretary and major architect of the us-led war in iraq , it was met with private consternation by many in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz , president bush 's choice for world bank president however , chancellor schröder has said germany will not oppose wolfowitz 's -lrb- photo -rrb- nomination , saying he thought wolfowitz could yield positive surprises in his role as the head of the global lending institution and that berlin could work constructively with him .
the netherlands said it would have liked a wider field of candidates . it is , however , unlikely that the europeans will try to block wolfowitz , especially at a time when they are trying to heal the deep rifts with the us that formed over the iraq war .

another issue up for debate is america 's controversial nomination of paul wolfowitz as head of the world bank . the spring economic summit beginning tuesday in brussels will likely start off with a quick approval of a reform of the eu 's stability and growth pact , which eu finance ministers agreed upon on sunday . according to luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude junker , who will chair the meeting , there will be little discussion and " certainly not any tough debate " on the loosening of the eu deficit rules , which was passed largely thanks to germany 's fierce lobbying efforts . the rules governing the euro , namely that countries should keep their deficits under three percent of gross domestic product , have not been scrapped .
however , the reform will allow the rules to be interpreted more loosely and give governments space to spend more in order to get their economies moving . starting the motor summit participants aim to focus on europe 's sclerotic economy and look at ways of revving up a motor that has been sputtering for some time now .
leaders say they hope to agree on more business-friendly measures and increased research spending to boost long-term growth . in 2000 , eu heads drew up the " lisbon agenda , " a strategy paper that has the ambitious goal of europe becoming the world 's most dynamic economy by 2010 .
the brussels meeting will take another look at that plan at its half-way mark .
the judgment wo n't likely be too positive .
already last month , the eu admitted that its underperforming economy had made the lisbon agreement 's 2010 deadline impossible to achieve . contention one divisive issue that could cloud the summit is the proposed eu services directive , introduced by former internal market commissioner frits bolkestein .
the directive , which would greatly liberalize the eu 's services market , has run into a wall of protest , both from leaders and the public . on monday , french president jacques chirac repeated his vocal critique of the directive and germany 's chancellor gerhard schröder has expressed fears that were the directive to go into effect , it would lead to wage dumping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man shows his shirt slogan as he marches , together with an estimated 50,000 protesters , during a demonstration in downtown brussels on march 19 on saturday , 50,000 people demonstrated against the plan in brussels , arguing the directive will destroy many well-paid jobs in the western part of the eu and end the traditional ways in many professions . world politics could also invade the economic roundtable as the issue of lifting the eu ban on selling arms to china is called into question again .
britain once against cast doubt on the wisdom of such a move , although abolishing the ban is supported by fellow eu heavyweights germany and france . china 's recent assertion that it would use force if taiwan - which the mainland considers a breakaway province - formally declared its independence has made it more difficult for the eu to lift the arms embargo , uk foreign secretary jack straw said . controversial nomination the nomination by us president george w. bush to head the world bank will also be discussed by european leaders .
when the us leader announced the nomination of paul wolfowitz , deputy defense secretary and major architect of the us-led war in iraq , it was met with private consternation by many in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz , president bush 's choice for world bank president however , chancellor schröder has said germany will not oppose wolfowitz 's -lrb- photo -rrb- nomination , saying he thought wolfowitz could yield positive surprises in his role as the head of the global lending institution and that berlin could work constructively with him .
the netherlands said it would have liked a wider field of candidates . it is , however , unlikely that the europeans will try to block wolfowitz , especially at a time when they are trying to heal the deep rifts with the us that formed over the iraq war .

but in doing so , the floodgates have been opened for reinterpreting the regulations meant to ensure budgetary discipline and a stable currency . let 's be honest .
rarely do sinners decide to punish themselves .
in that respect , establishing the european stability and growth pact - which germany successfully made a condition for abolishing the deutsche mark - was defective from the start , for there were and are many sinners .
countries like greece or italy would never have been allowed to join the euro club if the maastricht treaty 's convergence criteria had been applied verbatim .
france violated the treaty from 2002-2004 .
portugal did so in 2001 .
the netherlands breached it in 2003 .
greece swindled its way through every year .
and germany , the pact 's initiator , has n't kept its public debts below the ceiling of 3 percent of gdp since 2002 . if the heads of government sign the deal their finance ministers agreed to monday evening , the stability pact will remain formally valid - the 3 percent cap and the deficit limit of 60 percent of gdp annually will go untouched .
but , in reality , the pact will have degenerated into an arbitrary document .
the european commission - which is meant to police compliance to the deficit caps - will be instructed to take into account exceptional circumstances when they consider exacting disciplinary measures for deficit breaches .
thus , the german finance minister , for example , will be able to claim the costs of developing eastern germany as a special burden - and other states will follow and use their imaginations to devise new exceptional circumstances . loosening the stability pact is n't a license to make debts , says germany 's finance minister - but that 's how it will be understood in the euro zone .
the idea of the stability pact is dead .
the idea was that the maastricht treaty 's admission criteria would be made permanent to encourage budgetary discipline .
the idea was that future generations would n't be left with a mountain of debt .
the idea was to show the rest of the world that the euro zone had an elementary interest in ensuring a strong and stable euro . little remains of these ideas .

however , this impression is misleading .
the euro is currently sought-after on the currency markets only because many investors are concerned about the us twin deficit and are consequently avoiding the dollar .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.03.2005 germany welcomes annan 's call for action 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is hoping to take a permanent seat at the coveted table kofi annan 's ambitious reform plans for the united nations have met with a largely positive response in europe .
germany feels it 's inched closer to reaching its goal of a permanent seat on the un security council . calling for action , not more words , to fulfil pledges already made , un secretary general kofi annan presented his plan for overhauling the un to the general assembly on monday . if acted on , the proposals - ranging from a nine-member increase in the security council 's membership to the establishment of a new human rights council - would mark the most wide-ranging reforms since the un was founded 60 years ago . " this hall has heard enough high-sounding declarations to last us for some decades to come , " annan told the assembly .
" we know what the problems are , and we all know what we have promised to achieve .
what is needed now is not more declarations , but action to fulfil the promises already made . " germany optimistic one of the most closely-watched ideas in annan ’ s recommendations is the expansion of the security council .
" i urge member states to make the security council more broadly representative of the international community as a whole , as well as of the geographic realities of today , " the secretary general said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi annan called for strong reforms to the un though there was no explicit mention of germany , one of the aspirants to a permanent un seat , the german government on monday indicated that it welcomed annan 's clear statement . germany has fervently lobbied for a permanent seat on the council and felt " strongly reconfirmed " in its ambitions , said the berlin government ’ s deputy spokesman thomas steg .
german foreign minister joschka fischer on tuesday also welcomed annan 's sweeping reform proposals for the united nations , saying they were crucial for peace and stability in the 21st century . " it showed a healthy dose of realism , " fischer said . although security council reform has been discussed at the un for decades , the issue is so complex and politically sensitive that agreement has been impossible .
seeking to break the deadlock , annan urged realistic action . " it would be preferable for member states to take this vital decision by consensus , " said annan .
" but if they are unable to reach consensus , this must not become an excuse for postponing action . " should it come to a crucial vote , the german government assumed it would gain the necessary majority for a permanent seat , steg said . former german defense minister volker rühe , from the opposition christian democrats , said the world would need the un more than ever before in the 21st century .
for this reason , the security council could no longer have a setup dating from the aftermath of world war ii . " the current member states do not adequately reflect the 21st century , " rühe told german news agency dpa . two models for the security council a un high-level panel has outlined two possible models for increasing the security council 's membership to make it more representative and inclusive . model a would add six new members to its five permanent members , britain , china , france , russia and the united states .
the new permanent seats would , however , have no veto power .
this model also recommends an additional three new two-year terms or non-permanent seats , divided among africa , asia and the pacific , europe and the americas . model b would add a third tier of semi-permanent members to the council , with no new permanent seats , but rather a new category of eight four-year , renewable-term seats and one new two-year , non-permanent -lrb- and non-renewable -rrb- seat , divided among the major regional areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india , japan , brazil and germany formed the g4 group to lobby for a permanent council seat germany - together with japan , brazil and india - launched a joint effort for permanent seats on the council last year .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " silbermond " from the east german town of bautzen -lrb- left to right -rrb- : thomas stolle -lrb- 20 , guitar -rrb- , stefanie kloss -lrb- 19 , vocals -rrb- , andreas nowak -lrb- 21 , drums -rrb- and johannes stolle -lrb- 21 , bass -rrb- releases by german bands made up 30.3 percent of the albums on the charts in 2004 , the highest percentage ever , said spiesecke .
singles by german artists made up more than half of the singles on the charts , the second-highest in history .
" it is really amazing , " said aditya sharma , director of programming at the berlin radio station fritz .
" what the bands have done is make people believe that the german language and pop music are compatible . "
deutsch suddenly cool again fritz 's young listeners by and large rejected german music in the past , said sharma .
the reason : music in english sounded , well , cooler .
then came wir sind helden , whose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva briegel , lead singer of the band juli which , like other popular german bands at the moment , features a female lead vocalist and a bunch of guys playing back up debut album , " die reklamation , " or " the claim , " packed lyrics about being young in an economically-downtrodden germany with an upbeat mix of guitar and electronic sound .
ross said the band " hit a nerve " among students and other young people .
alternative radio stations in germany , like sharma 's , began playing wsh 's music in 2004 .
before long , the band had cobbled together 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,300 -rrb- to produce a video that got regular airtime on mtv .
" they came from the underground , and if the lyrics are good and people connect to it , why should n't they be successful ? " said matthias reimann , whose company was the first to heavily promote wir sind helden , sending a representative to radio stations across germany with a small bundle of cds .
juli and silbermond followed with double plantinum albums of their own .
for all the hype , germany 's pop phenomenon is n't expected to jump the atlantic , as british and french pop songs sometimes have , finding success in the us .
national , but not international , success # b # " the competition -lrb- in the international pop scene -rrb- is too tough , " said reimann .
" especially the pop music that comes out of america .
it 's much more polished , and the quality is higher . "
retaining supremacy in the national music market is more likely .
the test will come in the next few months , when bands like wir sind helden and silbermond release their second albums .
but things are looking good .
industry insiders said there has n't been this much hype surrounding german pop since a teenager named nena sang about 99 red balloons in 1984 .
" the last time things were this big was the neue deutsche welle , 20 years ago , " said sharma , referring to the string of german bands that made names for themselves internationally in the mid-1980s .
" and the bands nowadays - at least their lyrics - are much better .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 22.03.2005 long-lost bach cantata revived großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bach composed the cantata in 1728 a piece by german composer johann sebastian bach lost for decades has come to life in japan this week , shedding new light on the 18th-century baroque master . the wedding cantata bwv216 resurfaced a year ago by chance in the papers of chieko hara , the japanese pianist who died in december 2001 at the age 86 after a career spent largely in europe . bach had composed the cantata in 1728 for the wedding of a customs official 's daughter in leipzig .
the original score has never been recovered , but the version discovered in japan was believed to have been copied by one of bach 's students under his stewardship . the eight rediscovered pages consist almost uniquely of vocal pieces in german for soprano and alto , with the seven movements lasting for a total of between 20 and 25 minutes .
the instrumental parts are entirely lost except for two recycled movements , a duet and an aria which had been used elsewhere in bach 's work .
the text is an allegorical dialogue between two rivers in saxony , the pleisse and the neisse , which represent the groom and the young bride . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thankfully still here " this is my dinosaur " american musicologist joshua rifkin , a conductor and composer who is one of the leading interpreters of bach was asked to recreate the missing instrumental parts .
he said he originally wanted to let the lost cantata rest . " maybe a fragment should stay a fragment , " rifkin told afp .
" then i thought of palaeontologists , from one bone they figure the entire dinosaur .
this is my dinosaur . " at first , rifkin thought the challenge would be too difficult .
in the end , he decided to take up the project which he described as a " musical rubik 's cube " . " i could not reconstruct what bach wrote but i could give the people of today an idea of what his music was like , " rifkin said .

germany feels it 's inched closer to reaching its goal of a permanent seat on the un security council . calling for action , not more words , to fulfil pledges already made , un secretary general kofi annan presented his plan for overhauling the un to the general assembly on monday . if acted on , the proposals - ranging from a nine-member increase in the security council 's membership to the establishment of a new human rights council - would mark the most wide-ranging reforms since the un was founded 60 years ago . " this hall has heard enough high-sounding declarations to last us for some decades to come , " annan told the assembly .
" we know what the problems are , and we all know what we have promised to achieve .
what is needed now is not more declarations , but action to fulfil the promises already made . " germany optimistic one of the most closely-watched ideas in annan ’ s recommendations is the expansion of the security council .
" i urge member states to make the security council more broadly representative of the international community as a whole , as well as of the geographic realities of today , " the secretary general said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi annan called for strong reforms to the un though there was no explicit mention of germany , one of the aspirants to a permanent un seat , the german government on monday indicated that it welcomed annan 's clear statement . germany has fervently lobbied for a permanent seat on the council and felt " strongly reconfirmed " in its ambitions , said the berlin government ’ s deputy spokesman thomas steg .
german foreign minister joschka fischer on tuesday also welcomed annan 's sweeping reform proposals for the united nations , saying they were crucial for peace and stability in the 21st century . " it showed a healthy dose of realism , " fischer said . although security council reform has been discussed at the un for decades , the issue is so complex and politically sensitive that agreement has been impossible .
seeking to break the deadlock , annan urged realistic action . " it would be preferable for member states to take this vital decision by consensus , " said annan .
" but if they are unable to reach consensus , this must not become an excuse for postponing action . " should it come to a crucial vote , the german government assumed it would gain the necessary majority for a permanent seat , steg said . former german defense minister volker rühe , from the opposition christian democrats , said the world would need the un more than ever before in the 21st century .
for this reason , the security council could no longer have a setup dating from the aftermath of world war ii . " the current member states do not adequately reflect the 21st century , " rühe told german news agency dpa . two models for the security council a un high-level panel has outlined two possible models for increasing the security council 's membership to make it more representative and inclusive . model a would add six new members to its five permanent members , britain , china , france , russia and the united states .
the new permanent seats would , however , have no veto power .
this model also recommends an additional three new two-year terms or non-permanent seats , divided among africa , asia and the pacific , europe and the americas . model b would add a third tier of semi-permanent members to the council , with no new permanent seats , but rather a new category of eight four-year , renewable-term seats and one new two-year , non-permanent -lrb- and non-renewable -rrb- seat , divided among the major regional areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india , japan , brazil and germany formed the g4 group to lobby for a permanent council seat germany - together with japan , brazil and india - launched a joint effort for permanent seats on the council last year .
in a joint statement issued monday , the four nations welcomed annan 's report and said they would work with all member states to reach agreement on council reform based on model a. they noted that recent general assembly debates had demonstrated that " a clear majority " of states favored adding permanent and non-permanent members from both developed and developing countries . cautious reactions from washington in a telephone conversation with annan , us president george w. bush told the un chief his speech on un reforms " had some constructive ideas " and that he looked forward to working with annan on it , said white house spokesman scott mccellan . but earlier , the united states cast doubt on a council resolution that would set rules for authorizing military force .
" frankly , we 're skeptical that any kind of resolution on the use of force would be helpful , " said deputy state department spokesman adam ereli . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's un ambassador gunter pleuger thinks his country will make it into the security council the german ambassador to the un , gunter pleuger , said he was nevertheless confident that the united states would agree to un improvements . " we saw in the past year that even the largest power in the world can ’ t win peace by itself , even if it won a war previously , " said pleuger .

the original score has never been recovered , but the version discovered in japan was believed to have been copied by one of bach 's students under his stewardship . the eight rediscovered pages consist almost uniquely of vocal pieces in german for soprano and alto , with the seven movements lasting for a total of between 20 and 25 minutes .
the instrumental parts are entirely lost except for two recycled movements , a duet and an aria which had been used elsewhere in bach 's work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 22.03.2005 long-lost bach cantata revived großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bach composed the cantata in 1728 a piece by german composer johann sebastian bach lost for decades has come to life in japan this week , shedding new light on the 18th-century baroque master . the wedding cantata bwv216 resurfaced a year ago by chance in the papers of chieko hara , the japanese pianist who died in december 2001 at the age 86 after a career spent largely in europe . bach had composed the cantata in 1728 for the wedding of a customs official 's daughter in leipzig .
the original score has never been recovered , but the version discovered in japan was believed to have been copied by one of bach 's students under his stewardship . the eight rediscovered pages consist almost uniquely of vocal pieces in german for soprano and alto , with the seven movements lasting for a total of between 20 and 25 minutes .
the instrumental parts are entirely lost except for two recycled movements , a duet and an aria which had been used elsewhere in bach 's work .
the text is an allegorical dialogue between two rivers in saxony , the pleisse and the neisse , which represent the groom and the young bride . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thankfully still here " this is my dinosaur " american musicologist joshua rifkin , a conductor and composer who is one of the leading interpreters of bach was asked to recreate the missing instrumental parts .
he said he originally wanted to let the lost cantata rest . " maybe a fragment should stay a fragment , " rifkin told afp .
" then i thought of palaeontologists , from one bone they figure the entire dinosaur .
this is my dinosaur . " at first , rifkin thought the challenge would be too difficult .
in the end , he decided to take up the project which he described as a " musical rubik 's cube " . " i could not reconstruct what bach wrote but i could give the people of today an idea of what his music was like , " rifkin said .
" it sounds like bach 's music , " he said .
" but the listener should not know which part is bach 's , which part is mine . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connection , in politics and in the arts lost for decades the cantata , which despite being yellow with age remained in good state , was authenticated by a team of experts led by bach specialist , professor tadashi isoyama of the kunitachi college of music in suburban tokyo . the copy of the cantata passed from collector to collector and had vanished for 80 years .
the only thing known for sure is that it belonged to a descendant of the german composer felix mendelssohn until the 1920s . experts believe hara likely inherited the cantata - but was oblivious to its existence - from her husband , the late spanish cellist gaspar cassado , who knew the mendelssohn family . huge impact for isoyama , the music professor , the rediscovery of the cantata is " very important " to the understanding of bach , who lived from 1685 to 1750 : " this finding has a huge impact in the music world , " isoyama said . while there were attempts to recreate the cantata in the early 20th century , isoyama said the difference this time was the involvement of rifkin with his knowledge of bach . " he reconstructed the instrumental score .
this is history making because -lrb- his -rrb- high-level score is reconstructed , truly reflecting bach 's style , " isoyama said . passionate musical audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johann sebastian bach the wedding cantata had its debut sunday in the small hall of suntory hall in tokyo , one of the world 's most prestigious venues for classical music , with two of bach 's profane cantatas bwv202 and bwv210 . " japan is full of bach lovers ; " said rifkin , who has been directing the ensemble bach concertino osaka in western japan for five years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.03.2005 berlin faces lawsuit demanding cleaner air the eu ’ s new clean air laws are not being upheld in major german cities .
citizens have now taken legal action against berlin to reduce pollutants in the air .
other german cities could have to tackle similar cases . major german cities are facing a wave of lawsuits for not giving their citizens air clean enough to breathe .
berlin could become the first city to be legally forced to introduce measures to improve air quality .
the german environmental organization deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- duh -rrb- began a planned string of legal action on monday by supporting lawsuits from three berlin citizens .
similar suits would follow in munich , stuttgart and other major cities , duh said . the charges are a result of the eu 's new clean air laws , which took effect on jan .
1 , 2005 .
these place limits on the air levels of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants , such as soot particles emitted by diesel vehicles .
german cities and municipalities have to control their air quality and take countermeasures if the toxic levels are too high . duh director jürgen resch criticized that the cities had long been aware of the planned changes and had simply disregarded the directive .
" the citizens concerned are taking legal action out of pure self-defense , " resch told journalists in berlin . banning diesel vehicles in large cities like berlin , sticking to the new limits is a challenge .
they stipulate that so-called particulate matter , the concentration of fine dust in the air , can not exceed 50 micrograms per cubic meter on more than 35 days of the year .
these pollutants have been found to cause respiratory and cardiovascular diseases . berlin has exceeded these levels by far in previous years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the more traffic that heads into cities , the higher the level of pollutants resch criticized that municipalities , state and federal governments had been inactive for years in battling these pollutants .
yet the eu directive has been known since 1999 .
he said duh supported lawsuits in order to push through measures to clean up the air , such as driving bans for diesel vehicles without particle filters . " we call on the cities to quickly take action to ban diesel vehicles without a filter from the cities and therefore contribute to a drastic reduction in the levels of fine dust in the air , " said resch . however , federal environment minister jürgen trittin said he thinks it would be more effective to tackle the problem at its source . " i think it would be better to ensure that we find a replacement for old cars and a re-fitting of diesel vehicles very quickly in order to really reduce the levels of fine dust , " said trittin . an unsuitable action plan for cleaner air the three plaintiffs in the berlin case live on the heavily-traveled frankfurter allee in the city 's friedrichshain district .
according to the federal environmental agency , this street already surpassed the maximum pollutant levels on 20 days this year .
the plaintiffs ' attorney , fabian löwenberg , said the injunction should force the municipality to take immediate measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : downtown berlin just has too much traffic , claim environmental groups " the clean air and action plan does not provide for a reduction in fine dust levels in berlin 's city center until 2008 , " said löwenberg .
" but it foregoes everything that would be suitable to reduce them immediately . " " the clean air and action plan for berlin in its current form is completely unsuitable to protect people 's health in the coming years , " he added . a toll for german cities ? according to duh , the most effective measure to reduce fine dust particles in the short-term is a driving ban , for example for cars without diesel soot filters .
resch referred to other eu countries , such as italy , that had introduced rigid measures like car-free days in order to meet the eu stipulations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london launched its controversial city toll in 2003 another possibility would be to introduce city tolls , such as those implemented in london .
the german traffic association verkehrsclub deutschland -lrb- vcd -rrb- said city tolls are a possibility to make the air in german cities cleaner . " but the municipalities have to decide for themselves if this would catch on in their city , " said vcd transport spokesman gerd lottsiepen .
" it could be more effective if there were defined areas in which dirty vehicles , that is , those without a filter , could simply not travel . " however , german retailers strongly oppose such bans .
" you ca n't oust cars out of the city centers , " said hubertus pellengahr , spokesman of the german retailers ' association hde .

other german cities could have to tackle similar cases . major german cities are facing a wave of lawsuits for not giving their citizens air clean enough to breathe .
berlin could become the first city to be legally forced to introduce measures to improve air quality .
the german environmental organization deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- duh -rrb- began a planned string of legal action on monday by supporting lawsuits from three berlin citizens .
similar suits would follow in munich , stuttgart and other major cities , duh said . the charges are a result of the eu 's new clean air laws , which took effect on jan .
1 , 2005 .
these place limits on the air levels of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants , such as soot particles emitted by diesel vehicles .
german cities and municipalities have to control their air quality and take countermeasures if the toxic levels are too high . duh director jürgen resch criticized that the cities had long been aware of the planned changes and had simply disregarded the directive .
" the citizens concerned are taking legal action out of pure self-defense , " resch told journalists in berlin . banning diesel vehicles in large cities like berlin , sticking to the new limits is a challenge .
they stipulate that so-called particulate matter , the concentration of fine dust in the air , can not exceed 50 micrograms per cubic meter on more than 35 days of the year .
these pollutants have been found to cause respiratory and cardiovascular diseases . berlin has exceeded these levels by far in previous years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the more traffic that heads into cities , the higher the level of pollutants resch criticized that municipalities , state and federal governments had been inactive for years in battling these pollutants .
yet the eu directive has been known since 1999 .
he said duh supported lawsuits in order to push through measures to clean up the air , such as driving bans for diesel vehicles without particle filters . " we call on the cities to quickly take action to ban diesel vehicles without a filter from the cities and therefore contribute to a drastic reduction in the levels of fine dust in the air , " said resch . however , federal environment minister jürgen trittin said he thinks it would be more effective to tackle the problem at its source . " i think it would be better to ensure that we find a replacement for old cars and a re-fitting of diesel vehicles very quickly in order to really reduce the levels of fine dust , " said trittin . an unsuitable action plan for cleaner air the three plaintiffs in the berlin case live on the heavily-traveled frankfurter allee in the city 's friedrichshain district .
according to the federal environmental agency , this street already surpassed the maximum pollutant levels on 20 days this year .
the plaintiffs ' attorney , fabian löwenberg , said the injunction should force the municipality to take immediate measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : downtown berlin just has too much traffic , claim environmental groups " the clean air and action plan does not provide for a reduction in fine dust levels in berlin 's city center until 2008 , " said löwenberg .
" but it foregoes everything that would be suitable to reduce them immediately . " " the clean air and action plan for berlin in its current form is completely unsuitable to protect people 's health in the coming years , " he added . a toll for german cities ? according to duh , the most effective measure to reduce fine dust particles in the short-term is a driving ban , for example for cars without diesel soot filters .
resch referred to other eu countries , such as italy , that had introduced rigid measures like car-free days in order to meet the eu stipulations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london launched its controversial city toll in 2003 another possibility would be to introduce city tolls , such as those implemented in london .
the german traffic association verkehrsclub deutschland -lrb- vcd -rrb- said city tolls are a possibility to make the air in german cities cleaner . " but the municipalities have to decide for themselves if this would catch on in their city , " said vcd transport spokesman gerd lottsiepen .
" it could be more effective if there were defined areas in which dirty vehicles , that is , those without a filter , could simply not travel . " however , german retailers strongly oppose such bans .
" you ca n't oust cars out of the city centers , " said hubertus pellengahr , spokesman of the german retailers ' association hde .
" this will lead to the demise of retail stores and , subsequently , the city .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 22.03.2005 long-lost bach cantata revived großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bach composed the cantata in 1728 a piece by german composer johann sebastian bach lost for decades has come to life in japan this week , shedding new light on the 18th-century baroque master . the wedding cantata bwv216 resurfaced a year ago by chance in the papers of chieko hara , the japanese pianist who died in december 2001 at the age 86 after a career spent largely in europe . bach had composed the cantata in 1728 for the wedding of a customs official 's daughter in leipzig .
the original score has never been recovered , but the version discovered in japan was believed to have been copied by one of bach 's students under his stewardship . the eight rediscovered pages consist almost uniquely of vocal pieces in german for soprano and alto , with the seven movements lasting for a total of between 20 and 25 minutes .
the instrumental parts are entirely lost except for two recycled movements , a duet and an aria which had been used elsewhere in bach 's work .
the text is an allegorical dialogue between two rivers in saxony , the pleisse and the neisse , which represent the groom and the young bride . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thankfully still here " this is my dinosaur " american musicologist joshua rifkin , a conductor and composer who is one of the leading interpreters of bach was asked to recreate the missing instrumental parts .
he said he originally wanted to let the lost cantata rest . " maybe a fragment should stay a fragment , " rifkin told afp .
" then i thought of palaeontologists , from one bone they figure the entire dinosaur .
this is my dinosaur . " at first , rifkin thought the challenge would be too difficult .
in the end , he decided to take up the project which he described as a " musical rubik 's cube " . " i could not reconstruct what bach wrote but i could give the people of today an idea of what his music was like , " rifkin said .
" it sounds like bach 's music , " he said .
" but the listener should not know which part is bach 's , which part is mine . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connection , in politics and in the arts lost for decades the cantata , which despite being yellow with age remained in good state , was authenticated by a team of experts led by bach specialist , professor tadashi isoyama of the kunitachi college of music in suburban tokyo . the copy of the cantata passed from collector to collector and had vanished for 80 years .
the only thing known for sure is that it belonged to a descendant of the german composer felix mendelssohn until the 1920s . experts believe hara likely inherited the cantata - but was oblivious to its existence - from her husband , the late spanish cellist gaspar cassado , who knew the mendelssohn family . huge impact for isoyama , the music professor , the rediscovery of the cantata is " very important " to the understanding of bach , who lived from 1685 to 1750 : " this finding has a huge impact in the music world , " isoyama said . while there were attempts to recreate the cantata in the early 20th century , isoyama said the difference this time was the involvement of rifkin with his knowledge of bach . " he reconstructed the instrumental score .
this is history making because -lrb- his -rrb- high-level score is reconstructed , truly reflecting bach 's style , " isoyama said . passionate musical audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johann sebastian bach the wedding cantata had its debut sunday in the small hall of suntory hall in tokyo , one of the world 's most prestigious venues for classical music , with two of bach 's profane cantatas bwv202 and bwv210 . " japan is full of bach lovers ; " said rifkin , who has been directing the ensemble bach concertino osaka in western japan for five years .

among the countries discussed as possible new members , germany and japan were especially popular . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of those surveyed believe germany permanently belongs in the security council germany was favored in 21 nations , with an average of 56 percent across all countries . the poll of 23,518 people was conducted for the bbc world service by the international polling firm globescan together with the program on international policy attitudes at the university of maryland . " results suggest that the tight control of the united nations by a few countries may soon be history , " said globescan ’ s president doug miller .
" there is strong popular support for the democratization of the un system . " un can ’ t eat " à la carte " annan wants the major changes to be agreed at a summit of world leaders at the un headquarters in september , which will mark the body 's 60th anniversary . " in any such list of proposals , there are items which seem more important to some than to others , " he said .
" the temptation is to treat the list as an à la carte menu , and select only those that you especially fancy .
in this case , that approach will not work . " the german government felt annan had given the un ’ s reform " very powerful and new momentum " with his plans , said spokesman steg . he added that the body ’ s reform was a key issue for the german government .
" for us , the point is to strengthen the principle of multilateralism and there is only one forum worldwide that is suitable to do that : the united nations , " steg said . critics skeptical of german chances however , not everybody is as optimistic about germany 's chances of getting a permanent un seat . " it matters a lot in which way you ’ re trying to make yourself part of the equation .
i personally believe that our campaign for a permanent seat on the un security council has been a bit too brash and self-complacent at times , " said claudia nolte , foreign affairs spokeswoman for the christian democrats . " this may have turned potential supporters into opponents .
secondly , the german government should state more clearly why it thinks it deserves a permanent seat and in which way it ’ ll live up to greater responsibilities .
people here and abroad have a right to know this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sources close to the us administration believe that germany ’ s hopes for a permanent seat will be dashed by what they view as the country ’ s failure to do enough for iraq ’ s post-war reconstruction .
in addition , they say , germany might not be able to live up to its greater responsibility financially , given its economic woes at present . in fact , kofi annan himself made it clear that a country ’ s financial contributions to the world body would play no small role in deciding which new members to accept on the council .
consequently , government spokesman thomas steg said on tuesday that official development assistance had to be increased substantially in order to move closer to the aim of allocating 0.7 percent of gdp to development aid by 2015 , as laid down in the un millennium goals .
at present , germany only spends 0.29 percent of gdp for this purpose - too little to impress anyone in the world body . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany says un record a success germany 's two-year stint as a non-permanent member of the un security council ended at the end of last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.03.2005 the neue deutsche welle rises großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wir sind helden lead singer judith holofernes german pop and rock music is suddenly making a comeback - thanks to good bands and better media coverage .
the industry has n't been this excited since a girl named nena sang about 99 red balloons more than 20 years ago . were it not for the german-speaking djs and ads , there would be nothing to distinguish german radio of the past few years with stations in britain and america .
the playlists read like they were copied from the us billboard top 20 charts , the main artists , world stars like puff daddy and christina aguilera .
then a berlin rock band with a female vocalist and the modest name " wir sind helden " - we are heroes - exploded onto the scene last summer , riding to the top of the german charts and selling a stupendous 500,000 records .
suddenly , rock auf deutsch was all the rage - again .
" they opened the gate , " said hannes ross , pop music critic at stern , the magazine with the largest circulation in germany .
" all of a sudden the record companies were waiting in line , wondering , ' why do n't we have a band like that under contract ?
we also need a german band ' ! "
since then , german bands have stormed the charts .
a combination of weariness with the mainstream pop piped in from america and songs that promoters and radio programmers say are more intelligent and polished than in the past has led to a flood of media coverage - and improved sales .
german music steps up though illegal downloads and stingy german consumers still meant music sales in 2004 were down 3 percent from 2003 , the figure was a far cry from the 20 percent decrease in sales between 2002 and 2003 , according to the german office of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- .
german music " had a big part in that " turnaround , said hartmut spiesecke , spokesman for ifpi germany .
bands like silbermond -lrb- photo -rrb- , from the eastern german town of bautzen , and juli , from the city of giessen , near frankfurt , have sold hundreds of thousands of albums .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " silbermond " from the east german town of bautzen -lrb- left to right -rrb- : thomas stolle -lrb- 20 , guitar -rrb- , stefanie kloss -lrb- 19 , vocals -rrb- , andreas nowak -lrb- 21 , drums -rrb- and johannes stolle -lrb- 21 , bass -rrb- releases by german bands made up 30.3 percent of the albums on the charts in 2004 , the highest percentage ever , said spiesecke .
singles by german artists made up more than half of the singles on the charts , the second-highest in history .
" it is really amazing , " said aditya sharma , director of programming at the berlin radio station fritz .
" what the bands have done is make people believe that the german language and pop music are compatible . "
deutsch suddenly cool again fritz 's young listeners by and large rejected german music in the past , said sharma .
the reason : music in english sounded , well , cooler .
then came wir sind helden , whose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva briegel , lead singer of the band juli which , like other popular german bands at the moment , features a female lead vocalist and a bunch of guys playing back up debut album , " die reklamation , " or " the claim , " packed lyrics about being young in an economically-downtrodden germany with an upbeat mix of guitar and electronic sound .
ross said the band " hit a nerve " among students and other young people .
alternative radio stations in germany , like sharma 's , began playing wsh 's music in 2004 .
before long , the band had cobbled together 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,300 -rrb- to produce a video that got regular airtime on mtv .
" they came from the underground , and if the lyrics are good and people connect to it , why should n't they be successful ? " said matthias reimann , whose company was the first to heavily promote wir sind helden , sending a representative to radio stations across germany with a small bundle of cds .
juli and silbermond followed with double plantinum albums of their own .
for all the hype , germany 's pop phenomenon is n't expected to jump the atlantic , as british and french pop songs sometimes have , finding success in the us .
national , but not international , success # b # " the competition -lrb- in the international pop scene -rrb- is too tough , " said reimann .
" especially the pop music that comes out of america .
it 's much more polished , and the quality is higher . "
retaining supremacy in the national music market is more likely .
the test will come in the next few months , when bands like wir sind helden and silbermond release their second albums .
but things are looking good .
industry insiders said there has n't been this much hype surrounding german pop since a teenager named nena sang about 99 red balloons in 1984 .
" the last time things were this big was the neue deutsche welle , 20 years ago , " said sharma , referring to the string of german bands that made names for themselves internationally in the mid-1980s .
" and the bands nowadays - at least their lyrics - are much better .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 22.03.2005 long-lost bach cantata revived großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bach composed the cantata in 1728 a piece by german composer johann sebastian bach lost for decades has come to life in japan this week , shedding new light on the 18th-century baroque master . the wedding cantata bwv216 resurfaced a year ago by chance in the papers of chieko hara , the japanese pianist who died in december 2001 at the age 86 after a career spent largely in europe . bach had composed the cantata in 1728 for the wedding of a customs official 's daughter in leipzig .
the original score has never been recovered , but the version discovered in japan was believed to have been copied by one of bach 's students under his stewardship . the eight rediscovered pages consist almost uniquely of vocal pieces in german for soprano and alto , with the seven movements lasting for a total of between 20 and 25 minutes .
the instrumental parts are entirely lost except for two recycled movements , a duet and an aria which had been used elsewhere in bach 's work .
the text is an allegorical dialogue between two rivers in saxony , the pleisse and the neisse , which represent the groom and the young bride . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thankfully still here " this is my dinosaur " american musicologist joshua rifkin , a conductor and composer who is one of the leading interpreters of bach was asked to recreate the missing instrumental parts .
he said he originally wanted to let the lost cantata rest . " maybe a fragment should stay a fragment , " rifkin told afp .
" then i thought of palaeontologists , from one bone they figure the entire dinosaur .
this is my dinosaur . " at first , rifkin thought the challenge would be too difficult .
in the end , he decided to take up the project which he described as a " musical rubik 's cube " . " i could not reconstruct what bach wrote but i could give the people of today an idea of what his music was like , " rifkin said .
" it sounds like bach 's music , " he said .
" but the listener should not know which part is bach 's , which part is mine . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connection , in politics and in the arts lost for decades the cantata , which despite being yellow with age remained in good state , was authenticated by a team of experts led by bach specialist , professor tadashi isoyama of the kunitachi college of music in suburban tokyo . the copy of the cantata passed from collector to collector and had vanished for 80 years .
the only thing known for sure is that it belonged to a descendant of the german composer felix mendelssohn until the 1920s . experts believe hara likely inherited the cantata - but was oblivious to its existence - from her husband , the late spanish cellist gaspar cassado , who knew the mendelssohn family . huge impact for isoyama , the music professor , the rediscovery of the cantata is " very important " to the understanding of bach , who lived from 1685 to 1750 : " this finding has a huge impact in the music world , " isoyama said . while there were attempts to recreate the cantata in the early 20th century , isoyama said the difference this time was the involvement of rifkin with his knowledge of bach . " he reconstructed the instrumental score .
this is history making because -lrb- his -rrb- high-level score is reconstructed , truly reflecting bach 's style , " isoyama said . passionate musical audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johann sebastian bach the wedding cantata had its debut sunday in the small hall of suntory hall in tokyo , one of the world 's most prestigious venues for classical music , with two of bach 's profane cantatas bwv202 and bwv210 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.03.2005 the neue deutsche welle rises großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wir sind helden lead singer judith holofernes german pop and rock music is suddenly making a comeback - thanks to good bands and better media coverage .
the industry has n't been this excited since a girl named nena sang about 99 red balloons more than 20 years ago . were it not for the german-speaking djs and ads , there would be nothing to distinguish german radio of the past few years with stations in britain and america .
the playlists read like they were copied from the us billboard top 20 charts , the main artists , world stars like puff daddy and christina aguilera .
then a berlin rock band with a female vocalist and the modest name " wir sind helden " - we are heroes - exploded onto the scene last summer , riding to the top of the german charts and selling a stupendous 500,000 records .
suddenly , rock auf deutsch was all the rage - again .
" they opened the gate , " said hannes ross , pop music critic at stern , the magazine with the largest circulation in germany .
" all of a sudden the record companies were waiting in line , wondering , ' why do n't we have a band like that under contract ?
we also need a german band ' ! "
since then , german bands have stormed the charts .
a combination of weariness with the mainstream pop piped in from america and songs that promoters and radio programmers say are more intelligent and polished than in the past has led to a flood of media coverage - and improved sales .
german music steps up though illegal downloads and stingy german consumers still meant music sales in 2004 were down 3 percent from 2003 , the figure was a far cry from the 20 percent decrease in sales between 2002 and 2003 , according to the german office of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- .
german music " had a big part in that " turnaround , said hartmut spiesecke , spokesman for ifpi germany .
bands like silbermond -lrb- photo -rrb- , from the eastern german town of bautzen , and juli , from the city of giessen , near frankfurt , have sold hundreds of thousands of albums .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " silbermond " from the east german town of bautzen -lrb- left to right -rrb- : thomas stolle -lrb- 20 , guitar -rrb- , stefanie kloss -lrb- 19 , vocals -rrb- , andreas nowak -lrb- 21 , drums -rrb- and johannes stolle -lrb- 21 , bass -rrb- releases by german bands made up 30.3 percent of the albums on the charts in 2004 , the highest percentage ever , said spiesecke .
singles by german artists made up more than half of the singles on the charts , the second-highest in history .
" it is really amazing , " said aditya sharma , director of programming at the berlin radio station fritz .
" what the bands have done is make people believe that the german language and pop music are compatible . "
deutsch suddenly cool again fritz 's young listeners by and large rejected german music in the past , said sharma .
the reason : music in english sounded , well , cooler .
then came wir sind helden , whose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva briegel , lead singer of the band juli which , like other popular german bands at the moment , features a female lead vocalist and a bunch of guys playing back up debut album , " die reklamation , " or " the claim , " packed lyrics about being young in an economically-downtrodden germany with an upbeat mix of guitar and electronic sound .
ross said the band " hit a nerve " among students and other young people .
alternative radio stations in germany , like sharma 's , began playing wsh 's music in 2004 .
before long , the band had cobbled together 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,300 -rrb- to produce a video that got regular airtime on mtv .
" they came from the underground , and if the lyrics are good and people connect to it , why should n't they be successful ? " said matthias reimann , whose company was the first to heavily promote wir sind helden , sending a representative to radio stations across germany with a small bundle of cds .
juli and silbermond followed with double plantinum albums of their own .
for all the hype , germany 's pop phenomenon is n't expected to jump the atlantic , as british and french pop songs sometimes have , finding success in the us .
national , but not international , success # b # " the competition -lrb- in the international pop scene -rrb- is too tough , " said reimann .
" especially the pop music that comes out of america .
it 's much more polished , and the quality is higher . "
retaining supremacy in the national music market is more likely .
the test will come in the next few months , when bands like wir sind helden and silbermond release their second albums .
but things are looking good .
industry insiders said there has n't been this much hype surrounding german pop since a teenager named nena sang about 99 red balloons in 1984 .
" the last time things were this big was the neue deutsche welle , 20 years ago , " said sharma , referring to the string of german bands that made names for themselves internationally in the mid-1980s .
" and the bands nowadays - at least their lyrics - are much better .

the industry has n't been this excited since a girl named nena sang about 99 red balloons more than 20 years ago . were it not for the german-speaking djs and ads , there would be nothing to distinguish german radio of the past few years with stations in britain and america .
the playlists read like they were copied from the us billboard top 20 charts , the main artists , world stars like puff daddy and christina aguilera .
then a berlin rock band with a female vocalist and the modest name " wir sind helden " - we are heroes - exploded onto the scene last summer , riding to the top of the german charts and selling a stupendous 500,000 records .
suddenly , rock auf deutsch was all the rage - again .
" they opened the gate , " said hannes ross , pop music critic at stern , the magazine with the largest circulation in germany .
" all of a sudden the record companies were waiting in line , wondering , ' why do n't we have a band like that under contract ?
we also need a german band ' ! "
since then , german bands have stormed the charts .
a combination of weariness with the mainstream pop piped in from america and songs that promoters and radio programmers say are more intelligent and polished than in the past has led to a flood of media coverage - and improved sales .
german music steps up though illegal downloads and stingy german consumers still meant music sales in 2004 were down 3 percent from 2003 , the figure was a far cry from the 20 percent decrease in sales between 2002 and 2003 , according to the german office of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- .
german music " had a big part in that " turnaround , said hartmut spiesecke , spokesman for ifpi germany .
bands like silbermond -lrb- photo -rrb- , from the eastern german town of bautzen , and juli , from the city of giessen , near frankfurt , have sold hundreds of thousands of albums .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " silbermond " from the east german town of bautzen -lrb- left to right -rrb- : thomas stolle -lrb- 20 , guitar -rrb- , stefanie kloss -lrb- 19 , vocals -rrb- , andreas nowak -lrb- 21 , drums -rrb- and johannes stolle -lrb- 21 , bass -rrb- releases by german bands made up 30.3 percent of the albums on the charts in 2004 , the highest percentage ever , said spiesecke .
singles by german artists made up more than half of the singles on the charts , the second-highest in history .
" it is really amazing , " said aditya sharma , director of programming at the berlin radio station fritz .
" what the bands have done is make people believe that the german language and pop music are compatible . "
deutsch suddenly cool again fritz 's young listeners by and large rejected german music in the past , said sharma .
the reason : music in english sounded , well , cooler .
then came wir sind helden , whose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva briegel , lead singer of the band juli which , like other popular german bands at the moment , features a female lead vocalist and a bunch of guys playing back up debut album , " die reklamation , " or " the claim , " packed lyrics about being young in an economically-downtrodden germany with an upbeat mix of guitar and electronic sound .
ross said the band " hit a nerve " among students and other young people .
alternative radio stations in germany , like sharma 's , began playing wsh 's music in 2004 .
before long , the band had cobbled together 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,300 -rrb- to produce a video that got regular airtime on mtv .
" they came from the underground , and if the lyrics are good and people connect to it , why should n't they be successful ? " said matthias reimann , whose company was the first to heavily promote wir sind helden , sending a representative to radio stations across germany with a small bundle of cds .
juli and silbermond followed with double plantinum albums of their own .
for all the hype , germany 's pop phenomenon is n't expected to jump the atlantic , as british and french pop songs sometimes have , finding success in the us .
national , but not international , success # b # " the competition -lrb- in the international pop scene -rrb- is too tough , " said reimann .
" especially the pop music that comes out of america .
it 's much more polished , and the quality is higher . "
retaining supremacy in the national music market is more likely .
the test will come in the next few months , when bands like wir sind helden and silbermond release their second albums .
but things are looking good .
industry insiders said there has n't been this much hype surrounding german pop since a teenager named nena sang about 99 red balloons in 1984 .
" the last time things were this big was the neue deutsche welle , 20 years ago , " said sharma , referring to the string of german bands that made names for themselves internationally in the mid-1980s .
" and the bands nowadays - at least their lyrics - are much better .

germany feels it 's inched closer to reaching its goal of a permanent seat on the un security council . calling for action , not more words , to fulfil pledges already made , un secretary general kofi annan presented his plan for overhauling the un to the general assembly on monday . if acted on , the proposals - ranging from a nine-member increase in the security council 's membership to the establishment of a new human rights council - would mark the most wide-ranging reforms since the un was founded 60 years ago . " this hall has heard enough high-sounding declarations to last us for some decades to come , " annan told the assembly .
" we know what the problems are , and we all know what we have promised to achieve .
what is needed now is not more declarations , but action to fulfil the promises already made . " germany optimistic one of the most closely-watched ideas in annan ’ s recommendations is the expansion of the security council .
" i urge member states to make the security council more broadly representative of the international community as a whole , as well as of the geographic realities of today , " the secretary general said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi annan called for strong reforms to the un though there was no explicit mention of germany , one of the aspirants to a permanent un seat , the german government on monday indicated that it welcomed annan 's clear statement . germany has fervently lobbied for a permanent seat on the council and felt " strongly reconfirmed " in its ambitions , said the berlin government ’ s deputy spokesman thomas steg .
german foreign minister joschka fischer on tuesday also welcomed annan 's sweeping reform proposals for the united nations , saying they were crucial for peace and stability in the 21st century . " it showed a healthy dose of realism , " fischer said . although security council reform has been discussed at the un for decades , the issue is so complex and politically sensitive that agreement has been impossible .
seeking to break the deadlock , annan urged realistic action . " it would be preferable for member states to take this vital decision by consensus , " said annan .
" but if they are unable to reach consensus , this must not become an excuse for postponing action . " should it come to a crucial vote , the german government assumed it would gain the necessary majority for a permanent seat , steg said . former german defense minister volker rühe , from the opposition christian democrats , said the world would need the un more than ever before in the 21st century .
for this reason , the security council could no longer have a setup dating from the aftermath of world war ii . " the current member states do not adequately reflect the 21st century , " rühe told german news agency dpa . two models for the security council a un high-level panel has outlined two possible models for increasing the security council 's membership to make it more representative and inclusive . model a would add six new members to its five permanent members , britain , china , france , russia and the united states .
the new permanent seats would , however , have no veto power .
this model also recommends an additional three new two-year terms or non-permanent seats , divided among africa , asia and the pacific , europe and the americas . model b would add a third tier of semi-permanent members to the council , with no new permanent seats , but rather a new category of eight four-year , renewable-term seats and one new two-year , non-permanent -lrb- and non-renewable -rrb- seat , divided among the major regional areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india , japan , brazil and germany formed the g4 group to lobby for a permanent council seat germany - together with japan , brazil and india - launched a joint effort for permanent seats on the council last year .
in a joint statement issued monday , the four nations welcomed annan 's report and said they would work with all member states to reach agreement on council reform based on model a. they noted that recent general assembly debates had demonstrated that " a clear majority " of states favored adding permanent and non-permanent members from both developed and developing countries . cautious reactions from washington in a telephone conversation with annan , us president george w. bush told the un chief his speech on un reforms " had some constructive ideas " and that he looked forward to working with annan on it , said white house spokesman scott mccellan . but earlier , the united states cast doubt on a council resolution that would set rules for authorizing military force .
" frankly , we 're skeptical that any kind of resolution on the use of force would be helpful , " said deputy state department spokesman adam ereli . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's un ambassador gunter pleuger thinks his country will make it into the security council the german ambassador to the un , gunter pleuger , said he was nevertheless confident that the united states would agree to un improvements . " we saw in the past year that even the largest power in the world can ’ t win peace by itself , even if it won a war previously , " said pleuger .

but in doing so , the floodgates have been opened for reinterpreting the regulations meant to ensure budgetary discipline and a stable currency . let 's be honest .
rarely do sinners decide to punish themselves .
in that respect , establishing the european stability and growth pact - which germany successfully made a condition for abolishing the deutsche mark - was defective from the start , for there were and are many sinners .
countries like greece or italy would never have been allowed to join the euro club if the maastricht treaty 's convergence criteria had been applied verbatim .
france violated the treaty from 2002-2004 .
portugal did so in 2001 .
the netherlands breached it in 2003 .
greece swindled its way through every year .
and germany , the pact 's initiator , has n't kept its public debts below the ceiling of 3 percent of gdp since 2002 . if the heads of government sign the deal their finance ministers agreed to monday evening , the stability pact will remain formally valid - the 3 percent cap and the deficit limit of 60 percent of gdp annually will go untouched .
but , in reality , the pact will have degenerated into an arbitrary document .
the european commission - which is meant to police compliance to the deficit caps - will be instructed to take into account exceptional circumstances when they consider exacting disciplinary measures for deficit breaches .
thus , the german finance minister , for example , will be able to claim the costs of developing eastern germany as a special burden - and other states will follow and use their imaginations to devise new exceptional circumstances . loosening the stability pact is n't a license to make debts , says germany 's finance minister - but that 's how it will be understood in the euro zone .
the idea of the stability pact is dead .
the idea was that the maastricht treaty 's admission criteria would be made permanent to encourage budgetary discipline .
the idea was that future generations would n't be left with a mountain of debt .
the idea was to show the rest of the world that the euro zone had an elementary interest in ensuring a strong and stable euro . little remains of these ideas .
and you do n't need much imagination to predict where political discussions will take us in the coming years , namely , examining what can be considered euro-zone admission criteria .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.03.2005 berlin faces lawsuit demanding cleaner air the eu ’ s new clean air laws are not being upheld in major german cities .
citizens have now taken legal action against berlin to reduce pollutants in the air .
other german cities could have to tackle similar cases . major german cities are facing a wave of lawsuits for not giving their citizens air clean enough to breathe .
berlin could become the first city to be legally forced to introduce measures to improve air quality .
the german environmental organization deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- duh -rrb- began a planned string of legal action on monday by supporting lawsuits from three berlin citizens .
similar suits would follow in munich , stuttgart and other major cities , duh said . the charges are a result of the eu 's new clean air laws , which took effect on jan .
1 , 2005 .
these place limits on the air levels of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants , such as soot particles emitted by diesel vehicles .
german cities and municipalities have to control their air quality and take countermeasures if the toxic levels are too high . duh director jürgen resch criticized that the cities had long been aware of the planned changes and had simply disregarded the directive .
" the citizens concerned are taking legal action out of pure self-defense , " resch told journalists in berlin . banning diesel vehicles in large cities like berlin , sticking to the new limits is a challenge .
they stipulate that so-called particulate matter , the concentration of fine dust in the air , can not exceed 50 micrograms per cubic meter on more than 35 days of the year .
these pollutants have been found to cause respiratory and cardiovascular diseases . berlin has exceeded these levels by far in previous years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the more traffic that heads into cities , the higher the level of pollutants resch criticized that municipalities , state and federal governments had been inactive for years in battling these pollutants .
yet the eu directive has been known since 1999 .
he said duh supported lawsuits in order to push through measures to clean up the air , such as driving bans for diesel vehicles without particle filters . " we call on the cities to quickly take action to ban diesel vehicles without a filter from the cities and therefore contribute to a drastic reduction in the levels of fine dust in the air , " said resch . however , federal environment minister jürgen trittin said he thinks it would be more effective to tackle the problem at its source . " i think it would be better to ensure that we find a replacement for old cars and a re-fitting of diesel vehicles very quickly in order to really reduce the levels of fine dust , " said trittin . an unsuitable action plan for cleaner air the three plaintiffs in the berlin case live on the heavily-traveled frankfurter allee in the city 's friedrichshain district .
according to the federal environmental agency , this street already surpassed the maximum pollutant levels on 20 days this year .
the plaintiffs ' attorney , fabian löwenberg , said the injunction should force the municipality to take immediate measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : downtown berlin just has too much traffic , claim environmental groups " the clean air and action plan does not provide for a reduction in fine dust levels in berlin 's city center until 2008 , " said löwenberg .
" but it foregoes everything that would be suitable to reduce them immediately . " " the clean air and action plan for berlin in its current form is completely unsuitable to protect people 's health in the coming years , " he added . a toll for german cities ? according to duh , the most effective measure to reduce fine dust particles in the short-term is a driving ban , for example for cars without diesel soot filters .
resch referred to other eu countries , such as italy , that had introduced rigid measures like car-free days in order to meet the eu stipulations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london launched its controversial city toll in 2003 another possibility would be to introduce city tolls , such as those implemented in london .
the german traffic association verkehrsclub deutschland -lrb- vcd -rrb- said city tolls are a possibility to make the air in german cities cleaner . " but the municipalities have to decide for themselves if this would catch on in their city , " said vcd transport spokesman gerd lottsiepen .
" it could be more effective if there were defined areas in which dirty vehicles , that is , those without a filter , could simply not travel . " however , german retailers strongly oppose such bans .
" you ca n't oust cars out of the city centers , " said hubertus pellengahr , spokesman of the german retailers ' association hde .
" this will lead to the demise of retail stores and , subsequently , the city . " he said a lively retail industry was crucial for versatile and attractive city centers . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german drivers face dent in driving style on jan .

germany feels it 's inched closer to reaching its goal of a permanent seat on the un security council . calling for action , not more words , to fulfil pledges already made , un secretary general kofi annan presented his plan for overhauling the un to the general assembly on monday . if acted on , the proposals - ranging from a nine-member increase in the security council 's membership to the establishment of a new human rights council - would mark the most wide-ranging reforms since the un was founded 60 years ago . " this hall has heard enough high-sounding declarations to last us for some decades to come , " annan told the assembly .
" we know what the problems are , and we all know what we have promised to achieve .
what is needed now is not more declarations , but action to fulfil the promises already made . " germany optimistic one of the most closely-watched ideas in annan ’ s recommendations is the expansion of the security council .
" i urge member states to make the security council more broadly representative of the international community as a whole , as well as of the geographic realities of today , " the secretary general said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi annan called for strong reforms to the un though there was no explicit mention of germany , one of the aspirants to a permanent un seat , the german government on monday indicated that it welcomed annan 's clear statement . germany has fervently lobbied for a permanent seat on the council and felt " strongly reconfirmed " in its ambitions , said the berlin government ’ s deputy spokesman thomas steg .
german foreign minister joschka fischer on tuesday also welcomed annan 's sweeping reform proposals for the united nations , saying they were crucial for peace and stability in the 21st century . " it showed a healthy dose of realism , " fischer said . although security council reform has been discussed at the un for decades , the issue is so complex and politically sensitive that agreement has been impossible .
seeking to break the deadlock , annan urged realistic action . " it would be preferable for member states to take this vital decision by consensus , " said annan .
" but if they are unable to reach consensus , this must not become an excuse for postponing action . " should it come to a crucial vote , the german government assumed it would gain the necessary majority for a permanent seat , steg said . former german defense minister volker rühe , from the opposition christian democrats , said the world would need the un more than ever before in the 21st century .
for this reason , the security council could no longer have a setup dating from the aftermath of world war ii . " the current member states do not adequately reflect the 21st century , " rühe told german news agency dpa . two models for the security council a un high-level panel has outlined two possible models for increasing the security council 's membership to make it more representative and inclusive . model a would add six new members to its five permanent members , britain , china , france , russia and the united states .
the new permanent seats would , however , have no veto power .
this model also recommends an additional three new two-year terms or non-permanent seats , divided among africa , asia and the pacific , europe and the americas . model b would add a third tier of semi-permanent members to the council , with no new permanent seats , but rather a new category of eight four-year , renewable-term seats and one new two-year , non-permanent -lrb- and non-renewable -rrb- seat , divided among the major regional areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india , japan , brazil and germany formed the g4 group to lobby for a permanent council seat germany - together with japan , brazil and india - launched a joint effort for permanent seats on the council last year .
in a joint statement issued monday , the four nations welcomed annan 's report and said they would work with all member states to reach agreement on council reform based on model a. they noted that recent general assembly debates had demonstrated that " a clear majority " of states favored adding permanent and non-permanent members from both developed and developing countries . cautious reactions from washington in a telephone conversation with annan , us president george w. bush told the un chief his speech on un reforms " had some constructive ideas " and that he looked forward to working with annan on it , said white house spokesman scott mccellan . but earlier , the united states cast doubt on a council resolution that would set rules for authorizing military force .
" frankly , we 're skeptical that any kind of resolution on the use of force would be helpful , " said deputy state department spokesman adam ereli . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's un ambassador gunter pleuger thinks his country will make it into the security council the german ambassador to the un , gunter pleuger , said he was nevertheless confident that the united states would agree to un improvements . " we saw in the past year that even the largest power in the world can ’ t win peace by itself , even if it won a war previously , " said pleuger .

among the countries discussed as possible new members , germany and japan were especially popular . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of those surveyed believe germany permanently belongs in the security council germany was favored in 21 nations , with an average of 56 percent across all countries . the poll of 23,518 people was conducted for the bbc world service by the international polling firm globescan together with the program on international policy attitudes at the university of maryland . " results suggest that the tight control of the united nations by a few countries may soon be history , " said globescan ’ s president doug miller .
" there is strong popular support for the democratization of the un system . " un can ’ t eat " à la carte " annan wants the major changes to be agreed at a summit of world leaders at the un headquarters in september , which will mark the body 's 60th anniversary . " in any such list of proposals , there are items which seem more important to some than to others , " he said .
" the temptation is to treat the list as an à la carte menu , and select only those that you especially fancy .
in this case , that approach will not work . " the german government felt annan had given the un ’ s reform " very powerful and new momentum " with his plans , said spokesman steg . he added that the body ’ s reform was a key issue for the german government .
" for us , the point is to strengthen the principle of multilateralism and there is only one forum worldwide that is suitable to do that : the united nations , " steg said . critics skeptical of german chances however , not everybody is as optimistic about germany 's chances of getting a permanent un seat . " it matters a lot in which way you ’ re trying to make yourself part of the equation .
i personally believe that our campaign for a permanent seat on the un security council has been a bit too brash and self-complacent at times , " said claudia nolte , foreign affairs spokeswoman for the christian democrats . " this may have turned potential supporters into opponents .
secondly , the german government should state more clearly why it thinks it deserves a permanent seat and in which way it ’ ll live up to greater responsibilities .
people here and abroad have a right to know this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sources close to the us administration believe that germany ’ s hopes for a permanent seat will be dashed by what they view as the country ’ s failure to do enough for iraq ’ s post-war reconstruction .
in addition , they say , germany might not be able to live up to its greater responsibility financially , given its economic woes at present . in fact , kofi annan himself made it clear that a country ’ s financial contributions to the world body would play no small role in deciding which new members to accept on the council .
consequently , government spokesman thomas steg said on tuesday that official development assistance had to be increased substantially in order to move closer to the aim of allocating 0.7 percent of gdp to development aid by 2015 , as laid down in the un millennium goals .
at present , germany only spends 0.29 percent of gdp for this purpose - too little to impress anyone in the world body . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany says un record a success germany 's two-year stint as a non-permanent member of the un security council ended at the end of last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.03.2005 germany welcomes annan 's call for action back to first page back 2/2 popular support for un reforms but while the united states may be hesitant to accept the changes , a bbc world service poll saw overwhelming support in the population for the un to be reformed . the proposal to expand the security council to include new permanent members was supported by a majority in 22 of 23 countries surveyed .
among the countries discussed as possible new members , germany and japan were especially popular . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of those surveyed believe germany permanently belongs in the security council germany was favored in 21 nations , with an average of 56 percent across all countries . the poll of 23,518 people was conducted for the bbc world service by the international polling firm globescan together with the program on international policy attitudes at the university of maryland . " results suggest that the tight control of the united nations by a few countries may soon be history , " said globescan ’ s president doug miller .
" there is strong popular support for the democratization of the un system . " un can ’ t eat " à la carte " annan wants the major changes to be agreed at a summit of world leaders at the un headquarters in september , which will mark the body 's 60th anniversary . " in any such list of proposals , there are items which seem more important to some than to others , " he said .
" the temptation is to treat the list as an à la carte menu , and select only those that you especially fancy .
in this case , that approach will not work . " the german government felt annan had given the un ’ s reform " very powerful and new momentum " with his plans , said spokesman steg . he added that the body ’ s reform was a key issue for the german government .
" for us , the point is to strengthen the principle of multilateralism and there is only one forum worldwide that is suitable to do that : the united nations , " steg said . critics skeptical of german chances however , not everybody is as optimistic about germany 's chances of getting a permanent un seat . " it matters a lot in which way you ’ re trying to make yourself part of the equation .
i personally believe that our campaign for a permanent seat on the un security council has been a bit too brash and self-complacent at times , " said claudia nolte , foreign affairs spokeswoman for the christian democrats . " this may have turned potential supporters into opponents .
secondly , the german government should state more clearly why it thinks it deserves a permanent seat and in which way it ’ ll live up to greater responsibilities .
people here and abroad have a right to know this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sources close to the us administration believe that germany ’ s hopes for a permanent seat will be dashed by what they view as the country ’ s failure to do enough for iraq ’ s post-war reconstruction .
in addition , they say , germany might not be able to live up to its greater responsibility financially , given its economic woes at present . in fact , kofi annan himself made it clear that a country ’ s financial contributions to the world body would play no small role in deciding which new members to accept on the council .
consequently , government spokesman thomas steg said on tuesday that official development assistance had to be increased substantially in order to move closer to the aim of allocating 0.7 percent of gdp to development aid by 2015 , as laid down in the un millennium goals .
at present , germany only spends 0.29 percent of gdp for this purpose - too little to impress anyone in the world body . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany says un record a success germany 's two-year stint as a non-permanent member of the un security council ended at the end of last year .

citizens have now taken legal action against berlin to reduce pollutants in the air .
other german cities could have to tackle similar cases . major german cities are facing a wave of lawsuits for not giving their citizens air clean enough to breathe .
berlin could become the first city to be legally forced to introduce measures to improve air quality .
the german environmental organization deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- duh -rrb- began a planned string of legal action on monday by supporting lawsuits from three berlin citizens .
similar suits would follow in munich , stuttgart and other major cities , duh said . the charges are a result of the eu 's new clean air laws , which took effect on jan .
1 , 2005 .
these place limits on the air levels of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants , such as soot particles emitted by diesel vehicles .
german cities and municipalities have to control their air quality and take countermeasures if the toxic levels are too high . duh director jürgen resch criticized that the cities had long been aware of the planned changes and had simply disregarded the directive .
" the citizens concerned are taking legal action out of pure self-defense , " resch told journalists in berlin . banning diesel vehicles in large cities like berlin , sticking to the new limits is a challenge .
they stipulate that so-called particulate matter , the concentration of fine dust in the air , can not exceed 50 micrograms per cubic meter on more than 35 days of the year .
these pollutants have been found to cause respiratory and cardiovascular diseases . berlin has exceeded these levels by far in previous years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the more traffic that heads into cities , the higher the level of pollutants resch criticized that municipalities , state and federal governments had been inactive for years in battling these pollutants .
yet the eu directive has been known since 1999 .
he said duh supported lawsuits in order to push through measures to clean up the air , such as driving bans for diesel vehicles without particle filters . " we call on the cities to quickly take action to ban diesel vehicles without a filter from the cities and therefore contribute to a drastic reduction in the levels of fine dust in the air , " said resch . however , federal environment minister jürgen trittin said he thinks it would be more effective to tackle the problem at its source . " i think it would be better to ensure that we find a replacement for old cars and a re-fitting of diesel vehicles very quickly in order to really reduce the levels of fine dust , " said trittin . an unsuitable action plan for cleaner air the three plaintiffs in the berlin case live on the heavily-traveled frankfurter allee in the city 's friedrichshain district .
according to the federal environmental agency , this street already surpassed the maximum pollutant levels on 20 days this year .
the plaintiffs ' attorney , fabian löwenberg , said the injunction should force the municipality to take immediate measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : downtown berlin just has too much traffic , claim environmental groups " the clean air and action plan does not provide for a reduction in fine dust levels in berlin 's city center until 2008 , " said löwenberg .
" but it foregoes everything that would be suitable to reduce them immediately . " " the clean air and action plan for berlin in its current form is completely unsuitable to protect people 's health in the coming years , " he added . a toll for german cities ? according to duh , the most effective measure to reduce fine dust particles in the short-term is a driving ban , for example for cars without diesel soot filters .
resch referred to other eu countries , such as italy , that had introduced rigid measures like car-free days in order to meet the eu stipulations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london launched its controversial city toll in 2003 another possibility would be to introduce city tolls , such as those implemented in london .
the german traffic association verkehrsclub deutschland -lrb- vcd -rrb- said city tolls are a possibility to make the air in german cities cleaner . " but the municipalities have to decide for themselves if this would catch on in their city , " said vcd transport spokesman gerd lottsiepen .
" it could be more effective if there were defined areas in which dirty vehicles , that is , those without a filter , could simply not travel . " however , german retailers strongly oppose such bans .
" you ca n't oust cars out of the city centers , " said hubertus pellengahr , spokesman of the german retailers ' association hde .

citizens have now taken legal action against berlin to reduce pollutants in the air .
other german cities could have to tackle similar cases . major german cities are facing a wave of lawsuits for not giving their citizens air clean enough to breathe .
berlin could become the first city to be legally forced to introduce measures to improve air quality .
the german environmental organization deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- duh -rrb- began a planned string of legal action on monday by supporting lawsuits from three berlin citizens .

german cities and municipalities have to control their air quality and take countermeasures if the toxic levels are too high . duh director jürgen resch criticized that the cities had long been aware of the planned changes and had simply disregarded the directive .
" the citizens concerned are taking legal action out of pure self-defense , " resch told journalists in berlin . banning diesel vehicles in large cities like berlin , sticking to the new limits is a challenge .
they stipulate that so-called particulate matter , the concentration of fine dust in the air , can not exceed 50 micrograms per cubic meter on more than 35 days of the year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.03.2005 economy in spotlight at eu summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic growth will be the watchword over the next two days jobs and growth will top the agenda at the two-day summit of eu leaders kicking off tuesday .
another issue up for debate is america 's controversial nomination of paul wolfowitz as head of the world bank . the spring economic summit beginning tuesday in brussels will likely start off with a quick approval of a reform of the eu 's stability and growth pact , which eu finance ministers agreed upon on sunday . according to luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude junker , who will chair the meeting , there will be little discussion and " certainly not any tough debate " on the loosening of the eu deficit rules , which was passed largely thanks to germany 's fierce lobbying efforts . the rules governing the euro , namely that countries should keep their deficits under three percent of gross domestic product , have not been scrapped .
however , the reform will allow the rules to be interpreted more loosely and give governments space to spend more in order to get their economies moving . starting the motor summit participants aim to focus on europe 's sclerotic economy and look at ways of revving up a motor that has been sputtering for some time now .
leaders say they hope to agree on more business-friendly measures and increased research spending to boost long-term growth . in 2000 , eu heads drew up the " lisbon agenda , " a strategy paper that has the ambitious goal of europe becoming the world 's most dynamic economy by 2010 .
the brussels meeting will take another look at that plan at its half-way mark .
the judgment wo n't likely be too positive .
already last month , the eu admitted that its underperforming economy had made the lisbon agreement 's 2010 deadline impossible to achieve . contention one divisive issue that could cloud the summit is the proposed eu services directive , introduced by former internal market commissioner frits bolkestein .
the directive , which would greatly liberalize the eu 's services market , has run into a wall of protest , both from leaders and the public . on monday , french president jacques chirac repeated his vocal critique of the directive and germany 's chancellor gerhard schröder has expressed fears that were the directive to go into effect , it would lead to wage dumping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man shows his shirt slogan as he marches , together with an estimated 50,000 protesters , during a demonstration in downtown brussels on march 19 on saturday , 50,000 people demonstrated against the plan in brussels , arguing the directive will destroy many well-paid jobs in the western part of the eu and end the traditional ways in many professions . world politics could also invade the economic roundtable as the issue of lifting the eu ban on selling arms to china is called into question again .
britain once against cast doubt on the wisdom of such a move , although abolishing the ban is supported by fellow eu heavyweights germany and france . china 's recent assertion that it would use force if taiwan - which the mainland considers a breakaway province - formally declared its independence has made it more difficult for the eu to lift the arms embargo , uk foreign secretary jack straw said . controversial nomination the nomination by us president george w. bush to head the world bank will also be discussed by european leaders .
when the us leader announced the nomination of paul wolfowitz , deputy defense secretary and major architect of the us-led war in iraq , it was met with private consternation by many in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz , president bush 's choice for world bank president however , chancellor schröder has said germany will not oppose wolfowitz 's -lrb- photo -rrb- nomination , saying he thought wolfowitz could yield positive surprises in his role as the head of the global lending institution and that berlin could work constructively with him .
the netherlands said it would have liked a wider field of candidates . it is , however , unlikely that the europeans will try to block wolfowitz , especially at a time when they are trying to heal the deep rifts with the us that formed over the iraq war .

among the countries discussed as possible new members , germany and japan were especially popular . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of those surveyed believe germany permanently belongs in the security council germany was favored in 21 nations , with an average of 56 percent across all countries . the poll of 23,518 people was conducted for the bbc world service by the international polling firm globescan together with the program on international policy attitudes at the university of maryland . " results suggest that the tight control of the united nations by a few countries may soon be history , " said globescan ’ s president doug miller .
" there is strong popular support for the democratization of the un system . " un can ’ t eat " à la carte " annan wants the major changes to be agreed at a summit of world leaders at the un headquarters in september , which will mark the body 's 60th anniversary . " in any such list of proposals , there are items which seem more important to some than to others , " he said .
" the temptation is to treat the list as an à la carte menu , and select only those that you especially fancy .
in this case , that approach will not work . " the german government felt annan had given the un ’ s reform " very powerful and new momentum " with his plans , said spokesman steg . he added that the body ’ s reform was a key issue for the german government .
" for us , the point is to strengthen the principle of multilateralism and there is only one forum worldwide that is suitable to do that : the united nations , " steg said . critics skeptical of german chances however , not everybody is as optimistic about germany 's chances of getting a permanent un seat . " it matters a lot in which way you ’ re trying to make yourself part of the equation .
i personally believe that our campaign for a permanent seat on the un security council has been a bit too brash and self-complacent at times , " said claudia nolte , foreign affairs spokeswoman for the christian democrats . " this may have turned potential supporters into opponents .
secondly , the german government should state more clearly why it thinks it deserves a permanent seat and in which way it ’ ll live up to greater responsibilities .
people here and abroad have a right to know this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sources close to the us administration believe that germany ’ s hopes for a permanent seat will be dashed by what they view as the country ’ s failure to do enough for iraq ’ s post-war reconstruction .
in addition , they say , germany might not be able to live up to its greater responsibility financially , given its economic woes at present . in fact , kofi annan himself made it clear that a country ’ s financial contributions to the world body would play no small role in deciding which new members to accept on the council .
consequently , government spokesman thomas steg said on tuesday that official development assistance had to be increased substantially in order to move closer to the aim of allocating 0.7 percent of gdp to development aid by 2015 , as laid down in the un millennium goals .
at present , germany only spends 0.29 percent of gdp for this purpose - too little to impress anyone in the world body . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany says un record a success germany 's two-year stint as a non-permanent member of the un security council ended at the end of last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.03.2005 germany welcomes annan 's call for action back to first page back 2/2 popular support for un reforms but while the united states may be hesitant to accept the changes , a bbc world service poll saw overwhelming support in the population for the un to be reformed . the proposal to expand the security council to include new permanent members was supported by a majority in 22 of 23 countries surveyed .
among the countries discussed as possible new members , germany and japan were especially popular . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of those surveyed believe germany permanently belongs in the security council germany was favored in 21 nations , with an average of 56 percent across all countries . the poll of 23,518 people was conducted for the bbc world service by the international polling firm globescan together with the program on international policy attitudes at the university of maryland . " results suggest that the tight control of the united nations by a few countries may soon be history , " said globescan ’ s president doug miller .
" there is strong popular support for the democratization of the un system . " un can ’ t eat " à la carte " annan wants the major changes to be agreed at a summit of world leaders at the un headquarters in september , which will mark the body 's 60th anniversary . " in any such list of proposals , there are items which seem more important to some than to others , " he said .
" the temptation is to treat the list as an à la carte menu , and select only those that you especially fancy .
in this case , that approach will not work . " the german government felt annan had given the un ’ s reform " very powerful and new momentum " with his plans , said spokesman steg . he added that the body ’ s reform was a key issue for the german government .
" for us , the point is to strengthen the principle of multilateralism and there is only one forum worldwide that is suitable to do that : the united nations , " steg said . critics skeptical of german chances however , not everybody is as optimistic about germany 's chances of getting a permanent un seat . " it matters a lot in which way you ’ re trying to make yourself part of the equation .
i personally believe that our campaign for a permanent seat on the un security council has been a bit too brash and self-complacent at times , " said claudia nolte , foreign affairs spokeswoman for the christian democrats . " this may have turned potential supporters into opponents .
secondly , the german government should state more clearly why it thinks it deserves a permanent seat and in which way it ’ ll live up to greater responsibilities .
people here and abroad have a right to know this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sources close to the us administration believe that germany ’ s hopes for a permanent seat will be dashed by what they view as the country ’ s failure to do enough for iraq ’ s post-war reconstruction .
in addition , they say , germany might not be able to live up to its greater responsibility financially , given its economic woes at present . in fact , kofi annan himself made it clear that a country ’ s financial contributions to the world body would play no small role in deciding which new members to accept on the council .
consequently , government spokesman thomas steg said on tuesday that official development assistance had to be increased substantially in order to move closer to the aim of allocating 0.7 percent of gdp to development aid by 2015 , as laid down in the un millennium goals .
at present , germany only spends 0.29 percent of gdp for this purpose - too little to impress anyone in the world body . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany says un record a success germany 's two-year stint as a non-permanent member of the un security council ended at the end of last year .
despite the turbulence over iraq , german officials said the term was constructive .

another issue up for debate is america 's controversial nomination of paul wolfowitz as head of the world bank . the spring economic summit beginning tuesday in brussels will likely start off with a quick approval of a reform of the eu 's stability and growth pact , which eu finance ministers agreed upon on sunday . according to luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude junker , who will chair the meeting , there will be little discussion and " certainly not any tough debate " on the loosening of the eu deficit rules , which was passed largely thanks to germany 's fierce lobbying efforts . the rules governing the euro , namely that countries should keep their deficits under three percent of gross domestic product , have not been scrapped .
however , the reform will allow the rules to be interpreted more loosely and give governments space to spend more in order to get their economies moving . starting the motor summit participants aim to focus on europe 's sclerotic economy and look at ways of revving up a motor that has been sputtering for some time now .
leaders say they hope to agree on more business-friendly measures and increased research spending to boost long-term growth . in 2000 , eu heads drew up the " lisbon agenda , " a strategy paper that has the ambitious goal of europe becoming the world 's most dynamic economy by 2010 .
the brussels meeting will take another look at that plan at its half-way mark .
the judgment wo n't likely be too positive .
already last month , the eu admitted that its underperforming economy had made the lisbon agreement 's 2010 deadline impossible to achieve . contention one divisive issue that could cloud the summit is the proposed eu services directive , introduced by former internal market commissioner frits bolkestein .
the directive , which would greatly liberalize the eu 's services market , has run into a wall of protest , both from leaders and the public . on monday , french president jacques chirac repeated his vocal critique of the directive and germany 's chancellor gerhard schröder has expressed fears that were the directive to go into effect , it would lead to wage dumping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man shows his shirt slogan as he marches , together with an estimated 50,000 protesters , during a demonstration in downtown brussels on march 19 on saturday , 50,000 people demonstrated against the plan in brussels , arguing the directive will destroy many well-paid jobs in the western part of the eu and end the traditional ways in many professions . world politics could also invade the economic roundtable as the issue of lifting the eu ban on selling arms to china is called into question again .
britain once against cast doubt on the wisdom of such a move , although abolishing the ban is supported by fellow eu heavyweights germany and france . china 's recent assertion that it would use force if taiwan - which the mainland considers a breakaway province - formally declared its independence has made it more difficult for the eu to lift the arms embargo , uk foreign secretary jack straw said . controversial nomination the nomination by us president george w. bush to head the world bank will also be discussed by european leaders .
when the us leader announced the nomination of paul wolfowitz , deputy defense secretary and major architect of the us-led war in iraq , it was met with private consternation by many in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz , president bush 's choice for world bank president however , chancellor schröder has said germany will not oppose wolfowitz 's -lrb- photo -rrb- nomination , saying he thought wolfowitz could yield positive surprises in his role as the head of the global lending institution and that berlin could work constructively with him .
the netherlands said it would have liked a wider field of candidates . it is , however , unlikely that the europeans will try to block wolfowitz , especially at a time when they are trying to heal the deep rifts with the us that formed over the iraq war .

" parties that make no secret of their racist , xenophobic or neo-nazi leanings should be banned , " he said . the report on racism , xenophobia and discrimination placed a special focus on extreme right parties in eastern germany , saying that it was " particularly worrying " that rightwing extremist parties such as the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- increased public support in recent state elections through racist slogans . also highlighting racist violence in russia and elsewhere , the report called on the 25 " to take account of its ethnic , cultural and religious pluralism . " german foreign minister joschka fischer , visiting the commission tuesday did not directly address the issue but said that " human rights violations in particular countries must be called so by name . " harry 's nazi gaffe sparks uproar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a copy of tabloid ' the sun ' , whose front page shows a picture of britain 's prince harry wearing a nazi soldier 's uniform to a fancy dress party .
the push to highlight racism follows increased attempts by eu member states to push for an eu-wide ban on neo-nazi symbols after prince harry of england caused an uproar when appearing at a costume party in a nazi uniform . the initiative was squashed by britain and italy because of concerns that such a ban would limit the basic right of freedom of expression .
but eu ministers did agree last month to reanimate a sleeping debate on regulating racism and xenophobia .
in this case , great britain and italy dropped up their blockade-like reaction .
among other things , the agreement would make it punishable by law to deny the holocaust or other crimes against humanity . meanwhile , the german upper house of parliament passed legislation last week in another attempt to crack down on far right parties : the initiative seeks to curb neo-nazi marches amid concerns the extreme-right will target celebrations to mark the end of the war in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : among some 6,000 sympathizers of the national party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- attended a neo-nazi meeting in the eastern german city of leipzig in 1998 .
the far right , led by the npd , is planning to march past the new holocaust memorial in berlin and to the brandenburg gate on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of germany 's capitulation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.03.2005 germany welcomes annan 's call for action back to first page back 2/2 popular support for un reforms but while the united states may be hesitant to accept the changes , a bbc world service poll saw overwhelming support in the population for the un to be reformed . the proposal to expand the security council to include new permanent members was supported by a majority in 22 of 23 countries surveyed .
among the countries discussed as possible new members , germany and japan were especially popular . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of those surveyed believe germany permanently belongs in the security council germany was favored in 21 nations , with an average of 56 percent across all countries . the poll of 23,518 people was conducted for the bbc world service by the international polling firm globescan together with the program on international policy attitudes at the university of maryland . " results suggest that the tight control of the united nations by a few countries may soon be history , " said globescan ’ s president doug miller .
" there is strong popular support for the democratization of the un system . " un can ’ t eat " à la carte " annan wants the major changes to be agreed at a summit of world leaders at the un headquarters in september , which will mark the body 's 60th anniversary . " in any such list of proposals , there are items which seem more important to some than to others , " he said .
" the temptation is to treat the list as an à la carte menu , and select only those that you especially fancy .
in this case , that approach will not work . " the german government felt annan had given the un ’ s reform " very powerful and new momentum " with his plans , said spokesman steg . he added that the body ’ s reform was a key issue for the german government .
" for us , the point is to strengthen the principle of multilateralism and there is only one forum worldwide that is suitable to do that : the united nations , " steg said . critics skeptical of german chances however , not everybody is as optimistic about germany 's chances of getting a permanent un seat . " it matters a lot in which way you ’ re trying to make yourself part of the equation .
i personally believe that our campaign for a permanent seat on the un security council has been a bit too brash and self-complacent at times , " said claudia nolte , foreign affairs spokeswoman for the christian democrats . " this may have turned potential supporters into opponents .
secondly , the german government should state more clearly why it thinks it deserves a permanent seat and in which way it ’ ll live up to greater responsibilities .
people here and abroad have a right to know this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sources close to the us administration believe that germany ’ s hopes for a permanent seat will be dashed by what they view as the country ’ s failure to do enough for iraq ’ s post-war reconstruction .
in addition , they say , germany might not be able to live up to its greater responsibility financially , given its economic woes at present . in fact , kofi annan himself made it clear that a country ’ s financial contributions to the world body would play no small role in deciding which new members to accept on the council .
consequently , government spokesman thomas steg said on tuesday that official development assistance had to be increased substantially in order to move closer to the aim of allocating 0.7 percent of gdp to development aid by 2015 , as laid down in the un millennium goals .
at present , germany only spends 0.29 percent of gdp for this purpose - too little to impress anyone in the world body . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany says un record a success germany 's two-year stint as a non-permanent member of the un security council ended at the end of last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.03.2005 germany welcomes annan 's call for action back to first page back 2/2 popular support for un reforms but while the united states may be hesitant to accept the changes , a bbc world service poll saw overwhelming support in the population for the un to be reformed . the proposal to expand the security council to include new permanent members was supported by a majority in 22 of 23 countries surveyed .
among the countries discussed as possible new members , germany and japan were especially popular . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of those surveyed believe germany permanently belongs in the security council germany was favored in 21 nations , with an average of 56 percent across all countries . the poll of 23,518 people was conducted for the bbc world service by the international polling firm globescan together with the program on international policy attitudes at the university of maryland . " results suggest that the tight control of the united nations by a few countries may soon be history , " said globescan ’ s president doug miller .
" there is strong popular support for the democratization of the un system . " un can ’ t eat " à la carte " annan wants the major changes to be agreed at a summit of world leaders at the un headquarters in september , which will mark the body 's 60th anniversary . " in any such list of proposals , there are items which seem more important to some than to others , " he said .
" the temptation is to treat the list as an à la carte menu , and select only those that you especially fancy .
in this case , that approach will not work . " the german government felt annan had given the un ’ s reform " very powerful and new momentum " with his plans , said spokesman steg . he added that the body ’ s reform was a key issue for the german government .
" for us , the point is to strengthen the principle of multilateralism and there is only one forum worldwide that is suitable to do that : the united nations , " steg said . critics skeptical of german chances however , not everybody is as optimistic about germany 's chances of getting a permanent un seat . " it matters a lot in which way you ’ re trying to make yourself part of the equation .
i personally believe that our campaign for a permanent seat on the un security council has been a bit too brash and self-complacent at times , " said claudia nolte , foreign affairs spokeswoman for the christian democrats . " this may have turned potential supporters into opponents .
secondly , the german government should state more clearly why it thinks it deserves a permanent seat and in which way it ’ ll live up to greater responsibilities .
people here and abroad have a right to know this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sources close to the us administration believe that germany ’ s hopes for a permanent seat will be dashed by what they view as the country ’ s failure to do enough for iraq ’ s post-war reconstruction .
in addition , they say , germany might not be able to live up to its greater responsibility financially , given its economic woes at present . in fact , kofi annan himself made it clear that a country ’ s financial contributions to the world body would play no small role in deciding which new members to accept on the council .
consequently , government spokesman thomas steg said on tuesday that official development assistance had to be increased substantially in order to move closer to the aim of allocating 0.7 percent of gdp to development aid by 2015 , as laid down in the un millennium goals .
at present , germany only spends 0.29 percent of gdp for this purpose - too little to impress anyone in the world body . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany says un record a success germany 's two-year stint as a non-permanent member of the un security council ended at the end of last year .

" parties that make no secret of their racist , xenophobic or neo-nazi leanings should be banned , " he said . the report on racism , xenophobia and discrimination placed a special focus on extreme right parties in eastern germany , saying that it was " particularly worrying " that rightwing extremist parties such as the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- increased public support in recent state elections through racist slogans . also highlighting racist violence in russia and elsewhere , the report called on the 25 " to take account of its ethnic , cultural and religious pluralism . " german foreign minister joschka fischer , visiting the commission tuesday did not directly address the issue but said that " human rights violations in particular countries must be called so by name . " harry 's nazi gaffe sparks uproar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a copy of tabloid ' the sun ' , whose front page shows a picture of britain 's prince harry wearing a nazi soldier 's uniform to a fancy dress party .
the push to highlight racism follows increased attempts by eu member states to push for an eu-wide ban on neo-nazi symbols after prince harry of england caused an uproar when appearing at a costume party in a nazi uniform . the initiative was squashed by britain and italy because of concerns that such a ban would limit the basic right of freedom of expression .
but eu ministers did agree last month to reanimate a sleeping debate on regulating racism and xenophobia .
in this case , great britain and italy dropped up their blockade-like reaction .
among other things , the agreement would make it punishable by law to deny the holocaust or other crimes against humanity . meanwhile , the german upper house of parliament passed legislation last week in another attempt to crack down on far right parties : the initiative seeks to curb neo-nazi marches amid concerns the extreme-right will target celebrations to mark the end of the war in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : among some 6,000 sympathizers of the national party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- attended a neo-nazi meeting in the eastern german city of leipzig in 1998 .
the far right , led by the npd , is planning to march past the new holocaust memorial in berlin and to the brandenburg gate on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of germany 's capitulation .
last month , 4,000 right-wing extremists rallied in dresden on the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing that devastated the city . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany moves to curb neo-nazi protests germany 's lower house of parliament friday voted by a large majority to tighten the right of assembly , thus making it easier in future to ban neo-nazi demonstrations at historic landmarks .

the original score has never been recovered , but the version discovered in japan was believed to have been copied by one of bach 's students under his stewardship . the eight rediscovered pages consist almost uniquely of vocal pieces in german for soprano and alto , with the seven movements lasting for a total of between 20 and 25 minutes .
the instrumental parts are entirely lost except for two recycled movements , a duet and an aria which had been used elsewhere in bach 's work .

" then i thought of palaeontologists , from one bone they figure the entire dinosaur .

the only thing known for sure is that it belonged to a descendant of the german composer felix mendelssohn until the 1920s . experts believe hara likely inherited the cantata - but was oblivious to its existence - from her husband , the late spanish cellist gaspar cassado , who knew the mendelssohn family . huge impact for isoyama , the music professor , the rediscovery of the cantata is " very important " to the understanding of bach , who lived from 1685 to 1750 : " this finding has a huge impact in the music world , " isoyama said . while there were attempts to recreate the cantata in the early 20th century , isoyama said the difference this time was the involvement of rifkin with his knowledge of bach .

the original score has never been recovered , but the version discovered in japan was believed to have been copied by one of bach 's students under his stewardship . the eight rediscovered pages consist almost uniquely of vocal pieces in german for soprano and alto , with the seven movements lasting for a total of between 20 and 25 minutes .
the instrumental parts are entirely lost except for two recycled movements , a duet and an aria which had been used elsewhere in bach 's work .
the text is an allegorical dialogue between two rivers in saxony , the pleisse and the neisse , which represent the groom and the young bride . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thankfully still here " this is my dinosaur " american musicologist joshua rifkin , a conductor and composer who is one of the leading interpreters of bach was asked to recreate the missing instrumental parts .
he said he originally wanted to let the lost cantata rest . " maybe a fragment should stay a fragment , " rifkin told afp .
" then i thought of palaeontologists , from one bone they figure the entire dinosaur .
this is my dinosaur . " at first , rifkin thought the challenge would be too difficult .
in the end , he decided to take up the project which he described as a " musical rubik 's cube " . " i could not reconstruct what bach wrote but i could give the people of today an idea of what his music was like , " rifkin said .
" it sounds like bach 's music , " he said .
" but the listener should not know which part is bach 's , which part is mine . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connection , in politics and in the arts lost for decades the cantata , which despite being yellow with age remained in good state , was authenticated by a team of experts led by bach specialist , professor tadashi isoyama of the kunitachi college of music in suburban tokyo . the copy of the cantata passed from collector to collector and had vanished for 80 years .
the only thing known for sure is that it belonged to a descendant of the german composer felix mendelssohn until the 1920s . experts believe hara likely inherited the cantata - but was oblivious to its existence - from her husband , the late spanish cellist gaspar cassado , who knew the mendelssohn family . huge impact for isoyama , the music professor , the rediscovery of the cantata is " very important " to the understanding of bach , who lived from 1685 to 1750 : " this finding has a huge impact in the music world , " isoyama said . while there were attempts to recreate the cantata in the early 20th century , isoyama said the difference this time was the involvement of rifkin with his knowledge of bach . " he reconstructed the instrumental score .
this is history making because -lrb- his -rrb- high-level score is reconstructed , truly reflecting bach 's style , " isoyama said . passionate musical audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johann sebastian bach the wedding cantata had its debut sunday in the small hall of suntory hall in tokyo , one of the world 's most prestigious venues for classical music , with two of bach 's profane cantatas bwv202 and bwv210 .

another issue up for debate is america 's controversial nomination of paul wolfowitz as head of the world bank . the spring economic summit beginning tuesday in brussels will likely start off with a quick approval of a reform of the eu 's stability and growth pact , which eu finance ministers agreed upon on sunday . according to luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude junker , who will chair the meeting , there will be little discussion and " certainly not any tough debate " on the loosening of the eu deficit rules , which was passed largely thanks to germany 's fierce lobbying efforts . the rules governing the euro , namely that countries should keep their deficits under three percent of gross domestic product , have not been scrapped .
however , the reform will allow the rules to be interpreted more loosely and give governments space to spend more in order to get their economies moving . starting the motor summit participants aim to focus on europe 's sclerotic economy and look at ways of revving up a motor that has been sputtering for some time now .
leaders say they hope to agree on more business-friendly measures and increased research spending to boost long-term growth . in 2000 , eu heads drew up the " lisbon agenda , " a strategy paper that has the ambitious goal of europe becoming the world 's most dynamic economy by 2010 .
the brussels meeting will take another look at that plan at its half-way mark .
the judgment wo n't likely be too positive .
already last month , the eu admitted that its underperforming economy had made the lisbon agreement 's 2010 deadline impossible to achieve . contention one divisive issue that could cloud the summit is the proposed eu services directive , introduced by former internal market commissioner frits bolkestein .
the directive , which would greatly liberalize the eu 's services market , has run into a wall of protest , both from leaders and the public . on monday , french president jacques chirac repeated his vocal critique of the directive and germany 's chancellor gerhard schröder has expressed fears that were the directive to go into effect , it would lead to wage dumping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man shows his shirt slogan as he marches , together with an estimated 50,000 protesters , during a demonstration in downtown brussels on march 19 on saturday , 50,000 people demonstrated against the plan in brussels , arguing the directive will destroy many well-paid jobs in the western part of the eu and end the traditional ways in many professions . world politics could also invade the economic roundtable as the issue of lifting the eu ban on selling arms to china is called into question again .
britain once against cast doubt on the wisdom of such a move , although abolishing the ban is supported by fellow eu heavyweights germany and france . china 's recent assertion that it would use force if taiwan - which the mainland considers a breakaway province - formally declared its independence has made it more difficult for the eu to lift the arms embargo , uk foreign secretary jack straw said . controversial nomination the nomination by us president george w. bush to head the world bank will also be discussed by european leaders .
when the us leader announced the nomination of paul wolfowitz , deputy defense secretary and major architect of the us-led war in iraq , it was met with private consternation by many in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz , president bush 's choice for world bank president however , chancellor schröder has said germany will not oppose wolfowitz 's -lrb- photo -rrb- nomination , saying he thought wolfowitz could yield positive surprises in his role as the head of the global lending institution and that berlin could work constructively with him .
the netherlands said it would have liked a wider field of candidates . it is , however , unlikely that the europeans will try to block wolfowitz , especially at a time when they are trying to heal the deep rifts with the us that formed over the iraq war .

another issue up for debate is america 's controversial nomination of paul wolfowitz as head of the world bank . the spring economic summit beginning tuesday in brussels will likely start off with a quick approval of a reform of the eu 's stability and growth pact , which eu finance ministers agreed upon on sunday . according to luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude junker , who will chair the meeting , there will be little discussion and " certainly not any tough debate " on the loosening of the eu deficit rules , which was passed largely thanks to germany 's fierce lobbying efforts . the rules governing the euro , namely that countries should keep their deficits under three percent of gross domestic product , have not been scrapped .
however , the reform will allow the rules to be interpreted more loosely and give governments space to spend more in order to get their economies moving . starting the motor summit participants aim to focus on europe 's sclerotic economy and look at ways of revving up a motor that has been sputtering for some time now .
leaders say they hope to agree on more business-friendly measures and increased research spending to boost long-term growth . in 2000 , eu heads drew up the " lisbon agenda , " a strategy paper that has the ambitious goal of europe becoming the world 's most dynamic economy by 2010 .
the brussels meeting will take another look at that plan at its half-way mark .
the judgment wo n't likely be too positive .
already last month , the eu admitted that its underperforming economy had made the lisbon agreement 's 2010 deadline impossible to achieve . contention one divisive issue that could cloud the summit is the proposed eu services directive , introduced by former internal market commissioner frits bolkestein .

britain once against cast doubt on the wisdom of such a move , although abolishing the ban is supported by fellow eu heavyweights germany and france . china 's recent assertion that it would use force if taiwan - which the mainland considers a breakaway province - formally declared its independence has made it more difficult for the eu to lift the arms embargo , uk foreign secretary jack straw said . controversial nomination the nomination by us president george w. bush to head the world bank will also be discussed by european leaders .
when the us leader announced the nomination of paul wolfowitz , deputy defense secretary and major architect of the us-led war in iraq , it was met with private consternation by many in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz , president bush 's choice for world bank president however , chancellor schröder has said germany will not oppose wolfowitz 's -lrb- photo -rrb- nomination , saying he thought wolfowitz could yield positive surprises in his role as the head of the global lending institution and that berlin could work constructively with him .

the industry has n't been this excited since a girl named nena sang about 99 red balloons more than 20 years ago . were it not for the german-speaking djs and ads , there would be nothing to distinguish german radio of the past few years with stations in britain and america .
the playlists read like they were copied from the us billboard top 20 charts , the main artists , world stars like puff daddy and christina aguilera .
then a berlin rock band with a female vocalist and the modest name " wir sind helden " - we are heroes - exploded onto the scene last summer , riding to the top of the german charts and selling a stupendous 500,000 records .
suddenly , rock auf deutsch was all the rage - again .
" they opened the gate , " said hannes ross , pop music critic at stern , the magazine with the largest circulation in germany .
" all of a sudden the record companies were waiting in line , wondering , ' why do n't we have a band like that under contract ?
we also need a german band ' ! "
since then , german bands have stormed the charts .
a combination of weariness with the mainstream pop piped in from america and songs that promoters and radio programmers say are more intelligent and polished than in the past has led to a flood of media coverage - and improved sales .
german music steps up though illegal downloads and stingy german consumers still meant music sales in 2004 were down 3 percent from 2003 , the figure was a far cry from the 20 percent decrease in sales between 2002 and 2003 , according to the german office of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- .
german music " had a big part in that " turnaround , said hartmut spiesecke , spokesman for ifpi germany .
bands like silbermond -lrb- photo -rrb- , from the eastern german town of bautzen , and juli , from the city of giessen , near frankfurt , have sold hundreds of thousands of albums .

singles by german artists made up more than half of the singles on the charts , the second-highest in history .
" it is really amazing , " said aditya sharma , director of programming at the berlin radio station fritz .
" what the bands have done is make people believe that the german language and pop music are compatible . "
deutsch suddenly cool again fritz 's young listeners by and large rejected german music in the past , said sharma .
the reason : music in english sounded , well , cooler .
then came wir sind helden , whose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva briegel , lead singer of the band juli which , like other popular german bands at the moment , features a female lead vocalist and a bunch of guys playing back up debut album , " die reklamation , " or " the claim , " packed lyrics about being young in an economically-downtrodden germany with an upbeat mix of guitar and electronic sound .
ross said the band " hit a nerve " among students and other young people .
alternative radio stations in germany , like sharma 's , began playing wsh 's music in 2004 .
before long , the band had cobbled together 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,300 -rrb- to produce a video that got regular airtime on mtv .
" they came from the underground , and if the lyrics are good and people connect to it , why should n't they be successful ? " said matthias reimann , whose company was the first to heavily promote wir sind helden , sending a representative to radio stations across germany with a small bundle of cds .
juli and silbermond followed with double plantinum albums of their own .
for all the hype , germany 's pop phenomenon is n't expected to jump the atlantic , as british and french pop songs sometimes have , finding success in the us .
national , but not international , success # b # " the competition -lrb- in the international pop scene -rrb- is too tough , " said reimann .

industry insiders said there has n't been this much hype surrounding german pop since a teenager named nena sang about 99 red balloons in 1984 .

however , the reform will allow the rules to be interpreted more loosely and give governments space to spend more in order to get their economies moving . starting the motor summit participants aim to focus on europe 's sclerotic economy and look at ways of revving up a motor that has been sputtering for some time now .
leaders say they hope to agree on more business-friendly measures and increased research spending to boost long-term growth . in 2000 , eu heads drew up the " lisbon agenda , " a strategy paper that has the ambitious goal of europe becoming the world 's most dynamic economy by 2010 .
the brussels meeting will take another look at that plan at its half-way mark .
the judgment wo n't likely be too positive .
already last month , the eu admitted that its underperforming economy had made the lisbon agreement 's 2010 deadline impossible to achieve . contention one divisive issue that could cloud the summit is the proposed eu services directive , introduced by former internal market commissioner frits bolkestein .
the directive , which would greatly liberalize the eu 's services market , has run into a wall of protest , both from leaders and the public . on monday , french president jacques chirac repeated his vocal critique of the directive and germany 's chancellor gerhard schröder has expressed fears that were the directive to go into effect , it would lead to wage dumping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man shows his shirt slogan as he marches , together with an estimated 50,000 protesters , during a demonstration in downtown brussels on march 19 on saturday , 50,000 people demonstrated against the plan in brussels , arguing the directive will destroy many well-paid jobs in the western part of the eu and end the traditional ways in many professions . world politics could also invade the economic roundtable as the issue of lifting the eu ban on selling arms to china is called into question again .
britain once against cast doubt on the wisdom of such a move , although abolishing the ban is supported by fellow eu heavyweights germany and france . china 's recent assertion that it would use force if taiwan - which the mainland considers a breakaway province - formally declared its independence has made it more difficult for the eu to lift the arms embargo , uk foreign secretary jack straw said . controversial nomination the nomination by us president george w. bush to head the world bank will also be discussed by european leaders .
when the us leader announced the nomination of paul wolfowitz , deputy defense secretary and major architect of the us-led war in iraq , it was met with private consternation by many in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz , president bush 's choice for world bank president however , chancellor schröder has said germany will not oppose wolfowitz 's -lrb- photo -rrb- nomination , saying he thought wolfowitz could yield positive surprises in his role as the head of the global lending institution and that berlin could work constructively with him .
the netherlands said it would have liked a wider field of candidates . it is , however , unlikely that the europeans will try to block wolfowitz , especially at a time when they are trying to heal the deep rifts with the us that formed over the iraq war .

the industry has n't been this excited since a girl named nena sang about 99 red balloons more than 20 years ago . were it not for the german-speaking djs and ads , there would be nothing to distinguish german radio of the past few years with stations in britain and america .
the playlists read like they were copied from the us billboard top 20 charts , the main artists , world stars like puff daddy and christina aguilera .
then a berlin rock band with a female vocalist and the modest name " wir sind helden " - we are heroes - exploded onto the scene last summer , riding to the top of the german charts and selling a stupendous 500,000 records .
suddenly , rock auf deutsch was all the rage - again .
" they opened the gate , " said hannes ross , pop music critic at stern , the magazine with the largest circulation in germany .
" all of a sudden the record companies were waiting in line , wondering , ' why do n't we have a band like that under contract ?
we also need a german band ' ! "
since then , german bands have stormed the charts .
a combination of weariness with the mainstream pop piped in from america and songs that promoters and radio programmers say are more intelligent and polished than in the past has led to a flood of media coverage - and improved sales .
german music steps up though illegal downloads and stingy german consumers still meant music sales in 2004 were down 3 percent from 2003 , the figure was a far cry from the 20 percent decrease in sales between 2002 and 2003 , according to the german office of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- .
german music " had a big part in that " turnaround , said hartmut spiesecke , spokesman for ifpi germany .
bands like silbermond -lrb- photo -rrb- , from the eastern german town of bautzen , and juli , from the city of giessen , near frankfurt , have sold hundreds of thousands of albums .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " silbermond " from the east german town of bautzen -lrb- left to right -rrb- : thomas stolle -lrb- 20 , guitar -rrb- , stefanie kloss -lrb- 19 , vocals -rrb- , andreas nowak -lrb- 21 , drums -rrb- and johannes stolle -lrb- 21 , bass -rrb- releases by german bands made up 30.3 percent of the albums on the charts in 2004 , the highest percentage ever , said spiesecke .
singles by german artists made up more than half of the singles on the charts , the second-highest in history .
" it is really amazing , " said aditya sharma , director of programming at the berlin radio station fritz .
" what the bands have done is make people believe that the german language and pop music are compatible . "
deutsch suddenly cool again fritz 's young listeners by and large rejected german music in the past , said sharma .
the reason : music in english sounded , well , cooler .
then came wir sind helden , whose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva briegel , lead singer of the band juli which , like other popular german bands at the moment , features a female lead vocalist and a bunch of guys playing back up debut album , " die reklamation , " or " the claim , " packed lyrics about being young in an economically-downtrodden germany with an upbeat mix of guitar and electronic sound .
ross said the band " hit a nerve " among students and other young people .
alternative radio stations in germany , like sharma 's , began playing wsh 's music in 2004 .
before long , the band had cobbled together 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,300 -rrb- to produce a video that got regular airtime on mtv .
" they came from the underground , and if the lyrics are good and people connect to it , why should n't they be successful ? " said matthias reimann , whose company was the first to heavily promote wir sind helden , sending a representative to radio stations across germany with a small bundle of cds .
juli and silbermond followed with double plantinum albums of their own .
for all the hype , germany 's pop phenomenon is n't expected to jump the atlantic , as british and french pop songs sometimes have , finding success in the us .
national , but not international , success # b # " the competition -lrb- in the international pop scene -rrb- is too tough , " said reimann .
" especially the pop music that comes out of america .
it 's much more polished , and the quality is higher . "
retaining supremacy in the national music market is more likely .
the test will come in the next few months , when bands like wir sind helden and silbermond release their second albums .
but things are looking good .
industry insiders said there has n't been this much hype surrounding german pop since a teenager named nena sang about 99 red balloons in 1984 .
" the last time things were this big was the neue deutsche welle , 20 years ago , " said sharma , referring to the string of german bands that made names for themselves internationally in the mid-1980s .
" and the bands nowadays - at least their lyrics - are much better .

german music steps up though illegal downloads and stingy german consumers still meant music sales in 2004 were down 3 percent from 2003 , the figure was a far cry from the 20 percent decrease in sales between 2002 and 2003 , according to the german office of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- .
german music " had a big part in that " turnaround , said hartmut spiesecke , spokesman for ifpi germany .
bands like silbermond -lrb- photo -rrb- , from the eastern german town of bautzen , and juli , from the city of giessen , near frankfurt , have sold hundreds of thousands of albums .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " silbermond " from the east german town of bautzen -lrb- left to right -rrb- : thomas stolle -lrb- 20 , guitar -rrb- , stefanie kloss -lrb- 19 , vocals -rrb- , andreas nowak -lrb- 21 , drums -rrb- and johannes stolle -lrb- 21 , bass -rrb- releases by german bands made up 30.3 percent of the albums on the charts in 2004 , the highest percentage ever , said spiesecke .
singles by german artists made up more than half of the singles on the charts , the second-highest in history .
" it is really amazing , " said aditya sharma , director of programming at the berlin radio station fritz .
" what the bands have done is make people believe that the german language and pop music are compatible . "
deutsch suddenly cool again fritz 's young listeners by and large rejected german music in the past , said sharma .
the reason : music in english sounded , well , cooler .
then came wir sind helden , whose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva briegel , lead singer of the band juli which , like other popular german bands at the moment , features a female lead vocalist and a bunch of guys playing back up debut album , " die reklamation , " or " the claim , " packed lyrics about being young in an economically-downtrodden germany with an upbeat mix of guitar and electronic sound .
ross said the band " hit a nerve " among students and other young people .
alternative radio stations in germany , like sharma 's , began playing wsh 's music in 2004 .
before long , the band had cobbled together 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,300 -rrb- to produce a video that got regular airtime on mtv .
" they came from the underground , and if the lyrics are good and people connect to it , why should n't they be successful ? " said matthias reimann , whose company was the first to heavily promote wir sind helden , sending a representative to radio stations across germany with a small bundle of cds .
juli and silbermond followed with double plantinum albums of their own .
for all the hype , germany 's pop phenomenon is n't expected to jump the atlantic , as british and french pop songs sometimes have , finding success in the us .
national , but not international , success # b # " the competition -lrb- in the international pop scene -rrb- is too tough , " said reimann .
" especially the pop music that comes out of america .
it 's much more polished , and the quality is higher . "
retaining supremacy in the national music market is more likely .
the test will come in the next few months , when bands like wir sind helden and silbermond release their second albums .
but things are looking good .
industry insiders said there has n't been this much hype surrounding german pop since a teenager named nena sang about 99 red balloons in 1984 .
" the last time things were this big was the neue deutsche welle , 20 years ago , " said sharma , referring to the string of german bands that made names for themselves internationally in the mid-1980s .

another issue up for debate is america 's controversial nomination of paul wolfowitz as head of the world bank . the spring economic summit beginning tuesday in brussels will likely start off with a quick approval of a reform of the eu 's stability and growth pact , which eu finance ministers agreed upon on sunday . according to luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude junker , who will chair the meeting , there will be little discussion and " certainly not any tough debate " on the loosening of the eu deficit rules , which was passed largely thanks to germany 's fierce lobbying efforts . the rules governing the euro , namely that countries should keep their deficits under three percent of gross domestic product , have not been scrapped .
however , the reform will allow the rules to be interpreted more loosely and give governments space to spend more in order to get their economies moving . starting the motor summit participants aim to focus on europe 's sclerotic economy and look at ways of revving up a motor that has been sputtering for some time now .
leaders say they hope to agree on more business-friendly measures and increased research spending to boost long-term growth . in 2000 , eu heads drew up the " lisbon agenda , " a strategy paper that has the ambitious goal of europe becoming the world 's most dynamic economy by 2010 .
the brussels meeting will take another look at that plan at its half-way mark .
the judgment wo n't likely be too positive .
already last month , the eu admitted that its underperforming economy had made the lisbon agreement 's 2010 deadline impossible to achieve . contention one divisive issue that could cloud the summit is the proposed eu services directive , introduced by former internal market commissioner frits bolkestein .
the directive , which would greatly liberalize the eu 's services market , has run into a wall of protest , both from leaders and the public . on monday , french president jacques chirac repeated his vocal critique of the directive and germany 's chancellor gerhard schröder has expressed fears that were the directive to go into effect , it would lead to wage dumping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man shows his shirt slogan as he marches , together with an estimated 50,000 protesters , during a demonstration in downtown brussels on march 19 on saturday , 50,000 people demonstrated against the plan in brussels , arguing the directive will destroy many well-paid jobs in the western part of the eu and end the traditional ways in many professions . world politics could also invade the economic roundtable as the issue of lifting the eu ban on selling arms to china is called into question again .
britain once against cast doubt on the wisdom of such a move , although abolishing the ban is supported by fellow eu heavyweights germany and france . china 's recent assertion that it would use force if taiwan - which the mainland considers a breakaway province - formally declared its independence has made it more difficult for the eu to lift the arms embargo , uk foreign secretary jack straw said . controversial nomination the nomination by us president george w. bush to head the world bank will also be discussed by european leaders .
when the us leader announced the nomination of paul wolfowitz , deputy defense secretary and major architect of the us-led war in iraq , it was met with private consternation by many in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz , president bush 's choice for world bank president however , chancellor schröder has said germany will not oppose wolfowitz 's -lrb- photo -rrb- nomination , saying he thought wolfowitz could yield positive surprises in his role as the head of the global lending institution and that berlin could work constructively with him .
the netherlands said it would have liked a wider field of candidates . it is , however , unlikely that the europeans will try to block wolfowitz , especially at a time when they are trying to heal the deep rifts with the us that formed over the iraq war .

the industry has n't been this excited since a girl named nena sang about 99 red balloons more than 20 years ago . were it not for the german-speaking djs and ads , there would be nothing to distinguish german radio of the past few years with stations in britain and america .
the playlists read like they were copied from the us billboard top 20 charts , the main artists , world stars like puff daddy and christina aguilera .
then a berlin rock band with a female vocalist and the modest name " wir sind helden " - we are heroes - exploded onto the scene last summer , riding to the top of the german charts and selling a stupendous 500,000 records .
suddenly , rock auf deutsch was all the rage - again .
" they opened the gate , " said hannes ross , pop music critic at stern , the magazine with the largest circulation in germany .
" all of a sudden the record companies were waiting in line , wondering , ' why do n't we have a band like that under contract ?
we also need a german band ' ! "
since then , german bands have stormed the charts .
a combination of weariness with the mainstream pop piped in from america and songs that promoters and radio programmers say are more intelligent and polished than in the past has led to a flood of media coverage - and improved sales .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.03.2005 opinion : burying the euro stability pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's strength does n't necessarily reflect confidence in it eu finance ministers have agreed to reform the rules underpinning the euro .
but in doing so , the floodgates have been opened for reinterpreting the regulations meant to ensure budgetary discipline and a stable currency . let 's be honest .
rarely do sinners decide to punish themselves .
in that respect , establishing the european stability and growth pact - which germany successfully made a condition for abolishing the deutsche mark - was defective from the start , for there were and are many sinners .
countries like greece or italy would never have been allowed to join the euro club if the maastricht treaty 's convergence criteria had been applied verbatim .
france violated the treaty from 2002-2004 .
portugal did so in 2001 .
the netherlands breached it in 2003 .
greece swindled its way through every year .
and germany , the pact 's initiator , has n't kept its public debts below the ceiling of 3 percent of gdp since 2002 . if the heads of government sign the deal their finance ministers agreed to monday evening , the stability pact will remain formally valid - the 3 percent cap and the deficit limit of 60 percent of gdp annually will go untouched .
but , in reality , the pact will have degenerated into an arbitrary document .
the european commission - which is meant to police compliance to the deficit caps - will be instructed to take into account exceptional circumstances when they consider exacting disciplinary measures for deficit breaches .
thus , the german finance minister , for example , will be able to claim the costs of developing eastern germany as a special burden - and other states will follow and use their imaginations to devise new exceptional circumstances . loosening the stability pact is n't a license to make debts , says germany 's finance minister - but that 's how it will be understood in the euro zone .
the idea of the stability pact is dead .
the idea was that the maastricht treaty 's admission criteria would be made permanent to encourage budgetary discipline .
the idea was that future generations would n't be left with a mountain of debt .
the idea was to show the rest of the world that the euro zone had an elementary interest in ensuring a strong and stable euro . little remains of these ideas .
and you do n't need much imagination to predict where political discussions will take us in the coming years , namely , examining what can be considered euro-zone admission criteria .
ca n't spending on research and education be included ?
can france bring to bear its developmental aid ?
do n't investments in infrastructure count since they 're meant to serve future generations ?
the floodgates are open for wrangling in brussels . all the same , the euro zone can point to the fact that its currency has become strong and stable - even without budgetary discipline on the part of its member countries .
however , this impression is misleading .
the euro is currently sought-after on the currency markets only because many investors are concerned about the us twin deficit and are consequently avoiding the dollar .
but they certainly are n't asking for the euro because they 're impressed by the euro zone 's budgetary discipline .
for that is surely nothing to marvel at . rolf wenkel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mixed reactions to stability pact rewrite in the wake of sunday 's decision to loosen the rules of the stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , opposition voices in germany are crying foul .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 22.03.2005 long-lost bach cantata revived großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bach composed the cantata in 1728 a piece by german composer johann sebastian bach lost for decades has come to life in japan this week , shedding new light on the 18th-century baroque master . the wedding cantata bwv216 resurfaced a year ago by chance in the papers of chieko hara , the japanese pianist who died in december 2001 at the age 86 after a career spent largely in europe . bach had composed the cantata in 1728 for the wedding of a customs official 's daughter in leipzig .
the original score has never been recovered , but the version discovered in japan was believed to have been copied by one of bach 's students under his stewardship . the eight rediscovered pages consist almost uniquely of vocal pieces in german for soprano and alto , with the seven movements lasting for a total of between 20 and 25 minutes .
the instrumental parts are entirely lost except for two recycled movements , a duet and an aria which had been used elsewhere in bach 's work .
the text is an allegorical dialogue between two rivers in saxony , the pleisse and the neisse , which represent the groom and the young bride . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thankfully still here " this is my dinosaur " american musicologist joshua rifkin , a conductor and composer who is one of the leading interpreters of bach was asked to recreate the missing instrumental parts .
he said he originally wanted to let the lost cantata rest . " maybe a fragment should stay a fragment , " rifkin told afp .
" then i thought of palaeontologists , from one bone they figure the entire dinosaur .
this is my dinosaur . " at first , rifkin thought the challenge would be too difficult .
in the end , he decided to take up the project which he described as a " musical rubik 's cube " . " i could not reconstruct what bach wrote but i could give the people of today an idea of what his music was like , " rifkin said .
" it sounds like bach 's music , " he said .
" but the listener should not know which part is bach 's , which part is mine . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connection , in politics and in the arts lost for decades the cantata , which despite being yellow with age remained in good state , was authenticated by a team of experts led by bach specialist , professor tadashi isoyama of the kunitachi college of music in suburban tokyo . the copy of the cantata passed from collector to collector and had vanished for 80 years .
the only thing known for sure is that it belonged to a descendant of the german composer felix mendelssohn until the 1920s . experts believe hara likely inherited the cantata - but was oblivious to its existence - from her husband , the late spanish cellist gaspar cassado , who knew the mendelssohn family . huge impact for isoyama , the music professor , the rediscovery of the cantata is " very important " to the understanding of bach , who lived from 1685 to 1750 : " this finding has a huge impact in the music world , " isoyama said . while there were attempts to recreate the cantata in the early 20th century , isoyama said the difference this time was the involvement of rifkin with his knowledge of bach . " he reconstructed the instrumental score .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 22.03.2005 long-lost bach cantata revived großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bach composed the cantata in 1728 a piece by german composer johann sebastian bach lost for decades has come to life in japan this week , shedding new light on the 18th-century baroque master . the wedding cantata bwv216 resurfaced a year ago by chance in the papers of chieko hara , the japanese pianist who died in december 2001 at the age 86 after a career spent largely in europe . bach had composed the cantata in 1728 for the wedding of a customs official 's daughter in leipzig .
the original score has never been recovered , but the version discovered in japan was believed to have been copied by one of bach 's students under his stewardship . the eight rediscovered pages consist almost uniquely of vocal pieces in german for soprano and alto , with the seven movements lasting for a total of between 20 and 25 minutes .
the instrumental parts are entirely lost except for two recycled movements , a duet and an aria which had been used elsewhere in bach 's work .
the text is an allegorical dialogue between two rivers in saxony , the pleisse and the neisse , which represent the groom and the young bride . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thankfully still here " this is my dinosaur " american musicologist joshua rifkin , a conductor and composer who is one of the leading interpreters of bach was asked to recreate the missing instrumental parts .
he said he originally wanted to let the lost cantata rest . " maybe a fragment should stay a fragment , " rifkin told afp .
" then i thought of palaeontologists , from one bone they figure the entire dinosaur .
this is my dinosaur . " at first , rifkin thought the challenge would be too difficult .
in the end , he decided to take up the project which he described as a " musical rubik 's cube " . " i could not reconstruct what bach wrote but i could give the people of today an idea of what his music was like , " rifkin said .
" it sounds like bach 's music , " he said .
" but the listener should not know which part is bach 's , which part is mine . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connection , in politics and in the arts lost for decades the cantata , which despite being yellow with age remained in good state , was authenticated by a team of experts led by bach specialist , professor tadashi isoyama of the kunitachi college of music in suburban tokyo . the copy of the cantata passed from collector to collector and had vanished for 80 years .
the only thing known for sure is that it belonged to a descendant of the german composer felix mendelssohn until the 1920s . experts believe hara likely inherited the cantata - but was oblivious to its existence - from her husband , the late spanish cellist gaspar cassado , who knew the mendelssohn family . huge impact for isoyama , the music professor , the rediscovery of the cantata is " very important " to the understanding of bach , who lived from 1685 to 1750 : " this finding has a huge impact in the music world , " isoyama said . while there were attempts to recreate the cantata in the early 20th century , isoyama said the difference this time was the involvement of rifkin with his knowledge of bach . " he reconstructed the instrumental score .
this is history making because -lrb- his -rrb- high-level score is reconstructed , truly reflecting bach 's style , " isoyama said . passionate musical audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johann sebastian bach the wedding cantata had its debut sunday in the small hall of suntory hall in tokyo , one of the world 's most prestigious venues for classical music , with two of bach 's profane cantatas bwv202 and bwv210 .

the push to highlight racism follows increased attempts by eu member states to push for an eu-wide ban on neo-nazi symbols after prince harry of england caused an uproar when appearing at a costume party in a nazi uniform . the initiative was squashed by britain and italy because of concerns that such a ban would limit the basic right of freedom of expression .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.03.2005 the neue deutsche welle rises großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wir sind helden lead singer judith holofernes german pop and rock music is suddenly making a comeback - thanks to good bands and better media coverage .
the industry has n't been this excited since a girl named nena sang about 99 red balloons more than 20 years ago . were it not for the german-speaking djs and ads , there would be nothing to distinguish german radio of the past few years with stations in britain and america .
the playlists read like they were copied from the us billboard top 20 charts , the main artists , world stars like puff daddy and christina aguilera .
then a berlin rock band with a female vocalist and the modest name " wir sind helden " - we are heroes - exploded onto the scene last summer , riding to the top of the german charts and selling a stupendous 500,000 records .
suddenly , rock auf deutsch was all the rage - again .
" they opened the gate , " said hannes ross , pop music critic at stern , the magazine with the largest circulation in germany .
" all of a sudden the record companies were waiting in line , wondering , ' why do n't we have a band like that under contract ?
we also need a german band ' ! "
since then , german bands have stormed the charts .
a combination of weariness with the mainstream pop piped in from america and songs that promoters and radio programmers say are more intelligent and polished than in the past has led to a flood of media coverage - and improved sales .
german music steps up though illegal downloads and stingy german consumers still meant music sales in 2004 were down 3 percent from 2003 , the figure was a far cry from the 20 percent decrease in sales between 2002 and 2003 , according to the german office of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- .
german music " had a big part in that " turnaround , said hartmut spiesecke , spokesman for ifpi germany .
bands like silbermond -lrb- photo -rrb- , from the eastern german town of bautzen , and juli , from the city of giessen , near frankfurt , have sold hundreds of thousands of albums .

singles by german artists made up more than half of the singles on the charts , the second-highest in history .
" it is really amazing , " said aditya sharma , director of programming at the berlin radio station fritz .
" what the bands have done is make people believe that the german language and pop music are compatible . "
deutsch suddenly cool again fritz 's young listeners by and large rejected german music in the past , said sharma .
the reason : music in english sounded , well , cooler .
then came wir sind helden , whose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva briegel , lead singer of the band juli which , like other popular german bands at the moment , features a female lead vocalist and a bunch of guys playing back up debut album , " die reklamation , " or " the claim , " packed lyrics about being young in an economically-downtrodden germany with an upbeat mix of guitar and electronic sound .
ross said the band " hit a nerve " among students and other young people .
alternative radio stations in germany , like sharma 's , began playing wsh 's music in 2004 .
before long , the band had cobbled together 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,300 -rrb- to produce a video that got regular airtime on mtv .
" they came from the underground , and if the lyrics are good and people connect to it , why should n't they be successful ? " said matthias reimann , whose company was the first to heavily promote wir sind helden , sending a representative to radio stations across germany with a small bundle of cds .
juli and silbermond followed with double plantinum albums of their own .
for all the hype , germany 's pop phenomenon is n't expected to jump the atlantic , as british and french pop songs sometimes have , finding success in the us .
national , but not international , success # b # " the competition -lrb- in the international pop scene -rrb- is too tough , " said reimann .
" especially the pop music that comes out of america .
it 's much more polished , and the quality is higher . "
retaining supremacy in the national music market is more likely .
the test will come in the next few months , when bands like wir sind helden and silbermond release their second albums .
but things are looking good .
industry insiders said there has n't been this much hype surrounding german pop since a teenager named nena sang about 99 red balloons in 1984 .
" the last time things were this big was the neue deutsche welle , 20 years ago , " said sharma , referring to the string of german bands that made names for themselves internationally in the mid-1980s .
" and the bands nowadays - at least their lyrics - are much better .

the original score has never been recovered , but the version discovered in japan was believed to have been copied by one of bach 's students under his stewardship . the eight rediscovered pages consist almost uniquely of vocal pieces in german for soprano and alto , with the seven movements lasting for a total of between 20 and 25 minutes .
the instrumental parts are entirely lost except for two recycled movements , a duet and an aria which had been used elsewhere in bach 's work .
the text is an allegorical dialogue between two rivers in saxony , the pleisse and the neisse , which represent the groom and the young bride . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thankfully still here " this is my dinosaur " american musicologist joshua rifkin , a conductor and composer who is one of the leading interpreters of bach was asked to recreate the missing instrumental parts .
he said he originally wanted to let the lost cantata rest . " maybe a fragment should stay a fragment , " rifkin told afp .
" then i thought of palaeontologists , from one bone they figure the entire dinosaur .
this is my dinosaur . " at first , rifkin thought the challenge would be too difficult .
in the end , he decided to take up the project which he described as a " musical rubik 's cube " . " i could not reconstruct what bach wrote but i could give the people of today an idea of what his music was like , " rifkin said .
" it sounds like bach 's music , " he said .
" but the listener should not know which part is bach 's , which part is mine . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connection , in politics and in the arts lost for decades the cantata , which despite being yellow with age remained in good state , was authenticated by a team of experts led by bach specialist , professor tadashi isoyama of the kunitachi college of music in suburban tokyo . the copy of the cantata passed from collector to collector and had vanished for 80 years .
the only thing known for sure is that it belonged to a descendant of the german composer felix mendelssohn until the 1920s . experts believe hara likely inherited the cantata - but was oblivious to its existence - from her husband , the late spanish cellist gaspar cassado , who knew the mendelssohn family . huge impact for isoyama , the music professor , the rediscovery of the cantata is " very important " to the understanding of bach , who lived from 1685 to 1750 : " this finding has a huge impact in the music world , " isoyama said . while there were attempts to recreate the cantata in the early 20th century , isoyama said the difference this time was the involvement of rifkin with his knowledge of bach . " he reconstructed the instrumental score .
this is history making because -lrb- his -rrb- high-level score is reconstructed , truly reflecting bach 's style , " isoyama said . passionate musical audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johann sebastian bach the wedding cantata had its debut sunday in the small hall of suntory hall in tokyo , one of the world 's most prestigious venues for classical music , with two of bach 's profane cantatas bwv202 and bwv210 .

" parties that make no secret of their racist , xenophobic or neo-nazi leanings should be banned , " he said . the report on racism , xenophobia and discrimination placed a special focus on extreme right parties in eastern germany , saying that it was " particularly worrying " that rightwing extremist parties such as the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- increased public support in recent state elections through racist slogans . also highlighting racist violence in russia and elsewhere , the report called on the 25 " to take account of its ethnic , cultural and religious pluralism .

" harry 's nazi gaffe sparks uproar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a copy of tabloid ' the sun ' , whose front page shows a picture of britain 's prince harry wearing a nazi soldier 's uniform to a fancy dress party .
the push to highlight racism follows increased attempts by eu member states to push for an eu-wide ban on neo-nazi symbols after prince harry of england caused an uproar when appearing at a costume party in a nazi uniform . the initiative was squashed by britain and italy because of concerns that such a ban would limit the basic right of freedom of expression .
but eu ministers did agree last month to reanimate a sleeping debate on regulating racism and xenophobia .
in this case , great britain and italy dropped up their blockade-like reaction .
among other things , the agreement would make it punishable by law to deny the holocaust or other crimes against humanity . meanwhile , the german upper house of parliament passed legislation last week in another attempt to crack down on far right parties : the initiative seeks to curb neo-nazi marches amid concerns the extreme-right will target celebrations to mark the end of the war in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : among some 6,000 sympathizers of the national party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- attended a neo-nazi meeting in the eastern german city of leipzig in 1998 .

another issue up for debate is america 's controversial nomination of paul wolfowitz as head of the world bank . the spring economic summit beginning tuesday in brussels will likely start off with a quick approval of a reform of the eu 's stability and growth pact , which eu finance ministers agreed upon on sunday . according to luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude junker , who will chair the meeting , there will be little discussion and " certainly not any tough debate " on the loosening of the eu deficit rules , which was passed largely thanks to germany 's fierce lobbying efforts . the rules governing the euro , namely that countries should keep their deficits under three percent of gross domestic product , have not been scrapped .
however , the reform will allow the rules to be interpreted more loosely and give governments space to spend more in order to get their economies moving . starting the motor summit participants aim to focus on europe 's sclerotic economy and look at ways of revving up a motor that has been sputtering for some time now .

another issue up for debate is america 's controversial nomination of paul wolfowitz as head of the world bank . the spring economic summit beginning tuesday in brussels will likely start off with a quick approval of a reform of the eu 's stability and growth pact , which eu finance ministers agreed upon on sunday . according to luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude junker , who will chair the meeting , there will be little discussion and " certainly not any tough debate " on the loosening of the eu deficit rules , which was passed largely thanks to germany 's fierce lobbying efforts . the rules governing the euro , namely that countries should keep their deficits under three percent of gross domestic product , have not been scrapped .
however , the reform will allow the rules to be interpreted more loosely and give governments space to spend more in order to get their economies moving . starting the motor summit participants aim to focus on europe 's sclerotic economy and look at ways of revving up a motor that has been sputtering for some time now .
leaders say they hope to agree on more business-friendly measures and increased research spending to boost long-term growth . in 2000 , eu heads drew up the " lisbon agenda , " a strategy paper that has the ambitious goal of europe becoming the world 's most dynamic economy by 2010 .
the brussels meeting will take another look at that plan at its half-way mark .
the judgment wo n't likely be too positive .
already last month , the eu admitted that its underperforming economy had made the lisbon agreement 's 2010 deadline impossible to achieve . contention one divisive issue that could cloud the summit is the proposed eu services directive , introduced by former internal market commissioner frits bolkestein .
the directive , which would greatly liberalize the eu 's services market , has run into a wall of protest , both from leaders and the public . on monday , french president jacques chirac repeated his vocal critique of the directive and germany 's chancellor gerhard schröder has expressed fears that were the directive to go into effect , it would lead to wage dumping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man shows his shirt slogan as he marches , together with an estimated 50,000 protesters , during a demonstration in downtown brussels on march 19 on saturday , 50,000 people demonstrated against the plan in brussels , arguing the directive will destroy many well-paid jobs in the western part of the eu and end the traditional ways in many professions . world politics could also invade the economic roundtable as the issue of lifting the eu ban on selling arms to china is called into question again .
britain once against cast doubt on the wisdom of such a move , although abolishing the ban is supported by fellow eu heavyweights germany and france . china 's recent assertion that it would use force if taiwan - which the mainland considers a breakaway province - formally declared its independence has made it more difficult for the eu to lift the arms embargo , uk foreign secretary jack straw said . controversial nomination the nomination by us president george w. bush to head the world bank will also be discussed by european leaders .
when the us leader announced the nomination of paul wolfowitz , deputy defense secretary and major architect of the us-led war in iraq , it was met with private consternation by many in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz , president bush 's choice for world bank president however , chancellor schröder has said germany will not oppose wolfowitz 's -lrb- photo -rrb- nomination , saying he thought wolfowitz could yield positive surprises in his role as the head of the global lending institution and that berlin could work constructively with him .
the netherlands said it would have liked a wider field of candidates . it is , however , unlikely that the europeans will try to block wolfowitz , especially at a time when they are trying to heal the deep rifts with the us that formed over the iraq war .

at present , germany only spends 0.29 percent of gdp for this purpose - too little to impress anyone in the world body . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany says un record a success germany 's two-year stint as a non-permanent member of the un security council ended at the end of last year .

the industry has n't been this excited since a girl named nena sang about 99 red balloons more than 20 years ago . were it not for the german-speaking djs and ads , there would be nothing to distinguish german radio of the past few years with stations in britain and america .
the playlists read like they were copied from the us billboard top 20 charts , the main artists , world stars like puff daddy and christina aguilera .
then a berlin rock band with a female vocalist and the modest name " wir sind helden " - we are heroes - exploded onto the scene last summer , riding to the top of the german charts and selling a stupendous 500,000 records .
suddenly , rock auf deutsch was all the rage - again .
" they opened the gate , " said hannes ross , pop music critic at stern , the magazine with the largest circulation in germany .
" all of a sudden the record companies were waiting in line , wondering , ' why do n't we have a band like that under contract ?
we also need a german band ' ! "
since then , german bands have stormed the charts .
a combination of weariness with the mainstream pop piped in from america and songs that promoters and radio programmers say are more intelligent and polished than in the past has led to a flood of media coverage - and improved sales .
german music steps up though illegal downloads and stingy german consumers still meant music sales in 2004 were down 3 percent from 2003 , the figure was a far cry from the 20 percent decrease in sales between 2002 and 2003 , according to the german office of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- .
german music " had a big part in that " turnaround , said hartmut spiesecke , spokesman for ifpi germany .
bands like silbermond -lrb- photo -rrb- , from the eastern german town of bautzen , and juli , from the city of giessen , near frankfurt , have sold hundreds of thousands of albums .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " silbermond " from the east german town of bautzen -lrb- left to right -rrb- : thomas stolle -lrb- 20 , guitar -rrb- , stefanie kloss -lrb- 19 , vocals -rrb- , andreas nowak -lrb- 21 , drums -rrb- and johannes stolle -lrb- 21 , bass -rrb- releases by german bands made up 30.3 percent of the albums on the charts in 2004 , the highest percentage ever , said spiesecke .
singles by german artists made up more than half of the singles on the charts , the second-highest in history .
" it is really amazing , " said aditya sharma , director of programming at the berlin radio station fritz .
" what the bands have done is make people believe that the german language and pop music are compatible . "
deutsch suddenly cool again fritz 's young listeners by and large rejected german music in the past , said sharma .
the reason : music in english sounded , well , cooler .
then came wir sind helden , whose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva briegel , lead singer of the band juli which , like other popular german bands at the moment , features a female lead vocalist and a bunch of guys playing back up debut album , " die reklamation , " or " the claim , " packed lyrics about being young in an economically-downtrodden germany with an upbeat mix of guitar and electronic sound .
ross said the band " hit a nerve " among students and other young people .
alternative radio stations in germany , like sharma 's , began playing wsh 's music in 2004 .
before long , the band had cobbled together 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,300 -rrb- to produce a video that got regular airtime on mtv .
" they came from the underground , and if the lyrics are good and people connect to it , why should n't they be successful ? " said matthias reimann , whose company was the first to heavily promote wir sind helden , sending a representative to radio stations across germany with a small bundle of cds .
juli and silbermond followed with double plantinum albums of their own .
for all the hype , germany 's pop phenomenon is n't expected to jump the atlantic , as british and french pop songs sometimes have , finding success in the us .
national , but not international , success # b # " the competition -lrb- in the international pop scene -rrb- is too tough , " said reimann .
" especially the pop music that comes out of america .
it 's much more polished , and the quality is higher . "
retaining supremacy in the national music market is more likely .
the test will come in the next few months , when bands like wir sind helden and silbermond release their second albums .
but things are looking good .
industry insiders said there has n't been this much hype surrounding german pop since a teenager named nena sang about 99 red balloons in 1984 .
" the last time things were this big was the neue deutsche welle , 20 years ago , " said sharma , referring to the string of german bands that made names for themselves internationally in the mid-1980s .
" and the bands nowadays - at least their lyrics - are much better .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.03.2005 berlin faces lawsuit demanding cleaner air the eu ’ s new clean air laws are not being upheld in major german cities .
citizens have now taken legal action against berlin to reduce pollutants in the air .
other german cities could have to tackle similar cases . major german cities are facing a wave of lawsuits for not giving their citizens air clean enough to breathe .
berlin could become the first city to be legally forced to introduce measures to improve air quality .
the german environmental organization deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- duh -rrb- began a planned string of legal action on monday by supporting lawsuits from three berlin citizens .
similar suits would follow in munich , stuttgart and other major cities , duh said . the charges are a result of the eu 's new clean air laws , which took effect on jan .
1 , 2005 .
these place limits on the air levels of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants , such as soot particles emitted by diesel vehicles .
german cities and municipalities have to control their air quality and take countermeasures if the toxic levels are too high . duh director jürgen resch criticized that the cities had long been aware of the planned changes and had simply disregarded the directive .
" the citizens concerned are taking legal action out of pure self-defense , " resch told journalists in berlin . banning diesel vehicles in large cities like berlin , sticking to the new limits is a challenge .
they stipulate that so-called particulate matter , the concentration of fine dust in the air , can not exceed 50 micrograms per cubic meter on more than 35 days of the year .
these pollutants have been found to cause respiratory and cardiovascular diseases . berlin has exceeded these levels by far in previous years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the more traffic that heads into cities , the higher the level of pollutants resch criticized that municipalities , state and federal governments had been inactive for years in battling these pollutants .
yet the eu directive has been known since 1999 .
he said duh supported lawsuits in order to push through measures to clean up the air , such as driving bans for diesel vehicles without particle filters . " we call on the cities to quickly take action to ban diesel vehicles without a filter from the cities and therefore contribute to a drastic reduction in the levels of fine dust in the air , " said resch . however , federal environment minister jürgen trittin said he thinks it would be more effective to tackle the problem at its source . " i think it would be better to ensure that we find a replacement for old cars and a re-fitting of diesel vehicles very quickly in order to really reduce the levels of fine dust , " said trittin . an unsuitable action plan for cleaner air the three plaintiffs in the berlin case live on the heavily-traveled frankfurter allee in the city 's friedrichshain district .
according to the federal environmental agency , this street already surpassed the maximum pollutant levels on 20 days this year .
the plaintiffs ' attorney , fabian löwenberg , said the injunction should force the municipality to take immediate measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : downtown berlin just has too much traffic , claim environmental groups " the clean air and action plan does not provide for a reduction in fine dust levels in berlin 's city center until 2008 , " said löwenberg .
" but it foregoes everything that would be suitable to reduce them immediately . " " the clean air and action plan for berlin in its current form is completely unsuitable to protect people 's health in the coming years , " he added . a toll for german cities ? according to duh , the most effective measure to reduce fine dust particles in the short-term is a driving ban , for example for cars without diesel soot filters .
resch referred to other eu countries , such as italy , that had introduced rigid measures like car-free days in order to meet the eu stipulations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london launched its controversial city toll in 2003 another possibility would be to introduce city tolls , such as those implemented in london .
the german traffic association verkehrsclub deutschland -lrb- vcd -rrb- said city tolls are a possibility to make the air in german cities cleaner . " but the municipalities have to decide for themselves if this would catch on in their city , " said vcd transport spokesman gerd lottsiepen .
" it could be more effective if there were defined areas in which dirty vehicles , that is , those without a filter , could simply not travel . " however , german retailers strongly oppose such bans .
" you ca n't oust cars out of the city centers , " said hubertus pellengahr , spokesman of the german retailers ' association hde .
" this will lead to the demise of retail stores and , subsequently , the city . " he said a lively retail industry was crucial for versatile and attractive city centers . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german drivers face dent in driving style on jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.03.2005 opinion : burying the euro stability pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's strength does n't necessarily reflect confidence in it eu finance ministers have agreed to reform the rules underpinning the euro .
but in doing so , the floodgates have been opened for reinterpreting the regulations meant to ensure budgetary discipline and a stable currency . let 's be honest .
rarely do sinners decide to punish themselves .
in that respect , establishing the european stability and growth pact - which germany successfully made a condition for abolishing the deutsche mark - was defective from the start , for there were and are many sinners .
countries like greece or italy would never have been allowed to join the euro club if the maastricht treaty 's convergence criteria had been applied verbatim .
france violated the treaty from 2002-2004 .
portugal did so in 2001 .
the netherlands breached it in 2003 .
greece swindled its way through every year .
and germany , the pact 's initiator , has n't kept its public debts below the ceiling of 3 percent of gdp since 2002 . if the heads of government sign the deal their finance ministers agreed to monday evening , the stability pact will remain formally valid - the 3 percent cap and the deficit limit of 60 percent of gdp annually will go untouched .
but , in reality , the pact will have degenerated into an arbitrary document .
the european commission - which is meant to police compliance to the deficit caps - will be instructed to take into account exceptional circumstances when they consider exacting disciplinary measures for deficit breaches .
thus , the german finance minister , for example , will be able to claim the costs of developing eastern germany as a special burden - and other states will follow and use their imaginations to devise new exceptional circumstances . loosening the stability pact is n't a license to make debts , says germany 's finance minister - but that 's how it will be understood in the euro zone .
the idea of the stability pact is dead .
the idea was that the maastricht treaty 's admission criteria would be made permanent to encourage budgetary discipline .
the idea was that future generations would n't be left with a mountain of debt .
the idea was to show the rest of the world that the euro zone had an elementary interest in ensuring a strong and stable euro . little remains of these ideas .
and you do n't need much imagination to predict where political discussions will take us in the coming years , namely , examining what can be considered euro-zone admission criteria .
ca n't spending on research and education be included ?
can france bring to bear its developmental aid ?
do n't investments in infrastructure count since they 're meant to serve future generations ?
the floodgates are open for wrangling in brussels . all the same , the euro zone can point to the fact that its currency has become strong and stable - even without budgetary discipline on the part of its member countries .
however , this impression is misleading .
the euro is currently sought-after on the currency markets only because many investors are concerned about the us twin deficit and are consequently avoiding the dollar .
but they certainly are n't asking for the euro because they 're impressed by the euro zone 's budgetary discipline .
for that is surely nothing to marvel at . rolf wenkel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mixed reactions to stability pact rewrite in the wake of sunday 's decision to loosen the rules of the stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , opposition voices in germany are crying foul .

among the countries discussed as possible new members , germany and japan were especially popular . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of those surveyed believe germany permanently belongs in the security council germany was favored in 21 nations , with an average of 56 percent across all countries . the poll of 23,518 people was conducted for the bbc world service by the international polling firm globescan together with the program on international policy attitudes at the university of maryland . " results suggest that the tight control of the united nations by a few countries may soon be history , " said globescan ’ s president doug miller .
" there is strong popular support for the democratization of the un system . " un can ’ t eat " à la carte " annan wants the major changes to be agreed at a summit of world leaders at the un headquarters in september , which will mark the body 's 60th anniversary . " in any such list of proposals , there are items which seem more important to some than to others , " he said .
" the temptation is to treat the list as an à la carte menu , and select only those that you especially fancy .
in this case , that approach will not work . " the german government felt annan had given the un ’ s reform " very powerful and new momentum " with his plans , said spokesman steg . he added that the body ’ s reform was a key issue for the german government .
" for us , the point is to strengthen the principle of multilateralism and there is only one forum worldwide that is suitable to do that : the united nations , " steg said . critics skeptical of german chances however , not everybody is as optimistic about germany 's chances of getting a permanent un seat . " it matters a lot in which way you ’ re trying to make yourself part of the equation .
i personally believe that our campaign for a permanent seat on the un security council has been a bit too brash and self-complacent at times , " said claudia nolte , foreign affairs spokeswoman for the christian democrats . " this may have turned potential supporters into opponents .
secondly , the german government should state more clearly why it thinks it deserves a permanent seat and in which way it ’ ll live up to greater responsibilities .
people here and abroad have a right to know this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sources close to the us administration believe that germany ’ s hopes for a permanent seat will be dashed by what they view as the country ’ s failure to do enough for iraq ’ s post-war reconstruction .
in addition , they say , germany might not be able to live up to its greater responsibility financially , given its economic woes at present . in fact , kofi annan himself made it clear that a country ’ s financial contributions to the world body would play no small role in deciding which new members to accept on the council .
consequently , government spokesman thomas steg said on tuesday that official development assistance had to be increased substantially in order to move closer to the aim of allocating 0.7 percent of gdp to development aid by 2015 , as laid down in the un millennium goals .
at present , germany only spends 0.29 percent of gdp for this purpose - too little to impress anyone in the world body . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany says un record a success germany 's two-year stint as a non-permanent member of the un security council ended at the end of last year .

but in doing so , the floodgates have been opened for reinterpreting the regulations meant to ensure budgetary discipline and a stable currency . let 's be honest .
rarely do sinners decide to punish themselves .
in that respect , establishing the european stability and growth pact - which germany successfully made a condition for abolishing the deutsche mark - was defective from the start , for there were and are many sinners .
countries like greece or italy would never have been allowed to join the euro club if the maastricht treaty 's convergence criteria had been applied verbatim .
france violated the treaty from 2002-2004 .
portugal did so in 2001 .
the netherlands breached it in 2003 .
greece swindled its way through every year .
and germany , the pact 's initiator , has n't kept its public debts below the ceiling of 3 percent of gdp since 2002 . if the heads of government sign the deal their finance ministers agreed to monday evening , the stability pact will remain formally valid - the 3 percent cap and the deficit limit of 60 percent of gdp annually will go untouched .
but , in reality , the pact will have degenerated into an arbitrary document .
the european commission - which is meant to police compliance to the deficit caps - will be instructed to take into account exceptional circumstances when they consider exacting disciplinary measures for deficit breaches .
thus , the german finance minister , for example , will be able to claim the costs of developing eastern germany as a special burden - and other states will follow and use their imaginations to devise new exceptional circumstances . loosening the stability pact is n't a license to make debts , says germany 's finance minister - but that 's how it will be understood in the euro zone .
the idea of the stability pact is dead .
the idea was that the maastricht treaty 's admission criteria would be made permanent to encourage budgetary discipline .
the idea was that future generations would n't be left with a mountain of debt .
the idea was to show the rest of the world that the euro zone had an elementary interest in ensuring a strong and stable euro . little remains of these ideas .

however , this impression is misleading .
the euro is currently sought-after on the currency markets only because many investors are concerned about the us twin deficit and are consequently avoiding the dollar .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 22.03.2005 long-lost bach cantata revived großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bach composed the cantata in 1728 a piece by german composer johann sebastian bach lost for decades has come to life in japan this week , shedding new light on the 18th-century baroque master . the wedding cantata bwv216 resurfaced a year ago by chance in the papers of chieko hara , the japanese pianist who died in december 2001 at the age 86 after a career spent largely in europe . bach had composed the cantata in 1728 for the wedding of a customs official 's daughter in leipzig .
the original score has never been recovered , but the version discovered in japan was believed to have been copied by one of bach 's students under his stewardship . the eight rediscovered pages consist almost uniquely of vocal pieces in german for soprano and alto , with the seven movements lasting for a total of between 20 and 25 minutes .
the instrumental parts are entirely lost except for two recycled movements , a duet and an aria which had been used elsewhere in bach 's work .
the text is an allegorical dialogue between two rivers in saxony , the pleisse and the neisse , which represent the groom and the young bride . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thankfully still here " this is my dinosaur " american musicologist joshua rifkin , a conductor and composer who is one of the leading interpreters of bach was asked to recreate the missing instrumental parts .
he said he originally wanted to let the lost cantata rest . " maybe a fragment should stay a fragment , " rifkin told afp .
" then i thought of palaeontologists , from one bone they figure the entire dinosaur .
this is my dinosaur . " at first , rifkin thought the challenge would be too difficult .
in the end , he decided to take up the project which he described as a " musical rubik 's cube " . " i could not reconstruct what bach wrote but i could give the people of today an idea of what his music was like , " rifkin said .
" it sounds like bach 's music , " he said .
" but the listener should not know which part is bach 's , which part is mine . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connection , in politics and in the arts lost for decades the cantata , which despite being yellow with age remained in good state , was authenticated by a team of experts led by bach specialist , professor tadashi isoyama of the kunitachi college of music in suburban tokyo . the copy of the cantata passed from collector to collector and had vanished for 80 years .
the only thing known for sure is that it belonged to a descendant of the german composer felix mendelssohn until the 1920s . experts believe hara likely inherited the cantata - but was oblivious to its existence - from her husband , the late spanish cellist gaspar cassado , who knew the mendelssohn family . huge impact for isoyama , the music professor , the rediscovery of the cantata is " very important " to the understanding of bach , who lived from 1685 to 1750 : " this finding has a huge impact in the music world , " isoyama said . while there were attempts to recreate the cantata in the early 20th century , isoyama said the difference this time was the involvement of rifkin with his knowledge of bach . " he reconstructed the instrumental score .
this is history making because -lrb- his -rrb- high-level score is reconstructed , truly reflecting bach 's style , " isoyama said . passionate musical audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johann sebastian bach the wedding cantata had its debut sunday in the small hall of suntory hall in tokyo , one of the world 's most prestigious venues for classical music , with two of bach 's profane cantatas bwv202 and bwv210 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.03.2005 germany welcomes annan 's call for action 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is hoping to take a permanent seat at the coveted table kofi annan 's ambitious reform plans for the united nations have met with a largely positive response in europe .
germany feels it 's inched closer to reaching its goal of a permanent seat on the un security council . calling for action , not more words , to fulfil pledges already made , un secretary general kofi annan presented his plan for overhauling the un to the general assembly on monday . if acted on , the proposals - ranging from a nine-member increase in the security council 's membership to the establishment of a new human rights council - would mark the most wide-ranging reforms since the un was founded 60 years ago . " this hall has heard enough high-sounding declarations to last us for some decades to come , " annan told the assembly .
" we know what the problems are , and we all know what we have promised to achieve .
what is needed now is not more declarations , but action to fulfil the promises already made . " germany optimistic one of the most closely-watched ideas in annan ’ s recommendations is the expansion of the security council .
" i urge member states to make the security council more broadly representative of the international community as a whole , as well as of the geographic realities of today , " the secretary general said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi annan called for strong reforms to the un though there was no explicit mention of germany , one of the aspirants to a permanent un seat , the german government on monday indicated that it welcomed annan 's clear statement . germany has fervently lobbied for a permanent seat on the council and felt " strongly reconfirmed " in its ambitions , said the berlin government ’ s deputy spokesman thomas steg .
german foreign minister joschka fischer on tuesday also welcomed annan 's sweeping reform proposals for the united nations , saying they were crucial for peace and stability in the 21st century . " it showed a healthy dose of realism , " fischer said . although security council reform has been discussed at the un for decades , the issue is so complex and politically sensitive that agreement has been impossible .
seeking to break the deadlock , annan urged realistic action . " it would be preferable for member states to take this vital decision by consensus , " said annan .
" but if they are unable to reach consensus , this must not become an excuse for postponing action . " should it come to a crucial vote , the german government assumed it would gain the necessary majority for a permanent seat , steg said . former german defense minister volker rühe , from the opposition christian democrats , said the world would need the un more than ever before in the 21st century .
for this reason , the security council could no longer have a setup dating from the aftermath of world war ii . " the current member states do not adequately reflect the 21st century , " rühe told german news agency dpa . two models for the security council a un high-level panel has outlined two possible models for increasing the security council 's membership to make it more representative and inclusive . model a would add six new members to its five permanent members , britain , china , france , russia and the united states .
the new permanent seats would , however , have no veto power .
this model also recommends an additional three new two-year terms or non-permanent seats , divided among africa , asia and the pacific , europe and the americas . model b would add a third tier of semi-permanent members to the council , with no new permanent seats , but rather a new category of eight four-year , renewable-term seats and one new two-year , non-permanent -lrb- and non-renewable -rrb- seat , divided among the major regional areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india , japan , brazil and germany formed the g4 group to lobby for a permanent council seat germany - together with japan , brazil and india - launched a joint effort for permanent seats on the council last year .
in a joint statement issued monday , the four nations welcomed annan 's report and said they would work with all member states to reach agreement on council reform based on model a. they noted that recent general assembly debates had demonstrated that " a clear majority " of states favored adding permanent and non-permanent members from both developed and developing countries . cautious reactions from washington in a telephone conversation with annan , us president george w. bush told the un chief his speech on un reforms " had some constructive ideas " and that he looked forward to working with annan on it , said white house spokesman scott mccellan . but earlier , the united states cast doubt on a council resolution that would set rules for authorizing military force .
" frankly , we 're skeptical that any kind of resolution on the use of force would be helpful , " said deputy state department spokesman adam ereli . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's un ambassador gunter pleuger thinks his country will make it into the security council the german ambassador to the un , gunter pleuger , said he was nevertheless confident that the united states would agree to un improvements .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.03.2005 berlin faces lawsuit demanding cleaner air the eu ’ s new clean air laws are not being upheld in major german cities .
citizens have now taken legal action against berlin to reduce pollutants in the air .
other german cities could have to tackle similar cases . major german cities are facing a wave of lawsuits for not giving their citizens air clean enough to breathe .
berlin could become the first city to be legally forced to introduce measures to improve air quality .
the german environmental organization deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- duh -rrb- began a planned string of legal action on monday by supporting lawsuits from three berlin citizens .
similar suits would follow in munich , stuttgart and other major cities , duh said . the charges are a result of the eu 's new clean air laws , which took effect on jan .
1 , 2005 .
these place limits on the air levels of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants , such as soot particles emitted by diesel vehicles .
german cities and municipalities have to control their air quality and take countermeasures if the toxic levels are too high . duh director jürgen resch criticized that the cities had long been aware of the planned changes and had simply disregarded the directive .
" the citizens concerned are taking legal action out of pure self-defense , " resch told journalists in berlin . banning diesel vehicles in large cities like berlin , sticking to the new limits is a challenge .
they stipulate that so-called particulate matter , the concentration of fine dust in the air , can not exceed 50 micrograms per cubic meter on more than 35 days of the year .
these pollutants have been found to cause respiratory and cardiovascular diseases . berlin has exceeded these levels by far in previous years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the more traffic that heads into cities , the higher the level of pollutants resch criticized that municipalities , state and federal governments had been inactive for years in battling these pollutants .
yet the eu directive has been known since 1999 .
he said duh supported lawsuits in order to push through measures to clean up the air , such as driving bans for diesel vehicles without particle filters . " we call on the cities to quickly take action to ban diesel vehicles without a filter from the cities and therefore contribute to a drastic reduction in the levels of fine dust in the air , " said resch . however , federal environment minister jürgen trittin said he thinks it would be more effective to tackle the problem at its source . " i think it would be better to ensure that we find a replacement for old cars and a re-fitting of diesel vehicles very quickly in order to really reduce the levels of fine dust , " said trittin . an unsuitable action plan for cleaner air the three plaintiffs in the berlin case live on the heavily-traveled frankfurter allee in the city 's friedrichshain district .
according to the federal environmental agency , this street already surpassed the maximum pollutant levels on 20 days this year .
the plaintiffs ' attorney , fabian löwenberg , said the injunction should force the municipality to take immediate measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : downtown berlin just has too much traffic , claim environmental groups " the clean air and action plan does not provide for a reduction in fine dust levels in berlin 's city center until 2008 , " said löwenberg .
" but it foregoes everything that would be suitable to reduce them immediately . " " the clean air and action plan for berlin in its current form is completely unsuitable to protect people 's health in the coming years , " he added . a toll for german cities ? according to duh , the most effective measure to reduce fine dust particles in the short-term is a driving ban , for example for cars without diesel soot filters .
resch referred to other eu countries , such as italy , that had introduced rigid measures like car-free days in order to meet the eu stipulations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london launched its controversial city toll in 2003 another possibility would be to introduce city tolls , such as those implemented in london .
the german traffic association verkehrsclub deutschland -lrb- vcd -rrb- said city tolls are a possibility to make the air in german cities cleaner . " but the municipalities have to decide for themselves if this would catch on in their city , " said vcd transport spokesman gerd lottsiepen .
" it could be more effective if there were defined areas in which dirty vehicles , that is , those without a filter , could simply not travel . " however , german retailers strongly oppose such bans .
" you ca n't oust cars out of the city centers , " said hubertus pellengahr , spokesman of the german retailers ' association hde .
" this will lead to the demise of retail stores and , subsequently , the city . " he said a lively retail industry was crucial for versatile and attractive city centers . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german drivers face dent in driving style on jan .

citizens have now taken legal action against berlin to reduce pollutants in the air .
other german cities could have to tackle similar cases . major german cities are facing a wave of lawsuits for not giving their citizens air clean enough to breathe .
berlin could become the first city to be legally forced to introduce measures to improve air quality .
the german environmental organization deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- duh -rrb- began a planned string of legal action on monday by supporting lawsuits from three berlin citizens .
similar suits would follow in munich , stuttgart and other major cities , duh said . the charges are a result of the eu 's new clean air laws , which took effect on jan .
1 , 2005 .
these place limits on the air levels of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants , such as soot particles emitted by diesel vehicles .
german cities and municipalities have to control their air quality and take countermeasures if the toxic levels are too high . duh director jürgen resch criticized that the cities had long been aware of the planned changes and had simply disregarded the directive .
" the citizens concerned are taking legal action out of pure self-defense , " resch told journalists in berlin . banning diesel vehicles in large cities like berlin , sticking to the new limits is a challenge .
they stipulate that so-called particulate matter , the concentration of fine dust in the air , can not exceed 50 micrograms per cubic meter on more than 35 days of the year .
these pollutants have been found to cause respiratory and cardiovascular diseases . berlin has exceeded these levels by far in previous years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the more traffic that heads into cities , the higher the level of pollutants resch criticized that municipalities , state and federal governments had been inactive for years in battling these pollutants .
yet the eu directive has been known since 1999 .
he said duh supported lawsuits in order to push through measures to clean up the air , such as driving bans for diesel vehicles without particle filters . " we call on the cities to quickly take action to ban diesel vehicles without a filter from the cities and therefore contribute to a drastic reduction in the levels of fine dust in the air , " said resch . however , federal environment minister jürgen trittin said he thinks it would be more effective to tackle the problem at its source .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 22.03.2005 long-lost bach cantata revived großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bach composed the cantata in 1728 a piece by german composer johann sebastian bach lost for decades has come to life in japan this week , shedding new light on the 18th-century baroque master . the wedding cantata bwv216 resurfaced a year ago by chance in the papers of chieko hara , the japanese pianist who died in december 2001 at the age 86 after a career spent largely in europe . bach had composed the cantata in 1728 for the wedding of a customs official 's daughter in leipzig .
the original score has never been recovered , but the version discovered in japan was believed to have been copied by one of bach 's students under his stewardship . the eight rediscovered pages consist almost uniquely of vocal pieces in german for soprano and alto , with the seven movements lasting for a total of between 20 and 25 minutes .
the instrumental parts are entirely lost except for two recycled movements , a duet and an aria which had been used elsewhere in bach 's work .
the text is an allegorical dialogue between two rivers in saxony , the pleisse and the neisse , which represent the groom and the young bride . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thankfully still here " this is my dinosaur " american musicologist joshua rifkin , a conductor and composer who is one of the leading interpreters of bach was asked to recreate the missing instrumental parts .
he said he originally wanted to let the lost cantata rest . " maybe a fragment should stay a fragment , " rifkin told afp .
" then i thought of palaeontologists , from one bone they figure the entire dinosaur .
this is my dinosaur . " at first , rifkin thought the challenge would be too difficult .
in the end , he decided to take up the project which he described as a " musical rubik 's cube " . " i could not reconstruct what bach wrote but i could give the people of today an idea of what his music was like , " rifkin said .
" it sounds like bach 's music , " he said .
" but the listener should not know which part is bach 's , which part is mine . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connection , in politics and in the arts lost for decades the cantata , which despite being yellow with age remained in good state , was authenticated by a team of experts led by bach specialist , professor tadashi isoyama of the kunitachi college of music in suburban tokyo . the copy of the cantata passed from collector to collector and had vanished for 80 years .
the only thing known for sure is that it belonged to a descendant of the german composer felix mendelssohn until the 1920s . experts believe hara likely inherited the cantata - but was oblivious to its existence - from her husband , the late spanish cellist gaspar cassado , who knew the mendelssohn family . huge impact for isoyama , the music professor , the rediscovery of the cantata is " very important " to the understanding of bach , who lived from 1685 to 1750 : " this finding has a huge impact in the music world , " isoyama said . while there were attempts to recreate the cantata in the early 20th century , isoyama said the difference this time was the involvement of rifkin with his knowledge of bach . " he reconstructed the instrumental score .
this is history making because -lrb- his -rrb- high-level score is reconstructed , truly reflecting bach 's style , " isoyama said . passionate musical audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johann sebastian bach the wedding cantata had its debut sunday in the small hall of suntory hall in tokyo , one of the world 's most prestigious venues for classical music , with two of bach 's profane cantatas bwv202 and bwv210 . " japan is full of bach lovers ; " said rifkin , who has been directing the ensemble bach concertino osaka in western japan for five years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.03.2005 opinion : burying the euro stability pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's strength does n't necessarily reflect confidence in it eu finance ministers have agreed to reform the rules underpinning the euro .
but in doing so , the floodgates have been opened for reinterpreting the regulations meant to ensure budgetary discipline and a stable currency . let 's be honest .
rarely do sinners decide to punish themselves .
in that respect , establishing the european stability and growth pact - which germany successfully made a condition for abolishing the deutsche mark - was defective from the start , for there were and are many sinners .
countries like greece or italy would never have been allowed to join the euro club if the maastricht treaty 's convergence criteria had been applied verbatim .
france violated the treaty from 2002-2004 .
portugal did so in 2001 .
the netherlands breached it in 2003 .
greece swindled its way through every year .
and germany , the pact 's initiator , has n't kept its public debts below the ceiling of 3 percent of gdp since 2002 . if the heads of government sign the deal their finance ministers agreed to monday evening , the stability pact will remain formally valid - the 3 percent cap and the deficit limit of 60 percent of gdp annually will go untouched .
but , in reality , the pact will have degenerated into an arbitrary document .
the european commission - which is meant to police compliance to the deficit caps - will be instructed to take into account exceptional circumstances when they consider exacting disciplinary measures for deficit breaches .
thus , the german finance minister , for example , will be able to claim the costs of developing eastern germany as a special burden - and other states will follow and use their imaginations to devise new exceptional circumstances . loosening the stability pact is n't a license to make debts , says germany 's finance minister - but that 's how it will be understood in the euro zone .
the idea of the stability pact is dead .
the idea was that the maastricht treaty 's admission criteria would be made permanent to encourage budgetary discipline .
the idea was that future generations would n't be left with a mountain of debt .
the idea was to show the rest of the world that the euro zone had an elementary interest in ensuring a strong and stable euro . little remains of these ideas .
and you do n't need much imagination to predict where political discussions will take us in the coming years , namely , examining what can be considered euro-zone admission criteria .
ca n't spending on research and education be included ?
can france bring to bear its developmental aid ?
do n't investments in infrastructure count since they 're meant to serve future generations ?
the floodgates are open for wrangling in brussels . all the same , the euro zone can point to the fact that its currency has become strong and stable - even without budgetary discipline on the part of its member countries .
however , this impression is misleading .
the euro is currently sought-after on the currency markets only because many investors are concerned about the us twin deficit and are consequently avoiding the dollar .
but they certainly are n't asking for the euro because they 're impressed by the euro zone 's budgetary discipline .
for that is surely nothing to marvel at . rolf wenkel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mixed reactions to stability pact rewrite in the wake of sunday 's decision to loosen the rules of the stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , opposition voices in germany are crying foul .
but some economists say more flexibility was needed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.03.2005 opinion : burying the euro stability pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's strength does n't necessarily reflect confidence in it eu finance ministers have agreed to reform the rules underpinning the euro .
but in doing so , the floodgates have been opened for reinterpreting the regulations meant to ensure budgetary discipline and a stable currency . let 's be honest .
rarely do sinners decide to punish themselves .
in that respect , establishing the european stability and growth pact - which germany successfully made a condition for abolishing the deutsche mark - was defective from the start , for there were and are many sinners .
countries like greece or italy would never have been allowed to join the euro club if the maastricht treaty 's convergence criteria had been applied verbatim .
france violated the treaty from 2002-2004 .
portugal did so in 2001 .
the netherlands breached it in 2003 .
greece swindled its way through every year .
and germany , the pact 's initiator , has n't kept its public debts below the ceiling of 3 percent of gdp since 2002 . if the heads of government sign the deal their finance ministers agreed to monday evening , the stability pact will remain formally valid - the 3 percent cap and the deficit limit of 60 percent of gdp annually will go untouched .
but , in reality , the pact will have degenerated into an arbitrary document .
the european commission - which is meant to police compliance to the deficit caps - will be instructed to take into account exceptional circumstances when they consider exacting disciplinary measures for deficit breaches .
thus , the german finance minister , for example , will be able to claim the costs of developing eastern germany as a special burden - and other states will follow and use their imaginations to devise new exceptional circumstances . loosening the stability pact is n't a license to make debts , says germany 's finance minister - but that 's how it will be understood in the euro zone .
the idea of the stability pact is dead .
the idea was that the maastricht treaty 's admission criteria would be made permanent to encourage budgetary discipline .
the idea was that future generations would n't be left with a mountain of debt .
the idea was to show the rest of the world that the euro zone had an elementary interest in ensuring a strong and stable euro . little remains of these ideas .
and you do n't need much imagination to predict where political discussions will take us in the coming years , namely , examining what can be considered euro-zone admission criteria .
ca n't spending on research and education be included ?
can france bring to bear its developmental aid ?
do n't investments in infrastructure count since they 're meant to serve future generations ?
the floodgates are open for wrangling in brussels . all the same , the euro zone can point to the fact that its currency has become strong and stable - even without budgetary discipline on the part of its member countries .
however , this impression is misleading .
the euro is currently sought-after on the currency markets only because many investors are concerned about the us twin deficit and are consequently avoiding the dollar .
but they certainly are n't asking for the euro because they 're impressed by the euro zone 's budgetary discipline .
for that is surely nothing to marvel at . rolf wenkel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mixed reactions to stability pact rewrite in the wake of sunday 's decision to loosen the rules of the stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , opposition voices in germany are crying foul .
but some economists say more flexibility was needed .

citizens have now taken legal action against berlin to reduce pollutants in the air .
other german cities could have to tackle similar cases . major german cities are facing a wave of lawsuits for not giving their citizens air clean enough to breathe .
berlin could become the first city to be legally forced to introduce measures to improve air quality .
the german environmental organization deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- duh -rrb- began a planned string of legal action on monday by supporting lawsuits from three berlin citizens .
similar suits would follow in munich , stuttgart and other major cities , duh said . the charges are a result of the eu 's new clean air laws , which took effect on jan .
1 , 2005 .
these place limits on the air levels of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants , such as soot particles emitted by diesel vehicles .
german cities and municipalities have to control their air quality and take countermeasures if the toxic levels are too high . duh director jürgen resch criticized that the cities had long been aware of the planned changes and had simply disregarded the directive .
" the citizens concerned are taking legal action out of pure self-defense , " resch told journalists in berlin . banning diesel vehicles in large cities like berlin , sticking to the new limits is a challenge .
they stipulate that so-called particulate matter , the concentration of fine dust in the air , can not exceed 50 micrograms per cubic meter on more than 35 days of the year .
these pollutants have been found to cause respiratory and cardiovascular diseases . berlin has exceeded these levels by far in previous years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the more traffic that heads into cities , the higher the level of pollutants resch criticized that municipalities , state and federal governments had been inactive for years in battling these pollutants .
yet the eu directive has been known since 1999 .
he said duh supported lawsuits in order to push through measures to clean up the air , such as driving bans for diesel vehicles without particle filters . " we call on the cities to quickly take action to ban diesel vehicles without a filter from the cities and therefore contribute to a drastic reduction in the levels of fine dust in the air , " said resch . however , federal environment minister jürgen trittin said he thinks it would be more effective to tackle the problem at its source . " i think it would be better to ensure that we find a replacement for old cars and a re-fitting of diesel vehicles very quickly in order to really reduce the levels of fine dust , " said trittin . an unsuitable action plan for cleaner air the three plaintiffs in the berlin case live on the heavily-traveled frankfurter allee in the city 's friedrichshain district .
according to the federal environmental agency , this street already surpassed the maximum pollutant levels on 20 days this year .
the plaintiffs ' attorney , fabian löwenberg , said the injunction should force the municipality to take immediate measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : downtown berlin just has too much traffic , claim environmental groups " the clean air and action plan does not provide for a reduction in fine dust levels in berlin 's city center until 2008 , " said löwenberg .
" but it foregoes everything that would be suitable to reduce them immediately . " " the clean air and action plan for berlin in its current form is completely unsuitable to protect people 's health in the coming years , " he added . a toll for german cities ? according to duh , the most effective measure to reduce fine dust particles in the short-term is a driving ban , for example for cars without diesel soot filters .
resch referred to other eu countries , such as italy , that had introduced rigid measures like car-free days in order to meet the eu stipulations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london launched its controversial city toll in 2003 another possibility would be to introduce city tolls , such as those implemented in london .
the german traffic association verkehrsclub deutschland -lrb- vcd -rrb- said city tolls are a possibility to make the air in german cities cleaner . " but the municipalities have to decide for themselves if this would catch on in their city , " said vcd transport spokesman gerd lottsiepen .
" it could be more effective if there were defined areas in which dirty vehicles , that is , those without a filter , could simply not travel . " however , german retailers strongly oppose such bans .
" you ca n't oust cars out of the city centers , " said hubertus pellengahr , spokesman of the german retailers ' association hde .

german cities and municipalities have to control their air quality and take countermeasures if the toxic levels are too high . duh director jürgen resch criticized that the cities had long been aware of the planned changes and had simply disregarded the directive .

he said duh supported lawsuits in order to push through measures to clean up the air , such as driving bans for diesel vehicles without particle filters . " we call on the cities to quickly take action to ban diesel vehicles without a filter from the cities and therefore contribute to a drastic reduction in the levels of fine dust in the air , " said resch . however , federal environment minister jürgen trittin said he thinks it would be more effective to tackle the problem at its source .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 22.03.2005 long-lost bach cantata revived großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bach composed the cantata in 1728 a piece by german composer johann sebastian bach lost for decades has come to life in japan this week , shedding new light on the 18th-century baroque master . the wedding cantata bwv216 resurfaced a year ago by chance in the papers of chieko hara , the japanese pianist who died in december 2001 at the age 86 after a career spent largely in europe . bach had composed the cantata in 1728 for the wedding of a customs official 's daughter in leipzig .
the original score has never been recovered , but the version discovered in japan was believed to have been copied by one of bach 's students under his stewardship . the eight rediscovered pages consist almost uniquely of vocal pieces in german for soprano and alto , with the seven movements lasting for a total of between 20 and 25 minutes .
the instrumental parts are entirely lost except for two recycled movements , a duet and an aria which had been used elsewhere in bach 's work .
the text is an allegorical dialogue between two rivers in saxony , the pleisse and the neisse , which represent the groom and the young bride . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thankfully still here " this is my dinosaur " american musicologist joshua rifkin , a conductor and composer who is one of the leading interpreters of bach was asked to recreate the missing instrumental parts .
he said he originally wanted to let the lost cantata rest . " maybe a fragment should stay a fragment , " rifkin told afp .
" then i thought of palaeontologists , from one bone they figure the entire dinosaur .
this is my dinosaur . " at first , rifkin thought the challenge would be too difficult .
in the end , he decided to take up the project which he described as a " musical rubik 's cube " . " i could not reconstruct what bach wrote but i could give the people of today an idea of what his music was like , " rifkin said .
" it sounds like bach 's music , " he said .
" but the listener should not know which part is bach 's , which part is mine . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connection , in politics and in the arts lost for decades the cantata , which despite being yellow with age remained in good state , was authenticated by a team of experts led by bach specialist , professor tadashi isoyama of the kunitachi college of music in suburban tokyo . the copy of the cantata passed from collector to collector and had vanished for 80 years .
the only thing known for sure is that it belonged to a descendant of the german composer felix mendelssohn until the 1920s . experts believe hara likely inherited the cantata - but was oblivious to its existence - from her husband , the late spanish cellist gaspar cassado , who knew the mendelssohn family . huge impact for isoyama , the music professor , the rediscovery of the cantata is " very important " to the understanding of bach , who lived from 1685 to 1750 : " this finding has a huge impact in the music world , " isoyama said . while there were attempts to recreate the cantata in the early 20th century , isoyama said the difference this time was the involvement of rifkin with his knowledge of bach . " he reconstructed the instrumental score .
this is history making because -lrb- his -rrb- high-level score is reconstructed , truly reflecting bach 's style , " isoyama said . passionate musical audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johann sebastian bach the wedding cantata had its debut sunday in the small hall of suntory hall in tokyo , one of the world 's most prestigious venues for classical music , with two of bach 's profane cantatas bwv202 and bwv210 . " japan is full of bach lovers ; " said rifkin , who has been directing the ensemble bach concertino osaka in western japan for five years .
" he is at home here . " dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de making germany music-literate again numerous studies have shown a strong correlation between music and intellectual development .

the original score has never been recovered , but the version discovered in japan was believed to have been copied by one of bach 's students under his stewardship . the eight rediscovered pages consist almost uniquely of vocal pieces in german for soprano and alto , with the seven movements lasting for a total of between 20 and 25 minutes .
the instrumental parts are entirely lost except for two recycled movements , a duet and an aria which had been used elsewhere in bach 's work .
the text is an allegorical dialogue between two rivers in saxony , the pleisse and the neisse , which represent the groom and the young bride . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thankfully still here " this is my dinosaur " american musicologist joshua rifkin , a conductor and composer who is one of the leading interpreters of bach was asked to recreate the missing instrumental parts .
he said he originally wanted to let the lost cantata rest . " maybe a fragment should stay a fragment , " rifkin told afp .
" then i thought of palaeontologists , from one bone they figure the entire dinosaur .

in the end , he decided to take up the project which he described as a " musical rubik 's cube " . " i could not reconstruct what bach wrote but i could give the people of today an idea of what his music was like , " rifkin said .

the only thing known for sure is that it belonged to a descendant of the german composer felix mendelssohn until the 1920s . experts believe hara likely inherited the cantata - but was oblivious to its existence - from her husband , the late spanish cellist gaspar cassado , who knew the mendelssohn family . huge impact for isoyama , the music professor , the rediscovery of the cantata is " very important " to the understanding of bach , who lived from 1685 to 1750 : " this finding has a huge impact in the music world , " isoyama said . while there were attempts to recreate the cantata in the early 20th century , isoyama said the difference this time was the involvement of rifkin with his knowledge of bach .

among the countries discussed as possible new members , germany and japan were especially popular . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of those surveyed believe germany permanently belongs in the security council germany was favored in 21 nations , with an average of 56 percent across all countries . the poll of 23,518 people was conducted for the bbc world service by the international polling firm globescan together with the program on international policy attitudes at the university of maryland . " results suggest that the tight control of the united nations by a few countries may soon be history , " said globescan ’ s president doug miller .
" there is strong popular support for the democratization of the un system . " un can ’ t eat " à la carte " annan wants the major changes to be agreed at a summit of world leaders at the un headquarters in september , which will mark the body 's 60th anniversary . " in any such list of proposals , there are items which seem more important to some than to others , " he said .
" the temptation is to treat the list as an à la carte menu , and select only those that you especially fancy .
in this case , that approach will not work . " the german government felt annan had given the un ’ s reform " very powerful and new momentum " with his plans , said spokesman steg . he added that the body ’ s reform was a key issue for the german government .

another issue up for debate is america 's controversial nomination of paul wolfowitz as head of the world bank . the spring economic summit beginning tuesday in brussels will likely start off with a quick approval of a reform of the eu 's stability and growth pact , which eu finance ministers agreed upon on sunday . according to luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude junker , who will chair the meeting , there will be little discussion and " certainly not any tough debate " on the loosening of the eu deficit rules , which was passed largely thanks to germany 's fierce lobbying efforts . the rules governing the euro , namely that countries should keep their deficits under three percent of gross domestic product , have not been scrapped .
however , the reform will allow the rules to be interpreted more loosely and give governments space to spend more in order to get their economies moving . starting the motor summit participants aim to focus on europe 's sclerotic economy and look at ways of revving up a motor that has been sputtering for some time now .
leaders say they hope to agree on more business-friendly measures and increased research spending to boost long-term growth . in 2000 , eu heads drew up the " lisbon agenda , " a strategy paper that has the ambitious goal of europe becoming the world 's most dynamic economy by 2010 .
the brussels meeting will take another look at that plan at its half-way mark .
the judgment wo n't likely be too positive .
already last month , the eu admitted that its underperforming economy had made the lisbon agreement 's 2010 deadline impossible to achieve . contention one divisive issue that could cloud the summit is the proposed eu services directive , introduced by former internal market commissioner frits bolkestein .
the directive , which would greatly liberalize the eu 's services market , has run into a wall of protest , both from leaders and the public . on monday , french president jacques chirac repeated his vocal critique of the directive and germany 's chancellor gerhard schröder has expressed fears that were the directive to go into effect , it would lead to wage dumping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man shows his shirt slogan as he marches , together with an estimated 50,000 protesters , during a demonstration in downtown brussels on march 19 on saturday , 50,000 people demonstrated against the plan in brussels , arguing the directive will destroy many well-paid jobs in the western part of the eu and end the traditional ways in many professions . world politics could also invade the economic roundtable as the issue of lifting the eu ban on selling arms to china is called into question again .
britain once against cast doubt on the wisdom of such a move , although abolishing the ban is supported by fellow eu heavyweights germany and france . china 's recent assertion that it would use force if taiwan - which the mainland considers a breakaway province - formally declared its independence has made it more difficult for the eu to lift the arms embargo , uk foreign secretary jack straw said . controversial nomination the nomination by us president george w. bush to head the world bank will also be discussed by european leaders .
when the us leader announced the nomination of paul wolfowitz , deputy defense secretary and major architect of the us-led war in iraq , it was met with private consternation by many in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz , president bush 's choice for world bank president however , chancellor schröder has said germany will not oppose wolfowitz 's -lrb- photo -rrb- nomination , saying he thought wolfowitz could yield positive surprises in his role as the head of the global lending institution and that berlin could work constructively with him .

another issue up for debate is america 's controversial nomination of paul wolfowitz as head of the world bank . the spring economic summit beginning tuesday in brussels will likely start off with a quick approval of a reform of the eu 's stability and growth pact , which eu finance ministers agreed upon on sunday . according to luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude junker , who will chair the meeting , there will be little discussion and " certainly not any tough debate " on the loosening of the eu deficit rules , which was passed largely thanks to germany 's fierce lobbying efforts . the rules governing the euro , namely that countries should keep their deficits under three percent of gross domestic product , have not been scrapped .
however , the reform will allow the rules to be interpreted more loosely and give governments space to spend more in order to get their economies moving . starting the motor summit participants aim to focus on europe 's sclerotic economy and look at ways of revving up a motor that has been sputtering for some time now .
leaders say they hope to agree on more business-friendly measures and increased research spending to boost long-term growth . in 2000 , eu heads drew up the " lisbon agenda , " a strategy paper that has the ambitious goal of europe becoming the world 's most dynamic economy by 2010 .
the brussels meeting will take another look at that plan at its half-way mark .
the judgment wo n't likely be too positive .

the playlists read like they were copied from the us billboard top 20 charts , the main artists , world stars like puff daddy and christina aguilera .
then a berlin rock band with a female vocalist and the modest name " wir sind helden " - we are heroes - exploded onto the scene last summer , riding to the top of the german charts and selling a stupendous 500,000 records .
suddenly , rock auf deutsch was all the rage - again .
" they opened the gate , " said hannes ross , pop music critic at stern , the magazine with the largest circulation in germany .
" all of a sudden the record companies were waiting in line , wondering , ' why do n't we have a band like that under contract ?

since then , german bands have stormed the charts .
a combination of weariness with the mainstream pop piped in from america and songs that promoters and radio programmers say are more intelligent and polished than in the past has led to a flood of media coverage - and improved sales .
german music steps up though illegal downloads and stingy german consumers still meant music sales in 2004 were down 3 percent from 2003 , the figure was a far cry from the 20 percent decrease in sales between 2002 and 2003 , according to the german office of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- .
german music " had a big part in that " turnaround , said hartmut spiesecke , spokesman for ifpi germany .

the playlists read like they were copied from the us billboard top 20 charts , the main artists , world stars like puff daddy and christina aguilera .
then a berlin rock band with a female vocalist and the modest name " wir sind helden " - we are heroes - exploded onto the scene last summer , riding to the top of the german charts and selling a stupendous 500,000 records .
suddenly , rock auf deutsch was all the rage - again .
" they opened the gate , " said hannes ross , pop music critic at stern , the magazine with the largest circulation in germany .
" all of a sudden the record companies were waiting in line , wondering , ' why do n't we have a band like that under contract ?

since then , german bands have stormed the charts .
a combination of weariness with the mainstream pop piped in from america and songs that promoters and radio programmers say are more intelligent and polished than in the past has led to a flood of media coverage - and improved sales .
german music steps up though illegal downloads and stingy german consumers still meant music sales in 2004 were down 3 percent from 2003 , the figure was a far cry from the 20 percent decrease in sales between 2002 and 2003 , according to the german office of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- .
german music " had a big part in that " turnaround , said hartmut spiesecke , spokesman for ifpi germany .

but in doing so , the floodgates have been opened for reinterpreting the regulations meant to ensure budgetary discipline and a stable currency . let 's be honest .
rarely do sinners decide to punish themselves .
in that respect , establishing the european stability and growth pact - which germany successfully made a condition for abolishing the deutsche mark - was defective from the start , for there were and are many sinners .
countries like greece or italy would never have been allowed to join the euro club if the maastricht treaty 's convergence criteria had been applied verbatim .
france violated the treaty from 2002-2004 .
portugal did so in 2001 .
the netherlands breached it in 2003 .
greece swindled its way through every year .
and germany , the pact 's initiator , has n't kept its public debts below the ceiling of 3 percent of gdp since 2002 . if the heads of government sign the deal their finance ministers agreed to monday evening , the stability pact will remain formally valid - the 3 percent cap and the deficit limit of 60 percent of gdp annually will go untouched .
but , in reality , the pact will have degenerated into an arbitrary document .
the european commission - which is meant to police compliance to the deficit caps - will be instructed to take into account exceptional circumstances when they consider exacting disciplinary measures for deficit breaches .
thus , the german finance minister , for example , will be able to claim the costs of developing eastern germany as a special burden - and other states will follow and use their imaginations to devise new exceptional circumstances . loosening the stability pact is n't a license to make debts , says germany 's finance minister - but that 's how it will be understood in the euro zone .
the idea of the stability pact is dead .
the idea was that the maastricht treaty 's admission criteria would be made permanent to encourage budgetary discipline .
the idea was that future generations would n't be left with a mountain of debt .
the idea was to show the rest of the world that the euro zone had an elementary interest in ensuring a strong and stable euro . little remains of these ideas .
and you do n't need much imagination to predict where political discussions will take us in the coming years , namely , examining what can be considered euro-zone admission criteria .

the floodgates are open for wrangling in brussels . all the same , the euro zone can point to the fact that its currency has become strong and stable - even without budgetary discipline on the part of its member countries .
however , this impression is misleading .
the euro is currently sought-after on the currency markets only because many investors are concerned about the us twin deficit and are consequently avoiding the dollar .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.03.2005 germany welcomes annan 's call for action 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is hoping to take a permanent seat at the coveted table kofi annan 's ambitious reform plans for the united nations have met with a largely positive response in europe .
germany feels it 's inched closer to reaching its goal of a permanent seat on the un security council . calling for action , not more words , to fulfil pledges already made , un secretary general kofi annan presented his plan for overhauling the un to the general assembly on monday . if acted on , the proposals - ranging from a nine-member increase in the security council 's membership to the establishment of a new human rights council - would mark the most wide-ranging reforms since the un was founded 60 years ago . " this hall has heard enough high-sounding declarations to last us for some decades to come , " annan told the assembly .
" we know what the problems are , and we all know what we have promised to achieve .
what is needed now is not more declarations , but action to fulfil the promises already made . " germany optimistic one of the most closely-watched ideas in annan ’ s recommendations is the expansion of the security council .
" i urge member states to make the security council more broadly representative of the international community as a whole , as well as of the geographic realities of today , " the secretary general said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi annan called for strong reforms to the un though there was no explicit mention of germany , one of the aspirants to a permanent un seat , the german government on monday indicated that it welcomed annan 's clear statement . germany has fervently lobbied for a permanent seat on the council and felt " strongly reconfirmed " in its ambitions , said the berlin government ’ s deputy spokesman thomas steg .
german foreign minister joschka fischer on tuesday also welcomed annan 's sweeping reform proposals for the united nations , saying they were crucial for peace and stability in the 21st century . " it showed a healthy dose of realism , " fischer said . although security council reform has been discussed at the un for decades , the issue is so complex and politically sensitive that agreement has been impossible .
seeking to break the deadlock , annan urged realistic action . " it would be preferable for member states to take this vital decision by consensus , " said annan .
" but if they are unable to reach consensus , this must not become an excuse for postponing action . " should it come to a crucial vote , the german government assumed it would gain the necessary majority for a permanent seat , steg said . former german defense minister volker rühe , from the opposition christian democrats , said the world would need the un more than ever before in the 21st century .
for this reason , the security council could no longer have a setup dating from the aftermath of world war ii . " the current member states do not adequately reflect the 21st century , " rühe told german news agency dpa . two models for the security council a un high-level panel has outlined two possible models for increasing the security council 's membership to make it more representative and inclusive . model a would add six new members to its five permanent members , britain , china , france , russia and the united states .

" germany is supporting the wish of bosnia-hercegovina to join the partnership for peace program , but there are preconditions to be met , such as the cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal " in the hague , struck told afp .
struck , who spoke after meeting his bosnian counterpart nikola radovanovic , added that surrender of some of the un tribunal 's top war crimes suspects - notably bosnian serb wartime military chief ratko mladic - would " advance to a great extent " bosnia 's chances to join the nato program .
bosnia 's application for nato 's partnership for peace program was twice rejected last year due to lack of cooperation with the un war crimes court .
bosnian serb authorities , accused of obstructing the tribunal 's work , have not arrested a single suspect since the end of bosnia 's 1992-95 war .

germany feels it 's inched closer to reaching its goal of a permanent seat on the un security council . calling for action , not more words , to fulfil pledges already made , un secretary general kofi annan presented his plan for overhauling the un to the general assembly on monday . if acted on , the proposals - ranging from a nine-member increase in the security council 's membership to the establishment of a new human rights council - would mark the most wide-ranging reforms since the un was founded 60 years ago . " this hall has heard enough high-sounding declarations to last us for some decades to come , " annan told the assembly .
" we know what the problems are , and we all know what we have promised to achieve .
what is needed now is not more declarations , but action to fulfil the promises already made . " germany optimistic one of the most closely-watched ideas in annan ’ s recommendations is the expansion of the security council .
" i urge member states to make the security council more broadly representative of the international community as a whole , as well as of the geographic realities of today , " the secretary general said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi annan called for strong reforms to the un though there was no explicit mention of germany , one of the aspirants to a permanent un seat , the german government on monday indicated that it welcomed annan 's clear statement . germany has fervently lobbied for a permanent seat on the council and felt " strongly reconfirmed " in its ambitions , said the berlin government ’ s deputy spokesman thomas steg .
german foreign minister joschka fischer on tuesday also welcomed annan 's sweeping reform proposals for the united nations , saying they were crucial for peace and stability in the 21st century . " it showed a healthy dose of realism , " fischer said . although security council reform has been discussed at the un for decades , the issue is so complex and politically sensitive that agreement has been impossible .
seeking to break the deadlock , annan urged realistic action . " it would be preferable for member states to take this vital decision by consensus , " said annan .
" but if they are unable to reach consensus , this must not become an excuse for postponing action . " should it come to a crucial vote , the german government assumed it would gain the necessary majority for a permanent seat , steg said . former german defense minister volker rühe , from the opposition christian democrats , said the world would need the un more than ever before in the 21st century .

the original score has never been recovered , but the version discovered in japan was believed to have been copied by one of bach 's students under his stewardship . the eight rediscovered pages consist almost uniquely of vocal pieces in german for soprano and alto , with the seven movements lasting for a total of between 20 and 25 minutes .
the instrumental parts are entirely lost except for two recycled movements , a duet and an aria which had been used elsewhere in bach 's work .

in the end , he decided to take up the project which he described as a " musical rubik 's cube " . " i could not reconstruct what bach wrote but i could give the people of today an idea of what his music was like , " rifkin said .

the original score has never been recovered , but the version discovered in japan was believed to have been copied by one of bach 's students under his stewardship . the eight rediscovered pages consist almost uniquely of vocal pieces in german for soprano and alto , with the seven movements lasting for a total of between 20 and 25 minutes .
the instrumental parts are entirely lost except for two recycled movements , a duet and an aria which had been used elsewhere in bach 's work .

the only thing known for sure is that it belonged to a descendant of the german composer felix mendelssohn until the 1920s . experts believe hara likely inherited the cantata - but was oblivious to its existence - from her husband , the late spanish cellist gaspar cassado , who knew the mendelssohn family . huge impact for isoyama , the music professor , the rediscovery of the cantata is " very important " to the understanding of bach , who lived from 1685 to 1750 : " this finding has a huge impact in the music world , " isoyama said . while there were attempts to recreate the cantata in the early 20th century , isoyama said the difference this time was the involvement of rifkin with his knowledge of bach .

he said he originally wanted to let the lost cantata rest . " maybe a fragment should stay a fragment , " rifkin told afp .
" then i thought of palaeontologists , from one bone they figure the entire dinosaur .
this is my dinosaur . " at first , rifkin thought the challenge would be too difficult .
in the end , he decided to take up the project which he described as a " musical rubik 's cube " . " i could not reconstruct what bach wrote but i could give the people of today an idea of what his music was like , " rifkin said .
" it sounds like bach 's music , " he said .
" but the listener should not know which part is bach 's , which part is mine . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connection , in politics and in the arts lost for decades the cantata , which despite being yellow with age remained in good state , was authenticated by a team of experts led by bach specialist , professor tadashi isoyama of the kunitachi college of music in suburban tokyo . the copy of the cantata passed from collector to collector and had vanished for 80 years .
the only thing known for sure is that it belonged to a descendant of the german composer felix mendelssohn until the 1920s . experts believe hara likely inherited the cantata - but was oblivious to its existence - from her husband , the late spanish cellist gaspar cassado , who knew the mendelssohn family . huge impact for isoyama , the music professor , the rediscovery of the cantata is " very important " to the understanding of bach , who lived from 1685 to 1750 : " this finding has a huge impact in the music world , " isoyama said . while there were attempts to recreate the cantata in the early 20th century , isoyama said the difference this time was the involvement of rifkin with his knowledge of bach . " he reconstructed the instrumental score .
this is history making because -lrb- his -rrb- high-level score is reconstructed , truly reflecting bach 's style , " isoyama said . passionate musical audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johann sebastian bach the wedding cantata had its debut sunday in the small hall of suntory hall in tokyo , one of the world 's most prestigious venues for classical music , with two of bach 's profane cantatas bwv202 and bwv210 . " japan is full of bach lovers ; " said rifkin , who has been directing the ensemble bach concertino osaka in western japan for five years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.03.2005 berlin faces lawsuit demanding cleaner air the eu ’ s new clean air laws are not being upheld in major german cities .
citizens have now taken legal action against berlin to reduce pollutants in the air .
other german cities could have to tackle similar cases . major german cities are facing a wave of lawsuits for not giving their citizens air clean enough to breathe .
berlin could become the first city to be legally forced to introduce measures to improve air quality .
the german environmental organization deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- duh -rrb- began a planned string of legal action on monday by supporting lawsuits from three berlin citizens .
similar suits would follow in munich , stuttgart and other major cities , duh said . the charges are a result of the eu 's new clean air laws , which took effect on jan .
1 , 2005 .
these place limits on the air levels of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants , such as soot particles emitted by diesel vehicles .
german cities and municipalities have to control their air quality and take countermeasures if the toxic levels are too high . duh director jürgen resch criticized that the cities had long been aware of the planned changes and had simply disregarded the directive .
" the citizens concerned are taking legal action out of pure self-defense , " resch told journalists in berlin . banning diesel vehicles in large cities like berlin , sticking to the new limits is a challenge .
they stipulate that so-called particulate matter , the concentration of fine dust in the air , can not exceed 50 micrograms per cubic meter on more than 35 days of the year .
these pollutants have been found to cause respiratory and cardiovascular diseases . berlin has exceeded these levels by far in previous years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the more traffic that heads into cities , the higher the level of pollutants resch criticized that municipalities , state and federal governments had been inactive for years in battling these pollutants .
yet the eu directive has been known since 1999 .
he said duh supported lawsuits in order to push through measures to clean up the air , such as driving bans for diesel vehicles without particle filters . " we call on the cities to quickly take action to ban diesel vehicles without a filter from the cities and therefore contribute to a drastic reduction in the levels of fine dust in the air , " said resch . however , federal environment minister jürgen trittin said he thinks it would be more effective to tackle the problem at its source . " i think it would be better to ensure that we find a replacement for old cars and a re-fitting of diesel vehicles very quickly in order to really reduce the levels of fine dust , " said trittin . an unsuitable action plan for cleaner air the three plaintiffs in the berlin case live on the heavily-traveled frankfurter allee in the city 's friedrichshain district .
according to the federal environmental agency , this street already surpassed the maximum pollutant levels on 20 days this year .
the plaintiffs ' attorney , fabian löwenberg , said the injunction should force the municipality to take immediate measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : downtown berlin just has too much traffic , claim environmental groups " the clean air and action plan does not provide for a reduction in fine dust levels in berlin 's city center until 2008 , " said löwenberg .
" but it foregoes everything that would be suitable to reduce them immediately . " " the clean air and action plan for berlin in its current form is completely unsuitable to protect people 's health in the coming years , " he added . a toll for german cities ? according to duh , the most effective measure to reduce fine dust particles in the short-term is a driving ban , for example for cars without diesel soot filters .
resch referred to other eu countries , such as italy , that had introduced rigid measures like car-free days in order to meet the eu stipulations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london launched its controversial city toll in 2003 another possibility would be to introduce city tolls , such as those implemented in london .
the german traffic association verkehrsclub deutschland -lrb- vcd -rrb- said city tolls are a possibility to make the air in german cities cleaner . " but the municipalities have to decide for themselves if this would catch on in their city , " said vcd transport spokesman gerd lottsiepen .
" it could be more effective if there were defined areas in which dirty vehicles , that is , those without a filter , could simply not travel . " however , german retailers strongly oppose such bans .

citizens have now taken legal action against berlin to reduce pollutants in the air .
other german cities could have to tackle similar cases . major german cities are facing a wave of lawsuits for not giving their citizens air clean enough to breathe .
berlin could become the first city to be legally forced to introduce measures to improve air quality .
the german environmental organization deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- duh -rrb- began a planned string of legal action on monday by supporting lawsuits from three berlin citizens .
similar suits would follow in munich , stuttgart and other major cities , duh said . the charges are a result of the eu 's new clean air laws , which took effect on jan .
1 , 2005 .
these place limits on the air levels of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants , such as soot particles emitted by diesel vehicles .
german cities and municipalities have to control their air quality and take countermeasures if the toxic levels are too high . duh director jürgen resch criticized that the cities had long been aware of the planned changes and had simply disregarded the directive .
" the citizens concerned are taking legal action out of pure self-defense , " resch told journalists in berlin . banning diesel vehicles in large cities like berlin , sticking to the new limits is a challenge .
they stipulate that so-called particulate matter , the concentration of fine dust in the air , can not exceed 50 micrograms per cubic meter on more than 35 days of the year .
these pollutants have been found to cause respiratory and cardiovascular diseases . berlin has exceeded these levels by far in previous years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the more traffic that heads into cities , the higher the level of pollutants resch criticized that municipalities , state and federal governments had been inactive for years in battling these pollutants .
yet the eu directive has been known since 1999 .
he said duh supported lawsuits in order to push through measures to clean up the air , such as driving bans for diesel vehicles without particle filters . " we call on the cities to quickly take action to ban diesel vehicles without a filter from the cities and therefore contribute to a drastic reduction in the levels of fine dust in the air , " said resch . however , federal environment minister jürgen trittin said he thinks it would be more effective to tackle the problem at its source . " i think it would be better to ensure that we find a replacement for old cars and a re-fitting of diesel vehicles very quickly in order to really reduce the levels of fine dust , " said trittin . an unsuitable action plan for cleaner air the three plaintiffs in the berlin case live on the heavily-traveled frankfurter allee in the city 's friedrichshain district .
according to the federal environmental agency , this street already surpassed the maximum pollutant levels on 20 days this year .
the plaintiffs ' attorney , fabian löwenberg , said the injunction should force the municipality to take immediate measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : downtown berlin just has too much traffic , claim environmental groups " the clean air and action plan does not provide for a reduction in fine dust levels in berlin 's city center until 2008 , " said löwenberg .
" but it foregoes everything that would be suitable to reduce them immediately . " " the clean air and action plan for berlin in its current form is completely unsuitable to protect people 's health in the coming years , " he added . a toll for german cities ? according to duh , the most effective measure to reduce fine dust particles in the short-term is a driving ban , for example for cars without diesel soot filters .
resch referred to other eu countries , such as italy , that had introduced rigid measures like car-free days in order to meet the eu stipulations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london launched its controversial city toll in 2003 another possibility would be to introduce city tolls , such as those implemented in london .
the german traffic association verkehrsclub deutschland -lrb- vcd -rrb- said city tolls are a possibility to make the air in german cities cleaner . " but the municipalities have to decide for themselves if this would catch on in their city , " said vcd transport spokesman gerd lottsiepen .

citizens have now taken legal action against berlin to reduce pollutants in the air .
other german cities could have to tackle similar cases . major german cities are facing a wave of lawsuits for not giving their citizens air clean enough to breathe .
berlin could become the first city to be legally forced to introduce measures to improve air quality .
the german environmental organization deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- duh -rrb- began a planned string of legal action on monday by supporting lawsuits from three berlin citizens .
similar suits would follow in munich , stuttgart and other major cities , duh said . the charges are a result of the eu 's new clean air laws , which took effect on jan .
1 , 2005 .
these place limits on the air levels of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants , such as soot particles emitted by diesel vehicles .
german cities and municipalities have to control their air quality and take countermeasures if the toxic levels are too high . duh director jürgen resch criticized that the cities had long been aware of the planned changes and had simply disregarded the directive .
" the citizens concerned are taking legal action out of pure self-defense , " resch told journalists in berlin . banning diesel vehicles in large cities like berlin , sticking to the new limits is a challenge .
they stipulate that so-called particulate matter , the concentration of fine dust in the air , can not exceed 50 micrograms per cubic meter on more than 35 days of the year .
these pollutants have been found to cause respiratory and cardiovascular diseases . berlin has exceeded these levels by far in previous years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the more traffic that heads into cities , the higher the level of pollutants resch criticized that municipalities , state and federal governments had been inactive for years in battling these pollutants .
yet the eu directive has been known since 1999 .
he said duh supported lawsuits in order to push through measures to clean up the air , such as driving bans for diesel vehicles without particle filters . " we call on the cities to quickly take action to ban diesel vehicles without a filter from the cities and therefore contribute to a drastic reduction in the levels of fine dust in the air , " said resch . however , federal environment minister jürgen trittin said he thinks it would be more effective to tackle the problem at its source . " i think it would be better to ensure that we find a replacement for old cars and a re-fitting of diesel vehicles very quickly in order to really reduce the levels of fine dust , " said trittin . an unsuitable action plan for cleaner air the three plaintiffs in the berlin case live on the heavily-traveled frankfurter allee in the city 's friedrichshain district .
according to the federal environmental agency , this street already surpassed the maximum pollutant levels on 20 days this year .
the plaintiffs ' attorney , fabian löwenberg , said the injunction should force the municipality to take immediate measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : downtown berlin just has too much traffic , claim environmental groups " the clean air and action plan does not provide for a reduction in fine dust levels in berlin 's city center until 2008 , " said löwenberg .

" " the clean air and action plan for berlin in its current form is completely unsuitable to protect people 's health in the coming years , " he added . a toll for german cities ? according to duh , the most effective measure to reduce fine dust particles in the short-term is a driving ban , for example for cars without diesel soot filters .

the german traffic association verkehrsclub deutschland -lrb- vcd -rrb- said city tolls are a possibility to make the air in german cities cleaner . " but the municipalities have to decide for themselves if this would catch on in their city , " said vcd transport spokesman gerd lottsiepen .
" it could be more effective if there were defined areas in which dirty vehicles , that is , those without a filter , could simply not travel . " however , german retailers strongly oppose such bans .

but in doing so , the floodgates have been opened for reinterpreting the regulations meant to ensure budgetary discipline and a stable currency . let 's be honest .
rarely do sinners decide to punish themselves .
in that respect , establishing the european stability and growth pact - which germany successfully made a condition for abolishing the deutsche mark - was defective from the start , for there were and are many sinners .
countries like greece or italy would never have been allowed to join the euro club if the maastricht treaty 's convergence criteria had been applied verbatim .
france violated the treaty from 2002-2004 .
portugal did so in 2001 .
the netherlands breached it in 2003 .
greece swindled its way through every year .
and germany , the pact 's initiator , has n't kept its public debts below the ceiling of 3 percent of gdp since 2002 . if the heads of government sign the deal their finance ministers agreed to monday evening , the stability pact will remain formally valid - the 3 percent cap and the deficit limit of 60 percent of gdp annually will go untouched .
but , in reality , the pact will have degenerated into an arbitrary document .
the european commission - which is meant to police compliance to the deficit caps - will be instructed to take into account exceptional circumstances when they consider exacting disciplinary measures for deficit breaches .
thus , the german finance minister , for example , will be able to claim the costs of developing eastern germany as a special burden - and other states will follow and use their imaginations to devise new exceptional circumstances . loosening the stability pact is n't a license to make debts , says germany 's finance minister - but that 's how it will be understood in the euro zone .
the idea of the stability pact is dead .
the idea was that the maastricht treaty 's admission criteria would be made permanent to encourage budgetary discipline .
the idea was that future generations would n't be left with a mountain of debt .
the idea was to show the rest of the world that the euro zone had an elementary interest in ensuring a strong and stable euro . little remains of these ideas .
and you do n't need much imagination to predict where political discussions will take us in the coming years , namely , examining what can be considered euro-zone admission criteria .
ca n't spending on research and education be included ?
can france bring to bear its developmental aid ?
do n't investments in infrastructure count since they 're meant to serve future generations ?
the floodgates are open for wrangling in brussels . all the same , the euro zone can point to the fact that its currency has become strong and stable - even without budgetary discipline on the part of its member countries .
however , this impression is misleading .
the euro is currently sought-after on the currency markets only because many investors are concerned about the us twin deficit and are consequently avoiding the dollar .
but they certainly are n't asking for the euro because they 're impressed by the euro zone 's budgetary discipline .
for that is surely nothing to marvel at . rolf wenkel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mixed reactions to stability pact rewrite in the wake of sunday 's decision to loosen the rules of the stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , opposition voices in germany are crying foul .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.03.2005 opinion : burying the euro stability pact großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro 's strength does n't necessarily reflect confidence in it eu finance ministers have agreed to reform the rules underpinning the euro .
but in doing so , the floodgates have been opened for reinterpreting the regulations meant to ensure budgetary discipline and a stable currency . let 's be honest .
rarely do sinners decide to punish themselves .
in that respect , establishing the european stability and growth pact - which germany successfully made a condition for abolishing the deutsche mark - was defective from the start , for there were and are many sinners .
countries like greece or italy would never have been allowed to join the euro club if the maastricht treaty 's convergence criteria had been applied verbatim .
france violated the treaty from 2002-2004 .
portugal did so in 2001 .
the netherlands breached it in 2003 .
greece swindled its way through every year .
and germany , the pact 's initiator , has n't kept its public debts below the ceiling of 3 percent of gdp since 2002 . if the heads of government sign the deal their finance ministers agreed to monday evening , the stability pact will remain formally valid - the 3 percent cap and the deficit limit of 60 percent of gdp annually will go untouched .
but , in reality , the pact will have degenerated into an arbitrary document .
the european commission - which is meant to police compliance to the deficit caps - will be instructed to take into account exceptional circumstances when they consider exacting disciplinary measures for deficit breaches .
thus , the german finance minister , for example , will be able to claim the costs of developing eastern germany as a special burden - and other states will follow and use their imaginations to devise new exceptional circumstances . loosening the stability pact is n't a license to make debts , says germany 's finance minister - but that 's how it will be understood in the euro zone .
the idea of the stability pact is dead .
the idea was that the maastricht treaty 's admission criteria would be made permanent to encourage budgetary discipline .
the idea was that future generations would n't be left with a mountain of debt .
the idea was to show the rest of the world that the euro zone had an elementary interest in ensuring a strong and stable euro . little remains of these ideas .
and you do n't need much imagination to predict where political discussions will take us in the coming years , namely , examining what can be considered euro-zone admission criteria .
ca n't spending on research and education be included ?
can france bring to bear its developmental aid ?
do n't investments in infrastructure count since they 're meant to serve future generations ?
the floodgates are open for wrangling in brussels . all the same , the euro zone can point to the fact that its currency has become strong and stable - even without budgetary discipline on the part of its member countries .
however , this impression is misleading .
the euro is currently sought-after on the currency markets only because many investors are concerned about the us twin deficit and are consequently avoiding the dollar .
but they certainly are n't asking for the euro because they 're impressed by the euro zone 's budgetary discipline .
for that is surely nothing to marvel at . rolf wenkel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mixed reactions to stability pact rewrite in the wake of sunday 's decision to loosen the rules of the stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , opposition voices in germany are crying foul .

germany feels it 's inched closer to reaching its goal of a permanent seat on the un security council . calling for action , not more words , to fulfil pledges already made , un secretary general kofi annan presented his plan for overhauling the un to the general assembly on monday . if acted on , the proposals - ranging from a nine-member increase in the security council 's membership to the establishment of a new human rights council - would mark the most wide-ranging reforms since the un was founded 60 years ago .

" we know what the problems are , and we all know what we have promised to achieve .

" it showed a healthy dose of realism , " fischer said . although security council reform has been discussed at the un for decades , the issue is so complex and politically sensitive that agreement has been impossible .

among the countries discussed as possible new members , germany and japan were especially popular . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of those surveyed believe germany permanently belongs in the security council germany was favored in 21 nations , with an average of 56 percent across all countries . the poll of 23,518 people was conducted for the bbc world service by the international polling firm globescan together with the program on international policy attitudes at the university of maryland . " results suggest that the tight control of the united nations by a few countries may soon be history , " said globescan ’ s president doug miller .
" there is strong popular support for the democratization of the un system . " un can ’ t eat " à la carte " annan wants the major changes to be agreed at a summit of world leaders at the un headquarters in september , which will mark the body 's 60th anniversary . " in any such list of proposals , there are items which seem more important to some than to others , " he said .
" the temptation is to treat the list as an à la carte menu , and select only those that you especially fancy .
in this case , that approach will not work . " the german government felt annan had given the un ’ s reform " very powerful and new momentum " with his plans , said spokesman steg . he added that the body ’ s reform was a key issue for the german government .
" for us , the point is to strengthen the principle of multilateralism and there is only one forum worldwide that is suitable to do that : the united nations , " steg said . critics skeptical of german chances however , not everybody is as optimistic about germany 's chances of getting a permanent un seat . " it matters a lot in which way you ’ re trying to make yourself part of the equation .
i personally believe that our campaign for a permanent seat on the un security council has been a bit too brash and self-complacent at times , " said claudia nolte , foreign affairs spokeswoman for the christian democrats . " this may have turned potential supporters into opponents .
secondly , the german government should state more clearly why it thinks it deserves a permanent seat and in which way it ’ ll live up to greater responsibilities .
people here and abroad have a right to know this . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sources close to the us administration believe that germany ’ s hopes for a permanent seat will be dashed by what they view as the country ’ s failure to do enough for iraq ’ s post-war reconstruction .
in addition , they say , germany might not be able to live up to its greater responsibility financially , given its economic woes at present . in fact , kofi annan himself made it clear that a country ’ s financial contributions to the world body would play no small role in deciding which new members to accept on the council .
consequently , government spokesman thomas steg said on tuesday that official development assistance had to be increased substantially in order to move closer to the aim of allocating 0.7 percent of gdp to development aid by 2015 , as laid down in the un millennium goals .
at present , germany only spends 0.29 percent of gdp for this purpose - too little to impress anyone in the world body . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany says un record a success germany 's two-year stint as a non-permanent member of the un security council ended at the end of last year .

oracle , the world 's second-largest software maker - but behind sap in business management software - agreed to pay $ 630 million -lrb- 477 million euros -rrb- , or $ 11.25 a share , for retek , which specializes in management software for retailers .
oracle chief executive larry ellison told afp that the acquisition of retek " strengthens our position in the retail applications market globally . "
retek brings to the silicon valley-based oracle a group of prestigious retail clients , including us apparel giant the gap , electronic retailer best buy and british supermarket group sainsbury .
retek provides customers in the retail industry with software to help them carry out a variety of tasks , such as managing sales and tracking financial and inventory data .
it has more than 200 customers in 20 countries .
the companies are now realizing the need to update technology to keep pace as giant retailers like wal-mart have become a huge force across the industry .
a spokesman for sap , europe 's largest software group , confirmed that the company had backed out but declined further comment .
meanwhile , the rivalry between the firms has since intensified , and oracle 's latest move could hinder sap from gaining a stronger footing in the united states , the world 's largest software market . dw-world.de oracle moves to outbid sap the bidding war for business software group retek heated up friday as oracle boosted its bid over the offer of german-based sap .

schäfer , who was arrested in argentina and then expelled to chile earlier this month after eight years on the run , was accused in a santiago court of involvement in the disappearance of photographer and leftist party leader juan maino during the repressive 1973-1990 pinochet regime .
after his arrest by pinochet 's police , maino , 27 , was taken to colonia dignidad , a mysterious sect founded by schäfer , and was never seen again .
schäfer , 83 , established the large , self-sufficient german colony in an isolated region south of santiago in 1961 after fleeing germany to escape child abuse charges .
a chilean court convicted schäfer and 22 other sect members on child abuse charges in absentia in november 2004 .
monday 's charge was the second of what could become numerous cases against schäfer in the disappearance of anti-government activists during the pinochet years .
last week he was charged in the 1974 disappearance of leftist leader alvaro vallejos villagran .
he is also expected to be questioned in the 1985 disappearance of us mathematician boris wesfeiler .
schäfer has been held in a high security prison in santiago since his expulsion from argentina on march 12 . dw-world.de former nazi pedophile nabbed in argentina german foreign minister joschka fischer on friday hailed the arrest of former nazi paul schaefer in argentina and said he hoped it would shed light on alleged child sex abuse at a shady sect he led in chile .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.03.2005 germany welcomes annan 's call for action 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is hoping to take a permanent seat at the coveted table kofi annan 's ambitious reform plans for the united nations have met with a largely positive response in europe .
germany feels it 's inched closer to reaching its goal of a permanent seat on the un security council . calling for action , not more words , to fulfil pledges already made , un secretary general kofi annan presented his plan for overhauling the un to the general assembly on monday . if acted on , the proposals - ranging from a nine-member increase in the security council 's membership to the establishment of a new human rights council - would mark the most wide-ranging reforms since the un was founded 60 years ago . " this hall has heard enough high-sounding declarations to last us for some decades to come , " annan told the assembly .
" we know what the problems are , and we all know what we have promised to achieve .
what is needed now is not more declarations , but action to fulfil the promises already made . " germany optimistic one of the most closely-watched ideas in annan ’ s recommendations is the expansion of the security council .
" i urge member states to make the security council more broadly representative of the international community as a whole , as well as of the geographic realities of today , " the secretary general said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kofi annan called for strong reforms to the un though there was no explicit mention of germany , one of the aspirants to a permanent un seat , the german government on monday indicated that it welcomed annan 's clear statement . germany has fervently lobbied for a permanent seat on the council and felt " strongly reconfirmed " in its ambitions , said the berlin government ’ s deputy spokesman thomas steg .
german foreign minister joschka fischer on tuesday also welcomed annan 's sweeping reform proposals for the united nations , saying they were crucial for peace and stability in the 21st century . " it showed a healthy dose of realism , " fischer said . although security council reform has been discussed at the un for decades , the issue is so complex and politically sensitive that agreement has been impossible .
seeking to break the deadlock , annan urged realistic action . " it would be preferable for member states to take this vital decision by consensus , " said annan .
" but if they are unable to reach consensus , this must not become an excuse for postponing action . " should it come to a crucial vote , the german government assumed it would gain the necessary majority for a permanent seat , steg said . former german defense minister volker rühe , from the opposition christian democrats , said the world would need the un more than ever before in the 21st century .
for this reason , the security council could no longer have a setup dating from the aftermath of world war ii . " the current member states do not adequately reflect the 21st century , " rühe told german news agency dpa . two models for the security council a un high-level panel has outlined two possible models for increasing the security council 's membership to make it more representative and inclusive . model a would add six new members to its five permanent members , britain , china , france , russia and the united states .
the new permanent seats would , however , have no veto power .
this model also recommends an additional three new two-year terms or non-permanent seats , divided among africa , asia and the pacific , europe and the americas . model b would add a third tier of semi-permanent members to the council , with no new permanent seats , but rather a new category of eight four-year , renewable-term seats and one new two-year , non-permanent -lrb- and non-renewable -rrb- seat , divided among the major regional areas . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india , japan , brazil and germany formed the g4 group to lobby for a permanent council seat germany - together with japan , brazil and india - launched a joint effort for permanent seats on the council last year .
in a joint statement issued monday , the four nations welcomed annan 's report and said they would work with all member states to reach agreement on council reform based on model a. they noted that recent general assembly debates had demonstrated that " a clear majority " of states favored adding permanent and non-permanent members from both developed and developing countries . cautious reactions from washington in a telephone conversation with annan , us president george w. bush told the un chief his speech on un reforms " had some constructive ideas " and that he looked forward to working with annan on it , said white house spokesman scott mccellan . but earlier , the united states cast doubt on a council resolution that would set rules for authorizing military force .
" frankly , we 're skeptical that any kind of resolution on the use of force would be helpful , " said deputy state department spokesman adam ereli . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's un ambassador gunter pleuger thinks his country will make it into the security council the german ambassador to the un , gunter pleuger , said he was nevertheless confident that the united states would agree to un improvements . " we saw in the past year that even the largest power in the world can ’ t win peace by itself , even if it won a war previously , " said pleuger .

among the countries discussed as possible new members , germany and japan were especially popular . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of those surveyed believe germany permanently belongs in the security council germany was favored in 21 nations , with an average of 56 percent across all countries . the poll of 23,518 people was conducted for the bbc world service by the international polling firm globescan together with the program on international policy attitudes at the university of maryland .

" the temptation is to treat the list as an à la carte menu , and select only those that you especially fancy .

consequently , government spokesman thomas steg said on tuesday that official development assistance had to be increased substantially in order to move closer to the aim of allocating 0.7 percent of gdp to development aid by 2015 , as laid down in the un millennium goals .

among the countries discussed as possible new members , germany and japan were especially popular . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the majority of those surveyed believe germany permanently belongs in the security council germany was favored in 21 nations , with an average of 56 percent across all countries . the poll of 23,518 people was conducted for the bbc world service by the international polling firm globescan together with the program on international policy attitudes at the university of maryland .

" the temptation is to treat the list as an à la carte menu , and select only those that you especially fancy .

consequently , government spokesman thomas steg said on tuesday that official development assistance had to be increased substantially in order to move closer to the aim of allocating 0.7 percent of gdp to development aid by 2015 , as laid down in the un millennium goals .

but in doing so , the floodgates have been opened for reinterpreting the regulations meant to ensure budgetary discipline and a stable currency . let 's be honest .
rarely do sinners decide to punish themselves .
in that respect , establishing the european stability and growth pact - which germany successfully made a condition for abolishing the deutsche mark - was defective from the start , for there were and are many sinners .
countries like greece or italy would never have been allowed to join the euro club if the maastricht treaty 's convergence criteria had been applied verbatim .
france violated the treaty from 2002-2004 .
portugal did so in 2001 .
the netherlands breached it in 2003 .
greece swindled its way through every year .
and germany , the pact 's initiator , has n't kept its public debts below the ceiling of 3 percent of gdp since 2002 . if the heads of government sign the deal their finance ministers agreed to monday evening , the stability pact will remain formally valid - the 3 percent cap and the deficit limit of 60 percent of gdp annually will go untouched .
but , in reality , the pact will have degenerated into an arbitrary document .
the european commission - which is meant to police compliance to the deficit caps - will be instructed to take into account exceptional circumstances when they consider exacting disciplinary measures for deficit breaches .
thus , the german finance minister , for example , will be able to claim the costs of developing eastern germany as a special burden - and other states will follow and use their imaginations to devise new exceptional circumstances . loosening the stability pact is n't a license to make debts , says germany 's finance minister - but that 's how it will be understood in the euro zone .
the idea of the stability pact is dead .
the idea was that the maastricht treaty 's admission criteria would be made permanent to encourage budgetary discipline .
the idea was that future generations would n't be left with a mountain of debt .
the idea was to show the rest of the world that the euro zone had an elementary interest in ensuring a strong and stable euro . little remains of these ideas .
and you do n't need much imagination to predict where political discussions will take us in the coming years , namely , examining what can be considered euro-zone admission criteria .
ca n't spending on research and education be included ?
can france bring to bear its developmental aid ?
do n't investments in infrastructure count since they 're meant to serve future generations ?
the floodgates are open for wrangling in brussels . all the same , the euro zone can point to the fact that its currency has become strong and stable - even without budgetary discipline on the part of its member countries .
however , this impression is misleading .
the euro is currently sought-after on the currency markets only because many investors are concerned about the us twin deficit and are consequently avoiding the dollar .
but they certainly are n't asking for the euro because they 're impressed by the euro zone 's budgetary discipline .
for that is surely nothing to marvel at . rolf wenkel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mixed reactions to stability pact rewrite in the wake of sunday 's decision to loosen the rules of the stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , opposition voices in germany are crying foul .

but in doing so , the floodgates have been opened for reinterpreting the regulations meant to ensure budgetary discipline and a stable currency . let 's be honest .
rarely do sinners decide to punish themselves .
in that respect , establishing the european stability and growth pact - which germany successfully made a condition for abolishing the deutsche mark - was defective from the start , for there were and are many sinners .
countries like greece or italy would never have been allowed to join the euro club if the maastricht treaty 's convergence criteria had been applied verbatim .
france violated the treaty from 2002-2004 .
portugal did so in 2001 .
the netherlands breached it in 2003 .
greece swindled its way through every year .
and germany , the pact 's initiator , has n't kept its public debts below the ceiling of 3 percent of gdp since 2002 . if the heads of government sign the deal their finance ministers agreed to monday evening , the stability pact will remain formally valid - the 3 percent cap and the deficit limit of 60 percent of gdp annually will go untouched .
but , in reality , the pact will have degenerated into an arbitrary document .
the european commission - which is meant to police compliance to the deficit caps - will be instructed to take into account exceptional circumstances when they consider exacting disciplinary measures for deficit breaches .
thus , the german finance minister , for example , will be able to claim the costs of developing eastern germany as a special burden - and other states will follow and use their imaginations to devise new exceptional circumstances . loosening the stability pact is n't a license to make debts , says germany 's finance minister - but that 's how it will be understood in the euro zone .
the idea of the stability pact is dead .
the idea was that the maastricht treaty 's admission criteria would be made permanent to encourage budgetary discipline .
the idea was that future generations would n't be left with a mountain of debt .
the idea was to show the rest of the world that the euro zone had an elementary interest in ensuring a strong and stable euro . little remains of these ideas .
and you do n't need much imagination to predict where political discussions will take us in the coming years , namely , examining what can be considered euro-zone admission criteria .

the floodgates are open for wrangling in brussels . all the same , the euro zone can point to the fact that its currency has become strong and stable - even without budgetary discipline on the part of its member countries .
however , this impression is misleading .
the euro is currently sought-after on the currency markets only because many investors are concerned about the us twin deficit and are consequently avoiding the dollar .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.03.2005 berlin faces lawsuit demanding cleaner air the eu ’ s new clean air laws are not being upheld in major german cities .
citizens have now taken legal action against berlin to reduce pollutants in the air .
other german cities could have to tackle similar cases . major german cities are facing a wave of lawsuits for not giving their citizens air clean enough to breathe .
berlin could become the first city to be legally forced to introduce measures to improve air quality .
the german environmental organization deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- duh -rrb- began a planned string of legal action on monday by supporting lawsuits from three berlin citizens .
similar suits would follow in munich , stuttgart and other major cities , duh said . the charges are a result of the eu 's new clean air laws , which took effect on jan .
1 , 2005 .
these place limits on the air levels of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants , such as soot particles emitted by diesel vehicles .
german cities and municipalities have to control their air quality and take countermeasures if the toxic levels are too high . duh director jürgen resch criticized that the cities had long been aware of the planned changes and had simply disregarded the directive .
" the citizens concerned are taking legal action out of pure self-defense , " resch told journalists in berlin . banning diesel vehicles in large cities like berlin , sticking to the new limits is a challenge .
they stipulate that so-called particulate matter , the concentration of fine dust in the air , can not exceed 50 micrograms per cubic meter on more than 35 days of the year .
these pollutants have been found to cause respiratory and cardiovascular diseases . berlin has exceeded these levels by far in previous years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the more traffic that heads into cities , the higher the level of pollutants resch criticized that municipalities , state and federal governments had been inactive for years in battling these pollutants .
yet the eu directive has been known since 1999 .
he said duh supported lawsuits in order to push through measures to clean up the air , such as driving bans for diesel vehicles without particle filters . " we call on the cities to quickly take action to ban diesel vehicles without a filter from the cities and therefore contribute to a drastic reduction in the levels of fine dust in the air , " said resch . however , federal environment minister jürgen trittin said he thinks it would be more effective to tackle the problem at its source . " i think it would be better to ensure that we find a replacement for old cars and a re-fitting of diesel vehicles very quickly in order to really reduce the levels of fine dust , " said trittin . an unsuitable action plan for cleaner air the three plaintiffs in the berlin case live on the heavily-traveled frankfurter allee in the city 's friedrichshain district .
according to the federal environmental agency , this street already surpassed the maximum pollutant levels on 20 days this year .
the plaintiffs ' attorney , fabian löwenberg , said the injunction should force the municipality to take immediate measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : downtown berlin just has too much traffic , claim environmental groups " the clean air and action plan does not provide for a reduction in fine dust levels in berlin 's city center until 2008 , " said löwenberg .
" but it foregoes everything that would be suitable to reduce them immediately . " " the clean air and action plan for berlin in its current form is completely unsuitable to protect people 's health in the coming years , " he added . a toll for german cities ? according to duh , the most effective measure to reduce fine dust particles in the short-term is a driving ban , for example for cars without diesel soot filters .
resch referred to other eu countries , such as italy , that had introduced rigid measures like car-free days in order to meet the eu stipulations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london launched its controversial city toll in 2003 another possibility would be to introduce city tolls , such as those implemented in london .
the german traffic association verkehrsclub deutschland -lrb- vcd -rrb- said city tolls are a possibility to make the air in german cities cleaner . " but the municipalities have to decide for themselves if this would catch on in their city , " said vcd transport spokesman gerd lottsiepen .
" it could be more effective if there were defined areas in which dirty vehicles , that is , those without a filter , could simply not travel . " however , german retailers strongly oppose such bans .
" you ca n't oust cars out of the city centers , " said hubertus pellengahr , spokesman of the german retailers ' association hde .

citizens have now taken legal action against berlin to reduce pollutants in the air .
other german cities could have to tackle similar cases . major german cities are facing a wave of lawsuits for not giving their citizens air clean enough to breathe .
berlin could become the first city to be legally forced to introduce measures to improve air quality .
the german environmental organization deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- duh -rrb- began a planned string of legal action on monday by supporting lawsuits from three berlin citizens .
similar suits would follow in munich , stuttgart and other major cities , duh said . the charges are a result of the eu 's new clean air laws , which took effect on jan .
1 , 2005 .
these place limits on the air levels of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants , such as soot particles emitted by diesel vehicles .
german cities and municipalities have to control their air quality and take countermeasures if the toxic levels are too high . duh director jürgen resch criticized that the cities had long been aware of the planned changes and had simply disregarded the directive .
" the citizens concerned are taking legal action out of pure self-defense , " resch told journalists in berlin . banning diesel vehicles in large cities like berlin , sticking to the new limits is a challenge .
they stipulate that so-called particulate matter , the concentration of fine dust in the air , can not exceed 50 micrograms per cubic meter on more than 35 days of the year .
these pollutants have been found to cause respiratory and cardiovascular diseases . berlin has exceeded these levels by far in previous years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the more traffic that heads into cities , the higher the level of pollutants resch criticized that municipalities , state and federal governments had been inactive for years in battling these pollutants .
yet the eu directive has been known since 1999 .
he said duh supported lawsuits in order to push through measures to clean up the air , such as driving bans for diesel vehicles without particle filters . " we call on the cities to quickly take action to ban diesel vehicles without a filter from the cities and therefore contribute to a drastic reduction in the levels of fine dust in the air , " said resch . however , federal environment minister jürgen trittin said he thinks it would be more effective to tackle the problem at its source . " i think it would be better to ensure that we find a replacement for old cars and a re-fitting of diesel vehicles very quickly in order to really reduce the levels of fine dust , " said trittin . an unsuitable action plan for cleaner air the three plaintiffs in the berlin case live on the heavily-traveled frankfurter allee in the city 's friedrichshain district .
according to the federal environmental agency , this street already surpassed the maximum pollutant levels on 20 days this year .
the plaintiffs ' attorney , fabian löwenberg , said the injunction should force the municipality to take immediate measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : downtown berlin just has too much traffic , claim environmental groups " the clean air and action plan does not provide for a reduction in fine dust levels in berlin 's city center until 2008 , " said löwenberg .
" but it foregoes everything that would be suitable to reduce them immediately . " " the clean air and action plan for berlin in its current form is completely unsuitable to protect people 's health in the coming years , " he added . a toll for german cities ? according to duh , the most effective measure to reduce fine dust particles in the short-term is a driving ban , for example for cars without diesel soot filters .
resch referred to other eu countries , such as italy , that had introduced rigid measures like car-free days in order to meet the eu stipulations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london launched its controversial city toll in 2003 another possibility would be to introduce city tolls , such as those implemented in london .
the german traffic association verkehrsclub deutschland -lrb- vcd -rrb- said city tolls are a possibility to make the air in german cities cleaner . " but the municipalities have to decide for themselves if this would catch on in their city , " said vcd transport spokesman gerd lottsiepen .
" it could be more effective if there were defined areas in which dirty vehicles , that is , those without a filter , could simply not travel . " however , german retailers strongly oppose such bans .
" you ca n't oust cars out of the city centers , " said hubertus pellengahr , spokesman of the german retailers ' association hde .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.03.2005 the neue deutsche welle rises großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wir sind helden lead singer judith holofernes german pop and rock music is suddenly making a comeback - thanks to good bands and better media coverage .
the industry has n't been this excited since a girl named nena sang about 99 red balloons more than 20 years ago . were it not for the german-speaking djs and ads , there would be nothing to distinguish german radio of the past few years with stations in britain and america .
the playlists read like they were copied from the us billboard top 20 charts , the main artists , world stars like puff daddy and christina aguilera .
then a berlin rock band with a female vocalist and the modest name " wir sind helden " - we are heroes - exploded onto the scene last summer , riding to the top of the german charts and selling a stupendous 500,000 records .
suddenly , rock auf deutsch was all the rage - again .
" they opened the gate , " said hannes ross , pop music critic at stern , the magazine with the largest circulation in germany .
" all of a sudden the record companies were waiting in line , wondering , ' why do n't we have a band like that under contract ?
we also need a german band ' ! "
since then , german bands have stormed the charts .
a combination of weariness with the mainstream pop piped in from america and songs that promoters and radio programmers say are more intelligent and polished than in the past has led to a flood of media coverage - and improved sales .
german music steps up though illegal downloads and stingy german consumers still meant music sales in 2004 were down 3 percent from 2003 , the figure was a far cry from the 20 percent decrease in sales between 2002 and 2003 , according to the german office of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- .
german music " had a big part in that " turnaround , said hartmut spiesecke , spokesman for ifpi germany .
bands like silbermond -lrb- photo -rrb- , from the eastern german town of bautzen , and juli , from the city of giessen , near frankfurt , have sold hundreds of thousands of albums .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " silbermond " from the east german town of bautzen -lrb- left to right -rrb- : thomas stolle -lrb- 20 , guitar -rrb- , stefanie kloss -lrb- 19 , vocals -rrb- , andreas nowak -lrb- 21 , drums -rrb- and johannes stolle -lrb- 21 , bass -rrb- releases by german bands made up 30.3 percent of the albums on the charts in 2004 , the highest percentage ever , said spiesecke .
singles by german artists made up more than half of the singles on the charts , the second-highest in history .
" it is really amazing , " said aditya sharma , director of programming at the berlin radio station fritz .
" what the bands have done is make people believe that the german language and pop music are compatible . "
deutsch suddenly cool again fritz 's young listeners by and large rejected german music in the past , said sharma .
the reason : music in english sounded , well , cooler .
then came wir sind helden , whose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva briegel , lead singer of the band juli which , like other popular german bands at the moment , features a female lead vocalist and a bunch of guys playing back up debut album , " die reklamation , " or " the claim , " packed lyrics about being young in an economically-downtrodden germany with an upbeat mix of guitar and electronic sound .
ross said the band " hit a nerve " among students and other young people .
alternative radio stations in germany , like sharma 's , began playing wsh 's music in 2004 .
before long , the band had cobbled together 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,300 -rrb- to produce a video that got regular airtime on mtv .
" they came from the underground , and if the lyrics are good and people connect to it , why should n't they be successful ? " said matthias reimann , whose company was the first to heavily promote wir sind helden , sending a representative to radio stations across germany with a small bundle of cds .
juli and silbermond followed with double plantinum albums of their own .
for all the hype , germany 's pop phenomenon is n't expected to jump the atlantic , as british and french pop songs sometimes have , finding success in the us .
national , but not international , success # b # " the competition -lrb- in the international pop scene -rrb- is too tough , " said reimann .
" especially the pop music that comes out of america .
it 's much more polished , and the quality is higher . "
retaining supremacy in the national music market is more likely .
the test will come in the next few months , when bands like wir sind helden and silbermond release their second albums .
but things are looking good .
industry insiders said there has n't been this much hype surrounding german pop since a teenager named nena sang about 99 red balloons in 1984 .
" the last time things were this big was the neue deutsche welle , 20 years ago , " said sharma , referring to the string of german bands that made names for themselves internationally in the mid-1980s .
" and the bands nowadays - at least their lyrics - are much better .

the industry has n't been this excited since a girl named nena sang about 99 red balloons more than 20 years ago . were it not for the german-speaking djs and ads , there would be nothing to distinguish german radio of the past few years with stations in britain and america .
the playlists read like they were copied from the us billboard top 20 charts , the main artists , world stars like puff daddy and christina aguilera .
then a berlin rock band with a female vocalist and the modest name " wir sind helden " - we are heroes - exploded onto the scene last summer , riding to the top of the german charts and selling a stupendous 500,000 records .
suddenly , rock auf deutsch was all the rage - again .
" they opened the gate , " said hannes ross , pop music critic at stern , the magazine with the largest circulation in germany .
" all of a sudden the record companies were waiting in line , wondering , ' why do n't we have a band like that under contract ?
we also need a german band ' ! "
since then , german bands have stormed the charts .
a combination of weariness with the mainstream pop piped in from america and songs that promoters and radio programmers say are more intelligent and polished than in the past has led to a flood of media coverage - and improved sales .
german music steps up though illegal downloads and stingy german consumers still meant music sales in 2004 were down 3 percent from 2003 , the figure was a far cry from the 20 percent decrease in sales between 2002 and 2003 , according to the german office of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- .
german music " had a big part in that " turnaround , said hartmut spiesecke , spokesman for ifpi germany .
bands like silbermond -lrb- photo -rrb- , from the eastern german town of bautzen , and juli , from the city of giessen , near frankfurt , have sold hundreds of thousands of albums .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " silbermond " from the east german town of bautzen -lrb- left to right -rrb- : thomas stolle -lrb- 20 , guitar -rrb- , stefanie kloss -lrb- 19 , vocals -rrb- , andreas nowak -lrb- 21 , drums -rrb- and johannes stolle -lrb- 21 , bass -rrb- releases by german bands made up 30.3 percent of the albums on the charts in 2004 , the highest percentage ever , said spiesecke .
singles by german artists made up more than half of the singles on the charts , the second-highest in history .
" it is really amazing , " said aditya sharma , director of programming at the berlin radio station fritz .
" what the bands have done is make people believe that the german language and pop music are compatible . "
deutsch suddenly cool again fritz 's young listeners by and large rejected german music in the past , said sharma .
the reason : music in english sounded , well , cooler .
then came wir sind helden , whose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva briegel , lead singer of the band juli which , like other popular german bands at the moment , features a female lead vocalist and a bunch of guys playing back up debut album , " die reklamation , " or " the claim , " packed lyrics about being young in an economically-downtrodden germany with an upbeat mix of guitar and electronic sound .
ross said the band " hit a nerve " among students and other young people .
alternative radio stations in germany , like sharma 's , began playing wsh 's music in 2004 .
before long , the band had cobbled together 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,300 -rrb- to produce a video that got regular airtime on mtv .
" they came from the underground , and if the lyrics are good and people connect to it , why should n't they be successful ? " said matthias reimann , whose company was the first to heavily promote wir sind helden , sending a representative to radio stations across germany with a small bundle of cds .
juli and silbermond followed with double plantinum albums of their own .
for all the hype , germany 's pop phenomenon is n't expected to jump the atlantic , as british and french pop songs sometimes have , finding success in the us .
national , but not international , success # b # " the competition -lrb- in the international pop scene -rrb- is too tough , " said reimann .
" especially the pop music that comes out of america .
it 's much more polished , and the quality is higher . "
retaining supremacy in the national music market is more likely .
the test will come in the next few months , when bands like wir sind helden and silbermond release their second albums .
but things are looking good .
industry insiders said there has n't been this much hype surrounding german pop since a teenager named nena sang about 99 red balloons in 1984 .
" the last time things were this big was the neue deutsche welle , 20 years ago , " said sharma , referring to the string of german bands that made names for themselves internationally in the mid-1980s .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.03.2005 berlin faces lawsuit demanding cleaner air the eu ’ s new clean air laws are not being upheld in major german cities .
citizens have now taken legal action against berlin to reduce pollutants in the air .
other german cities could have to tackle similar cases . major german cities are facing a wave of lawsuits for not giving their citizens air clean enough to breathe .
berlin could become the first city to be legally forced to introduce measures to improve air quality .
the german environmental organization deutsche umwelthilfe -lrb- duh -rrb- began a planned string of legal action on monday by supporting lawsuits from three berlin citizens .
similar suits would follow in munich , stuttgart and other major cities , duh said . the charges are a result of the eu 's new clean air laws , which took effect on jan .
1 , 2005 .
these place limits on the air levels of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants , such as soot particles emitted by diesel vehicles .
german cities and municipalities have to control their air quality and take countermeasures if the toxic levels are too high . duh director jürgen resch criticized that the cities had long been aware of the planned changes and had simply disregarded the directive .
" the citizens concerned are taking legal action out of pure self-defense , " resch told journalists in berlin . banning diesel vehicles in large cities like berlin , sticking to the new limits is a challenge .
they stipulate that so-called particulate matter , the concentration of fine dust in the air , can not exceed 50 micrograms per cubic meter on more than 35 days of the year .
these pollutants have been found to cause respiratory and cardiovascular diseases . berlin has exceeded these levels by far in previous years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the more traffic that heads into cities , the higher the level of pollutants resch criticized that municipalities , state and federal governments had been inactive for years in battling these pollutants .
yet the eu directive has been known since 1999 .
he said duh supported lawsuits in order to push through measures to clean up the air , such as driving bans for diesel vehicles without particle filters . " we call on the cities to quickly take action to ban diesel vehicles without a filter from the cities and therefore contribute to a drastic reduction in the levels of fine dust in the air , " said resch . however , federal environment minister jürgen trittin said he thinks it would be more effective to tackle the problem at its source . " i think it would be better to ensure that we find a replacement for old cars and a re-fitting of diesel vehicles very quickly in order to really reduce the levels of fine dust , " said trittin . an unsuitable action plan for cleaner air the three plaintiffs in the berlin case live on the heavily-traveled frankfurter allee in the city 's friedrichshain district .
according to the federal environmental agency , this street already surpassed the maximum pollutant levels on 20 days this year .
the plaintiffs ' attorney , fabian löwenberg , said the injunction should force the municipality to take immediate measures . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : downtown berlin just has too much traffic , claim environmental groups " the clean air and action plan does not provide for a reduction in fine dust levels in berlin 's city center until 2008 , " said löwenberg .
" but it foregoes everything that would be suitable to reduce them immediately . " " the clean air and action plan for berlin in its current form is completely unsuitable to protect people 's health in the coming years , " he added . a toll for german cities ? according to duh , the most effective measure to reduce fine dust particles in the short-term is a driving ban , for example for cars without diesel soot filters .
resch referred to other eu countries , such as italy , that had introduced rigid measures like car-free days in order to meet the eu stipulations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : london launched its controversial city toll in 2003 another possibility would be to introduce city tolls , such as those implemented in london .
the german traffic association verkehrsclub deutschland -lrb- vcd -rrb- said city tolls are a possibility to make the air in german cities cleaner . " but the municipalities have to decide for themselves if this would catch on in their city , " said vcd transport spokesman gerd lottsiepen .
" it could be more effective if there were defined areas in which dirty vehicles , that is , those without a filter , could simply not travel . " however , german retailers strongly oppose such bans .
" you ca n't oust cars out of the city centers , " said hubertus pellengahr , spokesman of the german retailers ' association hde .
" this will lead to the demise of retail stores and , subsequently , the city . " he said a lively retail industry was crucial for versatile and attractive city centers . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german drivers face dent in driving style on jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.03.2005 economy in spotlight at eu summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economic growth will be the watchword over the next two days jobs and growth will top the agenda at the two-day summit of eu leaders kicking off tuesday .
another issue up for debate is america 's controversial nomination of paul wolfowitz as head of the world bank . the spring economic summit beginning tuesday in brussels will likely start off with a quick approval of a reform of the eu 's stability and growth pact , which eu finance ministers agreed upon on sunday . according to luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude junker , who will chair the meeting , there will be little discussion and " certainly not any tough debate " on the loosening of the eu deficit rules , which was passed largely thanks to germany 's fierce lobbying efforts . the rules governing the euro , namely that countries should keep their deficits under three percent of gross domestic product , have not been scrapped .
however , the reform will allow the rules to be interpreted more loosely and give governments space to spend more in order to get their economies moving . starting the motor summit participants aim to focus on europe 's sclerotic economy and look at ways of revving up a motor that has been sputtering for some time now .
leaders say they hope to agree on more business-friendly measures and increased research spending to boost long-term growth . in 2000 , eu heads drew up the " lisbon agenda , " a strategy paper that has the ambitious goal of europe becoming the world 's most dynamic economy by 2010 .
the brussels meeting will take another look at that plan at its half-way mark .
the judgment wo n't likely be too positive .
already last month , the eu admitted that its underperforming economy had made the lisbon agreement 's 2010 deadline impossible to achieve . contention one divisive issue that could cloud the summit is the proposed eu services directive , introduced by former internal market commissioner frits bolkestein .
the directive , which would greatly liberalize the eu 's services market , has run into a wall of protest , both from leaders and the public . on monday , french president jacques chirac repeated his vocal critique of the directive and germany 's chancellor gerhard schröder has expressed fears that were the directive to go into effect , it would lead to wage dumping . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a man shows his shirt slogan as he marches , together with an estimated 50,000 protesters , during a demonstration in downtown brussels on march 19 on saturday , 50,000 people demonstrated against the plan in brussels , arguing the directive will destroy many well-paid jobs in the western part of the eu and end the traditional ways in many professions . world politics could also invade the economic roundtable as the issue of lifting the eu ban on selling arms to china is called into question again .
britain once against cast doubt on the wisdom of such a move , although abolishing the ban is supported by fellow eu heavyweights germany and france . china 's recent assertion that it would use force if taiwan - which the mainland considers a breakaway province - formally declared its independence has made it more difficult for the eu to lift the arms embargo , uk foreign secretary jack straw said . controversial nomination the nomination by us president george w. bush to head the world bank will also be discussed by european leaders .
when the us leader announced the nomination of paul wolfowitz , deputy defense secretary and major architect of the us-led war in iraq , it was met with private consternation by many in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz , president bush 's choice for world bank president however , chancellor schröder has said germany will not oppose wolfowitz 's -lrb- photo -rrb- nomination , saying he thought wolfowitz could yield positive surprises in his role as the head of the global lending institution and that berlin could work constructively with him .
the netherlands said it would have liked a wider field of candidates . it is , however , unlikely that the europeans will try to block wolfowitz , especially at a time when they are trying to heal the deep rifts with the us that formed over the iraq war .
tradition has it that the us nominates the head of the world bank and europe nominates the head of the international monetary fund . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mixed reactions to stability pact rewrite in the wake of sunday 's decision to loosen the rules of the stability and growth pact which underpins the euro , opposition voices in germany are crying foul .
but some economists say more flexibility was needed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 22.03.2005 long-lost bach cantata revived großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bach composed the cantata in 1728 a piece by german composer johann sebastian bach lost for decades has come to life in japan this week , shedding new light on the 18th-century baroque master . the wedding cantata bwv216 resurfaced a year ago by chance in the papers of chieko hara , the japanese pianist who died in december 2001 at the age 86 after a career spent largely in europe . bach had composed the cantata in 1728 for the wedding of a customs official 's daughter in leipzig .
the original score has never been recovered , but the version discovered in japan was believed to have been copied by one of bach 's students under his stewardship . the eight rediscovered pages consist almost uniquely of vocal pieces in german for soprano and alto , with the seven movements lasting for a total of between 20 and 25 minutes .
the instrumental parts are entirely lost except for two recycled movements , a duet and an aria which had been used elsewhere in bach 's work .
the text is an allegorical dialogue between two rivers in saxony , the pleisse and the neisse , which represent the groom and the young bride . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thankfully still here " this is my dinosaur " american musicologist joshua rifkin , a conductor and composer who is one of the leading interpreters of bach was asked to recreate the missing instrumental parts .
he said he originally wanted to let the lost cantata rest . " maybe a fragment should stay a fragment , " rifkin told afp .
" then i thought of palaeontologists , from one bone they figure the entire dinosaur .
this is my dinosaur . " at first , rifkin thought the challenge would be too difficult .
in the end , he decided to take up the project which he described as a " musical rubik 's cube " . " i could not reconstruct what bach wrote but i could give the people of today an idea of what his music was like , " rifkin said .
" it sounds like bach 's music , " he said .
" but the listener should not know which part is bach 's , which part is mine . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connection , in politics and in the arts lost for decades the cantata , which despite being yellow with age remained in good state , was authenticated by a team of experts led by bach specialist , professor tadashi isoyama of the kunitachi college of music in suburban tokyo . the copy of the cantata passed from collector to collector and had vanished for 80 years .
the only thing known for sure is that it belonged to a descendant of the german composer felix mendelssohn until the 1920s . experts believe hara likely inherited the cantata - but was oblivious to its existence - from her husband , the late spanish cellist gaspar cassado , who knew the mendelssohn family . huge impact for isoyama , the music professor , the rediscovery of the cantata is " very important " to the understanding of bach , who lived from 1685 to 1750 : " this finding has a huge impact in the music world , " isoyama said . while there were attempts to recreate the cantata in the early 20th century , isoyama said the difference this time was the involvement of rifkin with his knowledge of bach .

the original score has never been recovered , but the version discovered in japan was believed to have been copied by one of bach 's students under his stewardship . the eight rediscovered pages consist almost uniquely of vocal pieces in german for soprano and alto , with the seven movements lasting for a total of between 20 and 25 minutes .
the instrumental parts are entirely lost except for two recycled movements , a duet and an aria which had been used elsewhere in bach 's work .
the text is an allegorical dialogue between two rivers in saxony , the pleisse and the neisse , which represent the groom and the young bride . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thankfully still here " this is my dinosaur " american musicologist joshua rifkin , a conductor and composer who is one of the leading interpreters of bach was asked to recreate the missing instrumental parts .
he said he originally wanted to let the lost cantata rest . " maybe a fragment should stay a fragment , " rifkin told afp .
" then i thought of palaeontologists , from one bone they figure the entire dinosaur .
this is my dinosaur . " at first , rifkin thought the challenge would be too difficult .
in the end , he decided to take up the project which he described as a " musical rubik 's cube " . " i could not reconstruct what bach wrote but i could give the people of today an idea of what his music was like , " rifkin said .
" it sounds like bach 's music , " he said .
" but the listener should not know which part is bach 's , which part is mine . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connection , in politics and in the arts lost for decades the cantata , which despite being yellow with age remained in good state , was authenticated by a team of experts led by bach specialist , professor tadashi isoyama of the kunitachi college of music in suburban tokyo . the copy of the cantata passed from collector to collector and had vanished for 80 years .
the only thing known for sure is that it belonged to a descendant of the german composer felix mendelssohn until the 1920s . experts believe hara likely inherited the cantata - but was oblivious to its existence - from her husband , the late spanish cellist gaspar cassado , who knew the mendelssohn family . huge impact for isoyama , the music professor , the rediscovery of the cantata is " very important " to the understanding of bach , who lived from 1685 to 1750 : " this finding has a huge impact in the music world , " isoyama said . while there were attempts to recreate the cantata in the early 20th century , isoyama said the difference this time was the involvement of rifkin with his knowledge of bach .

" parties that make no secret of their racist , xenophobic or neo-nazi leanings should be banned , " he said . the report on racism , xenophobia and discrimination placed a special focus on extreme right parties in eastern germany , saying that it was " particularly worrying " that rightwing extremist parties such as the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- increased public support in recent state elections through racist slogans . also highlighting racist violence in russia and elsewhere , the report called on the 25 " to take account of its ethnic , cultural and religious pluralism .

" harry 's nazi gaffe sparks uproar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a copy of tabloid ' the sun ' , whose front page shows a picture of britain 's prince harry wearing a nazi soldier 's uniform to a fancy dress party .
the push to highlight racism follows increased attempts by eu member states to push for an eu-wide ban on neo-nazi symbols after prince harry of england caused an uproar when appearing at a costume party in a nazi uniform . the initiative was squashed by britain and italy because of concerns that such a ban would limit the basic right of freedom of expression .
but eu ministers did agree last month to reanimate a sleeping debate on regulating racism and xenophobia .
in this case , great britain and italy dropped up their blockade-like reaction .
among other things , the agreement would make it punishable by law to deny the holocaust or other crimes against humanity . meanwhile , the german upper house of parliament passed legislation last week in another attempt to crack down on far right parties : the initiative seeks to curb neo-nazi marches amid concerns the extreme-right will target celebrations to mark the end of the war in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : among some 6,000 sympathizers of the national party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- attended a neo-nazi meeting in the eastern german city of leipzig in 1998 .
the far right , led by the npd , is planning to march past the new holocaust memorial in berlin and to the brandenburg gate on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of germany 's capitulation .

" parties that make no secret of their racist , xenophobic or neo-nazi leanings should be banned , " he said . the report on racism , xenophobia and discrimination placed a special focus on extreme right parties in eastern germany , saying that it was " particularly worrying " that rightwing extremist parties such as the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- increased public support in recent state elections through racist slogans . also highlighting racist violence in russia and elsewhere , the report called on the 25 " to take account of its ethnic , cultural and religious pluralism . " german foreign minister joschka fischer , visiting the commission tuesday did not directly address the issue but said that " human rights violations in particular countries must be called so by name . " harry 's nazi gaffe sparks uproar bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a copy of tabloid ' the sun ' , whose front page shows a picture of britain 's prince harry wearing a nazi soldier 's uniform to a fancy dress party .
the push to highlight racism follows increased attempts by eu member states to push for an eu-wide ban on neo-nazi symbols after prince harry of england caused an uproar when appearing at a costume party in a nazi uniform . the initiative was squashed by britain and italy because of concerns that such a ban would limit the basic right of freedom of expression .
but eu ministers did agree last month to reanimate a sleeping debate on regulating racism and xenophobia .
in this case , great britain and italy dropped up their blockade-like reaction .
among other things , the agreement would make it punishable by law to deny the holocaust or other crimes against humanity . meanwhile , the german upper house of parliament passed legislation last week in another attempt to crack down on far right parties : the initiative seeks to curb neo-nazi marches amid concerns the extreme-right will target celebrations to mark the end of the war in europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : among some 6,000 sympathizers of the national party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- attended a neo-nazi meeting in the eastern german city of leipzig in 1998 .
the far right , led by the npd , is planning to march past the new holocaust memorial in berlin and to the brandenburg gate on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of germany 's capitulation .

the industry has n't been this excited since a girl named nena sang about 99 red balloons more than 20 years ago . were it not for the german-speaking djs and ads , there would be nothing to distinguish german radio of the past few years with stations in britain and america .
the playlists read like they were copied from the us billboard top 20 charts , the main artists , world stars like puff daddy and christina aguilera .
then a berlin rock band with a female vocalist and the modest name " wir sind helden " - we are heroes - exploded onto the scene last summer , riding to the top of the german charts and selling a stupendous 500,000 records .
suddenly , rock auf deutsch was all the rage - again .
" they opened the gate , " said hannes ross , pop music critic at stern , the magazine with the largest circulation in germany .
" all of a sudden the record companies were waiting in line , wondering , ' why do n't we have a band like that under contract ?
we also need a german band ' ! "
since then , german bands have stormed the charts .
a combination of weariness with the mainstream pop piped in from america and songs that promoters and radio programmers say are more intelligent and polished than in the past has led to a flood of media coverage - and improved sales .
german music steps up though illegal downloads and stingy german consumers still meant music sales in 2004 were down 3 percent from 2003 , the figure was a far cry from the 20 percent decrease in sales between 2002 and 2003 , according to the german office of the international federation of the phonographic industry -lrb- ifpi -rrb- .
german music " had a big part in that " turnaround , said hartmut spiesecke , spokesman for ifpi germany .
bands like silbermond -lrb- photo -rrb- , from the eastern german town of bautzen , and juli , from the city of giessen , near frankfurt , have sold hundreds of thousands of albums .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " silbermond " from the east german town of bautzen -lrb- left to right -rrb- : thomas stolle -lrb- 20 , guitar -rrb- , stefanie kloss -lrb- 19 , vocals -rrb- , andreas nowak -lrb- 21 , drums -rrb- and johannes stolle -lrb- 21 , bass -rrb- releases by german bands made up 30.3 percent of the albums on the charts in 2004 , the highest percentage ever , said spiesecke .
singles by german artists made up more than half of the singles on the charts , the second-highest in history .
" it is really amazing , " said aditya sharma , director of programming at the berlin radio station fritz .
" what the bands have done is make people believe that the german language and pop music are compatible . "
deutsch suddenly cool again fritz 's young listeners by and large rejected german music in the past , said sharma .
the reason : music in english sounded , well , cooler .
then came wir sind helden , whose bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eva briegel , lead singer of the band juli which , like other popular german bands at the moment , features a female lead vocalist and a bunch of guys playing back up debut album , " die reklamation , " or " the claim , " packed lyrics about being young in an economically-downtrodden germany with an upbeat mix of guitar and electronic sound .
ross said the band " hit a nerve " among students and other young people .
alternative radio stations in germany , like sharma 's , began playing wsh 's music in 2004 .
before long , the band had cobbled together 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,300 -rrb- to produce a video that got regular airtime on mtv .
" they came from the underground , and if the lyrics are good and people connect to it , why should n't they be successful ? " said matthias reimann , whose company was the first to heavily promote wir sind helden , sending a representative to radio stations across germany with a small bundle of cds .
juli and silbermond followed with double plantinum albums of their own .
for all the hype , germany 's pop phenomenon is n't expected to jump the atlantic , as british and french pop songs sometimes have , finding success in the us .
national , but not international , success # b # " the competition -lrb- in the international pop scene -rrb- is too tough , " said reimann .
" especially the pop music that comes out of america .
it 's much more polished , and the quality is higher . "
retaining supremacy in the national music market is more likely .
the test will come in the next few months , when bands like wir sind helden and silbermond release their second albums .
but things are looking good .
industry insiders said there has n't been this much hype surrounding german pop since a teenager named nena sang about 99 red balloons in 1984 .
" the last time things were this big was the neue deutsche welle , 20 years ago , " said sharma , referring to the string of german bands that made names for themselves internationally in the mid-1980s .
" and the bands nowadays - at least their lyrics - are much better .

kiera chaplin , 22 , granddaughter of iconic actor charlie , is hoping to forge a film career of her own , with the help of the title role in the first movie about lady godiva since the 1960s .
shooting for lady godiva : back in the saddle - described by co-producer dennis timothy as " a romp in the full monty tradition " - is due to start in the summer , with the picture scheduled for release in 2006 .
some of the planned filming locations include coventry 's memorial park , the city hall and warwick castle .
mr timothy is hoping the chaplin name can help propel the independent movie to the kind of international success enjoyed by the full monty .
" kiera 's a beauty and what you might call hollywood royalty , " mr timothy said .
our film wo n't be soft porn dennis timothy he told bbc news that the team behind the film , which is partly the work of warwick-based koralis pictures , had initially been in talks with us actress pamela anderson to play the role of lady godiva .
" lady godiva , as legend has it , was young .
pammy could 've been her mother , " he said .
" kiera is far nearer to lady godiva as legend has it . "
mr timothy said chaplin - who is the chairman of the company set up by her grandfather , limelight films - was also free from the type of " baggage " that accompanies anderson .
little britain star anthony head is expanding his comedy repertoire the former baywatch beauty 's turbulent private life has achieved her some notoriety .
and anybody hoping for a titillating re-enactment of lady godiva 's semi-mythical naked ride through the streets of coventry is likely to be disappointed .
" our film wo n't be soft porn , " mr timothy said .
" it 'll be a family movie with a family rating .
there 'll be nothing in the film which will offend . "
the movie , which is set in the present day , sees the fictional mayor of coventry blackmailed into converting the city 's memorial park into a site for a casino .
a local villain then brings in a tribe of wealthy native americans to develop the casino .
cannes film festival the mayor has to look after the tribe , leading to a culture clash with " hilarious consequences " , according to the website for the film .
as well as chaplin , back in the saddle will feature american oscar-nominated actress jennifer tilly , bbc two 's dead ringers impressionist jon culshaw and tv actor anthony head .
jennifer tilly was oscar-nominated for bullets over broadway the english star achieved worldwide fame in us series buffy the vampire slayer , but is now perhaps best-known in the uk for his appearances in the comedy hit-of-the-moment , little britain .
and although much of the £ 4.4m needed to make the film has already been secured , an unusual opportunity has arisen for film lovers with some spare cash .
mr timothy said that anyone who can find £ 5,000 would be guaranteed a role as an extra in the film and be given the chance to attend the premiere to " schmooze " with the stars .
he said he hoped the picture could be launched at next year 's cannes film festival , but added that his ambitions for the movie were really quite straightforward .
" what we 'd like is three generations of the same family to leave the cinema laughing at different parts of the same film . "

kiera chaplin , 22 , granddaughter of iconic actor charlie , is hoping to forge a film career of her own , with the help of the title role in the first movie about lady godiva since the 1960s .
shooting for lady godiva : back in the saddle - described by co-producer dennis timothy as " a romp in the full monty tradition " - is due to start in the summer , with the picture scheduled for release in 2006 .
some of the planned filming locations include coventry 's memorial park , the city hall and warwick castle .
mr timothy is hoping the chaplin name can help propel the independent movie to the kind of international success enjoyed by the full monty .
" kiera 's a beauty and what you might call hollywood royalty , " mr timothy said .
our film wo n't be soft porn dennis timothy he told bbc news that the team behind the film , which is partly the work of warwick-based koralis pictures , had initially been in talks with us actress pamela anderson to play the role of lady godiva .
" lady godiva , as legend has it , was young .
pammy could 've been her mother , " he said .
" kiera is far nearer to lady godiva as legend has it . "
mr timothy said chaplin - who is the chairman of the company set up by her grandfather , limelight films - was also free from the type of " baggage " that accompanies anderson .
little britain star anthony head is expanding his comedy repertoire the former baywatch beauty 's turbulent private life has achieved her some notoriety .
and anybody hoping for a titillating re-enactment of lady godiva 's semi-mythical naked ride through the streets of coventry is likely to be disappointed .
" our film wo n't be soft porn , " mr timothy said .
" it 'll be a family movie with a family rating .
there 'll be nothing in the film which will offend . "
the movie , which is set in the present day , sees the fictional mayor of coventry blackmailed into converting the city 's memorial park into a site for a casino .
a local villain then brings in a tribe of wealthy native americans to develop the casino .
cannes film festival the mayor has to look after the tribe , leading to a culture clash with " hilarious consequences " , according to the website for the film .
as well as chaplin , back in the saddle will feature american oscar-nominated actress jennifer tilly , bbc two 's dead ringers impressionist jon culshaw and tv actor anthony head .
jennifer tilly was oscar-nominated for bullets over broadway the english star achieved worldwide fame in us series buffy the vampire slayer , but is now perhaps best-known in the uk for his appearances in the comedy hit-of-the-moment , little britain .
and although much of the £ 4.4m needed to make the film has already been secured , an unusual opportunity has arisen for film lovers with some spare cash .
mr timothy said that anyone who can find £ 5,000 would be guaranteed a role as an extra in the film and be given the chance to attend the premiere to " schmooze " with the stars .
he said he hoped the picture could be launched at next year 's cannes film festival , but added that his ambitions for the movie were really quite straightforward .
" what we 'd like is three generations of the same family to leave the cinema laughing at different parts of the same film . "

shooting for lady godiva : back in the saddle - described by co-producer dennis timothy as " a romp in the full monty tradition " - is due to start in the summer , with the picture scheduled for release in 2006 .
some of the planned filming locations include coventry 's memorial park , the city hall and warwick castle .
mr timothy is hoping the chaplin name can help propel the independent movie to the kind of international success enjoyed by the full monty .
" kiera 's a beauty and what you might call hollywood royalty , " mr timothy said .
our film wo n't be soft porn dennis timothy he told bbc news that the team behind the film , which is partly the work of warwick-based koralis pictures , had initially been in talks with us actress pamela anderson to play the role of lady godiva .
" lady godiva , as legend has it , was young .
pammy could 've been her mother , " he said .
" kiera is far nearer to lady godiva as legend has it . "
mr timothy said chaplin - who is the chairman of the company set up by her grandfather , limelight films - was also free from the type of " baggage " that accompanies anderson .
little britain star anthony head is expanding his comedy repertoire the former baywatch beauty 's turbulent private life has achieved her some notoriety .
and anybody hoping for a titillating re-enactment of lady godiva 's semi-mythical naked ride through the streets of coventry is likely to be disappointed .
" our film wo n't be soft porn , " mr timothy said .
" it 'll be a family movie with a family rating .
there 'll be nothing in the film which will offend . "
the movie , which is set in the present day , sees the fictional mayor of coventry blackmailed into converting the city 's memorial park into a site for a casino .
a local villain then brings in a tribe of wealthy native americans to develop the casino .
cannes film festival the mayor has to look after the tribe , leading to a culture clash with " hilarious consequences " , according to the website for the film .
as well as chaplin , back in the saddle will feature american oscar-nominated actress jennifer tilly , bbc two 's dead ringers impressionist jon culshaw and tv actor anthony head .
jennifer tilly was oscar-nominated for bullets over broadway the english star achieved worldwide fame in us series buffy the vampire slayer , but is now perhaps best-known in the uk for his appearances in the comedy hit-of-the-moment , little britain .
and although much of the £ 4.4m needed to make the film has already been secured , an unusual opportunity has arisen for film lovers with some spare cash .
mr timothy said that anyone who can find £ 5,000 would be guaranteed a role as an extra in the film and be given the chance to attend the premiere to " schmooze " with the stars .
he said he hoped the picture could be launched at next year 's cannes film festival , but added that his ambitions for the movie were really quite straightforward .
" what we 'd like is three generations of the same family to leave the cinema laughing at different parts of the same film . "

wales had the highest density of beach litter recorded in the marine conservation society 's beachwatch initiative .
the society has been monitoring beaches for 14 years .
it said litter had more than doubled in uk in the past decade .
it is campaigning for new laws to control the growth in beach pollution , particularly discarded plastic .
the two-day beachwatch survey was carried out by volunteers in september 2004 at 27 unidentified beaches in wales .
in all , 269 beaches and 135km of uk coastline were cleaned and surveyed .
an international study was also carried out in 100 countries .

they can also be swallowed by marine animals like whales and turtles , causing them to starve .
" there is the problem of plastic bags and balloons which have been ingested by leatherback turtles off cardigan bay when mistaken for jelly fish , " said ms bell .
the society has called on the uk government to introduce new laws placing a tax on plastic bags and limiting the release of balloons .
a spokeswoman for the welsh assembly said : " we are disappointed that this survey shows a litter problem on our welsh beaches , particularly because we have such superb bathing water quality results and this is a huge attraction for tourists .

the strategic rail authority said the firm beat stiff competition to continue operating the intercity east coast mainline service .
there are fears of job cuts and fare rises as , at £ 100m a year , gner will pay up to five times as much as it currently does to run the service .
gner says the standard of its trains will remain the same .
rmt leader bob crow has warned that firms paying the government to run services could lead to " service cuts and massive fare rises " .
the line carries more than 15 million passengers a year and generates revenues of about £ 400m .
' paid too much ' gner competed with virgin , danish rail company dsb and uk transport firm firstgroup to win the contract .
gner , which has operated the east coast route since 1996 , will run the service for seven years .
if performance targets are met , the contract is likely to be extended to 10 years .
while most train firms receive money from the government to subsidise services , gner pays cash to run the contract .
some rival bidders are wondering whether the firm had paid too much , the bbc transport correspondent tom symonds said .
at present , gner pays £ 22m a year to the treasury to run the line but this is expected to rise to as much as £ 100m a year .
policy change at one point it looked as if a 20-year franchise would be awarded on the east coast route .
but a change in policy meant that in april 2003 , gner only got a two-year extension to its original seven-year franchise .
from 1 may 2005 , the franchise will run for either seven or 10 years .
meanwhile , the government has announced a £ 370m plan to help more disabled people use trains .
improvements include the provision of lifts and ramps , accessible customer information and more station staff .

there are fears of job cuts and fare rises as , at £ 100m a year , gner will pay up to five times as much as it currently does to run the service .
gner says the standard of its trains will remain the same .
rmt leader bob crow has warned that firms paying the government to run services could lead to " service cuts and massive fare rises " .
the line carries more than 15 million passengers a year and generates revenues of about £ 400m .
' paid too much ' gner competed with virgin , danish rail company dsb and uk transport firm firstgroup to win the contract .
gner , which has operated the east coast route since 1996 , will run the service for seven years .
if performance targets are met , the contract is likely to be extended to 10 years .
while most train firms receive money from the government to subsidise services , gner pays cash to run the contract .
some rival bidders are wondering whether the firm had paid too much , the bbc transport correspondent tom symonds said .
at present , gner pays £ 22m a year to the treasury to run the line but this is expected to rise to as much as £ 100m a year .
policy change at one point it looked as if a 20-year franchise would be awarded on the east coast route .
but a change in policy meant that in april 2003 , gner only got a two-year extension to its original seven-year franchise .
from 1 may 2005 , the franchise will run for either seven or 10 years .
meanwhile , the government has announced a £ 370m plan to help more disabled people use trains .
improvements include the provision of lifts and ramps , accessible customer information and more station staff .

the strategic rail authority said the firm beat stiff competition to continue operating the intercity east coast mainline service .
there are fears of job cuts and fare rises as , at £ 100m a year , gner will pay up to five times as much as it currently does to run the service .
gner says the standard of its trains will remain the same .
rmt leader bob crow has warned that firms paying the government to run services could lead to " service cuts and massive fare rises " .
the line carries more than 15 million passengers a year and generates revenues of about £ 400m .
' paid too much ' gner competed with virgin , danish rail company dsb and uk transport firm firstgroup to win the contract .
gner , which has operated the east coast route since 1996 , will run the service for seven years .
if performance targets are met , the contract is likely to be extended to 10 years .
while most train firms receive money from the government to subsidise services , gner pays cash to run the contract .
some rival bidders are wondering whether the firm had paid too much , the bbc transport correspondent tom symonds said .
at present , gner pays £ 22m a year to the treasury to run the line but this is expected to rise to as much as £ 100m a year .
policy change at one point it looked as if a 20-year franchise would be awarded on the east coast route .
but a change in policy meant that in april 2003 , gner only got a two-year extension to its original seven-year franchise .
from 1 may 2005 , the franchise will run for either seven or 10 years .
meanwhile , the government has announced a £ 370m plan to help more disabled people use trains .

the board will vote on whether to introduce the measures on tuesday .
former board member fred cobain 's comments follow a vote " under protest " by the south eastern education board to cut £ 13m over two years .
" i think when you look at this issue about education cuts , this community needs to stand up for itself , " he said .
" when you look where the cuts are directed , they are clearly directed at special needs and those children who are from socially and economically deprived backgrounds . "
on monday , the south eastern education and library board voted through a package of measures to save millions of pounds .
they include major cutbacks in services to special needs children as well as cuts in transport , classroom assistants and support for teachers .
the board already has to repay the government more than £ 5.5m it overspent in the last financial year .
members said they would vote the £ 13m of cuts through , but only under duress .
some wanted to reject them entirely .
we are concerned that they will have an adverse impact on the education of children jackie fitzsimons , seelb executive the cuts include halving the number of hours of home tuition for sick children to save £ 200,000 .
the toy and book library will close saving £ 155,000 , while extra charges will bring in more money for music lessons and school meals .
some board members wanted to reject the cuts and accused education minister barry gardiner of not caring about northern ireland education .
however , the department of education had threatened to take control of finance if the board had not voted through the savings .
unions are threatening to take strike action over the decision .
patrick mulholland of the trade union , nipsa , said : " what appears today breaches health and safety law .
" it puts lives of children at risk and the document states that .
it is an attack on special needs children .
the seelb 's chief executive , jackie fitzsimons , said members were " very saddened " that after many years of building up services they were " forced to dismantle " them .
budget preparation " we are concerned that they will have an adverse impact on the education of children , " he said .
" we are obviously trying to do things differently and make efficiencies , but the cuts are so large it will impact directly on children .
last week , the north eastern education and library board voted to push through cuts to school services " under severe duress " , as it faces a £ 6m shortfall in money from the department next year .
earlier this month , it was revealed that all five cash-strapped education and library boards had been given more time to prepare their budgets .
they said millions of pounds of cuts would be needed to stay in the black .
