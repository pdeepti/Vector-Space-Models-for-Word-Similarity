read more to find out what it means . wto members aim to complete a final deal at the end of 2006 in order to start wide ranging trade reforms in 2008 that would reduce trade barriers and boost the economies of poor countries . the following are the key areas of the statement agreed upon sunday in hong kong . farm trade governments accepted the elimination of all forms of export subsidies by the end of 2013 .
such payments are seen as skewing farm trade , creating unfair competition for poor countries .
a " substantial " part of the cuts are meant to be underway by around 2010 .
that was seen as a compromise between the european union , which pushed for a later date , and australia , brazil and the united states , which wanted a 2010 cut-off .
in exchange , the eu won a commitment that food aid , which brussels says is misused by washington to offload the us farm surplus , and monopoly firms that sell grain and dairy products from australia , canada and new zealand will be examined to ensure they do not distort trade . cotton bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cotton is a hot topic a key product of west african countries , cotton from the world 's poorest nations will be allowed to enter markets in the industrialized world duty- and quota-free from 2008 .
however , this measure is seen as insufficient by african cotton-producing countries , which have the united states in their sights and note that washington 's import duties are under 2 percent .
the real problem , they say , is the $ 4 billion in subsidies paid to us cotton growers , which allow the american cotton sector to drive down world prices .
while the accord said cotton export subsidies offered by rich countries should be eliminated next year , it did not fix a date for removing the domestic subsidies that make up most of the payouts .
it simply said they should be cut " more ambitiously " than subsidies on other farm goods . development industrialized countries , and developing countries " declaring themselves in a position to do so , " promised to give " at least 97 percent " of goods from the world 's least developed countries access to their markets from 2008 . industrial goods this area logged the least progress .
in exchange for farm trade concessions , rich nations wanted developing countries to give them more market access for manufactured goods .
but the deal simply said that customs duties will be reduced to maximum levels which are yet to be set out . services negotiations on liberalizing trade in this area , which includes banking , insurance and tourism , will aim at " promoting economic growth of all trading partners and the development of developing and least-developed countries , " the deal said .
rich countries are pressing poor nations for more trade concessions .
the statement said that new market-opening requests should be made by the end of february and that governments must draw up their final plans on services by the end of october . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wto ministers adopt compromise trade accord trade ministers adopted a compromise text sunday to clear the way to a global trade deal in 2006 , agreeing to cut farm trade export subsidies and providing special breaks for the poorest nations .

since sunday she had been in safety at the german embassy in baghdad , and she was in good health , he said . the kidnappers had said they would also release her driver , he added .
german news service dpa said monday that the driver had been released , citing a foreign ministry spokesman .
steinmeier said that in the name of the german government , he wished to thank everyone who had contributed to osthoff 's release .
he took the opportunity to point out that hostages are still being held by kidnappers in iraq .
osthoff " not maltreated " during 24-day ordeal steinmeier did not disclose the identity of the kidnappers , with whom german officials had reportedly established contact last week , but said that the hostage had apparently not been maltreated during her 24-day ordeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier in berlin on sunday " she is in the safe care of the german embassy in baghdad , " he said .

however , while relief floods through germany at the news of osthoff 's safe release , questions have already begun to arise over how her release was secured . chancellor angela merkel said at the start of the crisis that the german government would not be " blackmailed " by the kidnappers , but did not give a clear answer when asked if germany would be prepared to pay a ransom . security experts say germany has paid ransoms for hostages in the past and would probably do so for osthoff . questions likely over whether ransom was paid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumors persisted that a ransom was paid for the release of the tourists in algeria in 2003 in 2003 , a group of european tourists including nine germans were held in algeria by the islamic militant group for preaching and combat -lrb- gspc -rrb- , an organization allegedly affiliated to al qaeda . it was alleged that the german government paid a ransom to free the hostages , a claim that gained strength when the foreign office asked the german contingent to contribute some 2,300 euros -lrb- $ 2,680 -rrb- each to the cost of their rescue - an operation believed to have cost around 20 million euros -lrb- $ 23 million -rrb- .

read more to find out what it means . wto members aim to complete a final deal at the end of 2006 in order to start wide ranging trade reforms in 2008 that would reduce trade barriers and boost the economies of poor countries . the following are the key areas of the statement agreed upon sunday in hong kong . farm trade governments accepted the elimination of all forms of export subsidies by the end of 2013 .
such payments are seen as skewing farm trade , creating unfair competition for poor countries .
a " substantial " part of the cuts are meant to be underway by around 2010 .
that was seen as a compromise between the european union , which pushed for a later date , and australia , brazil and the united states , which wanted a 2010 cut-off .
in exchange , the eu won a commitment that food aid , which brussels says is misused by washington to offload the us farm surplus , and monopoly firms that sell grain and dairy products from australia , canada and new zealand will be examined to ensure they do not distort trade . cotton bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cotton is a hot topic a key product of west african countries , cotton from the world 's poorest nations will be allowed to enter markets in the industrialized world duty- and quota-free from 2008 .
however , this measure is seen as insufficient by african cotton-producing countries , which have the united states in their sights and note that washington 's import duties are under 2 percent .
the real problem , they say , is the $ 4 billion in subsidies paid to us cotton growers , which allow the american cotton sector to drive down world prices .
while the accord said cotton export subsidies offered by rich countries should be eliminated next year , it did not fix a date for removing the domestic subsidies that make up most of the payouts .
it simply said they should be cut " more ambitiously " than subsidies on other farm goods . development industrialized countries , and developing countries " declaring themselves in a position to do so , " promised to give " at least 97 percent " of goods from the world 's least developed countries access to their markets from 2008 . industrial goods this area logged the least progress .
in exchange for farm trade concessions , rich nations wanted developing countries to give them more market access for manufactured goods .
but the deal simply said that customs duties will be reduced to maximum levels which are yet to be set out . services negotiations on liberalizing trade in this area , which includes banking , insurance and tourism , will aim at " promoting economic growth of all trading partners and the development of developing and least-developed countries , " the deal said .
rich countries are pressing poor nations for more trade concessions .
the statement said that new market-opening requests should be made by the end of february and that governments must draw up their final plans on services by the end of october . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wto ministers adopt compromise trade accord trade ministers adopted a compromise text sunday to clear the way to a global trade deal in 2006 , agreeing to cut farm trade export subsidies and providing special breaks for the poorest nations .

well , it could well be the future if the boffins at german technology giant siemens get their way . the electronics company has announced that is only about two years away from changing the way that disposable packaging carries its advertising and information forever .
conventional labels may well go the same way as the packaging that carries them by ending up in the dustbin of history if siemens make good on their promise to have digital , wafer-thin flat screens flashing and blinking graphics at customers from all manner of products by 2008 . flashi n g displays a n d i n formatio n o n packagi n g the display technology , which is composed of a polymer-based photochromic material , will allow companies to display moving adverts , nutritional information and special offers on their product ranges . to achieve that spell-binding flashing effect which is designed to lure consumers to the product , the screens receive an on-off electrical charge from minute batteries which stimulate an electrochemical reaction .
this prompts the digital text and images to appear and disappear . " when kids see flashing pictures on cereal boxes we do n't expect them to just ask for the product , but to say , ' i want it , " ' said axel gerlt , an engineer on the siemens project , in an interview with wired magazine . the prototypes , which will eventually be among first phase of screens to be attached to packaging , currently resemble a calculator screen and have a monochromatic display .

the chemical reaction that produces the crude pictures at the moment is to slow to support video . " video could happen , but that is not what this technology is about for now , " gerlt told wired . some scientists are not so enthusiastic or optimistic .

fan projects say fears are exaggerated . a brawl between some 100 german and polish hooligans last month raised fears that this was just a warm-up before next summer 's world cup match that pits the neighboring countries against each other in dortmund . the june 14 game is still a long way off , but germany 's central location in europe has already started causing headaches for german authorities and organizers .
true soccer fans have already started doing their part to make sure that germany 2006 does not go down in history as a violence-filled attraction for seedy elements - unlike france 1998 where german hooligans almost beat a french policeman to death and english supporters ran wild in marseille . this week , fan project heads from 12 nations , including england and the netherlands whose fans have a notorious reputation for violent tendencies , completed a five-day workshop in hamburg with security and world cup officials . a positive experience is possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup organizers do n't want pictures like these , during euro 2000 , to appear again " we 're convinced if we welcome people in germany like guests and look after the needs of fans , then you create a much more secure atmosphere , " michael gabriel of germany 's kos fan project told reuters . the proof can be found in the past gabriel said . " we had good experiences in england 1996 and portugal 2004 -lrb- european championships -rrb- , when a positive atmosphere for the whole event was generated .
we 're telling the police not to be worried . " gabriel 's english counterpart and workshop attendee , kevin miles , said the conditions for a successful world cup with little violence do exist .
he insisted , however , that an alcohol ban at public viewing venues should not even be considered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most soccer fans just want to have fun " most fans are against violence , " the spokesman for football supporters ' federation -lrb- fsf -rrb- said .
" most fans think that having no ticket and drinking large amounts are fine -lrb- but -rrb- i think that public viewing is a risk , and it needs policing , but it 's positive . " the most significant measure is banning orders , to prevent the worst english hooligans from even setting foot on the continent .
" banning orders serve to relax the foreign police , " miles said . fan embassies there when trouble brews there 's no way to eliminate all potential before millions of fans get together ; too much alcohol lowers inhibitions and pickpockets thrive in such environments .
hence , groups such as kos in germany , the fsf in england and euro support from the netherlands , plan to set up fan embassies to take action when the inevitable fight breaks out , possessions are stolen or police make arrests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans looking for tickets could pose problems at the world cup 2006 at euro 2004 in portugal , euro support acted as intermediaries when a group of dutch supporters had their belongings stolen . " when something nasty happens , we make the point that this does n't reflect on all the people of a country , " said martijn pelle .
" we 're intermediaries and we show that people are doing their best .
we can play a role . "
cheap accommodations lacking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british police check for troublemakers before fans fly to matches abroad the embassies are also there to inform fans in four languages about places to eat and drink , entertainment on offer and how to find cheap accommodation .
an inexpensive place to sleep is a big concern for many visitors from abroad . " my hotel room costs 65 euros -lrb- $ 78 -rrb- now .
during the world cup it will cost 270 , " said miles . true to the world cup motto " a time to make friends , " an event management company has established a web site to help willing hosts and seeking guests get together and make a deal for a stay during the world cup .
it may not ease the situation for cash-strapped fans , but it 's a contribution to making the world 's largest sporting event less stressful for everyone involved . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bobbies draw world cup duty in berlin in the past , british plainclothes police have accompanied english soccer events abroad .

" we are tipping the balance in the wto back in favor of the developing countries , " said wto director general pascal lamy after the agreement was finally approved after six grueling days of negotiations .
" you have put the round back on track , you have given it a sense of urgency , " lamy said , referring to the doha round of trade negotiations launched in 2001 and due to be completed by the end of 2006 .

" today , europe has gone further on its existing commitment by setting a clear date , 2013 , for the elimination of export subsidies , " mandelson said .
" we have demanded and received equivalent movement from the other countries .
while the outcome of hong kong is not a great success , this move of ours is enough to save it from failure . " the united states also welcomed the text , saying it had come to hong kong to build a solid platform to move forward global trade liberalization and that this had been achieved . brazilian foreign minister celso amorim said the group of 20 major developing countries also accepted the compromise .
" that keeps a certain degree of credibility " in the wto negotiations , he said .

in exchange , the eu won a commitment that food aid , which brussels says is misused by washington to offload the us farm surplus , and monopoly firms that sell grain and dairy products from australia , canada and new zealand will be examined to ensure they do not distort trade . cotton bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cotton is a hot topic a key product of west african countries , cotton from the world 's poorest nations will be allowed to enter markets in the industrialized world duty- and quota-free from 2008 .
however , this measure is seen as insufficient by african cotton-producing countries , which have the united states in their sights and note that washington 's import duties are under 2 percent .
the real problem , they say , is the $ 4 billion in subsidies paid to us cotton growers , which allow the american cotton sector to drive down world prices .
while the accord said cotton export subsidies offered by rich countries should be eliminated next year , it did not fix a date for removing the domestic subsidies that make up most of the payouts .
it simply said they should be cut " more ambitiously " than subsidies on other farm goods . development industrialized countries , and developing countries " declaring themselves in a position to do so , " promised to give " at least 97 percent " of goods from the world 's least developed countries access to their markets from 2008 . industrial goods this area logged the least progress .
in exchange for farm trade concessions , rich nations wanted developing countries to give them more market access for manufactured goods .
but the deal simply said that customs duties will be reduced to maximum levels which are yet to be set out . services negotiations on liberalizing trade in this area , which includes banking , insurance and tourism , will aim at " promoting economic growth of all trading partners and the development of developing and least-developed countries , " the deal said .
rich countries are pressing poor nations for more trade concessions .
the statement said that new market-opening requests should be made by the end of february and that governments must draw up their final plans on services by the end of october . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wto ministers adopt compromise trade accord trade ministers adopted a compromise text sunday to clear the way to a global trade deal in 2006 , agreeing to cut farm trade export subsidies and providing special breaks for the poorest nations .

her driver , shalid al-shimani , was also released according to a statement monday . frank-walter steinmeier confirmed in an evening press conference that susanne osthoff had been freed .
since sunday she had been in safety at the german embassy in baghdad , and she was in good health , he said . the kidnappers had said they would also release her driver , he added .
german news service dpa said monday that the driver had been released , citing a foreign ministry spokesman .
steinmeier said that in the name of the german government , he wished to thank everyone who had contributed to osthoff 's release .
he took the opportunity to point out that hostages are still being held by kidnappers in iraq .
osthoff " not maltreated " during 24-day ordeal steinmeier did not disclose the identity of the kidnappers , with whom german officials had reportedly established contact last week , but said that the hostage had apparently not been maltreated during her 24-day ordeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier in berlin on sunday " she is in the safe care of the german embassy in baghdad , " he said .

however , while relief floods through germany at the news of osthoff 's safe release , questions have already begun to arise over how her release was secured . chancellor angela merkel said at the start of the crisis that the german government would not be " blackmailed " by the kidnappers , but did not give a clear answer when asked if germany would be prepared to pay a ransom . security experts say germany has paid ransoms for hostages in the past and would probably do so for osthoff . questions likely over whether ransom was paid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumors persisted that a ransom was paid for the release of the tourists in algeria in 2003 in 2003 , a group of european tourists including nine germans were held in algeria by the islamic militant group for preaching and combat -lrb- gspc -rrb- , an organization allegedly affiliated to al qaeda . it was alleged that the german government paid a ransom to free the hostages , a claim that gained strength when the foreign office asked the german contingent to contribute some 2,300 euros -lrb- $ 2,680 -rrb- each to the cost of their rescue - an operation believed to have cost around 20 million euros -lrb- $ 23 million -rrb- .

her driver , shalid al-shimani , was also released according to a statement monday . frank-walter steinmeier confirmed in an evening press conference that susanne osthoff had been freed .
since sunday she had been in safety at the german embassy in baghdad , and she was in good health , he said . the kidnappers had said they would also release her driver , he added .
german news service dpa said monday that the driver had been released , citing a foreign ministry spokesman .
steinmeier said that in the name of the german government , he wished to thank everyone who had contributed to osthoff 's release .
he took the opportunity to point out that hostages are still being held by kidnappers in iraq .
osthoff " not maltreated " during 24-day ordeal steinmeier did not disclose the identity of the kidnappers , with whom german officials had reportedly established contact last week , but said that the hostage had apparently not been maltreated during her 24-day ordeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier in berlin on sunday " she is in the safe care of the german embassy in baghdad , " he said .
" i my first conversation with her i 've learned that she is also in good health . "
the foreign minister refused to respond to further questions about osthoff 's release . " not tonight , " he told journalists .
previously , her brother , robert osthoff had announced her release in an interview with german news channel n-tv .
osthoff 's family had been informed earlier by germany 's criminal police office .
" my sister is safe and free again and we feel relieved of a great burden , " he said .
" it has been almost unbearable to have to live through such a terrible time . " osthoff , 43 , a convert to islam who has lived in iraq for 10 years , was seized along with her driver on nov .
25 in the nineveh region of north-western iraq .
a video released by her kidnappers to german television purportedly showed her and the driver blindfolded and surrounded by armed men .
they threatened to kill her unless germany stopped training iraqi police . german 's driver also released , diplomats claim it was also announced on monday that shalid al-shimani , susanne osthoff 's driver , was no longer in the hands of his kidnappers , according to reports attributed to german diplomats . details concerning the release of both osthoff and al-shimani have not yet been made public , nor is it known whether any ransom was paid .
however , while relief floods through germany at the news of osthoff 's safe release , questions have already begun to arise over how her release was secured . chancellor angela merkel said at the start of the crisis that the german government would not be " blackmailed " by the kidnappers , but did not give a clear answer when asked if germany would be prepared to pay a ransom . security experts say germany has paid ransoms for hostages in the past and would probably do so for osthoff . questions likely over whether ransom was paid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumors persisted that a ransom was paid for the release of the tourists in algeria in 2003 in 2003 , a group of european tourists including nine germans were held in algeria by the islamic militant group for preaching and combat -lrb- gspc -rrb- , an organization allegedly affiliated to al qaeda . it was alleged that the german government paid a ransom to free the hostages , a claim that gained strength when the foreign office asked the german contingent to contribute some 2,300 euros -lrb- $ 2,680 -rrb- each to the cost of their rescue - an operation believed to have cost around 20 million euros -lrb- $ 23 million -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 18.12.2005 true fans prepare for a peaceful german world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fan project heads met to nip world cup violence in the bud " a time to make friends " is the motto of the world cup in germany .
organizers and police are concerned that some will come to do the opposite - make enemies .
fan projects say fears are exaggerated . a brawl between some 100 german and polish hooligans last month raised fears that this was just a warm-up before next summer 's world cup match that pits the neighboring countries against each other in dortmund . the june 14 game is still a long way off , but germany 's central location in europe has already started causing headaches for german authorities and organizers .
true soccer fans have already started doing their part to make sure that germany 2006 does not go down in history as a violence-filled attraction for seedy elements - unlike france 1998 where german hooligans almost beat a french policeman to death and english supporters ran wild in marseille . this week , fan project heads from 12 nations , including england and the netherlands whose fans have a notorious reputation for violent tendencies , completed a five-day workshop in hamburg with security and world cup officials . a positive experience is possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup organizers do n't want pictures like these , during euro 2000 , to appear again " we 're convinced if we welcome people in germany like guests and look after the needs of fans , then you create a much more secure atmosphere , " michael gabriel of germany 's kos fan project told reuters . the proof can be found in the past gabriel said . " we had good experiences in england 1996 and portugal 2004 -lrb- european championships -rrb- , when a positive atmosphere for the whole event was generated .
we 're telling the police not to be worried . " gabriel 's english counterpart and workshop attendee , kevin miles , said the conditions for a successful world cup with little violence do exist .
he insisted , however , that an alcohol ban at public viewing venues should not even be considered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most soccer fans just want to have fun " most fans are against violence , " the spokesman for football supporters ' federation -lrb- fsf -rrb- said .
" most fans think that having no ticket and drinking large amounts are fine -lrb- but -rrb- i think that public viewing is a risk , and it needs policing , but it 's positive . " the most significant measure is banning orders , to prevent the worst english hooligans from even setting foot on the continent .
" banning orders serve to relax the foreign police , " miles said . fan embassies there when trouble brews there 's no way to eliminate all potential before millions of fans get together ; too much alcohol lowers inhibitions and pickpockets thrive in such environments .
hence , groups such as kos in germany , the fsf in england and euro support from the netherlands , plan to set up fan embassies to take action when the inevitable fight breaks out , possessions are stolen or police make arrests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans looking for tickets could pose problems at the world cup 2006 at euro 2004 in portugal , euro support acted as intermediaries when a group of dutch supporters had their belongings stolen . " when something nasty happens , we make the point that this does n't reflect on all the people of a country , " said martijn pelle .
" we 're intermediaries and we show that people are doing their best .
we can play a role . "
cheap accommodations lacking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british police check for troublemakers before fans fly to matches abroad the embassies are also there to inform fans in four languages about places to eat and drink , entertainment on offer and how to find cheap accommodation .
an inexpensive place to sleep is a big concern for many visitors from abroad . " my hotel room costs 65 euros -lrb- $ 78 -rrb- now .
during the world cup it will cost 270 , " said miles . true to the world cup motto " a time to make friends , " an event management company has established a web site to help willing hosts and seeking guests get together and make a deal for a stay during the world cup .
it may not ease the situation for cash-strapped fans , but it 's a contribution to making the world 's largest sporting event less stressful for everyone involved . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bobbies draw world cup duty in berlin in the past , british plainclothes police have accompanied english soccer events abroad .

" we are tipping the balance in the wto back in favor of the developing countries , " said wto director general pascal lamy after the agreement was finally approved after six grueling days of negotiations .
" you have put the round back on track , you have given it a sense of urgency , " lamy said , referring to the doha round of trade negotiations launched in 2001 and due to be completed by the end of 2006 .
europe gives way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lamy -lrb- l . -rrb- can breathe a sigh of relief eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said the text was " acceptable " after other countries had accepted the eu compromise on the date .
" today , europe has gone further on its existing commitment by setting a clear date , 2013 , for the elimination of export subsidies , " mandelson said .
" we have demanded and received equivalent movement from the other countries .
while the outcome of hong kong is not a great success , this move of ours is enough to save it from failure . " the united states also welcomed the text , saying it had come to hong kong to build a solid platform to move forward global trade liberalization and that this had been achieved . brazilian foreign minister celso amorim said the group of 20 major developing countries also accepted the compromise .
" that keeps a certain degree of credibility " in the wto negotiations , he said .
" as coordinator of the g20 i am very happy to see those elements . "
anti-poverty groups angry however anti-poverty campaigners were not so pleased . " this is not a deal , it 's a fraud , " the head of actionaid 's trade justice campaign aftab alam khan told afp .
oxfam 's trade campaign chief phil bloomer said rich countries had conceded minimal access to their agricultural markets while opening up the sensitive industrial and services sectors of developing nations .
" this is a profoundly disappointing text and a betrayal of development promises , " bloomer said . agreeing on a date to scrap the subsidies , which critics say prevent farmers in poor countries from competing effectively on world markets , had been one of the trickiest issues at the six-day meeting . the document is intended to guide ministers in further negotiations , with the goal of approving a final trade liberalization deal and completing the current round of negotiations by the end of 2006 .
violent protests as officials talked , the harbor-side conference center was totally sealed off , with police out in force to prevent more rowdy anti-wto protests after clashes on saturday in which nearly 100 people were hurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of protesters fought police on saturday in the most violent demonstrations since the talks started police used tear gas , fire hoses and pepper spray saturday to hold back hundreds of demonstrators led by militant korean farmers , some of whom were armed with bamboo sticks and metal bars .
the violent scenes saturday were highly unusual for hong kong where marches by hundreds of thousands of pro-democracy protesters in recent years have passed off without a single incident . on the divisive issue of cotton , the wto text said all developed country export subsidies would end in 2006 while the poorest producers would get duty-free and quota-free market access once an overall accord was agreed .
crucially , no date was given for an end to these domestic subsidies . african cotton producers have been pressing rich countries - and the united states in particular - to eliminate their domestic subsidies , which they say depress world prices and keep them mired in poverty , by jan .

read more to find out what it means . wto members aim to complete a final deal at the end of 2006 in order to start wide ranging trade reforms in 2008 that would reduce trade barriers and boost the economies of poor countries . the following are the key areas of the statement agreed upon sunday in hong kong . farm trade governments accepted the elimination of all forms of export subsidies by the end of 2013 .
such payments are seen as skewing farm trade , creating unfair competition for poor countries .
a " substantial " part of the cuts are meant to be underway by around 2010 .
that was seen as a compromise between the european union , which pushed for a later date , and australia , brazil and the united states , which wanted a 2010 cut-off .
in exchange , the eu won a commitment that food aid , which brussels says is misused by washington to offload the us farm surplus , and monopoly firms that sell grain and dairy products from australia , canada and new zealand will be examined to ensure they do not distort trade . cotton bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cotton is a hot topic a key product of west african countries , cotton from the world 's poorest nations will be allowed to enter markets in the industrialized world duty- and quota-free from 2008 .

but when somebody starts questioning his past , he simply says : fine , i 'll take my big bucks elsewhere . otto beisheim probably owns more retail stores , department stores , and businesses than he could remember off the top of his head .
which is really not that bad for somebody whose parents were too poor to send him to a high school . son of an estate manager , beisheim was born in 1924 .
as a young man , he was trained in the leather industry , but he quickly realized that that profits in retailing electronics would be much higher .
in 1964 , he became independent and , following a trip to the united states , founded the first german cash-and-carry market , proving himself to be a brilliant organizer and financial expert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top-notch beisheim center -lrb- right -rrb- , next to sony center in berlin from then on , his professional life became an ongoing saga of mergers and acquisitions , market conquests and clever marketing campaigns .
as founder and stake holder in metro ag group , beisheim employs some 250,000 people in more than 2,400 cities in 30 countries . it would be practically impossible to find a german who has n't shopped in kaufhof department stores , extra and real supermarkets or the mediamarkt electronics chain . beware of germans carrying gifts beisheim 's wealth has been estimated to $ 3.4 billion -lrb- 2.9 billion euros -rrb- .
having invested 500 million euros in a 70 meter tall beisheim tower on berlin 's exclusive potstamer platz - part of a complex including two five-star hotels and the most expensive apartment building in all of germany - beisheim also became the largest private investor in the german capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beisheim does n't like to look back : he 'd rather bring grocery shopping into the 21st century if he has a weakness , it is having buildings named after him .
his hefty donations in the educational sector have landed him honorary titles , seminar and colloquia series , as well as an otto beisheim school of management . but his decision to award 10 million euros to tagernsee high school in return for having his name on a golden plaque ended in a fiasco and public scandal , after some of the teachers questioned the moral aspects of such a gift . beisheim is believed to have been a member of hitler 's ss fighting unit during the war .
he refuses not only to talk about that period of his life , but also to allow anybody - especially those who 'd benefit from his wealth - to question his past .
after the tagernsee school asked for a proof of his innocence in november 2005 , beisheim revoked his generous offer and decided to take his money elsewhere . students and parents then organized demonstrations in which they carried around posters with cheesy slogans in support of " dear grandpa beisheim , " but that did n't change his mind .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 18.12.2005 true fans prepare for a peaceful german world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fan project heads met to nip world cup violence in the bud " a time to make friends " is the motto of the world cup in germany .
organizers and police are concerned that some will come to do the opposite - make enemies .
fan projects say fears are exaggerated . a brawl between some 100 german and polish hooligans last month raised fears that this was just a warm-up before next summer 's world cup match that pits the neighboring countries against each other in dortmund . the june 14 game is still a long way off , but germany 's central location in europe has already started causing headaches for german authorities and organizers .
true soccer fans have already started doing their part to make sure that germany 2006 does not go down in history as a violence-filled attraction for seedy elements - unlike france 1998 where german hooligans almost beat a french policeman to death and english supporters ran wild in marseille . this week , fan project heads from 12 nations , including england and the netherlands whose fans have a notorious reputation for violent tendencies , completed a five-day workshop in hamburg with security and world cup officials . a positive experience is possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup organizers do n't want pictures like these , during euro 2000 , to appear again " we 're convinced if we welcome people in germany like guests and look after the needs of fans , then you create a much more secure atmosphere , " michael gabriel of germany 's kos fan project told reuters . the proof can be found in the past gabriel said . " we had good experiences in england 1996 and portugal 2004 -lrb- european championships -rrb- , when a positive atmosphere for the whole event was generated .
we 're telling the police not to be worried . " gabriel 's english counterpart and workshop attendee , kevin miles , said the conditions for a successful world cup with little violence do exist .
he insisted , however , that an alcohol ban at public viewing venues should not even be considered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most soccer fans just want to have fun " most fans are against violence , " the spokesman for football supporters ' federation -lrb- fsf -rrb- said .
" most fans think that having no ticket and drinking large amounts are fine -lrb- but -rrb- i think that public viewing is a risk , and it needs policing , but it 's positive . " the most significant measure is banning orders , to prevent the worst english hooligans from even setting foot on the continent .
" banning orders serve to relax the foreign police , " miles said . fan embassies there when trouble brews there 's no way to eliminate all potential before millions of fans get together ; too much alcohol lowers inhibitions and pickpockets thrive in such environments .
hence , groups such as kos in germany , the fsf in england and euro support from the netherlands , plan to set up fan embassies to take action when the inevitable fight breaks out , possessions are stolen or police make arrests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans looking for tickets could pose problems at the world cup 2006 at euro 2004 in portugal , euro support acted as intermediaries when a group of dutch supporters had their belongings stolen . " when something nasty happens , we make the point that this does n't reflect on all the people of a country , " said martijn pelle .
" we 're intermediaries and we show that people are doing their best .
we can play a role . "
cheap accommodations lacking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british police check for troublemakers before fans fly to matches abroad the embassies are also there to inform fans in four languages about places to eat and drink , entertainment on offer and how to find cheap accommodation .

" we are tipping the balance in the wto back in favor of the developing countries , " said wto director general pascal lamy after the agreement was finally approved after six grueling days of negotiations .
" you have put the round back on track , you have given it a sense of urgency , " lamy said , referring to the doha round of trade negotiations launched in 2001 and due to be completed by the end of 2006 .
europe gives way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lamy -lrb- l . -rrb- can breathe a sigh of relief eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said the text was " acceptable " after other countries had accepted the eu compromise on the date .
" today , europe has gone further on its existing commitment by setting a clear date , 2013 , for the elimination of export subsidies , " mandelson said .
" we have demanded and received equivalent movement from the other countries .
while the outcome of hong kong is not a great success , this move of ours is enough to save it from failure . " the united states also welcomed the text , saying it had come to hong kong to build a solid platform to move forward global trade liberalization and that this had been achieved . brazilian foreign minister celso amorim said the group of 20 major developing countries also accepted the compromise .
" that keeps a certain degree of credibility " in the wto negotiations , he said .
" as coordinator of the g20 i am very happy to see those elements . "
anti-poverty groups angry however anti-poverty campaigners were not so pleased . " this is not a deal , it 's a fraud , " the head of actionaid 's trade justice campaign aftab alam khan told afp .
oxfam 's trade campaign chief phil bloomer said rich countries had conceded minimal access to their agricultural markets while opening up the sensitive industrial and services sectors of developing nations .
" this is a profoundly disappointing text and a betrayal of development promises , " bloomer said . agreeing on a date to scrap the subsidies , which critics say prevent farmers in poor countries from competing effectively on world markets , had been one of the trickiest issues at the six-day meeting . the document is intended to guide ministers in further negotiations , with the goal of approving a final trade liberalization deal and completing the current round of negotiations by the end of 2006 .
violent protests as officials talked , the harbor-side conference center was totally sealed off , with police out in force to prevent more rowdy anti-wto protests after clashes on saturday in which nearly 100 people were hurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of protesters fought police on saturday in the most violent demonstrations since the talks started police used tear gas , fire hoses and pepper spray saturday to hold back hundreds of demonstrators led by militant korean farmers , some of whom were armed with bamboo sticks and metal bars .
the violent scenes saturday were highly unusual for hong kong where marches by hundreds of thousands of pro-democracy protesters in recent years have passed off without a single incident . on the divisive issue of cotton , the wto text said all developed country export subsidies would end in 2006 while the poorest producers would get duty-free and quota-free market access once an overall accord was agreed .
crucially , no date was given for an end to these domestic subsidies . african cotton producers have been pressing rich countries - and the united states in particular - to eliminate their domestic subsidies , which they say depress world prices and keep them mired in poverty , by jan .
1 . on trade in industrial goods and services , where the developed world wanted progress in exchange for removing its farm trade export subsidies , the document sketched out a formula for cutting tariffs but left it to be finalized . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says wto talks going backwards global trade talks are going in the wrong direction , the european union warned friday , as it continued to exchange barbs with the united states amid fears that the wto meeting could unravel .

but instead of the unthreatening image of a happy nuclear family of mum , dad and 2.4 kids sharing a nutritious breakfast on the back of your cereal package , there 's a flashing electronic display telling you how eating your bowl of bran can give you the world 's most efficient digestive system . sounds like a breakfast scene from a science fiction movie or maybe the worst nightmare of the hung-over ?
well , it could well be the future if the boffins at german technology giant siemens get their way . the electronics company has announced that is only about two years away from changing the way that disposable packaging carries its advertising and information forever .
conventional labels may well go the same way as the packaging that carries them by ending up in the dustbin of history if siemens make good on their promise to have digital , wafer-thin flat screens flashing and blinking graphics at customers from all manner of products by 2008 . flashi n g displays a n d i n formatio n o n packagi n g the display technology , which is composed of a polymer-based photochromic material , will allow companies to display moving adverts , nutritional information and special offers on their product ranges . to achieve that spell-binding flashing effect which is designed to lure consumers to the product , the screens receive an on-off electrical charge from minute batteries which stimulate an electrochemical reaction .
this prompts the digital text and images to appear and disappear . " when kids see flashing pictures on cereal boxes we do n't expect them to just ask for the product , but to say , ' i want it , " ' said axel gerlt , an engineer on the siemens project , in an interview with wired magazine . the prototypes , which will eventually be among first phase of screens to be attached to packaging , currently resemble a calculator screen and have a monochromatic display .
siemens said that by 2007 , color screens with a resolution of 80 dpi producing simplistic moving images would be available and a year later the resolution could double . sieme n s n ot ruli n g out video displays i n future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens predict their digital displays will be able to support video in future however , siemens had news for those who are envisaging their breakfast news coming to them on the back of a cereal box in the near future .

the chemical reaction that produces the crude pictures at the moment is to slow to support video . " video could happen , but that is not what this technology is about for now , " gerlt told wired . some scientists are not so enthusiastic or optimistic .

but when somebody starts questioning his past , he simply says : fine , i 'll take my big bucks elsewhere . otto beisheim probably owns more retail stores , department stores , and businesses than he could remember off the top of his head .
which is really not that bad for somebody whose parents were too poor to send him to a high school . son of an estate manager , beisheim was born in 1924 .
as a young man , he was trained in the leather industry , but he quickly realized that that profits in retailing electronics would be much higher .
in 1964 , he became independent and , following a trip to the united states , founded the first german cash-and-carry market , proving himself to be a brilliant organizer and financial expert . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top-notch beisheim center -lrb- right -rrb- , next to sony center in berlin from then on , his professional life became an ongoing saga of mergers and acquisitions , market conquests and clever marketing campaigns .
as founder and stake holder in metro ag group , beisheim employs some 250,000 people in more than 2,400 cities in 30 countries . it would be practically impossible to find a german who has n't shopped in kaufhof department stores , extra and real supermarkets or the mediamarkt electronics chain . beware of germans carrying gifts beisheim 's wealth has been estimated to $ 3.4 billion -lrb- 2.9 billion euros -rrb- .
having invested 500 million euros in a 70 meter tall beisheim tower on berlin 's exclusive potstamer platz - part of a complex including two five-star hotels and the most expensive apartment building in all of germany - beisheim also became the largest private investor in the german capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beisheim does n't like to look back : he 'd rather bring grocery shopping into the 21st century if he has a weakness , it is having buildings named after him .
his hefty donations in the educational sector have landed him honorary titles , seminar and colloquia series , as well as an otto beisheim school of management . but his decision to award 10 million euros to tagernsee high school in return for having his name on a golden plaque ended in a fiasco and public scandal , after some of the teachers questioned the moral aspects of such a gift . beisheim is believed to have been a member of hitler 's ss fighting unit during the war .
he refuses not only to talk about that period of his life , but also to allow anybody - especially those who 'd benefit from his wealth - to question his past .
after the tagernsee school asked for a proof of his innocence in november 2005 , beisheim revoked his generous offer and decided to take his money elsewhere . students and parents then organized demonstrations in which they carried around posters with cheesy slogans in support of " dear grandpa beisheim , " but that did n't change his mind .

read more to find out what it means . wto members aim to complete a final deal at the end of 2006 in order to start wide ranging trade reforms in 2008 that would reduce trade barriers and boost the economies of poor countries . the following are the key areas of the statement agreed upon sunday in hong kong . farm trade governments accepted the elimination of all forms of export subsidies by the end of 2013 .
such payments are seen as skewing farm trade , creating unfair competition for poor countries .
a " substantial " part of the cuts are meant to be underway by around 2010 .
that was seen as a compromise between the european union , which pushed for a later date , and australia , brazil and the united states , which wanted a 2010 cut-off .
in exchange , the eu won a commitment that food aid , which brussels says is misused by washington to offload the us farm surplus , and monopoly firms that sell grain and dairy products from australia , canada and new zealand will be examined to ensure they do not distort trade . cotton bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cotton is a hot topic a key product of west african countries , cotton from the world 's poorest nations will be allowed to enter markets in the industrialized world duty- and quota-free from 2008 .
however , this measure is seen as insufficient by african cotton-producing countries , which have the united states in their sights and note that washington 's import duties are under 2 percent .
the real problem , they say , is the $ 4 billion in subsidies paid to us cotton growers , which allow the american cotton sector to drive down world prices .
while the accord said cotton export subsidies offered by rich countries should be eliminated next year , it did not fix a date for removing the domestic subsidies that make up most of the payouts .
it simply said they should be cut " more ambitiously " than subsidies on other farm goods . development industrialized countries , and developing countries " declaring themselves in a position to do so , " promised to give " at least 97 percent " of goods from the world 's least developed countries access to their markets from 2008 . industrial goods this area logged the least progress .
in exchange for farm trade concessions , rich nations wanted developing countries to give them more market access for manufactured goods .
but the deal simply said that customs duties will be reduced to maximum levels which are yet to be set out . services negotiations on liberalizing trade in this area , which includes banking , insurance and tourism , will aim at " promoting economic growth of all trading partners and the development of developing and least-developed countries , " the deal said .
rich countries are pressing poor nations for more trade concessions .
the statement said that new market-opening requests should be made by the end of february and that governments must draw up their final plans on services by the end of october . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wto ministers adopt compromise trade accord trade ministers adopted a compromise text sunday to clear the way to a global trade deal in 2006 , agreeing to cut farm trade export subsidies and providing special breaks for the poorest nations .

organizers and police are concerned that some will come to do the opposite - make enemies .
fan projects say fears are exaggerated . a brawl between some 100 german and polish hooligans last month raised fears that this was just a warm-up before next summer 's world cup match that pits the neighboring countries against each other in dortmund . the june 14 game is still a long way off , but germany 's central location in europe has already started causing headaches for german authorities and organizers .
true soccer fans have already started doing their part to make sure that germany 2006 does not go down in history as a violence-filled attraction for seedy elements - unlike france 1998 where german hooligans almost beat a french policeman to death and english supporters ran wild in marseille . this week , fan project heads from 12 nations , including england and the netherlands whose fans have a notorious reputation for violent tendencies , completed a five-day workshop in hamburg with security and world cup officials . a positive experience is possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup organizers do n't want pictures like these , during euro 2000 , to appear again " we 're convinced if we welcome people in germany like guests and look after the needs of fans , then you create a much more secure atmosphere , " michael gabriel of germany 's kos fan project told reuters . the proof can be found in the past gabriel said . " we had good experiences in england 1996 and portugal 2004 -lrb- european championships -rrb- , when a positive atmosphere for the whole event was generated .
we 're telling the police not to be worried . " gabriel 's english counterpart and workshop attendee , kevin miles , said the conditions for a successful world cup with little violence do exist .
he insisted , however , that an alcohol ban at public viewing venues should not even be considered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most soccer fans just want to have fun " most fans are against violence , " the spokesman for football supporters ' federation -lrb- fsf -rrb- said .
" most fans think that having no ticket and drinking large amounts are fine -lrb- but -rrb- i think that public viewing is a risk , and it needs policing , but it 's positive . " the most significant measure is banning orders , to prevent the worst english hooligans from even setting foot on the continent .
" banning orders serve to relax the foreign police , " miles said . fan embassies there when trouble brews there 's no way to eliminate all potential before millions of fans get together ; too much alcohol lowers inhibitions and pickpockets thrive in such environments .
hence , groups such as kos in germany , the fsf in england and euro support from the netherlands , plan to set up fan embassies to take action when the inevitable fight breaks out , possessions are stolen or police make arrests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans looking for tickets could pose problems at the world cup 2006 at euro 2004 in portugal , euro support acted as intermediaries when a group of dutch supporters had their belongings stolen . " when something nasty happens , we make the point that this does n't reflect on all the people of a country , " said martijn pelle .
" we 're intermediaries and we show that people are doing their best .
we can play a role . "
cheap accommodations lacking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british police check for troublemakers before fans fly to matches abroad the embassies are also there to inform fans in four languages about places to eat and drink , entertainment on offer and how to find cheap accommodation .
an inexpensive place to sleep is a big concern for many visitors from abroad . " my hotel room costs 65 euros -lrb- $ 78 -rrb- now .
during the world cup it will cost 270 , " said miles . true to the world cup motto " a time to make friends , " an event management company has established a web site to help willing hosts and seeking guests get together and make a deal for a stay during the world cup .
it may not ease the situation for cash-strapped fans , but it 's a contribution to making the world 's largest sporting event less stressful for everyone involved . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bobbies draw world cup duty in berlin in the past , british plainclothes police have accompanied english soccer events abroad .

he took the opportunity to point out that hostages are still being held by kidnappers in iraq .

her driver , shalid al-shimani , was also released according to a statement monday . frank-walter steinmeier confirmed in an evening press conference that susanne osthoff had been freed .
since sunday she had been in safety at the german embassy in baghdad , and she was in good health , he said . the kidnappers had said they would also release her driver , he added .
german news service dpa said monday that the driver had been released , citing a foreign ministry spokesman .
steinmeier said that in the name of the german government , he wished to thank everyone who had contributed to osthoff 's release .
he took the opportunity to point out that hostages are still being held by kidnappers in iraq .
osthoff " not maltreated " during 24-day ordeal steinmeier did not disclose the identity of the kidnappers , with whom german officials had reportedly established contact last week , but said that the hostage had apparently not been maltreated during her 24-day ordeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier in berlin on sunday " she is in the safe care of the german embassy in baghdad , " he said .
" i my first conversation with her i 've learned that she is also in good health . "
the foreign minister refused to respond to further questions about osthoff 's release . " not tonight , " he told journalists .
previously , her brother , robert osthoff had announced her release in an interview with german news channel n-tv .

however , while relief floods through germany at the news of osthoff 's safe release , questions have already begun to arise over how her release was secured . chancellor angela merkel said at the start of the crisis that the german government would not be " blackmailed " by the kidnappers , but did not give a clear answer when asked if germany would be prepared to pay a ransom . security experts say germany has paid ransoms for hostages in the past and would probably do so for osthoff . questions likely over whether ransom was paid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumors persisted that a ransom was paid for the release of the tourists in algeria in 2003 in 2003 , a group of european tourists including nine germans were held in algeria by the islamic militant group for preaching and combat -lrb- gspc -rrb- , an organization allegedly affiliated to al qaeda . it was alleged that the german government paid a ransom to free the hostages , a claim that gained strength when the foreign office asked the german contingent to contribute some 2,300 euros -lrb- $ 2,680 -rrb- each to the cost of their rescue - an operation believed to have cost around 20 million euros -lrb- $ 23 million -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.12.2005 siemens claims " electronic paper " available in two years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in the near future , your pizza box might advise you to spend more time at the gym paper-thin digital screens which can display advertising and information on product packaging may only be two years away , according to german electronic giant siemens . bleary-eyed , you stagger to the breakfast table in search of life-affirming orange juice and that caffeine kick you need to start your day .
but instead of the unthreatening image of a happy nuclear family of mum , dad and 2.4 kids sharing a nutritious breakfast on the back of your cereal package , there 's a flashing electronic display telling you how eating your bowl of bran can give you the world 's most efficient digestive system . sounds like a breakfast scene from a science fiction movie or maybe the worst nightmare of the hung-over ?
well , it could well be the future if the boffins at german technology giant siemens get their way . the electronics company has announced that is only about two years away from changing the way that disposable packaging carries its advertising and information forever .
conventional labels may well go the same way as the packaging that carries them by ending up in the dustbin of history if siemens make good on their promise to have digital , wafer-thin flat screens flashing and blinking graphics at customers from all manner of products by 2008 . flashi n g displays a n d i n formatio n o n packagi n g the display technology , which is composed of a polymer-based photochromic material , will allow companies to display moving adverts , nutritional information and special offers on their product ranges . to achieve that spell-binding flashing effect which is designed to lure consumers to the product , the screens receive an on-off electrical charge from minute batteries which stimulate an electrochemical reaction .
this prompts the digital text and images to appear and disappear . " when kids see flashing pictures on cereal boxes we do n't expect them to just ask for the product , but to say , ' i want it , " ' said axel gerlt , an engineer on the siemens project , in an interview with wired magazine . the prototypes , which will eventually be among first phase of screens to be attached to packaging , currently resemble a calculator screen and have a monochromatic display .
siemens said that by 2007 , color screens with a resolution of 80 dpi producing simplistic moving images would be available and a year later the resolution could double . sieme n s n ot ruli n g out video displays i n future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens predict their digital displays will be able to support video in future however , siemens had news for those who are envisaging their breakfast news coming to them on the back of a cereal box in the near future .
while video streaming is likely to happen , the company said , it wo n't be any time soon .
the chemical reaction that produces the crude pictures at the moment is to slow to support video . " video could happen , but that is not what this technology is about for now , " gerlt told wired . some scientists are not so enthusiastic or optimistic .
the electrochromic material being developed by siemens has yet to prove its stability and performance when mass produced , according to researchers . critics cite i n stability a n d performa n ce as drawbacks problems such as slow imaging-response time and device instability have been impediments to commercialization during the 30 or so years that the electronic industry has been working on producing the fabled " electronic paper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 18.12.2005 true fans prepare for a peaceful german world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fan project heads met to nip world cup violence in the bud " a time to make friends " is the motto of the world cup in germany .
organizers and police are concerned that some will come to do the opposite - make enemies .
fan projects say fears are exaggerated . a brawl between some 100 german and polish hooligans last month raised fears that this was just a warm-up before next summer 's world cup match that pits the neighboring countries against each other in dortmund . the june 14 game is still a long way off , but germany 's central location in europe has already started causing headaches for german authorities and organizers .
true soccer fans have already started doing their part to make sure that germany 2006 does not go down in history as a violence-filled attraction for seedy elements - unlike france 1998 where german hooligans almost beat a french policeman to death and english supporters ran wild in marseille . this week , fan project heads from 12 nations , including england and the netherlands whose fans have a notorious reputation for violent tendencies , completed a five-day workshop in hamburg with security and world cup officials . a positive experience is possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup organizers do n't want pictures like these , during euro 2000 , to appear again " we 're convinced if we welcome people in germany like guests and look after the needs of fans , then you create a much more secure atmosphere , " michael gabriel of germany 's kos fan project told reuters . the proof can be found in the past gabriel said . " we had good experiences in england 1996 and portugal 2004 -lrb- european championships -rrb- , when a positive atmosphere for the whole event was generated .
we 're telling the police not to be worried . " gabriel 's english counterpart and workshop attendee , kevin miles , said the conditions for a successful world cup with little violence do exist .
he insisted , however , that an alcohol ban at public viewing venues should not even be considered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most soccer fans just want to have fun " most fans are against violence , " the spokesman for football supporters ' federation -lrb- fsf -rrb- said .
" most fans think that having no ticket and drinking large amounts are fine -lrb- but -rrb- i think that public viewing is a risk , and it needs policing , but it 's positive . " the most significant measure is banning orders , to prevent the worst english hooligans from even setting foot on the continent .
" banning orders serve to relax the foreign police , " miles said . fan embassies there when trouble brews there 's no way to eliminate all potential before millions of fans get together ; too much alcohol lowers inhibitions and pickpockets thrive in such environments .
hence , groups such as kos in germany , the fsf in england and euro support from the netherlands , plan to set up fan embassies to take action when the inevitable fight breaks out , possessions are stolen or police make arrests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans looking for tickets could pose problems at the world cup 2006 at euro 2004 in portugal , euro support acted as intermediaries when a group of dutch supporters had their belongings stolen . " when something nasty happens , we make the point that this does n't reflect on all the people of a country , " said martijn pelle .
" we 're intermediaries and we show that people are doing their best .
we can play a role . "
cheap accommodations lacking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british police check for troublemakers before fans fly to matches abroad the embassies are also there to inform fans in four languages about places to eat and drink , entertainment on offer and how to find cheap accommodation .

but instead of the unthreatening image of a happy nuclear family of mum , dad and 2.4 kids sharing a nutritious breakfast on the back of your cereal package , there 's a flashing electronic display telling you how eating your bowl of bran can give you the world 's most efficient digestive system . sounds like a breakfast scene from a science fiction movie or maybe the worst nightmare of the hung-over ?
well , it could well be the future if the boffins at german technology giant siemens get their way . the electronics company has announced that is only about two years away from changing the way that disposable packaging carries its advertising and information forever .

this prompts the digital text and images to appear and disappear .

the chemical reaction that produces the crude pictures at the moment is to slow to support video . " video could happen , but that is not what this technology is about for now , " gerlt told wired . some scientists are not so enthusiastic or optimistic .

read more to find out what it means . wto members aim to complete a final deal at the end of 2006 in order to start wide ranging trade reforms in 2008 that would reduce trade barriers and boost the economies of poor countries . the following are the key areas of the statement agreed upon sunday in hong kong . farm trade governments accepted the elimination of all forms of export subsidies by the end of 2013 .
such payments are seen as skewing farm trade , creating unfair competition for poor countries .
a " substantial " part of the cuts are meant to be underway by around 2010 .
that was seen as a compromise between the european union , which pushed for a later date , and australia , brazil and the united states , which wanted a 2010 cut-off .
in exchange , the eu won a commitment that food aid , which brussels says is misused by washington to offload the us farm surplus , and monopoly firms that sell grain and dairy products from australia , canada and new zealand will be examined to ensure they do not distort trade . cotton bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cotton is a hot topic a key product of west african countries , cotton from the world 's poorest nations will be allowed to enter markets in the industrialized world duty- and quota-free from 2008 .
however , this measure is seen as insufficient by african cotton-producing countries , which have the united states in their sights and note that washington 's import duties are under 2 percent .
the real problem , they say , is the $ 4 billion in subsidies paid to us cotton growers , which allow the american cotton sector to drive down world prices .
while the accord said cotton export subsidies offered by rich countries should be eliminated next year , it did not fix a date for removing the domestic subsidies that make up most of the payouts .
it simply said they should be cut " more ambitiously " than subsidies on other farm goods . development industrialized countries , and developing countries " declaring themselves in a position to do so , " promised to give " at least 97 percent " of goods from the world 's least developed countries access to their markets from 2008 . industrial goods this area logged the least progress .
in exchange for farm trade concessions , rich nations wanted developing countries to give them more market access for manufactured goods .
but the deal simply said that customs duties will be reduced to maximum levels which are yet to be set out . services negotiations on liberalizing trade in this area , which includes banking , insurance and tourism , will aim at " promoting economic growth of all trading partners and the development of developing and least-developed countries , " the deal said .
rich countries are pressing poor nations for more trade concessions .
the statement said that new market-opening requests should be made by the end of february and that governments must draw up their final plans on services by the end of october . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wto ministers adopt compromise trade accord trade ministers adopted a compromise text sunday to clear the way to a global trade deal in 2006 , agreeing to cut farm trade export subsidies and providing special breaks for the poorest nations .

her driver , shalid al-shimani , was also released according to a statement monday . frank-walter steinmeier confirmed in an evening press conference that susanne osthoff had been freed .
since sunday she had been in safety at the german embassy in baghdad , and she was in good health , he said . the kidnappers had said they would also release her driver , he added .
german news service dpa said monday that the driver had been released , citing a foreign ministry spokesman .
steinmeier said that in the name of the german government , he wished to thank everyone who had contributed to osthoff 's release .
he took the opportunity to point out that hostages are still being held by kidnappers in iraq .
osthoff " not maltreated " during 24-day ordeal steinmeier did not disclose the identity of the kidnappers , with whom german officials had reportedly established contact last week , but said that the hostage had apparently not been maltreated during her 24-day ordeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier in berlin on sunday " she is in the safe care of the german embassy in baghdad , " he said .

the foreign minister refused to respond to further questions about osthoff 's release . " not tonight , " he told journalists .
previously , her brother , robert osthoff had announced her release in an interview with german news channel n-tv .

however , while relief floods through germany at the news of osthoff 's safe release , questions have already begun to arise over how her release was secured . chancellor angela merkel said at the start of the crisis that the german government would not be " blackmailed " by the kidnappers , but did not give a clear answer when asked if germany would be prepared to pay a ransom . security experts say germany has paid ransoms for hostages in the past and would probably do so for osthoff . questions likely over whether ransom was paid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumors persisted that a ransom was paid for the release of the tourists in algeria in 2003 in 2003 , a group of european tourists including nine germans were held in algeria by the islamic militant group for preaching and combat -lrb- gspc -rrb- , an organization allegedly affiliated to al qaeda . it was alleged that the german government paid a ransom to free the hostages , a claim that gained strength when the foreign office asked the german contingent to contribute some 2,300 euros -lrb- $ 2,680 -rrb- each to the cost of their rescue - an operation believed to have cost around 20 million euros -lrb- $ 23 million -rrb- .

her driver , shalid al-shimani , was also released according to a statement monday . frank-walter steinmeier confirmed in an evening press conference that susanne osthoff had been freed .
since sunday she had been in safety at the german embassy in baghdad , and she was in good health , he said . the kidnappers had said they would also release her driver , he added .
german news service dpa said monday that the driver had been released , citing a foreign ministry spokesman .
steinmeier said that in the name of the german government , he wished to thank everyone who had contributed to osthoff 's release .
he took the opportunity to point out that hostages are still being held by kidnappers in iraq .
osthoff " not maltreated " during 24-day ordeal steinmeier did not disclose the identity of the kidnappers , with whom german officials had reportedly established contact last week , but said that the hostage had apparently not been maltreated during her 24-day ordeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier in berlin on sunday " she is in the safe care of the german embassy in baghdad , " he said .
" i my first conversation with her i 've learned that she is also in good health . "
the foreign minister refused to respond to further questions about osthoff 's release . " not tonight , " he told journalists .
previously , her brother , robert osthoff had announced her release in an interview with german news channel n-tv .
osthoff 's family had been informed earlier by germany 's criminal police office .
" my sister is safe and free again and we feel relieved of a great burden , " he said .
" it has been almost unbearable to have to live through such a terrible time . " osthoff , 43 , a convert to islam who has lived in iraq for 10 years , was seized along with her driver on nov .
25 in the nineveh region of north-western iraq .
a video released by her kidnappers to german television purportedly showed her and the driver blindfolded and surrounded by armed men .
they threatened to kill her unless germany stopped training iraqi police . german 's driver also released , diplomats claim it was also announced on monday that shalid al-shimani , susanne osthoff 's driver , was no longer in the hands of his kidnappers , according to reports attributed to german diplomats . details concerning the release of both osthoff and al-shimani have not yet been made public , nor is it known whether any ransom was paid .
however , while relief floods through germany at the news of osthoff 's safe release , questions have already begun to arise over how her release was secured . chancellor angela merkel said at the start of the crisis that the german government would not be " blackmailed " by the kidnappers , but did not give a clear answer when asked if germany would be prepared to pay a ransom . security experts say germany has paid ransoms for hostages in the past and would probably do so for osthoff . questions likely over whether ransom was paid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumors persisted that a ransom was paid for the release of the tourists in algeria in 2003 in 2003 , a group of european tourists including nine germans were held in algeria by the islamic militant group for preaching and combat -lrb- gspc -rrb- , an organization allegedly affiliated to al qaeda . it was alleged that the german government paid a ransom to free the hostages , a claim that gained strength when the foreign office asked the german contingent to contribute some 2,300 euros -lrb- $ 2,680 -rrb- each to the cost of their rescue - an operation believed to have cost around 20 million euros -lrb- $ 23 million -rrb- .

but instead of the unthreatening image of a happy nuclear family of mum , dad and 2.4 kids sharing a nutritious breakfast on the back of your cereal package , there 's a flashing electronic display telling you how eating your bowl of bran can give you the world 's most efficient digestive system . sounds like a breakfast scene from a science fiction movie or maybe the worst nightmare of the hung-over ?
well , it could well be the future if the boffins at german technology giant siemens get their way . the electronics company has announced that is only about two years away from changing the way that disposable packaging carries its advertising and information forever .
conventional labels may well go the same way as the packaging that carries them by ending up in the dustbin of history if siemens make good on their promise to have digital , wafer-thin flat screens flashing and blinking graphics at customers from all manner of products by 2008 . flashi n g displays a n d i n formatio n o n packagi n g the display technology , which is composed of a polymer-based photochromic material , will allow companies to display moving adverts , nutritional information and special offers on their product ranges . to achieve that spell-binding flashing effect which is designed to lure consumers to the product , the screens receive an on-off electrical charge from minute batteries which stimulate an electrochemical reaction .
this prompts the digital text and images to appear and disappear . " when kids see flashing pictures on cereal boxes we do n't expect them to just ask for the product , but to say , ' i want it , " ' said axel gerlt , an engineer on the siemens project , in an interview with wired magazine . the prototypes , which will eventually be among first phase of screens to be attached to packaging , currently resemble a calculator screen and have a monochromatic display .
siemens said that by 2007 , color screens with a resolution of 80 dpi producing simplistic moving images would be available and a year later the resolution could double . sieme n s n ot ruli n g out video displays i n future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens predict their digital displays will be able to support video in future however , siemens had news for those who are envisaging their breakfast news coming to them on the back of a cereal box in the near future .

the chemical reaction that produces the crude pictures at the moment is to slow to support video . " video could happen , but that is not what this technology is about for now , " gerlt told wired . some scientists are not so enthusiastic or optimistic .

but instead of the unthreatening image of a happy nuclear family of mum , dad and 2.4 kids sharing a nutritious breakfast on the back of your cereal package , there 's a flashing electronic display telling you how eating your bowl of bran can give you the world 's most efficient digestive system . sounds like a breakfast scene from a science fiction movie or maybe the worst nightmare of the hung-over ?
well , it could well be the future if the boffins at german technology giant siemens get their way . the electronics company has announced that is only about two years away from changing the way that disposable packaging carries its advertising and information forever .
conventional labels may well go the same way as the packaging that carries them by ending up in the dustbin of history if siemens make good on their promise to have digital , wafer-thin flat screens flashing and blinking graphics at customers from all manner of products by 2008 . flashi n g displays a n d i n formatio n o n packagi n g the display technology , which is composed of a polymer-based photochromic material , will allow companies to display moving adverts , nutritional information and special offers on their product ranges . to achieve that spell-binding flashing effect which is designed to lure consumers to the product , the screens receive an on-off electrical charge from minute batteries which stimulate an electrochemical reaction .
this prompts the digital text and images to appear and disappear . " when kids see flashing pictures on cereal boxes we do n't expect them to just ask for the product , but to say , ' i want it , " ' said axel gerlt , an engineer on the siemens project , in an interview with wired magazine . the prototypes , which will eventually be among first phase of screens to be attached to packaging , currently resemble a calculator screen and have a monochromatic display .
siemens said that by 2007 , color screens with a resolution of 80 dpi producing simplistic moving images would be available and a year later the resolution could double . sieme n s n ot ruli n g out video displays i n future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens predict their digital displays will be able to support video in future however , siemens had news for those who are envisaging their breakfast news coming to them on the back of a cereal box in the near future .
while video streaming is likely to happen , the company said , it wo n't be any time soon .
the chemical reaction that produces the crude pictures at the moment is to slow to support video . " video could happen , but that is not what this technology is about for now , " gerlt told wired . some scientists are not so enthusiastic or optimistic .
the electrochromic material being developed by siemens has yet to prove its stability and performance when mass produced , according to researchers . critics cite i n stability a n d performa n ce as drawbacks problems such as slow imaging-response time and device instability have been impediments to commercialization during the 30 or so years that the electronic industry has been working on producing the fabled " electronic paper .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world cup 2006 -pipe- 18.12.2005 true fans prepare for a peaceful german world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fan project heads met to nip world cup violence in the bud " a time to make friends " is the motto of the world cup in germany .
organizers and police are concerned that some will come to do the opposite - make enemies .
fan projects say fears are exaggerated . a brawl between some 100 german and polish hooligans last month raised fears that this was just a warm-up before next summer 's world cup match that pits the neighboring countries against each other in dortmund . the june 14 game is still a long way off , but germany 's central location in europe has already started causing headaches for german authorities and organizers .
true soccer fans have already started doing their part to make sure that germany 2006 does not go down in history as a violence-filled attraction for seedy elements - unlike france 1998 where german hooligans almost beat a french policeman to death and english supporters ran wild in marseille . this week , fan project heads from 12 nations , including england and the netherlands whose fans have a notorious reputation for violent tendencies , completed a five-day workshop in hamburg with security and world cup officials . a positive experience is possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup organizers do n't want pictures like these , during euro 2000 , to appear again " we 're convinced if we welcome people in germany like guests and look after the needs of fans , then you create a much more secure atmosphere , " michael gabriel of germany 's kos fan project told reuters . the proof can be found in the past gabriel said . " we had good experiences in england 1996 and portugal 2004 -lrb- european championships -rrb- , when a positive atmosphere for the whole event was generated .
we 're telling the police not to be worried . " gabriel 's english counterpart and workshop attendee , kevin miles , said the conditions for a successful world cup with little violence do exist .
he insisted , however , that an alcohol ban at public viewing venues should not even be considered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most soccer fans just want to have fun " most fans are against violence , " the spokesman for football supporters ' federation -lrb- fsf -rrb- said .
" most fans think that having no ticket and drinking large amounts are fine -lrb- but -rrb- i think that public viewing is a risk , and it needs policing , but it 's positive . " the most significant measure is banning orders , to prevent the worst english hooligans from even setting foot on the continent .
" banning orders serve to relax the foreign police , " miles said . fan embassies there when trouble brews there 's no way to eliminate all potential before millions of fans get together ; too much alcohol lowers inhibitions and pickpockets thrive in such environments .
hence , groups such as kos in germany , the fsf in england and euro support from the netherlands , plan to set up fan embassies to take action when the inevitable fight breaks out , possessions are stolen or police make arrests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans looking for tickets could pose problems at the world cup 2006 at euro 2004 in portugal , euro support acted as intermediaries when a group of dutch supporters had their belongings stolen . " when something nasty happens , we make the point that this does n't reflect on all the people of a country , " said martijn pelle .
" we 're intermediaries and we show that people are doing their best .
we can play a role . "
cheap accommodations lacking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british police check for troublemakers before fans fly to matches abroad the embassies are also there to inform fans in four languages about places to eat and drink , entertainment on offer and how to find cheap accommodation .

organizers and police are concerned that some will come to do the opposite - make enemies .
fan projects say fears are exaggerated . a brawl between some 100 german and polish hooligans last month raised fears that this was just a warm-up before next summer 's world cup match that pits the neighboring countries against each other in dortmund . the june 14 game is still a long way off , but germany 's central location in europe has already started causing headaches for german authorities and organizers .
true soccer fans have already started doing their part to make sure that germany 2006 does not go down in history as a violence-filled attraction for seedy elements - unlike france 1998 where german hooligans almost beat a french policeman to death and english supporters ran wild in marseille . this week , fan project heads from 12 nations , including england and the netherlands whose fans have a notorious reputation for violent tendencies , completed a five-day workshop in hamburg with security and world cup officials . a positive experience is possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup organizers do n't want pictures like these , during euro 2000 , to appear again " we 're convinced if we welcome people in germany like guests and look after the needs of fans , then you create a much more secure atmosphere , " michael gabriel of germany 's kos fan project told reuters . the proof can be found in the past gabriel said . " we had good experiences in england 1996 and portugal 2004 -lrb- european championships -rrb- , when a positive atmosphere for the whole event was generated .
we 're telling the police not to be worried . " gabriel 's english counterpart and workshop attendee , kevin miles , said the conditions for a successful world cup with little violence do exist .
he insisted , however , that an alcohol ban at public viewing venues should not even be considered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most soccer fans just want to have fun " most fans are against violence , " the spokesman for football supporters ' federation -lrb- fsf -rrb- said .
" most fans think that having no ticket and drinking large amounts are fine -lrb- but -rrb- i think that public viewing is a risk , and it needs policing , but it 's positive . " the most significant measure is banning orders , to prevent the worst english hooligans from even setting foot on the continent .
" banning orders serve to relax the foreign police , " miles said . fan embassies there when trouble brews there 's no way to eliminate all potential before millions of fans get together ; too much alcohol lowers inhibitions and pickpockets thrive in such environments .
hence , groups such as kos in germany , the fsf in england and euro support from the netherlands , plan to set up fan embassies to take action when the inevitable fight breaks out , possessions are stolen or police make arrests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans looking for tickets could pose problems at the world cup 2006 at euro 2004 in portugal , euro support acted as intermediaries when a group of dutch supporters had their belongings stolen . " when something nasty happens , we make the point that this does n't reflect on all the people of a country , " said martijn pelle .
" we 're intermediaries and we show that people are doing their best .
we can play a role . "
cheap accommodations lacking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british police check for troublemakers before fans fly to matches abroad the embassies are also there to inform fans in four languages about places to eat and drink , entertainment on offer and how to find cheap accommodation .
an inexpensive place to sleep is a big concern for many visitors from abroad . " my hotel room costs 65 euros -lrb- $ 78 -rrb- now .
during the world cup it will cost 270 , " said miles . true to the world cup motto " a time to make friends , " an event management company has established a web site to help willing hosts and seeking guests get together and make a deal for a stay during the world cup .
it may not ease the situation for cash-strapped fans , but it 's a contribution to making the world 's largest sporting event less stressful for everyone involved . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bobbies draw world cup duty in berlin in the past , british plainclothes police have accompanied english soccer events abroad .
for the world cup in germany , uniformed officers will be present in a further attempt to stamp out hooliganism in advance .
-lrb- may 20 , 2005 -rrb- world cup security gives terror priority hooliganism has long been the bane of those organizing security for the 2006 world cup but germany 's police union chief has turned the attention to the terror threat on such an " attractive " target .

interior minister otto schily and the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- are trying to get a grip on the violence .

read more to find out what it means . wto members aim to complete a final deal at the end of 2006 in order to start wide ranging trade reforms in 2008 that would reduce trade barriers and boost the economies of poor countries . the following are the key areas of the statement agreed upon sunday in hong kong . farm trade governments accepted the elimination of all forms of export subsidies by the end of 2013 .
such payments are seen as skewing farm trade , creating unfair competition for poor countries .
a " substantial " part of the cuts are meant to be underway by around 2010 .
that was seen as a compromise between the european union , which pushed for a later date , and australia , brazil and the united states , which wanted a 2010 cut-off .
in exchange , the eu won a commitment that food aid , which brussels says is misused by washington to offload the us farm surplus , and monopoly firms that sell grain and dairy products from australia , canada and new zealand will be examined to ensure they do not distort trade . cotton bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cotton is a hot topic a key product of west african countries , cotton from the world 's poorest nations will be allowed to enter markets in the industrialized world duty- and quota-free from 2008 .
however , this measure is seen as insufficient by african cotton-producing countries , which have the united states in their sights and note that washington 's import duties are under 2 percent .
the real problem , they say , is the $ 4 billion in subsidies paid to us cotton growers , which allow the american cotton sector to drive down world prices .
while the accord said cotton export subsidies offered by rich countries should be eliminated next year , it did not fix a date for removing the domestic subsidies that make up most of the payouts .
it simply said they should be cut " more ambitiously " than subsidies on other farm goods . development industrialized countries , and developing countries " declaring themselves in a position to do so , " promised to give " at least 97 percent " of goods from the world 's least developed countries access to their markets from 2008 . industrial goods this area logged the least progress .
in exchange for farm trade concessions , rich nations wanted developing countries to give them more market access for manufactured goods .
but the deal simply said that customs duties will be reduced to maximum levels which are yet to be set out . services negotiations on liberalizing trade in this area , which includes banking , insurance and tourism , will aim at " promoting economic growth of all trading partners and the development of developing and least-developed countries , " the deal said .

read more to find out what it means . wto members aim to complete a final deal at the end of 2006 in order to start wide ranging trade reforms in 2008 that would reduce trade barriers and boost the economies of poor countries . the following are the key areas of the statement agreed upon sunday in hong kong . farm trade governments accepted the elimination of all forms of export subsidies by the end of 2013 .
such payments are seen as skewing farm trade , creating unfair competition for poor countries .
a " substantial " part of the cuts are meant to be underway by around 2010 .
that was seen as a compromise between the european union , which pushed for a later date , and australia , brazil and the united states , which wanted a 2010 cut-off .
in exchange , the eu won a commitment that food aid , which brussels says is misused by washington to offload the us farm surplus , and monopoly firms that sell grain and dairy products from australia , canada and new zealand will be examined to ensure they do not distort trade . cotton bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cotton is a hot topic a key product of west african countries , cotton from the world 's poorest nations will be allowed to enter markets in the industrialized world duty- and quota-free from 2008 .
however , this measure is seen as insufficient by african cotton-producing countries , which have the united states in their sights and note that washington 's import duties are under 2 percent .
the real problem , they say , is the $ 4 billion in subsidies paid to us cotton growers , which allow the american cotton sector to drive down world prices .
while the accord said cotton export subsidies offered by rich countries should be eliminated next year , it did not fix a date for removing the domestic subsidies that make up most of the payouts .
it simply said they should be cut " more ambitiously " than subsidies on other farm goods . development industrialized countries , and developing countries " declaring themselves in a position to do so , " promised to give " at least 97 percent " of goods from the world 's least developed countries access to their markets from 2008 . industrial goods this area logged the least progress .
in exchange for farm trade concessions , rich nations wanted developing countries to give them more market access for manufactured goods .
but the deal simply said that customs duties will be reduced to maximum levels which are yet to be set out . services negotiations on liberalizing trade in this area , which includes banking , insurance and tourism , will aim at " promoting economic growth of all trading partners and the development of developing and least-developed countries , " the deal said .
rich countries are pressing poor nations for more trade concessions .
the statement said that new market-opening requests should be made by the end of february and that governments must draw up their final plans on services by the end of october . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wto ministers adopt compromise trade accord trade ministers adopted a compromise text sunday to clear the way to a global trade deal in 2006 , agreeing to cut farm trade export subsidies and providing special breaks for the poorest nations .

her driver , shalid al-shimani , was also released according to a statement monday . frank-walter steinmeier confirmed in an evening press conference that susanne osthoff had been freed .
since sunday she had been in safety at the german embassy in baghdad , and she was in good health , he said . the kidnappers had said they would also release her driver , he added .
german news service dpa said monday that the driver had been released , citing a foreign ministry spokesman .
steinmeier said that in the name of the german government , he wished to thank everyone who had contributed to osthoff 's release .
he took the opportunity to point out that hostages are still being held by kidnappers in iraq .
osthoff " not maltreated " during 24-day ordeal steinmeier did not disclose the identity of the kidnappers , with whom german officials had reportedly established contact last week , but said that the hostage had apparently not been maltreated during her 24-day ordeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier in berlin on sunday " she is in the safe care of the german embassy in baghdad , " he said .

however , while relief floods through germany at the news of osthoff 's safe release , questions have already begun to arise over how her release was secured . chancellor angela merkel said at the start of the crisis that the german government would not be " blackmailed " by the kidnappers , but did not give a clear answer when asked if germany would be prepared to pay a ransom . security experts say germany has paid ransoms for hostages in the past and would probably do so for osthoff . questions likely over whether ransom was paid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumors persisted that a ransom was paid for the release of the tourists in algeria in 2003 in 2003 , a group of european tourists including nine germans were held in algeria by the islamic militant group for preaching and combat -lrb- gspc -rrb- , an organization allegedly affiliated to al qaeda . it was alleged that the german government paid a ransom to free the hostages , a claim that gained strength when the foreign office asked the german contingent to contribute some 2,300 euros -lrb- $ 2,680 -rrb- each to the cost of their rescue - an operation believed to have cost around 20 million euros -lrb- $ 23 million -rrb- .

such payments are seen as skewing farm trade , creating unfair competition for poor countries .

in exchange for farm trade concessions , rich nations wanted developing countries to give them more market access for manufactured goods .
but the deal simply said that customs duties will be reduced to maximum levels which are yet to be set out . services negotiations on liberalizing trade in this area , which includes banking , insurance and tourism , will aim at " promoting economic growth of all trading partners and the development of developing and least-developed countries , " the deal said .

since sunday she had been in safety at the german embassy in baghdad , and she was in good health , he said . the kidnappers had said they would also release her driver , he added .
german news service dpa said monday that the driver had been released , citing a foreign ministry spokesman .
steinmeier said that in the name of the german government , he wished to thank everyone who had contributed to osthoff 's release .
he took the opportunity to point out that hostages are still being held by kidnappers in iraq .

read more to find out what it means . wto members aim to complete a final deal at the end of 2006 in order to start wide ranging trade reforms in 2008 that would reduce trade barriers and boost the economies of poor countries . the following are the key areas of the statement agreed upon sunday in hong kong . farm trade governments accepted the elimination of all forms of export subsidies by the end of 2013 .
such payments are seen as skewing farm trade , creating unfair competition for poor countries .
a " substantial " part of the cuts are meant to be underway by around 2010 .
that was seen as a compromise between the european union , which pushed for a later date , and australia , brazil and the united states , which wanted a 2010 cut-off .
in exchange , the eu won a commitment that food aid , which brussels says is misused by washington to offload the us farm surplus , and monopoly firms that sell grain and dairy products from australia , canada and new zealand will be examined to ensure they do not distort trade . cotton bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cotton is a hot topic a key product of west african countries , cotton from the world 's poorest nations will be allowed to enter markets in the industrialized world duty- and quota-free from 2008 .
however , this measure is seen as insufficient by african cotton-producing countries , which have the united states in their sights and note that washington 's import duties are under 2 percent .
the real problem , they say , is the $ 4 billion in subsidies paid to us cotton growers , which allow the american cotton sector to drive down world prices .
while the accord said cotton export subsidies offered by rich countries should be eliminated next year , it did not fix a date for removing the domestic subsidies that make up most of the payouts .
it simply said they should be cut " more ambitiously " than subsidies on other farm goods . development industrialized countries , and developing countries " declaring themselves in a position to do so , " promised to give " at least 97 percent " of goods from the world 's least developed countries access to their markets from 2008 . industrial goods this area logged the least progress .
in exchange for farm trade concessions , rich nations wanted developing countries to give them more market access for manufactured goods .
but the deal simply said that customs duties will be reduced to maximum levels which are yet to be set out . services negotiations on liberalizing trade in this area , which includes banking , insurance and tourism , will aim at " promoting economic growth of all trading partners and the development of developing and least-developed countries , " the deal said .
rich countries are pressing poor nations for more trade concessions .
the statement said that new market-opening requests should be made by the end of february and that governments must draw up their final plans on services by the end of october . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wto ministers adopt compromise trade accord trade ministers adopted a compromise text sunday to clear the way to a global trade deal in 2006 , agreeing to cut farm trade export subsidies and providing special breaks for the poorest nations .

" we are tipping the balance in the wto back in favor of the developing countries , " said wto director general pascal lamy after the agreement was finally approved after six grueling days of negotiations .
" you have put the round back on track , you have given it a sense of urgency , " lamy said , referring to the doha round of trade negotiations launched in 2001 and due to be completed by the end of 2006 .
europe gives way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lamy -lrb- l . -rrb- can breathe a sigh of relief eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said the text was " acceptable " after other countries had accepted the eu compromise on the date .
" today , europe has gone further on its existing commitment by setting a clear date , 2013 , for the elimination of export subsidies , " mandelson said .
" we have demanded and received equivalent movement from the other countries .
while the outcome of hong kong is not a great success , this move of ours is enough to save it from failure . " the united states also welcomed the text , saying it had come to hong kong to build a solid platform to move forward global trade liberalization and that this had been achieved . brazilian foreign minister celso amorim said the group of 20 major developing countries also accepted the compromise .
" that keeps a certain degree of credibility " in the wto negotiations , he said .

conventional labels may well go the same way as the packaging that carries them by ending up in the dustbin of history if siemens make good on their promise to have digital , wafer-thin flat screens flashing and blinking graphics at customers from all manner of products by 2008 . flashi n g displays a n d i n formatio n o n packagi n g the display technology , which is composed of a polymer-based photochromic material , will allow companies to display moving adverts , nutritional information and special offers on their product ranges . to achieve that spell-binding flashing effect which is designed to lure consumers to the product , the screens receive an on-off electrical charge from minute batteries which stimulate an electrochemical reaction .
this prompts the digital text and images to appear and disappear . " when kids see flashing pictures on cereal boxes we do n't expect them to just ask for the product , but to say , ' i want it , " ' said axel gerlt , an engineer on the siemens project , in an interview with wired magazine . the prototypes , which will eventually be among first phase of screens to be attached to packaging , currently resemble a calculator screen and have a monochromatic display .
siemens said that by 2007 , color screens with a resolution of 80 dpi producing simplistic moving images would be available and a year later the resolution could double . sieme n s n ot ruli n g out video displays i n future bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : siemens predict their digital displays will be able to support video in future however , siemens had news for those who are envisaging their breakfast news coming to them on the back of a cereal box in the near future .
while video streaming is likely to happen , the company said , it wo n't be any time soon .
the chemical reaction that produces the crude pictures at the moment is to slow to support video . " video could happen , but that is not what this technology is about for now , " gerlt told wired . some scientists are not so enthusiastic or optimistic .
the electrochromic material being developed by siemens has yet to prove its stability and performance when mass produced , according to researchers . critics cite i n stability a n d performa n ce as drawbacks problems such as slow imaging-response time and device instability have been impediments to commercialization during the 30 or so years that the electronic industry has been working on producing the fabled " electronic paper . " one scientist even suggested that siemens were " overstating " their claims . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de siemens to cut over 10,000 jobs germany 's largest electronics company , siemens ag , announced monday its plans to cut 10,000 jobs .

" we are tipping the balance in the wto back in favor of the developing countries , " said wto director general pascal lamy after the agreement was finally approved after six grueling days of negotiations .
" you have put the round back on track , you have given it a sense of urgency , " lamy said , referring to the doha round of trade negotiations launched in 2001 and due to be completed by the end of 2006 .
europe gives way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lamy -lrb- l . -rrb- can breathe a sigh of relief eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said the text was " acceptable " after other countries had accepted the eu compromise on the date .
" today , europe has gone further on its existing commitment by setting a clear date , 2013 , for the elimination of export subsidies , " mandelson said .
" we have demanded and received equivalent movement from the other countries .
while the outcome of hong kong is not a great success , this move of ours is enough to save it from failure . " the united states also welcomed the text , saying it had come to hong kong to build a solid platform to move forward global trade liberalization and that this had been achieved . brazilian foreign minister celso amorim said the group of 20 major developing countries also accepted the compromise .
" that keeps a certain degree of credibility " in the wto negotiations , he said .
" as coordinator of the g20 i am very happy to see those elements . "
anti-poverty groups angry however anti-poverty campaigners were not so pleased . " this is not a deal , it 's a fraud , " the head of actionaid 's trade justice campaign aftab alam khan told afp .
oxfam 's trade campaign chief phil bloomer said rich countries had conceded minimal access to their agricultural markets while opening up the sensitive industrial and services sectors of developing nations .
" this is a profoundly disappointing text and a betrayal of development promises , " bloomer said . agreeing on a date to scrap the subsidies , which critics say prevent farmers in poor countries from competing effectively on world markets , had been one of the trickiest issues at the six-day meeting . the document is intended to guide ministers in further negotiations , with the goal of approving a final trade liberalization deal and completing the current round of negotiations by the end of 2006 .
violent protests as officials talked , the harbor-side conference center was totally sealed off , with police out in force to prevent more rowdy anti-wto protests after clashes on saturday in which nearly 100 people were hurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of protesters fought police on saturday in the most violent demonstrations since the talks started police used tear gas , fire hoses and pepper spray saturday to hold back hundreds of demonstrators led by militant korean farmers , some of whom were armed with bamboo sticks and metal bars .
the violent scenes saturday were highly unusual for hong kong where marches by hundreds of thousands of pro-democracy protesters in recent years have passed off without a single incident . on the divisive issue of cotton , the wto text said all developed country export subsidies would end in 2006 while the poorest producers would get duty-free and quota-free market access once an overall accord was agreed .
crucially , no date was given for an end to these domestic subsidies . african cotton producers have been pressing rich countries - and the united states in particular - to eliminate their domestic subsidies , which they say depress world prices and keep them mired in poverty , by jan .

in exchange , the eu won a commitment that food aid , which brussels says is misused by washington to offload the us farm surplus , and monopoly firms that sell grain and dairy products from australia , canada and new zealand will be examined to ensure they do not distort trade . cotton bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cotton is a hot topic a key product of west african countries , cotton from the world 's poorest nations will be allowed to enter markets in the industrialized world duty- and quota-free from 2008 .
however , this measure is seen as insufficient by african cotton-producing countries , which have the united states in their sights and note that washington 's import duties are under 2 percent .
the real problem , they say , is the $ 4 billion in subsidies paid to us cotton growers , which allow the american cotton sector to drive down world prices .
while the accord said cotton export subsidies offered by rich countries should be eliminated next year , it did not fix a date for removing the domestic subsidies that make up most of the payouts .
it simply said they should be cut " more ambitiously " than subsidies on other farm goods . development industrialized countries , and developing countries " declaring themselves in a position to do so , " promised to give " at least 97 percent " of goods from the world 's least developed countries access to their markets from 2008 . industrial goods this area logged the least progress .
in exchange for farm trade concessions , rich nations wanted developing countries to give them more market access for manufactured goods .
but the deal simply said that customs duties will be reduced to maximum levels which are yet to be set out . services negotiations on liberalizing trade in this area , which includes banking , insurance and tourism , will aim at " promoting economic growth of all trading partners and the development of developing and least-developed countries , " the deal said .
rich countries are pressing poor nations for more trade concessions .
the statement said that new market-opening requests should be made by the end of february and that governments must draw up their final plans on services by the end of october . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wto ministers adopt compromise trade accord trade ministers adopted a compromise text sunday to clear the way to a global trade deal in 2006 , agreeing to cut farm trade export subsidies and providing special breaks for the poorest nations .

since sunday she had been in safety at the german embassy in baghdad , and she was in good health , he said . the kidnappers had said they would also release her driver , he added .
german news service dpa said monday that the driver had been released , citing a foreign ministry spokesman .
steinmeier said that in the name of the german government , he wished to thank everyone who had contributed to osthoff 's release .
he took the opportunity to point out that hostages are still being held by kidnappers in iraq .
osthoff " not maltreated " during 24-day ordeal steinmeier did not disclose the identity of the kidnappers , with whom german officials had reportedly established contact last week , but said that the hostage had apparently not been maltreated during her 24-day ordeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier in berlin on sunday " she is in the safe care of the german embassy in baghdad , " he said .

since sunday she had been in safety at the german embassy in baghdad , and she was in good health , he said . the kidnappers had said they would also release her driver , he added .
german news service dpa said monday that the driver had been released , citing a foreign ministry spokesman .
steinmeier said that in the name of the german government , he wished to thank everyone who had contributed to osthoff 's release .
he took the opportunity to point out that hostages are still being held by kidnappers in iraq .
osthoff " not maltreated " during 24-day ordeal steinmeier did not disclose the identity of the kidnappers , with whom german officials had reportedly established contact last week , but said that the hostage had apparently not been maltreated during her 24-day ordeal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier in berlin on sunday " she is in the safe care of the german embassy in baghdad , " he said .

however , while relief floods through germany at the news of osthoff 's safe release , questions have already begun to arise over how her release was secured . chancellor angela merkel said at the start of the crisis that the german government would not be " blackmailed " by the kidnappers , but did not give a clear answer when asked if germany would be prepared to pay a ransom . security experts say germany has paid ransoms for hostages in the past and would probably do so for osthoff . questions likely over whether ransom was paid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rumors persisted that a ransom was paid for the release of the tourists in algeria in 2003 in 2003 , a group of european tourists including nine germans were held in algeria by the islamic militant group for preaching and combat -lrb- gspc -rrb- , an organization allegedly affiliated to al qaeda . it was alleged that the german government paid a ransom to free the hostages , a claim that gained strength when the foreign office asked the german contingent to contribute some 2,300 euros -lrb- $ 2,680 -rrb- each to the cost of their rescue - an operation believed to have cost around 20 million euros -lrb- $ 23 million -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.12.2005 what the hong kong wto agreement means großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : much work to be done the world trade organization statement approved by the global body 's 149 member governments in hong kong sunday marks a further step in the doha round negotiations , launched in 2001 .
read more to find out what it means . wto members aim to complete a final deal at the end of 2006 in order to start wide ranging trade reforms in 2008 that would reduce trade barriers and boost the economies of poor countries . the following are the key areas of the statement agreed upon sunday in hong kong . farm trade governments accepted the elimination of all forms of export subsidies by the end of 2013 .
such payments are seen as skewing farm trade , creating unfair competition for poor countries .
a " substantial " part of the cuts are meant to be underway by around 2010 .
that was seen as a compromise between the european union , which pushed for a later date , and australia , brazil and the united states , which wanted a 2010 cut-off .
in exchange , the eu won a commitment that food aid , which brussels says is misused by washington to offload the us farm surplus , and monopoly firms that sell grain and dairy products from australia , canada and new zealand will be examined to ensure they do not distort trade . cotton bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cotton is a hot topic a key product of west african countries , cotton from the world 's poorest nations will be allowed to enter markets in the industrialized world duty- and quota-free from 2008 .
however , this measure is seen as insufficient by african cotton-producing countries , which have the united states in their sights and note that washington 's import duties are under 2 percent .
the real problem , they say , is the $ 4 billion in subsidies paid to us cotton growers , which allow the american cotton sector to drive down world prices .
while the accord said cotton export subsidies offered by rich countries should be eliminated next year , it did not fix a date for removing the domestic subsidies that make up most of the payouts .
it simply said they should be cut " more ambitiously " than subsidies on other farm goods . development industrialized countries , and developing countries " declaring themselves in a position to do so , " promised to give " at least 97 percent " of goods from the world 's least developed countries access to their markets from 2008 . industrial goods this area logged the least progress .
in exchange for farm trade concessions , rich nations wanted developing countries to give them more market access for manufactured goods .
but the deal simply said that customs duties will be reduced to maximum levels which are yet to be set out . services negotiations on liberalizing trade in this area , which includes banking , insurance and tourism , will aim at " promoting economic growth of all trading partners and the development of developing and least-developed countries , " the deal said .
rich countries are pressing poor nations for more trade concessions .
the statement said that new market-opening requests should be made by the end of february and that governments must draw up their final plans on services by the end of october . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de wto ministers adopt compromise trade accord trade ministers adopted a compromise text sunday to clear the way to a global trade deal in 2006 , agreeing to cut farm trade export subsidies and providing special breaks for the poorest nations .

organizers and police are concerned that some will come to do the opposite - make enemies .
fan projects say fears are exaggerated . a brawl between some 100 german and polish hooligans last month raised fears that this was just a warm-up before next summer 's world cup match that pits the neighboring countries against each other in dortmund . the june 14 game is still a long way off , but germany 's central location in europe has already started causing headaches for german authorities and organizers .
true soccer fans have already started doing their part to make sure that germany 2006 does not go down in history as a violence-filled attraction for seedy elements - unlike france 1998 where german hooligans almost beat a french policeman to death and english supporters ran wild in marseille . this week , fan project heads from 12 nations , including england and the netherlands whose fans have a notorious reputation for violent tendencies , completed a five-day workshop in hamburg with security and world cup officials . a positive experience is possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world cup organizers do n't want pictures like these , during euro 2000 , to appear again " we 're convinced if we welcome people in germany like guests and look after the needs of fans , then you create a much more secure atmosphere , " michael gabriel of germany 's kos fan project told reuters . the proof can be found in the past gabriel said .

" most fans think that having no ticket and drinking large amounts are fine -lrb- but -rrb- i think that public viewing is a risk , and it needs policing , but it 's positive . " the most significant measure is banning orders , to prevent the worst english hooligans from even setting foot on the continent .
" banning orders serve to relax the foreign police , " miles said . fan embassies there when trouble brews there 's no way to eliminate all potential before millions of fans get together ; too much alcohol lowers inhibitions and pickpockets thrive in such environments .
hence , groups such as kos in germany , the fsf in england and euro support from the netherlands , plan to set up fan embassies to take action when the inevitable fight breaks out , possessions are stolen or police make arrests . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans looking for tickets could pose problems at the world cup 2006 at euro 2004 in portugal , euro support acted as intermediaries when a group of dutch supporters had their belongings stolen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.12.2005 wto ministers adopt compromise trade accord großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deal was done , despite the protesters outside trade ministers adopted a compromise text sunday to clear the way to a global trade deal in 2006 , agreeing to cut farm trade export subsidies and providing special breaks for the poorest nations . the document provides for european union agricultural export subsidies to be scrapped by 2013 , a key sticking point , which the united states and key developing nations had wanted removed in 2010 . anti-poverty campaigners condemned the agreement as a betrayal of the poor but ministers from the main trading blocs welcomed it as a modest step forward which could pave the way for an overall trade liberalization accord in 2006 . " we are tipping the balance in the wto back in favor of the developing countries , " said wto director general pascal lamy after the agreement was finally approved after six grueling days of negotiations .
" you have put the round back on track , you have given it a sense of urgency , " lamy said , referring to the doha round of trade negotiations launched in 2001 and due to be completed by the end of 2006 .
europe gives way bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lamy -lrb- l . -rrb- can breathe a sigh of relief eu trade commissioner peter mandelson said the text was " acceptable " after other countries had accepted the eu compromise on the date .
" today , europe has gone further on its existing commitment by setting a clear date , 2013 , for the elimination of export subsidies , " mandelson said .
" we have demanded and received equivalent movement from the other countries .
while the outcome of hong kong is not a great success , this move of ours is enough to save it from failure . " the united states also welcomed the text , saying it had come to hong kong to build a solid platform to move forward global trade liberalization and that this had been achieved . brazilian foreign minister celso amorim said the group of 20 major developing countries also accepted the compromise .
" that keeps a certain degree of credibility " in the wto negotiations , he said .
" as coordinator of the g20 i am very happy to see those elements . "
anti-poverty groups angry however anti-poverty campaigners were not so pleased . " this is not a deal , it 's a fraud , " the head of actionaid 's trade justice campaign aftab alam khan told afp .
oxfam 's trade campaign chief phil bloomer said rich countries had conceded minimal access to their agricultural markets while opening up the sensitive industrial and services sectors of developing nations .
" this is a profoundly disappointing text and a betrayal of development promises , " bloomer said . agreeing on a date to scrap the subsidies , which critics say prevent farmers in poor countries from competing effectively on world markets , had been one of the trickiest issues at the six-day meeting . the document is intended to guide ministers in further negotiations , with the goal of approving a final trade liberalization deal and completing the current round of negotiations by the end of 2006 .
violent protests as officials talked , the harbor-side conference center was totally sealed off , with police out in force to prevent more rowdy anti-wto protests after clashes on saturday in which nearly 100 people were hurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of protesters fought police on saturday in the most violent demonstrations since the talks started police used tear gas , fire hoses and pepper spray saturday to hold back hundreds of demonstrators led by militant korean farmers , some of whom were armed with bamboo sticks and metal bars .
the violent scenes saturday were highly unusual for hong kong where marches by hundreds of thousands of pro-democracy protesters in recent years have passed off without a single incident . on the divisive issue of cotton , the wto text said all developed country export subsidies would end in 2006 while the poorest producers would get duty-free and quota-free market access once an overall accord was agreed .
crucially , no date was given for an end to these domestic subsidies . african cotton producers have been pressing rich countries - and the united states in particular - to eliminate their domestic subsidies , which they say depress world prices and keep them mired in poverty , by jan .

michael howard proposed withdrawal from a un convention that obliges countries to admit people being persecuted on the basis of need , not numbers .
mr cameron told the observer the plans would be subject to a policy rethink .
a poll for the newspaper puts the tories nine points ahead of labour among people certain to vote .
the ipsos / mori poll suggests 40 % would back the conservatives , up seven points from may , while 31 % would vote for labour - a drop of five percentage points , and 21 % would choose the liberal democrats , a fall of 2 % .
asked who would make the best prime minister , 31 % chose chancellor gordon brown , 27 % mr cameron and 13 % liberal democrat leader charles kennedy .
' irresponsible language ' mr cameron told the observer he welcomed people fleeing persecution and was committed to granting them asylum , " taking them to our hearts , and feeding and clothing and schooling them " .
while defending the tory election manifesto , which he wrote for mr howard , mr cameron admitted there was " a very deep perception problem " about the party 's handling of the asylum issue .
but he attacked former home secretary david blunkett 's " irresponsible language " on the issue of immigration .
" he was the person who talked about us being swamped , " mr cameron told the paper .
he praised the cultural and economic benefits of immigration , adding : " we will have a big amount of emigration and immigration , but will also recognise that a responsible government needs to look at the level of net migration in terms of also providing good public services and having good community relations . "
defection call mr cameron 's interview followed a speech on friday in which he appealed to liberal democrat mps and councillors to defect to his party .
he said conservatives stood for " liberal values " , including a commitment to green policies , localism and deregulation .
mr cameron called for the creation of " a modern , progressive , liberal , mainstream opposition to labour " .
but lib dem leader charles kennedy said his rival should change parties if " he meant what he was saying " .

king jigme singye wangchuck said he would be succeeded as leader of the tiny and remote himalayan kingdom by his son , the crown prince .
the king , who has ruled for 33 years , gave up absolute power in 1998 .
he currently rules in conjunction with the government , an assembly and a royal advisory council .
' parliamentary democracy ' speaking in a remote village three days ' drive from the capital , thimpu , the king told thousands of yak herders , monks , farmers , and students that he would begin handing over responsibility to the crown prince immediately .
isolated kingdom country is about 38,000 sq km -lrb- 15,000 sq miles -rrb- - sixth of the size of the uk hereditary monarchy established in 1907 only 6,000 tourists a year allowed to visit smoking is banned first introduced tv in 1999 king wangchuck has four wives , all of whom are sisters crown prince jigme khesar namgyel wangchuck is 25 and unmarried country profile : bhutan " i would like our people to know that the first national election to elect a government under a system of parliamentary democracy will take place in 2008 , " the 50-year-old told the crowd gathered in trashiyangtse .
in a speech published in the state newspaper , king wangchuck said he had every confidence that the people of bhutan would be able to choose the political party best able to provide good governance and serve the interests of the nation .
the government has already said it plans to appoint an election commissioner before the end of 2005 to draw up constituency boundaries and mock voting sessions .
a draft constitution provides for two houses of parliament - a 75-member national assembly and a 25-member national council - with the king as head of state .
correspondents say the king likes to project the image of simple lifestyle , preferring to work in a small log cabin above the capital while his fortress-like palace is used by his four wives , all of whom are sisters .

retailers have reported hordes of people hunting for gifts on the final full shopping weekend before christmas .
despite predictions of a slow start , shopping centres said sales are up on last year , with experts pointing to boosted consumer confidence .
early sales and special promotions are also thought to have contributed to the boost in numbers .
' busiest day of year ' shopping centres around britain reported strong sales over the weekend .
half a million people flocked to oxford street in london on saturday , which became a pedestrian-only zone in an attempt to attract shoppers .
a spokesman for the oxford street association , which represents retailers there , said it was likely to prove the busiest saturday of the year before christmas .
" yesterday was very busy and i expect it to be very busy today because this is the last full weekend before christmas , " he said .
at least 65,000 people will have passed through our doors this weekend fay jameson , edinburgh 's ocean terminal " i think the cold snap has helped as people stock up on woollens and winter clothes .
" there are some pre-christmas promotions around . "
queues he denied retailers had been struggling in the run-up to the festive season .
" november showed an upward growth for the first time since july .
" it has been challenging since july , but the increase in the last few weeks has been encouraging . "
in newcastle , the metrocentre hit the 100,000 mark every day this week and expected this weekend 's figures to be the same or higher .
a spokeswoman said : " on saturday we had more than 116,000 people through the doors and we expect to do well on sunday .
we are quite well up on last year in terms of figures . "
' extreme shopping ' it seems quite a lot of customers are leaving it to the last minute this year spokesperson for sheffield 's meadowhall complex at braehead , near glasgow , " hundreds of thousands " of shoppers were expected to have passed through the doors this weekend .
a spokesperson added : " we had a very busy saturday .
sunday is expected to be the same .
" we closed at 7pm last night but could have stayed open later because of the demand . "
meanwhile , at edinburgh 's ocean terminal , staff worked hard to cater for " extreme shopping " .
necessity duty manager fay jameson said : " at least 65,000 people will have passed through our doors this weekend .
" we had about 33,000 people yesterday - that 's the busiest saturday this year and up on last year by about 5 % .
" today is also very busy and we expect to go into overflow car parking by about 3pm . "
ms jameson said there were sales around but people were now shopping " out of necessity " .
she added : " we have also got a cinema and there are lots of good films on like king kong , which help bring people in . "
discounts at sheffield 's meadowhall complex , it seemed many shoppers were leaving things to the last minute in an effort to get better deals .
duty manager peter bellhouse said : " it was a very busy day yesterday and it looks like sunday will prove another very busy day .
" the shops open at 11am on sundays but there were a lot of people in window shopping before 10am today .
" there were big queues outside some of the stores as well as outside santa 's grotto .
" we 're expecting it to be one of the busiest weekends of the year .
" it seems quite a lot of customers are leaving it to the last minute this year .
" it 's like they are playing a game with the retailers - if they hold off long enough , they believe the shops are going to discount . "
' final crunch ' internet retailers are the ones expected to benefit most from the growth in spending .
a survey published last week suggested that almost two in five -lrb- 38 % -rrb- british adults would do some of their christmas shopping online , up from 22 % in 2001 .
retail analyst footfall said shopping visits increased by 9.5 % last week compared with the previous week .
but levels were still down on 2003 and 2004 .
natasha burton , marketing manager at footfall , said online shopping , the rise of the supermarket and a reduction in what people were spending were to blame .
" but i think it is now ramping up , " she said .
" people are realising there is only one week to go and so the final crunch is coming . "
