four journalists from four television networks - public broadcasters ard and zdf as well as private channels rtl and sat.1 - will ask their questions .
in contrast to 2002 , candidates wo n't -lrb- always -rrb- be cut off mid-answer due to time constraints .
the director is supposed to focus on the arguments , not on sweating foreheads or jittery hands .
o n e or two debates ?
even before germany 's constitutional court gave the green light for early elections on sept .
18 , the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- had already agreed that their chancellor candidates would square off .
the question was how many times ?
once or twice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder on all channels chancellor schröder , not someone to shy away from a television camera nor a discussion , wanted two debates .
yet he did not want to push the matter .
" we should n't make this an election topic , " schröder said matter-of-factly .
" it has to do with content , it has to do with experience , with steadfastness , and sometimes to have the rigor to lead a country in a difficult situation .
we should n't forget this . "
disadva n tage for merkel ?
angela merkel and the cdu on the other hand were more hesitant in taking the plunge and step up in front of an estimated 20 million people against schröder .
yet recent polls reveal that over one-fifth of german voters would make their decision on whom to vote for based on the tv debates .
merkel can at times seem robotic and stiff in public .
she also has a propensity to impatience .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel during a tv interview " it is n't enough to moan like some are doing now , " she screamed at hecklers during a campaign appearance in warnermünde .
" what we should do , to put it bluntly , is to use our thick skulls so that we can work properly later . "
a n u n avoidable eve n t ?
the television debate , an american creation that swayed the us presidential election in 1960 , did n't make it to germany until 2002 .
it may not have proved as pivotal for gerhard schröder as it did for john f. kennedy four-and-a-half decades ago , but it did not hurt the chancellor .
schröder 's challenger then , edmund stoiber , whom many chuckled over words getting stuck in his craw , proved a formidable challenger to the media-savvy chancellor .
he also realized that the debate had become an unavoidable event in future elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we may complain about it or welcome it , " the eventual loser in the 2002 election said .
" it is a bit of americanization .
but i think that there probably wo n't be another parliamentary campaign without this direct discussion and confrontation between the chancellor and his challenger . "
the sunday debate will not be schröder 's and merkel 's last television encounter before the election , however .
a sept .
12 program , originally meant for the party chairs to discuss their political platforms , will now serve as an unofficial second debate after schröder took the seat of social democratic party leader franz münterfering , who can not attend . jens thurau -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de political heavyweights eye one-round bout german chancellor gerhard schröder and his conservative challenger , angela merkel , will face each other in a single televised debate on september 4 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.09.2005 sparks fly in german election tv debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's four major channels televised the debate two weeks ahead of national elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder and his conservative challenger , angela merkel , met for a tv debate sunday .
they largely focused on domestic rather than foreign policy issues . with an estimated 15 million germans following the debate on germany 's four major tv channels , an aggressive merkel seemed eager to make up for her disadvantage of entering the duel in second place : polls had shown that most people expected schröder to win the debate .
sticking largely to domestic issues such as taxes , pensions and germany 's high unemployment levels , merkel continually returned to her christian democratic union 's message that only it can get germany 's 4.7 million unemployed back to work . bildunterschrift : " we are campaigning for a total change of policy , " she said , defending the radical tax reform laid out by her financial advisor , paul kirchhof . schröder countered that germans must not become " guinea pigs " for kirchhof 's ideas . it was wrong to ask " millionaires and nurses " to pay the same amount of tax , he added . managing katrina schröder and merkel also briefly touched on disaster management in the aftermath of hurricane katrina in the us . while merkel refused to comment on the issue , however , schröder said that us president george w. bush himself had described the slow relief effort as " unacceptable . "
the chancellor added that germany had handled catastrophic situations in a timelier manner in the past . bildunterschrift : national guard members carry an injured man to an awaiting helicopter near the new orleans superdome " it shows that you need a strong state for people in need , not a weak state , " schröder said .
" the structures that we have here work . " turkey , e n ergy issues turkey 's bid for eu membership also became an issue .
while merkel reiterated her view that turkey could not become a full member of the union and should instead be invited to a " privileged partnership , " schröder accused his challenger of failing to see the importance of integrating an islamic country into the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's stade nuclear plant has already been shut down .
merkel also said that she saw nuclear energy as part of a mix that was necessary to ensure germany 's power supply .
schröder 's red-green coalition has decided to phase out nuclear energy completely . what ki n d of coalitio n ? early polls of german television viewers said schröder was more convincing , with his challenger polling around half his score . but merkel , bidding to become germany 's first woman leader , appeared more assured in front of the cameras than many observers had predicted . while the debate is unlikely to affect merkel 's strong chance of becoming germany 's first woman chancellor , analysts said it could tip the scales for the coalition she is able to form . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with her dream coalition partners , the csu 's edmund stoiber -lrb- left -rrb- and the fdp 's guido westerwelle .
" it will go right down to the wire on whether black-yellow manages to win on sept .
18 , " said the director of independent polling institute infratest-dimap , reinhard hilmer , referring to the party colors of merkel 's favored coalition comprising her christian union alliance and the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- . " that is why the tv debate could be decisive , " he told the sunday newspaper bild am so n n tag . a seco n d duel a poll released friday by public television network zdf showed the christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- with 43 percent support and the fdp with 7 percent - just enough to give them a governing majority . but even a slight shift away from either party could put the country on the road to a " grand coalition " featuring the cdu / csu and schröder 's social democrats , which tallied 32 percent in the zdf poll . bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder will face each other a second time , albeit not in a one-on-one duel , during a debate on sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.09.2005 sparks fly in german election tv debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's four major channels televised the debate two weeks ahead of national elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder and his conservative challenger , angela merkel , met for a tv debate sunday .
they largely focused on domestic rather than foreign policy issues . with an estimated 15 million germans following the debate on germany 's four major tv channels , an aggressive merkel seemed eager to make up for her disadvantage of entering the duel in second place : polls had shown that most people expected schröder to win the debate .
sticking largely to domestic issues such as taxes , pensions and germany 's high unemployment levels , merkel continually returned to her christian democratic union 's message that only it can get germany 's 4.7 million unemployed back to work . bildunterschrift : " we are campaigning for a total change of policy , " she said , defending the radical tax reform laid out by her financial advisor , paul kirchhof . schröder countered that germans must not become " guinea pigs " for kirchhof 's ideas . it was wrong to ask " millionaires and nurses " to pay the same amount of tax , he added . managing katrina schröder and merkel also briefly touched on disaster management in the aftermath of hurricane katrina in the us . while merkel refused to comment on the issue , however , schröder said that us president george w. bush himself had described the slow relief effort as " unacceptable . "
the chancellor added that germany had handled catastrophic situations in a timelier manner in the past . bildunterschrift : national guard members carry an injured man to an awaiting helicopter near the new orleans superdome " it shows that you need a strong state for people in need , not a weak state , " schröder said .
" the structures that we have here work . " turkey , e n ergy issues turkey 's bid for eu membership also became an issue .
while merkel reiterated her view that turkey could not become a full member of the union and should instead be invited to a " privileged partnership , " schröder accused his challenger of failing to see the importance of integrating an islamic country into the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's stade nuclear plant has already been shut down .
merkel also said that she saw nuclear energy as part of a mix that was necessary to ensure germany 's power supply .
schröder 's red-green coalition has decided to phase out nuclear energy completely . what ki n d of coalitio n ? early polls of german television viewers said schröder was more convincing , with his challenger polling around half his score . but merkel , bidding to become germany 's first woman leader , appeared more assured in front of the cameras than many observers had predicted . while the debate is unlikely to affect merkel 's strong chance of becoming germany 's first woman chancellor , analysts said it could tip the scales for the coalition she is able to form . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with her dream coalition partners , the csu 's edmund stoiber -lrb- left -rrb- and the fdp 's guido westerwelle .
" it will go right down to the wire on whether black-yellow manages to win on sept .
18 , " said the director of independent polling institute infratest-dimap , reinhard hilmer , referring to the party colors of merkel 's favored coalition comprising her christian union alliance and the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- . " that is why the tv debate could be decisive , " he told the sunday newspaper bild am so n n tag . a seco n d duel a poll released friday by public television network zdf showed the christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- with 43 percent support and the fdp with 7 percent - just enough to give them a governing majority . but even a slight shift away from either party could put the country on the road to a " grand coalition " featuring the cdu / csu and schröder 's social democrats , which tallied 32 percent in the zdf poll . bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder will face each other a second time , albeit not in a one-on-one duel , during a debate on sept .

they largely focused on domestic rather than foreign policy issues . with an estimated 15 million germans following the debate on germany 's four major tv channels , an aggressive merkel seemed eager to make up for her disadvantage of entering the duel in second place : polls had shown that most people expected schröder to win the debate .
sticking largely to domestic issues such as taxes , pensions and germany 's high unemployment levels , merkel continually returned to her christian democratic union 's message that only it can get germany 's 4.7 million unemployed back to work . bildunterschrift : " we are campaigning for a total change of policy , " she said , defending the radical tax reform laid out by her financial advisor , paul kirchhof . schröder countered that germans must not become " guinea pigs " for kirchhof 's ideas . it was wrong to ask " millionaires and nurses " to pay the same amount of tax , he added . managing katrina schröder and merkel also briefly touched on disaster management in the aftermath of hurricane katrina in the us . while merkel refused to comment on the issue , however , schröder said that us president george w. bush himself had described the slow relief effort as " unacceptable .

while merkel reiterated her view that turkey could not become a full member of the union and should instead be invited to a " privileged partnership , " schröder accused his challenger of failing to see the importance of integrating an islamic country into the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's stade nuclear plant has already been shut down .
merkel also said that she saw nuclear energy as part of a mix that was necessary to ensure germany 's power supply .
schröder 's red-green coalition has decided to phase out nuclear energy completely . what ki n d of coalitio n ? early polls of german television viewers said schröder was more convincing , with his challenger polling around half his score . but merkel , bidding to become germany 's first woman leader , appeared more assured in front of the cameras than many observers had predicted . while the debate is unlikely to affect merkel 's strong chance of becoming germany 's first woman chancellor , analysts said it could tip the scales for the coalition she is able to form . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with her dream coalition partners , the csu 's edmund stoiber -lrb- left -rrb- and the fdp 's guido westerwelle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 04.09.2005 schröder , merkel to face off in tv debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and gerhard schröder ready to debate millions of germans are expected to watch the only debate between german chancellor gerhard schröder and his conservative challenger , angela merkel , on sunday . germans are ready for the 90-minute debate that will allow for more spontaneity than the debates during the 2002 election .
four journalists from four television networks - public broadcasters ard and zdf as well as private channels rtl and sat.1 - will ask their questions .
in contrast to 2002 , candidates wo n't -lrb- always -rrb- be cut off mid-answer due to time constraints .
the director is supposed to focus on the arguments , not on sweating foreheads or jittery hands .
o n e or two debates ?
even before germany 's constitutional court gave the green light for early elections on sept .
18 , the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- had already agreed that their chancellor candidates would square off .
the question was how many times ?
once or twice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder on all channels chancellor schröder , not someone to shy away from a television camera nor a discussion , wanted two debates .
yet he did not want to push the matter .
" we should n't make this an election topic , " schröder said matter-of-factly .
" it has to do with content , it has to do with experience , with steadfastness , and sometimes to have the rigor to lead a country in a difficult situation .
we should n't forget this . "
disadva n tage for merkel ?
angela merkel and the cdu on the other hand were more hesitant in taking the plunge and step up in front of an estimated 20 million people against schröder .
yet recent polls reveal that over one-fifth of german voters would make their decision on whom to vote for based on the tv debates .
merkel can at times seem robotic and stiff in public .
she also has a propensity to impatience .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel during a tv interview " it is n't enough to moan like some are doing now , " she screamed at hecklers during a campaign appearance in warnermünde .
" what we should do , to put it bluntly , is to use our thick skulls so that we can work properly later . "
a n u n avoidable eve n t ?
the television debate , an american creation that swayed the us presidential election in 1960 , did n't make it to germany until 2002 .
it may not have proved as pivotal for gerhard schröder as it did for john f. kennedy four-and-a-half decades ago , but it did not hurt the chancellor .
schröder 's challenger then , edmund stoiber , whom many chuckled over words getting stuck in his craw , proved a formidable challenger to the media-savvy chancellor .
he also realized that the debate had become an unavoidable event in future elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we may complain about it or welcome it , " the eventual loser in the 2002 election said .
" it is a bit of americanization .
but i think that there probably wo n't be another parliamentary campaign without this direct discussion and confrontation between the chancellor and his challenger . "
the sunday debate will not be schröder 's and merkel 's last television encounter before the election , however .
a sept .
12 program , originally meant for the party chairs to discuss their political platforms , will now serve as an unofficial second debate after schröder took the seat of social democratic party leader franz münterfering , who can not attend . jens thurau -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de political heavyweights eye one-round bout german chancellor gerhard schröder and his conservative challenger , angela merkel , will face each other in a single televised debate on september 4 .

they largely focused on domestic rather than foreign policy issues . with an estimated 15 million germans following the debate on germany 's four major tv channels , an aggressive merkel seemed eager to make up for her disadvantage of entering the duel in second place : polls had shown that most people expected schröder to win the debate .
sticking largely to domestic issues such as taxes , pensions and germany 's high unemployment levels , merkel continually returned to her christian democratic union 's message that only it can get germany 's 4.7 million unemployed back to work . bildunterschrift : " we are campaigning for a total change of policy , " she said , defending the radical tax reform laid out by her financial advisor , paul kirchhof . schröder countered that germans must not become " guinea pigs " for kirchhof 's ideas . it was wrong to ask " millionaires and nurses " to pay the same amount of tax , he added . managing katrina schröder and merkel also briefly touched on disaster management in the aftermath of hurricane katrina in the us . while merkel refused to comment on the issue , however , schröder said that us president george w. bush himself had described the slow relief effort as " unacceptable . "

while merkel reiterated her view that turkey could not become a full member of the union and should instead be invited to a " privileged partnership , " schröder accused his challenger of failing to see the importance of integrating an islamic country into the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's stade nuclear plant has already been shut down .
merkel also said that she saw nuclear energy as part of a mix that was necessary to ensure germany 's power supply .
schröder 's red-green coalition has decided to phase out nuclear energy completely . what ki n d of coalitio n ? early polls of german television viewers said schröder was more convincing , with his challenger polling around half his score . but merkel , bidding to become germany 's first woman leader , appeared more assured in front of the cameras than many observers had predicted . while the debate is unlikely to affect merkel 's strong chance of becoming germany 's first woman chancellor , analysts said it could tip the scales for the coalition she is able to form . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with her dream coalition partners , the csu 's edmund stoiber -lrb- left -rrb- and the fdp 's guido westerwelle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.09.2005 sparks fly in german election tv debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's four major channels televised the debate two weeks ahead of national elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder and his conservative challenger , angela merkel , met for a tv debate sunday .
they largely focused on domestic rather than foreign policy issues . with an estimated 15 million germans following the debate on germany 's four major tv channels , an aggressive merkel seemed eager to make up for her disadvantage of entering the duel in second place : polls had shown that most people expected schröder to win the debate .
sticking largely to domestic issues such as taxes , pensions and germany 's high unemployment levels , merkel continually returned to her christian democratic union 's message that only it can get germany 's 4.7 million unemployed back to work . bildunterschrift : " we are campaigning for a total change of policy , " she said , defending the radical tax reform laid out by her financial advisor , paul kirchhof . schröder countered that germans must not become " guinea pigs " for kirchhof 's ideas . it was wrong to ask " millionaires and nurses " to pay the same amount of tax , he added . managing katrina schröder and merkel also briefly touched on disaster management in the aftermath of hurricane katrina in the us . while merkel refused to comment on the issue , however , schröder said that us president george w. bush himself had described the slow relief effort as " unacceptable . "
the chancellor added that germany had handled catastrophic situations in a timelier manner in the past . bildunterschrift : national guard members carry an injured man to an awaiting helicopter near the new orleans superdome " it shows that you need a strong state for people in need , not a weak state , " schröder said .
" the structures that we have here work . " turkey , e n ergy issues turkey 's bid for eu membership also became an issue .
while merkel reiterated her view that turkey could not become a full member of the union and should instead be invited to a " privileged partnership , " schröder accused his challenger of failing to see the importance of integrating an islamic country into the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's stade nuclear plant has already been shut down .
merkel also said that she saw nuclear energy as part of a mix that was necessary to ensure germany 's power supply .
schröder 's red-green coalition has decided to phase out nuclear energy completely . what ki n d of coalitio n ? early polls of german television viewers said schröder was more convincing , with his challenger polling around half his score . but merkel , bidding to become germany 's first woman leader , appeared more assured in front of the cameras than many observers had predicted . while the debate is unlikely to affect merkel 's strong chance of becoming germany 's first woman chancellor , analysts said it could tip the scales for the coalition she is able to form . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with her dream coalition partners , the csu 's edmund stoiber -lrb- left -rrb- and the fdp 's guido westerwelle .
" it will go right down to the wire on whether black-yellow manages to win on sept .
18 , " said the director of independent polling institute infratest-dimap , reinhard hilmer , referring to the party colors of merkel 's favored coalition comprising her christian union alliance and the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- . " that is why the tv debate could be decisive , " he told the sunday newspaper bild am so n n tag . a seco n d duel a poll released friday by public television network zdf showed the christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- with 43 percent support and the fdp with 7 percent - just enough to give them a governing majority . but even a slight shift away from either party could put the country on the road to a " grand coalition " featuring the cdu / csu and schröder 's social democrats , which tallied 32 percent in the zdf poll . bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder will face each other a second time , albeit not in a one-on-one duel , during a debate on sept .

they largely focused on domestic rather than foreign policy issues . with an estimated 15 million germans following the debate on germany 's four major tv channels , an aggressive merkel seemed eager to make up for her disadvantage of entering the duel in second place : polls had shown that most people expected schröder to win the debate .
sticking largely to domestic issues such as taxes , pensions and germany 's high unemployment levels , merkel continually returned to her christian democratic union 's message that only it can get germany 's 4.7 million unemployed back to work . bildunterschrift : " we are campaigning for a total change of policy , " she said , defending the radical tax reform laid out by her financial advisor , paul kirchhof . schröder countered that germans must not become " guinea pigs " for kirchhof 's ideas . it was wrong to ask " millionaires and nurses " to pay the same amount of tax , he added . managing katrina schröder and merkel also briefly touched on disaster management in the aftermath of hurricane katrina in the us . while merkel refused to comment on the issue , however , schröder said that us president george w. bush himself had described the slow relief effort as " unacceptable . "
the chancellor added that germany had handled catastrophic situations in a timelier manner in the past . bildunterschrift : national guard members carry an injured man to an awaiting helicopter near the new orleans superdome " it shows that you need a strong state for people in need , not a weak state , " schröder said .
" the structures that we have here work . " turkey , e n ergy issues turkey 's bid for eu membership also became an issue .
while merkel reiterated her view that turkey could not become a full member of the union and should instead be invited to a " privileged partnership , " schröder accused his challenger of failing to see the importance of integrating an islamic country into the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's stade nuclear plant has already been shut down .
merkel also said that she saw nuclear energy as part of a mix that was necessary to ensure germany 's power supply .
schröder 's red-green coalition has decided to phase out nuclear energy completely . what ki n d of coalitio n ? early polls of german television viewers said schröder was more convincing , with his challenger polling around half his score . but merkel , bidding to become germany 's first woman leader , appeared more assured in front of the cameras than many observers had predicted . while the debate is unlikely to affect merkel 's strong chance of becoming germany 's first woman chancellor , analysts said it could tip the scales for the coalition she is able to form . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with her dream coalition partners , the csu 's edmund stoiber -lrb- left -rrb- and the fdp 's guido westerwelle .
" it will go right down to the wire on whether black-yellow manages to win on sept .

" that is why the tv debate could be decisive , " he told the sunday newspaper bild am so n n tag . a seco n d duel a poll released friday by public television network zdf showed the christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- with 43 percent support and the fdp with 7 percent - just enough to give them a governing majority . but even a slight shift away from either party could put the country on the road to a " grand coalition " featuring the cdu / csu and schröder 's social democrats , which tallied 32 percent in the zdf poll . bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder will face each other a second time , albeit not in a one-on-one duel , during a debate on sept .

they largely focused on domestic rather than foreign policy issues . with an estimated 15 million germans following the debate on germany 's four major tv channels , an aggressive merkel seemed eager to make up for her disadvantage of entering the duel in second place : polls had shown that most people expected schröder to win the debate .
sticking largely to domestic issues such as taxes , pensions and germany 's high unemployment levels , merkel continually returned to her christian democratic union 's message that only it can get germany 's 4.7 million unemployed back to work . bildunterschrift : " we are campaigning for a total change of policy , " she said , defending the radical tax reform laid out by her financial advisor , paul kirchhof . schröder countered that germans must not become " guinea pigs " for kirchhof 's ideas . it was wrong to ask " millionaires and nurses " to pay the same amount of tax , he added . managing katrina schröder and merkel also briefly touched on disaster management in the aftermath of hurricane katrina in the us . while merkel refused to comment on the issue , however , schröder said that us president george w. bush himself had described the slow relief effort as " unacceptable . "
the chancellor added that germany had handled catastrophic situations in a timelier manner in the past . bildunterschrift : national guard members carry an injured man to an awaiting helicopter near the new orleans superdome " it shows that you need a strong state for people in need , not a weak state , " schröder said .
" the structures that we have here work . " turkey , e n ergy issues turkey 's bid for eu membership also became an issue .
while merkel reiterated her view that turkey could not become a full member of the union and should instead be invited to a " privileged partnership , " schröder accused his challenger of failing to see the importance of integrating an islamic country into the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's stade nuclear plant has already been shut down .
merkel also said that she saw nuclear energy as part of a mix that was necessary to ensure germany 's power supply .
schröder 's red-green coalition has decided to phase out nuclear energy completely . what ki n d of coalitio n ? early polls of german television viewers said schröder was more convincing , with his challenger polling around half his score . but merkel , bidding to become germany 's first woman leader , appeared more assured in front of the cameras than many observers had predicted . while the debate is unlikely to affect merkel 's strong chance of becoming germany 's first woman chancellor , analysts said it could tip the scales for the coalition she is able to form . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with her dream coalition partners , the csu 's edmund stoiber -lrb- left -rrb- and the fdp 's guido westerwelle .
" it will go right down to the wire on whether black-yellow manages to win on sept .

" that is why the tv debate could be decisive , " he told the sunday newspaper bild am so n n tag . a seco n d duel a poll released friday by public television network zdf showed the christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- with 43 percent support and the fdp with 7 percent - just enough to give them a governing majority . but even a slight shift away from either party could put the country on the road to a " grand coalition " featuring the cdu / csu and schröder 's social democrats , which tallied 32 percent in the zdf poll . bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder will face each other a second time , albeit not in a one-on-one duel , during a debate on sept .

they largely focused on domestic rather than foreign policy issues . with an estimated 15 million germans following the debate on germany 's four major tv channels , an aggressive merkel seemed eager to make up for her disadvantage of entering the duel in second place : polls had shown that most people expected schröder to win the debate .
sticking largely to domestic issues such as taxes , pensions and germany 's high unemployment levels , merkel continually returned to her christian democratic union 's message that only it can get germany 's 4.7 million unemployed back to work . bildunterschrift : " we are campaigning for a total change of policy , " she said , defending the radical tax reform laid out by her financial advisor , paul kirchhof . schröder countered that germans must not become " guinea pigs " for kirchhof 's ideas . it was wrong to ask " millionaires and nurses " to pay the same amount of tax , he added . managing katrina schröder and merkel also briefly touched on disaster management in the aftermath of hurricane katrina in the us . while merkel refused to comment on the issue , however , schröder said that us president george w. bush himself had described the slow relief effort as " unacceptable .

schröder 's red-green coalition has decided to phase out nuclear energy completely . what ki n d of coalitio n ? early polls of german television viewers said schröder was more convincing , with his challenger polling around half his score . but merkel , bidding to become germany 's first woman leader , appeared more assured in front of the cameras than many observers had predicted . while the debate is unlikely to affect merkel 's strong chance of becoming germany 's first woman chancellor , analysts said it could tip the scales for the coalition she is able to form . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with her dream coalition partners , the csu 's edmund stoiber -lrb- left -rrb- and the fdp 's guido westerwelle .

four journalists from four television networks - public broadcasters ard and zdf as well as private channels rtl and sat.1 - will ask their questions .
in contrast to 2002 , candidates wo n't -lrb- always -rrb- be cut off mid-answer due to time constraints .
the director is supposed to focus on the arguments , not on sweating foreheads or jittery hands .
o n e or two debates ?
even before germany 's constitutional court gave the green light for early elections on sept .
18 , the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- had already agreed that their chancellor candidates would square off .
the question was how many times ?
once or twice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder on all channels chancellor schröder , not someone to shy away from a television camera nor a discussion , wanted two debates .
yet he did not want to push the matter .
" we should n't make this an election topic , " schröder said matter-of-factly .
" it has to do with content , it has to do with experience , with steadfastness , and sometimes to have the rigor to lead a country in a difficult situation .
we should n't forget this . "
disadva n tage for merkel ?
angela merkel and the cdu on the other hand were more hesitant in taking the plunge and step up in front of an estimated 20 million people against schröder .
yet recent polls reveal that over one-fifth of german voters would make their decision on whom to vote for based on the tv debates .
merkel can at times seem robotic and stiff in public .
she also has a propensity to impatience .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel during a tv interview " it is n't enough to moan like some are doing now , " she screamed at hecklers during a campaign appearance in warnermünde .
" what we should do , to put it bluntly , is to use our thick skulls so that we can work properly later . "
a n u n avoidable eve n t ?
the television debate , an american creation that swayed the us presidential election in 1960 , did n't make it to germany until 2002 .
it may not have proved as pivotal for gerhard schröder as it did for john f. kennedy four-and-a-half decades ago , but it did not hurt the chancellor .

four journalists from four television networks - public broadcasters ard and zdf as well as private channels rtl and sat.1 - will ask their questions .
in contrast to 2002 , candidates wo n't -lrb- always -rrb- be cut off mid-answer due to time constraints .
the director is supposed to focus on the arguments , not on sweating foreheads or jittery hands .
o n e or two debates ?
even before germany 's constitutional court gave the green light for early elections on sept .
18 , the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- had already agreed that their chancellor candidates would square off .
the question was how many times ?
once or twice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder on all channels chancellor schröder , not someone to shy away from a television camera nor a discussion , wanted two debates .
yet he did not want to push the matter .
" we should n't make this an election topic , " schröder said matter-of-factly .
" it has to do with content , it has to do with experience , with steadfastness , and sometimes to have the rigor to lead a country in a difficult situation .
we should n't forget this . "
disadva n tage for merkel ?
angela merkel and the cdu on the other hand were more hesitant in taking the plunge and step up in front of an estimated 20 million people against schröder .
yet recent polls reveal that over one-fifth of german voters would make their decision on whom to vote for based on the tv debates .
merkel can at times seem robotic and stiff in public .
she also has a propensity to impatience .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel during a tv interview " it is n't enough to moan like some are doing now , " she screamed at hecklers during a campaign appearance in warnermünde .
" what we should do , to put it bluntly , is to use our thick skulls so that we can work properly later . "
a n u n avoidable eve n t ?
the television debate , an american creation that swayed the us presidential election in 1960 , did n't make it to germany until 2002 .
it may not have proved as pivotal for gerhard schröder as it did for john f. kennedy four-and-a-half decades ago , but it did not hurt the chancellor .
schröder 's challenger then , edmund stoiber , whom many chuckled over words getting stuck in his craw , proved a formidable challenger to the media-savvy chancellor .
he also realized that the debate had become an unavoidable event in future elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we may complain about it or welcome it , " the eventual loser in the 2002 election said .
" it is a bit of americanization .
but i think that there probably wo n't be another parliamentary campaign without this direct discussion and confrontation between the chancellor and his challenger . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.09.2005 sparks fly in german election tv debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's four major channels televised the debate two weeks ahead of national elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder and his conservative challenger , angela merkel , met for a tv debate sunday .
they largely focused on domestic rather than foreign policy issues . with an estimated 15 million germans following the debate on germany 's four major tv channels , an aggressive merkel seemed eager to make up for her disadvantage of entering the duel in second place : polls had shown that most people expected schröder to win the debate .
sticking largely to domestic issues such as taxes , pensions and germany 's high unemployment levels , merkel continually returned to her christian democratic union 's message that only it can get germany 's 4.7 million unemployed back to work . bildunterschrift : " we are campaigning for a total change of policy , " she said , defending the radical tax reform laid out by her financial advisor , paul kirchhof . schröder countered that germans must not become " guinea pigs " for kirchhof 's ideas . it was wrong to ask " millionaires and nurses " to pay the same amount of tax , he added . managing katrina schröder and merkel also briefly touched on disaster management in the aftermath of hurricane katrina in the us . while merkel refused to comment on the issue , however , schröder said that us president george w. bush himself had described the slow relief effort as " unacceptable . "
the chancellor added that germany had handled catastrophic situations in a timelier manner in the past . bildunterschrift : national guard members carry an injured man to an awaiting helicopter near the new orleans superdome " it shows that you need a strong state for people in need , not a weak state , " schröder said .
" the structures that we have here work . " turkey , e n ergy issues turkey 's bid for eu membership also became an issue .
while merkel reiterated her view that turkey could not become a full member of the union and should instead be invited to a " privileged partnership , " schröder accused his challenger of failing to see the importance of integrating an islamic country into the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's stade nuclear plant has already been shut down .
merkel also said that she saw nuclear energy as part of a mix that was necessary to ensure germany 's power supply .
schröder 's red-green coalition has decided to phase out nuclear energy completely . what ki n d of coalitio n ? early polls of german television viewers said schröder was more convincing , with his challenger polling around half his score . but merkel , bidding to become germany 's first woman leader , appeared more assured in front of the cameras than many observers had predicted . while the debate is unlikely to affect merkel 's strong chance of becoming germany 's first woman chancellor , analysts said it could tip the scales for the coalition she is able to form . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with her dream coalition partners , the csu 's edmund stoiber -lrb- left -rrb- and the fdp 's guido westerwelle .
" it will go right down to the wire on whether black-yellow manages to win on sept .

they largely focused on domestic rather than foreign policy issues . with an estimated 15 million germans following the debate on germany 's four major tv channels , an aggressive merkel seemed eager to make up for her disadvantage of entering the duel in second place : polls had shown that most people expected schröder to win the debate .
sticking largely to domestic issues such as taxes , pensions and germany 's high unemployment levels , merkel continually returned to her christian democratic union 's message that only it can get germany 's 4.7 million unemployed back to work . bildunterschrift : " we are campaigning for a total change of policy , " she said , defending the radical tax reform laid out by her financial advisor , paul kirchhof . schröder countered that germans must not become " guinea pigs " for kirchhof 's ideas . it was wrong to ask " millionaires and nurses " to pay the same amount of tax , he added . managing katrina schröder and merkel also briefly touched on disaster management in the aftermath of hurricane katrina in the us . while merkel refused to comment on the issue , however , schröder said that us president george w. bush himself had described the slow relief effort as " unacceptable . "
the chancellor added that germany had handled catastrophic situations in a timelier manner in the past . bildunterschrift : national guard members carry an injured man to an awaiting helicopter near the new orleans superdome " it shows that you need a strong state for people in need , not a weak state , " schröder said .
" the structures that we have here work . " turkey , e n ergy issues turkey 's bid for eu membership also became an issue .
while merkel reiterated her view that turkey could not become a full member of the union and should instead be invited to a " privileged partnership , " schröder accused his challenger of failing to see the importance of integrating an islamic country into the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's stade nuclear plant has already been shut down .
merkel also said that she saw nuclear energy as part of a mix that was necessary to ensure germany 's power supply .
schröder 's red-green coalition has decided to phase out nuclear energy completely . what ki n d of coalitio n ? early polls of german television viewers said schröder was more convincing , with his challenger polling around half his score . but merkel , bidding to become germany 's first woman leader , appeared more assured in front of the cameras than many observers had predicted . while the debate is unlikely to affect merkel 's strong chance of becoming germany 's first woman chancellor , analysts said it could tip the scales for the coalition she is able to form . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with her dream coalition partners , the csu 's edmund stoiber -lrb- left -rrb- and the fdp 's guido westerwelle .
" it will go right down to the wire on whether black-yellow manages to win on sept .
18 , " said the director of independent polling institute infratest-dimap , reinhard hilmer , referring to the party colors of merkel 's favored coalition comprising her christian union alliance and the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .

four journalists from four television networks - public broadcasters ard and zdf as well as private channels rtl and sat.1 - will ask their questions .
in contrast to 2002 , candidates wo n't -lrb- always -rrb- be cut off mid-answer due to time constraints .
the director is supposed to focus on the arguments , not on sweating foreheads or jittery hands .
o n e or two debates ?
even before germany 's constitutional court gave the green light for early elections on sept .
18 , the ruling social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- had already agreed that their chancellor candidates would square off .
the question was how many times ?
once or twice .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder on all channels chancellor schröder , not someone to shy away from a television camera nor a discussion , wanted two debates .
yet he did not want to push the matter .
" we should n't make this an election topic , " schröder said matter-of-factly .
" it has to do with content , it has to do with experience , with steadfastness , and sometimes to have the rigor to lead a country in a difficult situation .
we should n't forget this . "
disadva n tage for merkel ?
angela merkel and the cdu on the other hand were more hesitant in taking the plunge and step up in front of an estimated 20 million people against schröder .
yet recent polls reveal that over one-fifth of german voters would make their decision on whom to vote for based on the tv debates .
merkel can at times seem robotic and stiff in public .
she also has a propensity to impatience .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel during a tv interview " it is n't enough to moan like some are doing now , " she screamed at hecklers during a campaign appearance in warnermünde .
" what we should do , to put it bluntly , is to use our thick skulls so that we can work properly later . "
a n u n avoidable eve n t ?
the television debate , an american creation that swayed the us presidential election in 1960 , did n't make it to germany until 2002 .
it may not have proved as pivotal for gerhard schröder as it did for john f. kennedy four-and-a-half decades ago , but it did not hurt the chancellor .
schröder 's challenger then , edmund stoiber , whom many chuckled over words getting stuck in his craw , proved a formidable challenger to the media-savvy chancellor .
he also realized that the debate had become an unavoidable event in future elections .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " we may complain about it or welcome it , " the eventual loser in the 2002 election said .

they largely focused on domestic rather than foreign policy issues . with an estimated 15 million germans following the debate on germany 's four major tv channels , an aggressive merkel seemed eager to make up for her disadvantage of entering the duel in second place : polls had shown that most people expected schröder to win the debate .
sticking largely to domestic issues such as taxes , pensions and germany 's high unemployment levels , merkel continually returned to her christian democratic union 's message that only it can get germany 's 4.7 million unemployed back to work . bildunterschrift : " we are campaigning for a total change of policy , " she said , defending the radical tax reform laid out by her financial advisor , paul kirchhof . schröder countered that germans must not become " guinea pigs " for kirchhof 's ideas . it was wrong to ask " millionaires and nurses " to pay the same amount of tax , he added . managing katrina schröder and merkel also briefly touched on disaster management in the aftermath of hurricane katrina in the us . while merkel refused to comment on the issue , however , schröder said that us president george w. bush himself had described the slow relief effort as " unacceptable . "
the chancellor added that germany had handled catastrophic situations in a timelier manner in the past . bildunterschrift : national guard members carry an injured man to an awaiting helicopter near the new orleans superdome " it shows that you need a strong state for people in need , not a weak state , " schröder said .
" the structures that we have here work . " turkey , e n ergy issues turkey 's bid for eu membership also became an issue .
while merkel reiterated her view that turkey could not become a full member of the union and should instead be invited to a " privileged partnership , " schröder accused his challenger of failing to see the importance of integrating an islamic country into the eu . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's stade nuclear plant has already been shut down .
merkel also said that she saw nuclear energy as part of a mix that was necessary to ensure germany 's power supply .
schröder 's red-green coalition has decided to phase out nuclear energy completely . what ki n d of coalitio n ? early polls of german television viewers said schröder was more convincing , with his challenger polling around half his score . but merkel , bidding to become germany 's first woman leader , appeared more assured in front of the cameras than many observers had predicted . while the debate is unlikely to affect merkel 's strong chance of becoming germany 's first woman chancellor , analysts said it could tip the scales for the coalition she is able to form . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with her dream coalition partners , the csu 's edmund stoiber -lrb- left -rrb- and the fdp 's guido westerwelle .
" it will go right down to the wire on whether black-yellow manages to win on sept .
18 , " said the director of independent polling institute infratest-dimap , reinhard hilmer , referring to the party colors of merkel 's favored coalition comprising her christian union alliance and the free-market liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- . " that is why the tv debate could be decisive , " he told the sunday newspaper bild am so n n tag . a seco n d duel a poll released friday by public television network zdf showed the christian union -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- with 43 percent support and the fdp with 7 percent - just enough to give them a governing majority . but even a slight shift away from either party could put the country on the road to a " grand coalition " featuring the cdu / csu and schröder 's social democrats , which tallied 32 percent in the zdf poll . bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder will face each other a second time , albeit not in a one-on-one duel , during a debate on sept .

william hubbs rehnquist was born in 1924 in a staunchly republican area of milwaukee , wisconsin , into a well-to-do family .
even as a child , he expressed a desire to make his mark , telling one of his teachers that his career plan was to " change the world " .
during world war ii he served as a volunteer civil defence officer before joining the army air corps .
an extremely bright student , william rehnquist earned degrees from both stanford and harvard universities before graduating top of his class at stanford law school in 1952 .
conservative transformation the same year , he began his legal career , serving for 18 months as a clerk to supreme court justice robert jackson , who had been the chief us prosecutor at the nuremberg war crimes trials .
from jackson , he took his favourite quote , one which followed him down the years : " we must never forget that the record on which we judge these defendants today is the record in which history will judge us tomorrow . "
rehnquist went on to serve as an assistant attorney general at the us department of justice , while also playing an active role in republican politics .
richard nixon nominated rehnquist for the supreme court in 1972 his reward finally came in 1971 , when that arch-republican , president richard nixon , nominated rehnquist to the supreme court .
during his time at the court , which he would head after being nominated to be the 16th chief justice by ronald reagan in 1986 , william rehnquist presided over a conservative transformation of what is arguably the most powerful institution in the united states .
rehnquist 's gut instincts - pro-states ' rights , anti-big government and anti- affirmative action - informed his legal opinions .
he did not win every argument - voting , for instance , against the legalisation of abortion as an associate justice in 1973 - but his conservative world-view often prevailed as successive republican appointees subtly shifted the supreme court to the right .
' a wiser man ' the political role of the chief justice is not confined to administering the oath of office at presidential inaugurations and , in recent years , rehnquist found himself presiding over a number of controversial cases .
in 1988 , he had voted in favour of the creation of an independent counsel , a senior prosecutor separate from the department of justice , charged with investigating alleged crimes at the very highest level .
and during the 1990s , special prosecutor kenneth starr twice investigated president bill clinton , over whitewater and monica lewinsky .
when the second case led to president clinton 's impeachment by the us senate , it was chief justice rehnquist who presided .
rehnquist presided over bush 's inauguration in january 2005 after president clinton 's acquittal , rehnquist reflected to senators : " i underwent the sort of culture shock that naturally occurs when one moves from the very structured environment of the supreme court , to what i shall call , for the want of a better phrase , the more free-form environment of the senate .
" i leave you now a wiser , but not a sadder , man . "
following the disputed presidential election of 2000 , rehnquist presided over the high court hearing which decided that there would be no second recount in florida , thereby handing the white house to george w bush .
while rehnquist often presented a solemn and austere figure , behind the scenes , he was described by colleagues as a down-to-earth person with a good sense of humour .
william rehnquist was diagnosed with thyroid cancer last autumn .
at the start of 2005 , and with the help of a walking stick , he presided over george w bush 's second inauguration , and administered the oath of office as usual .

hard-fi had rave reviews for their debut album , stars of cctv when mercury prize favourites kaiser chiefs bumped into hard-fi in chicago recently , the kaisers ' singer ricky wilson had a message for hard-fi 's frontman richard archer .
" ricky came up to me and he was really sweet , " archer says .
" he was like ' we 're well made up for you being nominated , we 're really pleased for you .
but if you win it , we 're going to kill you ' . "
and he meant it , archer says .
" the look in his eyes said it all . "
hailed as one of britain 's most refreshing new bands , hard-fi have been nominated for the tuneful mix of rock , pop , ska and disco on their debut album stars of cctv .
it went to number six when it was released in july and has spawned two top 20 singles - but has not been ranked among the favourites for the mercury by the bookies .
our recording budget is coldplay 's macrobiotic yoghurt budget richard archer hard-fi " we feel like outsiders so if they want to rank us as outsiders then that suits us fine , " archer says .
" we 're quite happy to come and gatecrash things . "
for a group who recorded the album themselves in a disused cab office in staines , just west of london , the nomination alone is seen as an achievement .
" when you think we made the album for £ 300 , it 's a vindication of what we 've done , " archer says .
" our recording budget is coldplay 's macrobiotic yoghurt budget . "
staines plays a big part on the album - the frustration and drama of being young in suburbia ooze out , as does the desire to escape .
i do n't want to spend my life working in a crappy job that i hate , trying to make ends meet and then you die richard archer -lrb- second right -rrb- " it 's just close enough to the city but no-one ever goes there , " archer says .
" there are loads of towns just like that , where you 're bored .
you 're bored of being bored .
you 're bored of having no money and you want to get out but you ca n't afford to move into the city .
" there 's nothing to do there , so you either make your own entertainment or you go crazy . "
music was the only alternative to a string of dead-end jobs - including collecting trolleys for supermarkets , data entry for british gas , and sitting " in a trench full of disinfectant peeling potatoes and onions " - archer says .
" i do n't want to spend my life working in a crappy job that i hate , trying to make ends meet and then you die , basically .
" my mum and dad did that and they always said ' if you can break out of that and follow your dreams you 've got to do it ' .
the band 's influences range from the clash to lee " scratch " perry " there 's so much pressure on you to consume , to buy , to borrow , that you fall into it .
i want to follow my own path , thanks , not one that 's pre-destined by society . "
no other british artists were writing about real life in the same way when hard-fi were making stars of cctv , the singer says .
" we 're singing about things that affected our lives and our friends ' lives or things that move us in some way because no-one for me has really done that since oasis . "
but rather than being downbeat , hard-fi 's album has a positive outlook - inspired , archer says , by 1960s soul music that has uplifting tunes while the lyrics " break your heart " .
the band 's influences stretch far and wide - when asked about their musical heroes , the list spans the clash , the rolling stones and ska stars the specials .
that 's life - it kicks you in the teeth just when you think you 've clawed your way out of a hole richard archer it also takes in reggae giant lee " scratch " perry , soul legend al green , electro-pop heroes new order and trip-hop pioneers massive attack .
that combination of influences helped their first major single , tied up too tight , reach number 15 in april while hard to beat went to number nine in june .
but the success was tinged with tragedy when archer 's mother died the week hard to beat went into the top 10 .
" it was extremely hard , " he says .
" instead of enjoying that moment , it was the pits of despair .
' extremely supportive ' " both of my parents were extremely supportive and the one thing they wanted was to see me do well .
" but unfortunately , that 's life sometimes - it kicks you in the teeth just when you think you 've clawed your way out of a hole . "
his record company said he could take time off , he says - but he did not want his band to waste the chance he and his parents had fought for .
" i was very conscious that you do n't get many opportunities in life and we had an opportunity , " archer says .
" we had a window .
me and my brother had already suffered - i did n't want to suffer again by losing the opportunity .
" there was no option , we just had to get back out there and make this happen . "

the plight of those stranded amid the filth and the dead has highlighted a side of the city most tourists did not see - one in which two-thirds of its residents are black and more than a quarter live in poverty .
anger is mounting among african-american leaders that this section was left behind when others fled .
some say the chaos in katrina 's aftermath has exposed deep divisions in both the city and us society .
" we can not allow it to be said by history that the difference between those who lived and ... died ... was nothing more than poverty , age or skin colour , " congressman elijah cummings said .
' paycheck to paycheck ' correspondents say new orleans ' glamorous reputation has always concealed a high level of deprivation .
new orleans 485,000 residents 10 times national murder rate 21 % of households without access to a car the city famous for its jazz clubs and horse-drawn carriage rides was also a place in which about one in three children lived in poverty , in one of the poorest states in the country .
observers say this group was particularly vulnerable in the face of a hurricane .
many of those trapped by katrina 's floodwaters lived in dilapidated neighbourhoods that were long known to be exposed to disaster if the levees failed .
and a large number would have had no means to flee the region as the storm loomed - a recent us census found that one-fifth of the city 's residents had no access to a car .
" we do n't have transportation , " one resident told whbf-tv .
" we 're living paycheck to paycheck , it 's not like we 're just able to get up and leave . "
a former leader of the black caucus in the house of representatives agrees .
" it is one thing to receive a warning to get out - it 's something else to have the ability to get out , " congressman james clyburn said .
uneasy questions black members of congress have also criticised the pace of relief efforts .
some say the response was slow because those most affected are poor .
i 'm ashamed of america .
i 'm ashamed of our government congresswoman carolyn kilpatrick " i 'm ashamed of america .
i 'm ashamed of our government , " congresswoman carolyn kilpatrick said .
" george bush does n't care about black people , " rapper kanye west told viewers of an nbc benefit concert for hurricane victims .
other commentators object to the media 's handling of the crisis .
" television is creating a sympathetic image of white people fleeing , and black people caught up in a shoplifting orgy , " lawrence aaron wrote in new jersey 's record .
but some hope that the aftermath of the hurricane will force people to confront the issue of inequality .
" most cities have a hidden , or not always talked about , poor population , black and white , and most of the time we look past them , " spencer crew , the chief of a cincinnati civil rights centre , told the new york times .
" this is a moment in time when we ca n't look past them .
their plight is coming to the forefront now , " he said .

anger is mounting among african-american leaders that this section was left behind when others fled .
some say the chaos in katrina 's aftermath has exposed deep divisions in both the city and us society .
" we can not allow it to be said by history that the difference between those who lived and ... died ... was nothing more than poverty , age or skin colour , " congressman elijah cummings said .
' paycheck to paycheck ' correspondents say new orleans ' glamorous reputation has always concealed a high level of deprivation .
new orleans 485,000 residents 10 times national murder rate 21 % of households without access to a car the city famous for its jazz clubs and horse-drawn carriage rides was also a place in which about one in three children lived in poverty , in one of the poorest states in the country .
observers say this group was particularly vulnerable in the face of a hurricane .
many of those trapped by katrina 's floodwaters lived in dilapidated neighbourhoods that were long known to be exposed to disaster if the levees failed .
and a large number would have had no means to flee the region as the storm loomed - a recent us census found that one-fifth of the city 's residents had no access to a car .
" we do n't have transportation , " one resident told whbf-tv .
" we 're living paycheck to paycheck , it 's not like we 're just able to get up and leave . "
a former leader of the black caucus in the house of representatives agrees .
" it is one thing to receive a warning to get out - it 's something else to have the ability to get out , " congressman james clyburn said .
uneasy questions black members of congress have also criticised the pace of relief efforts .
some say the response was slow because those most affected are poor .
i 'm ashamed of america .
i 'm ashamed of our government congresswoman carolyn kilpatrick " i 'm ashamed of america .
i 'm ashamed of our government , " congresswoman carolyn kilpatrick said .
" george bush does n't care about black people , " rapper kanye west told viewers of an nbc benefit concert for hurricane victims .
other commentators object to the media 's handling of the crisis .
" television is creating a sympathetic image of white people fleeing , and black people caught up in a shoplifting orgy , " lawrence aaron wrote in new jersey 's record .
but some hope that the aftermath of the hurricane will force people to confront the issue of inequality .
" most cities have a hidden , or not always talked about , poor population , black and white , and most of the time we look past them , " spencer crew , the chief of a cincinnati civil rights centre , told the new york times .
" this is a moment in time when we ca n't look past them .
their plight is coming to the forefront now , " he said .

readers recount their experiences from some of the worst affected areas .
mobile , alabama michael nickerson checks the damage sustained to his house in mobile everyone has seen the devastation done by hurricane katrina in new orleans , gulfport , biloxi , and pascagoula .
not everyone has seen or heard of the devastation here in my own home of mobile .
the majority of our county of 200-250 000 people are without power , fuel , food , and in some areas clean drinking water .
we are not a major metropolis like new orleans , and we do n't have fancy casinos like biloxi , but what we do have are our people who , despite surviving two category four hurricanes in less than a year , still find the courage and compassion to help each other and those in more desperate need like the people of biloxi / gulfport and new orleans .
we are thankful we did n't take a direct hit , but we did none-the-less take a big hit .
all we ask is that you keep us in mobile , alabama in your hearts and prayers with the others in our area who have nothing to come home to , much less to call home .
we ask that those of you in the international community to help in any way you can .
we are not on the same side of the earth as indonesia or thailand - but right now we are just a stones throw away .
mackie smith , mobile , alabama , usa i live on the eastern shore of mobile bay .
we stayed at my grandparent 's house during the storm .
at about 8:00 am , the power went out , and we had no idea of the extent of the damage that was about to happen to the area around us .
after the storm was over , we came back home .
even though daphne did not get much of the storm , there was still extensive damage .
one state trooper that lived near us had a huge oak tree fall on top of his house , the power lines in the street .
some were trapped on their roads with no way to get out .
we came to our house , and luckily we had a lot of debris in our yard and pool , but no damage .
while the power was out , the whole street worked together to get everything as close to normal as possible , but since we had limited contact with new sources , we had no idea what had happened .
finally , we got the power back .
if we did n't live near an area that required power immediately , it would have been days , perhaps weeks , before anything would have happened .
we were glued to the television , seeing many of the areas we were used to passing by every day destroyed .
it is a terrible feeling to see something that you 're used to seeing every day not there .
on a causeway connecting the eastern shore of mobile bay to mobile , there are no businesses .
favourite family icons and restaurants are destroyed .
peyton , daphne , alabama , usa return to the top biloxi , mississippi a stranded boat on the waterfront of biloxi our family are sitting in tallahassee florida watching the storm that could destroy our house .
we live in biloxi , close to where they think the worst winds will be .
it is really surreal watching it on tv , knowing your home and possessions may not be around in 24-hours time .
our children are worried and frightened for the future as are we .
wherever this goes there will be death and destruction , no doubt about it , unless a miracle happens .
linda larson , biloxi , mississippi - usa originally from oxford , my family and i are here anxiously awaiting katrina .
we have gone through several hurricanes , but always managed to find ourselves on the western side of the landfall -lrb- the better side - if you can say that -rrb- .we have just had the first of the feeder bands go over the top of us , which marks the beginning of a long 24 hours .
it is quite surreal to be here writing about a storm , that congers images of an atomic bomb aftermath .
but , that is what a category five storm does .
we are anticipating a storm surge of 30 feet .
yes , the entire gulf of mexico will rise by 30 ft .
we are also currently in a tornado warning , which is quite the ' norm ' for being on the northeast side .
so apart from the 165mph winds , tornados , torrential rain and floods , it 's just another day in paradise .
mal woodcock , biloxi , ms i am in the heart of the devastation here .
and that is the only word to describe it .
i am very lucky to have internet access .
no phone , no power , no running water .
we are running on a generator and dsl line .
my children evacuated with my mother and i am here .
i do not know when i will ever see my kids again .
it is not pretty here .
everything is gone .
wealthy and poor alike stand in the same lines for water and ice and mre 's .
lynnda , biloxi ms usa i presently at my job at a large federal hospital in biloxi , mississippi .
through my window i can see biloxi back bay and the surges look to be about four feet .
soon it should washing up to our parking lot , which is about 100 feet from our hospital .
normally the bay is like glass .
also , the intense winds -lrb- probably about 150 / miles per hour -rrb- are blowing debri and chunks of the roof .
listening to the radio i already heard that homes have been destroyed on the mississippi coast and highway 90 -lrb- beach blvd -rrb- is under water .
those familiar with biloxi is where the large casinos are .
the problem is the eye of the storm is not due for about another four hours , hope we make it .
alan cooper , gautier , mississippi return to the top gulfport , mississippi my town is gone .
the winds and waves have taken a once great beach side town and totally washed it away .
i do n't know how long it will take to rebuild and i 'm not sure if i will go back and rebuild .
please keep us in your thoughts .
j. vickery , gulfport , mississippi a military policeman surveys the damage in gulfport my friend did not evacuate gulfport , mississippi where there is 10 + feet of water .
i spoke to her the night before the hurricane made landfall .
all she had told me was that she was 15 miles inland in gulfport and she had to go because they would n't have power to charge her mobile phone and she wanted to save the battery so she could call me and my boyfriend as well as other friends and family to tell us she was alright .
i am hoping that she was in a shelter and i am distraught at the fact that i do not know that her and the children are safe and it may be weeks until they get the mobile towers operating again .
i ca n't even receive incoming calls because i have a biloxi , mississippi mobile number and i reside 9 hours away on the northeast coast of florida .
courtney , jacksonville , fl , united states the inhabitants of my coastal city hope and pray for the best as we try our best to make it out of here .
it 's going to be a long night .
arianna m , gulfport , ms , usa new orleans , louisiana supplies are handed to new orleans residents we were ready to come to terms with losing our homes , jobs , and possessions due to a natural disaster .
now we are hearing stories from people still in new orleans of armed gangs looting the homes and businesses that survived the flood waters .
our possessions are not so much the issue .
one police officer has already been shot by looters .
there are rescue workers risking their lives to save people trapped in their homes , and now these heroes and the survivors are in danger from armed looters .
our city looks like a war zone and the feeling of desperation has given way to anger that our president can send thousands of troops halfway around the world to " secure our country 's freedoms " yet the military presence in new orleans is so limited that we ca n't even protect our own people in our own country .
we have not even heard of any solutions from the white house to secure the city .
i ca n't even imagine what we come home to .
a beautiful city has been lost and it is heartbreaking to watch it be dismantled by its own people .
jessica marrero , new orleans , la usa i am a graduate student at tulane university , new orleans .
i evacuated just before the storm to a place on a ridge just north of new orleans .
it was a farmhouse in the middle of a forest .
half the trees in the woods there are down .
a couple of trees fell on the house i was taking shelter in .
the last two days we cleared the trees from the road leading to the main road and finally made our way to florida .
there is no news as to when school will reopen .
there are apprehensions here that the city of new orleans will be declared a dead city .
gautam , new orleans , usa while my brother and i are taking our chances on the tenth floor of our medical school residence hall , the rest of my family evacuated today .
unfortunately they are stuck in congested traffic with the thousands that decided to leave at the last minute .
the problem is we do n't even know when they will stop because nearly all the hotels in the state are already occupied !
yazen joudeh , new orleans , louisiana usa i fled the city last saturday and relocated with many in my office to monroe la .
every hotel to dallas is full .
it 's late and i just heard from a phone call on television that a levee on the 17th street canal has breeched and the lake is pouring into the city .
i took a chance and stayed when ivan hit and i was lucky .
i took no chances this time .
thanks to satellite images and the web we all knew this was bad .
this is your space program at work .
rick baxter , new orleans , usa i am in the midst of the hurricane at the moment , on the south shore of lake ponchatrain .
the eyewall is currently passing just east of here .
although the wind gusts are extremely forceful , filling the streets with branches and roof slates , all structures in this neighbourhood seem to be holding up well .
the drains are clear and working well .
electricity , water , and radio reception are all gone .
we are all hoping that the worst will soon be over .
lori frey ribeiro , new orleans , usa after a 12-hour ride from new orleans to jackson -lrb- the trip would normally take 3 hours -rrb- we are holed up in a school gymnasium .
everyone is bracing for the full brunt of the hurricane sometime tomorrow .
all laptops and televisions are on some weather channel .
the wind has picked up but not to any speed that would signal what is likely to be a story many will be talking about for the rest of the year .
all foreign students from around the globe -lrb- myself included -rrb- are keeping constant contact with family and friends .
the question on most people 's minds is how deadly will katrina 's kiss be ?
masimba fortune ngandu , new orleans , usa the scene here looks like something from the apocalypse .
people are running around the city , terrified about what to do .
those who are leaving have clogged the roadways so extensively that little hope remains for those who have not yet decided to leave .
gas stations are breeding grounds for fighting and riots , as people are resorting to a state of martial law in order to get the precious gasoline they need to move their vehicles .
this truly is the worst part of the storm and it only looks to get worse .
god be with everyone who is trying to escape the madness .

it is quite surreal to be here writing about a storm , that congers images of an atomic bomb aftermath .
but , that is what a category five storm does .
we are anticipating a storm surge of 30 feet .
yes , the entire gulf of mexico will rise by 30 ft .
we are also currently in a tornado warning , which is quite the ' norm ' for being on the northeast side .
so apart from the 165mph winds , tornados , torrential rain and floods , it 's just another day in paradise .

readers recount their experiences from some of the worst affected areas .
mobile , alabama michael nickerson checks the damage sustained to his house in mobile everyone has seen the devastation done by hurricane katrina in new orleans , gulfport , biloxi , and pascagoula .
not everyone has seen or heard of the devastation here in my own home of mobile .
the majority of our county of 200-250 000 people are without power , fuel , food , and in some areas clean drinking water .
we are not a major metropolis like new orleans , and we do n't have fancy casinos like biloxi , but what we do have are our people who , despite surviving two category four hurricanes in less than a year , still find the courage and compassion to help each other and those in more desperate need like the people of biloxi / gulfport and new orleans .
we are thankful we did n't take a direct hit , but we did none-the-less take a big hit .
all we ask is that you keep us in mobile , alabama in your hearts and prayers with the others in our area who have nothing to come home to , much less to call home .
we ask that those of you in the international community to help in any way you can .
we are not on the same side of the earth as indonesia or thailand - but right now we are just a stones throw away .
mackie smith , mobile , alabama , usa i live on the eastern shore of mobile bay .
we stayed at my grandparent 's house during the storm .
at about 8:00 am , the power went out , and we had no idea of the extent of the damage that was about to happen to the area around us .
after the storm was over , we came back home .
even though daphne did not get much of the storm , there was still extensive damage .
one state trooper that lived near us had a huge oak tree fall on top of his house , the power lines in the street .
some were trapped on their roads with no way to get out .
we came to our house , and luckily we had a lot of debris in our yard and pool , but no damage .
while the power was out , the whole street worked together to get everything as close to normal as possible , but since we had limited contact with new sources , we had no idea what had happened .
finally , we got the power back .
if we did n't live near an area that required power immediately , it would have been days , perhaps weeks , before anything would have happened .
we were glued to the television , seeing many of the areas we were used to passing by every day destroyed .
it is a terrible feeling to see something that you 're used to seeing every day not there .

readers recount their experiences from some of the worst affected areas .
mobile , alabama michael nickerson checks the damage sustained to his house in mobile everyone has seen the devastation done by hurricane katrina in new orleans , gulfport , biloxi , and pascagoula .
not everyone has seen or heard of the devastation here in my own home of mobile .
the majority of our county of 200-250 000 people are without power , fuel , food , and in some areas clean drinking water .
we are not a major metropolis like new orleans , and we do n't have fancy casinos like biloxi , but what we do have are our people who , despite surviving two category four hurricanes in less than a year , still find the courage and compassion to help each other and those in more desperate need like the people of biloxi / gulfport and new orleans .
we are thankful we did n't take a direct hit , but we did none-the-less take a big hit .
all we ask is that you keep us in mobile , alabama in your hearts and prayers with the others in our area who have nothing to come home to , much less to call home .
we ask that those of you in the international community to help in any way you can .
we are not on the same side of the earth as indonesia or thailand - but right now we are just a stones throw away .
mackie smith , mobile , alabama , usa i live on the eastern shore of mobile bay .
we stayed at my grandparent 's house during the storm .
at about 8:00 am , the power went out , and we had no idea of the extent of the damage that was about to happen to the area around us .
after the storm was over , we came back home .
even though daphne did not get much of the storm , there was still extensive damage .
one state trooper that lived near us had a huge oak tree fall on top of his house , the power lines in the street .
some were trapped on their roads with no way to get out .
we came to our house , and luckily we had a lot of debris in our yard and pool , but no damage .
while the power was out , the whole street worked together to get everything as close to normal as possible , but since we had limited contact with new sources , we had no idea what had happened .
finally , we got the power back .
if we did n't live near an area that required power immediately , it would have been days , perhaps weeks , before anything would have happened .
we were glued to the television , seeing many of the areas we were used to passing by every day destroyed .
it is a terrible feeling to see something that you 're used to seeing every day not there .
on a causeway connecting the eastern shore of mobile bay to mobile , there are no businesses .
favourite family icons and restaurants are destroyed .
peyton , daphne , alabama , usa return to the top biloxi , mississippi a stranded boat on the waterfront of biloxi our family are sitting in tallahassee florida watching the storm that could destroy our house .
we live in biloxi , close to where they think the worst winds will be .
it is really surreal watching it on tv , knowing your home and possessions may not be around in 24-hours time .
our children are worried and frightened for the future as are we .
wherever this goes there will be death and destruction , no doubt about it , unless a miracle happens .
linda larson , biloxi , mississippi - usa originally from oxford , my family and i are here anxiously awaiting katrina .
we have gone through several hurricanes , but always managed to find ourselves on the western side of the landfall -lrb- the better side - if you can say that -rrb- .we have just had the first of the feeder bands go over the top of us , which marks the beginning of a long 24 hours .
it is quite surreal to be here writing about a storm , that congers images of an atomic bomb aftermath .
but , that is what a category five storm does .
we are anticipating a storm surge of 30 feet .
yes , the entire gulf of mexico will rise by 30 ft .
we are also currently in a tornado warning , which is quite the ' norm ' for being on the northeast side .
so apart from the 165mph winds , tornados , torrential rain and floods , it 's just another day in paradise .
mal woodcock , biloxi , ms i am in the heart of the devastation here .
and that is the only word to describe it .
i am very lucky to have internet access .
no phone , no power , no running water .
we are running on a generator and dsl line .
my children evacuated with my mother and i am here .
i do not know when i will ever see my kids again .
it is not pretty here .
everything is gone .
wealthy and poor alike stand in the same lines for water and ice and mre 's .
lynnda , biloxi ms usa i presently at my job at a large federal hospital in biloxi , mississippi .
through my window i can see biloxi back bay and the surges look to be about four feet .
soon it should washing up to our parking lot , which is about 100 feet from our hospital .
normally the bay is like glass .
also , the intense winds -lrb- probably about 150 / miles per hour -rrb- are blowing debri and chunks of the roof .
listening to the radio i already heard that homes have been destroyed on the mississippi coast and highway 90 -lrb- beach blvd -rrb- is under water .
those familiar with biloxi is where the large casinos are .
the problem is the eye of the storm is not due for about another four hours , hope we make it .
alan cooper , gautier , mississippi return to the top gulfport , mississippi my town is gone .
the winds and waves have taken a once great beach side town and totally washed it away .
i do n't know how long it will take to rebuild and i 'm not sure if i will go back and rebuild .
please keep us in your thoughts .
j. vickery , gulfport , mississippi a military policeman surveys the damage in gulfport my friend did not evacuate gulfport , mississippi where there is 10 + feet of water .
i spoke to her the night before the hurricane made landfall .
all she had told me was that she was 15 miles inland in gulfport and she had to go because they would n't have power to charge her mobile phone and she wanted to save the battery so she could call me and my boyfriend as well as other friends and family to tell us she was alright .
i am hoping that she was in a shelter and i am distraught at the fact that i do not know that her and the children are safe and it may be weeks until they get the mobile towers operating again .
i ca n't even receive incoming calls because i have a biloxi , mississippi mobile number and i reside 9 hours away on the northeast coast of florida .
courtney , jacksonville , fl , united states the inhabitants of my coastal city hope and pray for the best as we try our best to make it out of here .
it 's going to be a long night .
arianna m , gulfport , ms , usa new orleans , louisiana supplies are handed to new orleans residents we were ready to come to terms with losing our homes , jobs , and possessions due to a natural disaster .
now we are hearing stories from people still in new orleans of armed gangs looting the homes and businesses that survived the flood waters .
our possessions are not so much the issue .
one police officer has already been shot by looters .
there are rescue workers risking their lives to save people trapped in their homes , and now these heroes and the survivors are in danger from armed looters .
our city looks like a war zone and the feeling of desperation has given way to anger that our president can send thousands of troops halfway around the world to " secure our country 's freedoms " yet the military presence in new orleans is so limited that we ca n't even protect our own people in our own country .
we have not even heard of any solutions from the white house to secure the city .
i ca n't even imagine what we come home to .
a beautiful city has been lost and it is heartbreaking to watch it be dismantled by its own people .
jessica marrero , new orleans , la usa i am a graduate student at tulane university , new orleans .
i evacuated just before the storm to a place on a ridge just north of new orleans .
it was a farmhouse in the middle of a forest .
half the trees in the woods there are down .
a couple of trees fell on the house i was taking shelter in .
the last two days we cleared the trees from the road leading to the main road and finally made our way to florida .
there is no news as to when school will reopen .
there are apprehensions here that the city of new orleans will be declared a dead city .
gautam , new orleans , usa while my brother and i are taking our chances on the tenth floor of our medical school residence hall , the rest of my family evacuated today .
unfortunately they are stuck in congested traffic with the thousands that decided to leave at the last minute .
the problem is we do n't even know when they will stop because nearly all the hotels in the state are already occupied !
yazen joudeh , new orleans , louisiana usa i fled the city last saturday and relocated with many in my office to monroe la .
every hotel to dallas is full .
it 's late and i just heard from a phone call on television that a levee on the 17th street canal has breeched and the lake is pouring into the city .
i took a chance and stayed when ivan hit and i was lucky .
i took no chances this time .
thanks to satellite images and the web we all knew this was bad .
this is your space program at work .
rick baxter , new orleans , usa i am in the midst of the hurricane at the moment , on the south shore of lake ponchatrain .
the eyewall is currently passing just east of here .
although the wind gusts are extremely forceful , filling the streets with branches and roof slates , all structures in this neighbourhood seem to be holding up well .
the drains are clear and working well .
electricity , water , and radio reception are all gone .
we are all hoping that the worst will soon be over .
lori frey ribeiro , new orleans , usa after a 12-hour ride from new orleans to jackson -lrb- the trip would normally take 3 hours -rrb- we are holed up in a school gymnasium .
everyone is bracing for the full brunt of the hurricane sometime tomorrow .
all laptops and televisions are on some weather channel .
the wind has picked up but not to any speed that would signal what is likely to be a story many will be talking about for the rest of the year .
all foreign students from around the globe -lrb- myself included -rrb- are keeping constant contact with family and friends .
the question on most people 's minds is how deadly will katrina 's kiss be ?
masimba fortune ngandu , new orleans , usa the scene here looks like something from the apocalypse .
people are running around the city , terrified about what to do .
those who are leaving have clogged the roadways so extensively that little hope remains for those who have not yet decided to leave .
gas stations are breeding grounds for fighting and riots , as people are resorting to a state of martial law in order to get the precious gasoline they need to move their vehicles .
this truly is the worst part of the storm and it only looks to get worse .

readers recount their experiences from some of the worst affected areas .
mobile , alabama michael nickerson checks the damage sustained to his house in mobile everyone has seen the devastation done by hurricane katrina in new orleans , gulfport , biloxi , and pascagoula .
not everyone has seen or heard of the devastation here in my own home of mobile .
the majority of our county of 200-250 000 people are without power , fuel , food , and in some areas clean drinking water .
we are not a major metropolis like new orleans , and we do n't have fancy casinos like biloxi , but what we do have are our people who , despite surviving two category four hurricanes in less than a year , still find the courage and compassion to help each other and those in more desperate need like the people of biloxi / gulfport and new orleans .
we are thankful we did n't take a direct hit , but we did none-the-less take a big hit .
all we ask is that you keep us in mobile , alabama in your hearts and prayers with the others in our area who have nothing to come home to , much less to call home .
we ask that those of you in the international community to help in any way you can .
we are not on the same side of the earth as indonesia or thailand - but right now we are just a stones throw away .
mackie smith , mobile , alabama , usa i live on the eastern shore of mobile bay .
we stayed at my grandparent 's house during the storm .
at about 8:00 am , the power went out , and we had no idea of the extent of the damage that was about to happen to the area around us .
after the storm was over , we came back home .
even though daphne did not get much of the storm , there was still extensive damage .
one state trooper that lived near us had a huge oak tree fall on top of his house , the power lines in the street .
some were trapped on their roads with no way to get out .
we came to our house , and luckily we had a lot of debris in our yard and pool , but no damage .
while the power was out , the whole street worked together to get everything as close to normal as possible , but since we had limited contact with new sources , we had no idea what had happened .
finally , we got the power back .
if we did n't live near an area that required power immediately , it would have been days , perhaps weeks , before anything would have happened .
we were glued to the television , seeing many of the areas we were used to passing by every day destroyed .
it is a terrible feeling to see something that you 're used to seeing every day not there .
on a causeway connecting the eastern shore of mobile bay to mobile , there are no businesses .
favourite family icons and restaurants are destroyed .
peyton , daphne , alabama , usa return to the top biloxi , mississippi a stranded boat on the waterfront of biloxi our family are sitting in tallahassee florida watching the storm that could destroy our house .
we live in biloxi , close to where they think the worst winds will be .
it is really surreal watching it on tv , knowing your home and possessions may not be around in 24-hours time .
our children are worried and frightened for the future as are we .
wherever this goes there will be death and destruction , no doubt about it , unless a miracle happens .
linda larson , biloxi , mississippi - usa originally from oxford , my family and i are here anxiously awaiting katrina .
we have gone through several hurricanes , but always managed to find ourselves on the western side of the landfall -lrb- the better side - if you can say that -rrb- .we have just had the first of the feeder bands go over the top of us , which marks the beginning of a long 24 hours .
it is quite surreal to be here writing about a storm , that congers images of an atomic bomb aftermath .
but , that is what a category five storm does .
we are anticipating a storm surge of 30 feet .
yes , the entire gulf of mexico will rise by 30 ft .
we are also currently in a tornado warning , which is quite the ' norm ' for being on the northeast side .
so apart from the 165mph winds , tornados , torrential rain and floods , it 's just another day in paradise .
mal woodcock , biloxi , ms i am in the heart of the devastation here .
and that is the only word to describe it .
i am very lucky to have internet access .
no phone , no power , no running water .
we are running on a generator and dsl line .
my children evacuated with my mother and i am here .
i do not know when i will ever see my kids again .
it is not pretty here .
everything is gone .
wealthy and poor alike stand in the same lines for water and ice and mre 's .
lynnda , biloxi ms usa i presently at my job at a large federal hospital in biloxi , mississippi .
through my window i can see biloxi back bay and the surges look to be about four feet .
soon it should washing up to our parking lot , which is about 100 feet from our hospital .
normally the bay is like glass .
also , the intense winds -lrb- probably about 150 / miles per hour -rrb- are blowing debri and chunks of the roof .
listening to the radio i already heard that homes have been destroyed on the mississippi coast and highway 90 -lrb- beach blvd -rrb- is under water .
those familiar with biloxi is where the large casinos are .
the problem is the eye of the storm is not due for about another four hours , hope we make it .
alan cooper , gautier , mississippi return to the top gulfport , mississippi my town is gone .
the winds and waves have taken a once great beach side town and totally washed it away .
i do n't know how long it will take to rebuild and i 'm not sure if i will go back and rebuild .

one state trooper that lived near us had a huge oak tree fall on top of his house , the power lines in the street .
some were trapped on their roads with no way to get out .
we came to our house , and luckily we had a lot of debris in our yard and pool , but no damage .
while the power was out , the whole street worked together to get everything as close to normal as possible , but since we had limited contact with new sources , we had no idea what had happened .
finally , we got the power back .
if we did n't live near an area that required power immediately , it would have been days , perhaps weeks , before anything would have happened .
we were glued to the television , seeing many of the areas we were used to passing by every day destroyed .
it is a terrible feeling to see something that you 're used to seeing every day not there .
on a causeway connecting the eastern shore of mobile bay to mobile , there are no businesses .

linda larson , biloxi , mississippi - usa originally from oxford , my family and i are here anxiously awaiting katrina .

it is quite surreal to be here writing about a storm , that congers images of an atomic bomb aftermath .
but , that is what a category five storm does .
we are anticipating a storm surge of 30 feet .
yes , the entire gulf of mexico will rise by 30 ft .
we are also currently in a tornado warning , which is quite the ' norm ' for being on the northeast side .
so apart from the 165mph winds , tornados , torrential rain and floods , it 's just another day in paradise .
mal woodcock , biloxi , ms i am in the heart of the devastation here .
and that is the only word to describe it .
i am very lucky to have internet access .

j. vickery , gulfport , mississippi a military policeman surveys the damage in gulfport my friend did not evacuate gulfport , mississippi where there is 10 + feet of water .
i spoke to her the night before the hurricane made landfall .
all she had told me was that she was 15 miles inland in gulfport and she had to go because they would n't have power to charge her mobile phone and she wanted to save the battery so she could call me and my boyfriend as well as other friends and family to tell us she was alright .
i am hoping that she was in a shelter and i am distraught at the fact that i do not know that her and the children are safe and it may be weeks until they get the mobile towers operating again .
i ca n't even receive incoming calls because i have a biloxi , mississippi mobile number and i reside 9 hours away on the northeast coast of florida .

arianna m , gulfport , ms , usa new orleans , louisiana supplies are handed to new orleans residents we were ready to come to terms with losing our homes , jobs , and possessions due to a natural disaster .
now we are hearing stories from people still in new orleans of armed gangs looting the homes and businesses that survived the flood waters .
our possessions are not so much the issue .
one police officer has already been shot by looters .
there are rescue workers risking their lives to save people trapped in their homes , and now these heroes and the survivors are in danger from armed looters .
our city looks like a war zone and the feeling of desperation has given way to anger that our president can send thousands of troops halfway around the world to " secure our country 's freedoms " yet the military presence in new orleans is so limited that we ca n't even protect our own people in our own country .
we have not even heard of any solutions from the white house to secure the city .
i ca n't even imagine what we come home to .
a beautiful city has been lost and it is heartbreaking to watch it be dismantled by its own people .

i took no chances this time .
thanks to satellite images and the web we all knew this was bad .

readers recount their experiences from some of the worst affected areas .
mobile , alabama everyone has seen the devastation done by hurricane katrina in new orleans , gulfport , biloxi , and pascagoula .
not everyone has seen or heard of the devastation here in my own home of mobile .
the majority of our county of 200-250 000 people are without power , fuel , food , and in some areas clean drinking water .
we are not a major metropolis like new orleans , and we do n't have fancy casinos like biloxi , but what we do have are our people who , despite surviving two category four hurricanes in less than a year , still find the courage and compassion to help each other and those in more desperate need like the people of biloxi / gulfport and new orleans .
we are thankful we did n't take a direct hit , but we did none-the-less take a big hit .
all we ask is that you keep us in mobile , alabama in your hearts and prayers with the others in our area who have nothing to come home to , much less to call home .
we ask that those of you in the international community to help in any way you can .
we are not on the same side of the earth as indonesia or thailand - but right now we are just a stones throw away .
mackie smith , mobile , alabama , usa i live on the eastern shore of mobile bay .
