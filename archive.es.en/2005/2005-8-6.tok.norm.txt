angst over the hovering specter of unemployment reached an all-time high last january as the number of unemployed climbed to over five million .
germany 's neighbors have similar problems , but the fear seems less severe . " germany is a country in which many people are unhappy and do n't have a job any more , " a dutch correspondent once described the ' german disease . '
" if they do , however , have a job , then they want to work as little as possible . " the questions is what has gone wrong in germany so that the mood has soured to this degree and politicians lack the courage to lead with confidence .
high unemployment has seemingly laid germany lame .
everyone today has an unemployed friend or relative , said bernd bohn , a psychologist at the university of bremen .
and thus the feeling has spread : nothing is secure any more , the question is only : when will it hit me ?
in neighboring countries , however , the problem is dealt with differently . " we saw in britain in the 1970s how maggie thatcher gave a proper crash course in flexibility , " bohn said .
a more relaxed approach was taken in the netherlands in the late 1980s , when all societal groups - workers , corporations , politicians and unions - pulled together and agreed that something has to change . " we have to become more flexible , " bohn said .
" for example , when we are unemployed , then we must be prepared to work for three or six months at ' below cost . " ' gainful employment is n't everything bildunterschrift : getting training to find a new job flexibility is the magic word for industrial psychologists .
examples are to be found in britian and the usa .
here , as in germany , many people find themselves temporarily without work , but there they use the time to gain further qualifications to give them competitive advantage in the job market . german politicians attack the problem too one-sidedly by constantly blaming the private economy for not creating more jobs .
there has to be a mental paradigm shift , bohn said . " we continue to define ourselves primarily through our occupation , and this is , after all , the basis for our material existence , " he added .
" if we could have a change in attitude at the societal level , then that would provide a foundation for dealing with unemployment on an individual basis . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caring for the elderly is not valued enough gainful employment is not the only way to justify one 's self , one 's personality , and feeling of self-worth , bohn said .
society should place more value on volunteer work and other occupations that benefit society at large . generous insurance and efficient placements the danes also changed their mental attitudes after the economic crisis a decade ago .
the tiny northern neighbor has an extremely flexible labor market with hardly any protection against getting fired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 'll get generous unemployment money should she need it instead denmark has one of europe 's most generous unemployment insurance plans .
it pays up to 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,226 -rrb- per month over a four-year period .
at the same time , job placement programs find tailor made traineeships , even if the demands on the job seekers are quite high . the austrians have also begun to feel the crunch in the past years .
there the long-term unemployed are still better compensated than in germany , and the placement system is more efficient .
in the alpine republic , the rule is : if the placement agencies work efficiently , then the state can be more generous . monika lohmüller -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder under attack for remarks german chancellor gerhard schröder has come under fire for saying that german corporate heads are failing to create new jobs in spite of business-friendly reforms initiated by his government .

construction cranes have become as much a part of berlin as the brandenburg gate , and while renovations are sure to continue during the 2006 world cup , organizers are checking to make sure work at the venues is finished . preparations for the 2006 world cup in the german capital are moving along but not fast enough to put organizing committee members at ease .
they wanted some answers from city 's mayor klaus wowereit on friday .
in it 's letter the world cup organizing committee , led by german soccer legend franz beckenbauer , wanted to know about construction progress at the schlossplatz , and pariser platz as well as how the adidas mini-stadium planed to be set up in front of the reichstag and spectator areas along the spree river were coming along .
bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's fans are ready for the tournament berlin behind other host cities though the organizing committee pointed out that its letter dealt only with " questions " and not " complaints , " in the midst of campaigning for germany 's early federal elections politicians in berlin 's opposition parties are using the opportunity to criticize the social democratic party 's organizational abilities .
" huge construction sites now threaten the world cup , " nicolas zimmer , head of berlin 's christian democratic union , told the newspaper die welt on saturday .
" while other host cities are obviously world-class , berlin is playing in the amateur leagues . "
anything less than complete precision could have serious effects on the tournament , as some street and pipeline repairs are scheduled to conclude near the end of may , just two weeks before the world cup kicks off on june 9 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's preparations have to stay on schedule or expect traffic delays during the world cup without referring to the state of berlin 's preparations and citing financial reasons , german public broadcaster ard also announced last week it would broadcast from cologne and not from a glass-walled studio close to the brandenburg gate as planners in berlin hoped .
spd optimistic and on schedule but berlin 's government remains confident that the city will be ready for the thousands of international fans expected to descend on the city during the world cup finals next summer .
" all of the points raised in the letter have been deal with , " berlin 's government spokesperson michael donnermeyer said .

angst over the hovering specter of unemployment reached an all-time high last january as the number of unemployed climbed to over five million .
germany 's neighbors have similar problems , but the fear seems less severe . " germany is a country in which many people are unhappy and do n't have a job any more , " a dutch correspondent once described the ' german disease . '
" if they do , however , have a job , then they want to work as little as possible . " the questions is what has gone wrong in germany so that the mood has soured to this degree and politicians lack the courage to lead with confidence .
high unemployment has seemingly laid germany lame .
everyone today has an unemployed friend or relative , said bernd bohn , a psychologist at the university of bremen .
and thus the feeling has spread : nothing is secure any more , the question is only : when will it hit me ?
in neighboring countries , however , the problem is dealt with differently . " we saw in britain in the 1970s how maggie thatcher gave a proper crash course in flexibility , " bohn said .
a more relaxed approach was taken in the netherlands in the late 1980s , when all societal groups - workers , corporations , politicians and unions - pulled together and agreed that something has to change . " we have to become more flexible , " bohn said .

there has to be a mental paradigm shift , bohn said . " we continue to define ourselves primarily through our occupation , and this is , after all , the basis for our material existence , " he added .
" if we could have a change in attitude at the societal level , then that would provide a foundation for dealing with unemployment on an individual basis . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caring for the elderly is not valued enough gainful employment is not the only way to justify one 's self , one 's personality , and feeling of self-worth , bohn said .

angst over the hovering specter of unemployment reached an all-time high last january as the number of unemployed climbed to over five million .
germany 's neighbors have similar problems , but the fear seems less severe . " germany is a country in which many people are unhappy and do n't have a job any more , " a dutch correspondent once described the ' german disease . '
" if they do , however , have a job , then they want to work as little as possible . " the questions is what has gone wrong in germany so that the mood has soured to this degree and politicians lack the courage to lead with confidence .
high unemployment has seemingly laid germany lame .
everyone today has an unemployed friend or relative , said bernd bohn , a psychologist at the university of bremen .
and thus the feeling has spread : nothing is secure any more , the question is only : when will it hit me ?
in neighboring countries , however , the problem is dealt with differently . " we saw in britain in the 1970s how maggie thatcher gave a proper crash course in flexibility , " bohn said .
a more relaxed approach was taken in the netherlands in the late 1980s , when all societal groups - workers , corporations , politicians and unions - pulled together and agreed that something has to change . " we have to become more flexible , " bohn said .
" for example , when we are unemployed , then we must be prepared to work for three or six months at ' below cost . " ' gainful employment is n't everything bildunterschrift : getting training to find a new job flexibility is the magic word for industrial psychologists .
examples are to be found in britian and the usa .
here , as in germany , many people find themselves temporarily without work , but there they use the time to gain further qualifications to give them competitive advantage in the job market . german politicians attack the problem too one-sidedly by constantly blaming the private economy for not creating more jobs .
there has to be a mental paradigm shift , bohn said . " we continue to define ourselves primarily through our occupation , and this is , after all , the basis for our material existence , " he added .
" if we could have a change in attitude at the societal level , then that would provide a foundation for dealing with unemployment on an individual basis . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caring for the elderly is not valued enough gainful employment is not the only way to justify one 's self , one 's personality , and feeling of self-worth , bohn said .
society should place more value on volunteer work and other occupations that benefit society at large . generous insurance and efficient placements the danes also changed their mental attitudes after the economic crisis a decade ago .

construction cranes have become as much a part of berlin as the brandenburg gate , and while renovations are sure to continue during the 2006 world cup , organizers are checking to make sure work at the venues is finished . preparations for the 2006 world cup in the german capital are moving along but not fast enough to put organizing committee members at ease .
they wanted some answers from city 's mayor klaus wowereit on friday .
in it 's letter the world cup organizing committee , led by german soccer legend franz beckenbauer , wanted to know about construction progress at the schlossplatz , and pariser platz as well as how the adidas mini-stadium planed to be set up in front of the reichstag and spectator areas along the spree river were coming along .
bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's fans are ready for the tournament berlin behind other host cities though the organizing committee pointed out that its letter dealt only with " questions " and not " complaints , " in the midst of campaigning for germany 's early federal elections politicians in berlin 's opposition parties are using the opportunity to criticize the social democratic party 's organizational abilities .
" huge construction sites now threaten the world cup , " nicolas zimmer , head of berlin 's christian democratic union , told the newspaper die welt on saturday .
" while other host cities are obviously world-class , berlin is playing in the amateur leagues . "
anything less than complete precision could have serious effects on the tournament , as some street and pipeline repairs are scheduled to conclude near the end of may , just two weeks before the world cup kicks off on june 9 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's preparations have to stay on schedule or expect traffic delays during the world cup without referring to the state of berlin 's preparations and citing financial reasons , german public broadcaster ard also announced last week it would broadcast from cologne and not from a glass-walled studio close to the brandenburg gate as planners in berlin hoped .
spd optimistic and on schedule but berlin 's government remains confident that the city will be ready for the thousands of international fans expected to descend on the city during the world cup finals next summer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.08.2005 bird flu heading for europe ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 5000 head of poultry were culled in siberia to contain the virus the discovery of bird flu in siberia has sparked renewed concerns about an outbreak of the deadly virus in europe .
but the threat is limited , experts say . kazakhstan this week confirmed an outbreak of bird flu in the north of the country where 400 geese died at a poultry farm in late july , but scientists have yet to determine whether the virus poses a threat to humans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 bird flu virus the news follows the discovery of bird flu cases in 18 siberian villages , where russian authorities have ordered the culling of poultry .
the virus found there has been identified as the highly pathogenic h5n1 strain -lrb- photo -rrb- of the avian influenza virus that has killed more than 50 people in south-east asia since 2003 .
" the disease probably arrived in siberia from asia through wild birds and there 's no doubt that birds from there fly to europe , " bernard vallat , the director-general of the world animal health body oie , told reuters .
different farm structure reduces risk of outbreak but because farm structures are very different in europe , it will be a lot more difficult for the virus to spread and infect humans , vallat said . " farms here are enclosed and separated from one another , " he said .
in asia , small backyard farms and unregulated local markets have allowed the disease to take hold as well as maximizing the contact between people and infected birds .
so far all humans infected by the virus had contracted it directly from the animals .
the outbreaks in russia and kazakhstan extend the number of countries affected by the disease .
however , it is hard to quantify to what extent this increases the risk of spreading it to europe and beyond , said susanne glasmacher of the robert-koch-institut in berlin , germany 's national institute charged with researching and surveying the spread of infectious diseases .
virus mutation poses the real danger " the real danger lies in the possibility that the deadly bird flu virus mutates into a form that transmits easily between humans , " glasmacher said .
the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- fears that in this case the virus could kill millions of people worldwide .
this is also confirmed by uk and us researchers who used computer models to simulate the spread of a mutated form of the virus .
contingency plans in place a senior russian veterinary official said the netherlands and france were potential destinations for migratory wildfowl .
the dutch farm ministry played down the threat , saying , after a risk assessment , that further measures were unnecessary .
surveillance and eradication plans had already been stepped up following a major outbreak in the netherlands of the less dangerous h7n7 bird flu strain in 2003 , when 30 million birds were destroyed at a direct cost of more than 150 million euros -lrb- $ 185.5 million -rrb- .
in germany , the robert-koch-institut presented the last part of a national " pandemic contingency plan " in may outlining a coordinated response by the authorities to an outbreak of the deadly virus among humans .
vaccines key to containing outbreak in humans experts agree that a key to fighting a pandemic is that vaccines and anti-viral medication are available quickly and in sufficient quantities in the concerned regions .
swiss firm roche said this week it was in talks with the who on donating substantial quantities of its anti-bird flu drug tamiflu to the un agency .
and britain 's acambis said it was developing a potentially breakthrough new shot that could offer permanent protection against all types of flu . dw staff -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans move to prevent bird flu after the outbreak of the deadly avian flu virus in asia , experts warned that migratory birds could carry the virus across the globe .
in germany , scientists are studying how to prevent this from happening .

angst over the hovering specter of unemployment reached an all-time high last january as the number of unemployed climbed to over five million .
germany 's neighbors have similar problems , but the fear seems less severe . " germany is a country in which many people are unhappy and do n't have a job any more , " a dutch correspondent once described the ' german disease . '

construction cranes have become as much a part of berlin as the brandenburg gate , and while renovations are sure to continue during the 2006 world cup , organizers are checking to make sure work at the venues is finished . preparations for the 2006 world cup in the german capital are moving along but not fast enough to put organizing committee members at ease .
they wanted some answers from city 's mayor klaus wowereit on friday .
in it 's letter the world cup organizing committee , led by german soccer legend franz beckenbauer , wanted to know about construction progress at the schlossplatz , and pariser platz as well as how the adidas mini-stadium planed to be set up in front of the reichstag and spectator areas along the spree river were coming along .
bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's fans are ready for the tournament berlin behind other host cities though the organizing committee pointed out that its letter dealt only with " questions " and not " complaints , " in the midst of campaigning for germany 's early federal elections politicians in berlin 's opposition parties are using the opportunity to criticize the social democratic party 's organizational abilities .
" huge construction sites now threaten the world cup , " nicolas zimmer , head of berlin 's christian democratic union , told the newspaper die welt on saturday .
" while other host cities are obviously world-class , berlin is playing in the amateur leagues . "
anything less than complete precision could have serious effects on the tournament , as some street and pipeline repairs are scheduled to conclude near the end of may , just two weeks before the world cup kicks off on june 9 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's preparations have to stay on schedule or expect traffic delays during the world cup without referring to the state of berlin 's preparations and citing financial reasons , german public broadcaster ard also announced last week it would broadcast from cologne and not from a glass-walled studio close to the brandenburg gate as planners in berlin hoped .
spd optimistic and on schedule but berlin 's government remains confident that the city will be ready for the thousands of international fans expected to descend on the city during the world cup finals next summer .
" all of the points raised in the letter have been deal with , " berlin 's government spokesperson michael donnermeyer said .

angst over the hovering specter of unemployment reached an all-time high last january as the number of unemployed climbed to over five million .
germany 's neighbors have similar problems , but the fear seems less severe . " germany is a country in which many people are unhappy and do n't have a job any more , " a dutch correspondent once described the ' german disease . '
" if they do , however , have a job , then they want to work as little as possible . " the questions is what has gone wrong in germany so that the mood has soured to this degree and politicians lack the courage to lead with confidence .
high unemployment has seemingly laid germany lame .
everyone today has an unemployed friend or relative , said bernd bohn , a psychologist at the university of bremen .
and thus the feeling has spread : nothing is secure any more , the question is only : when will it hit me ?
in neighboring countries , however , the problem is dealt with differently . " we saw in britain in the 1970s how maggie thatcher gave a proper crash course in flexibility , " bohn said .
a more relaxed approach was taken in the netherlands in the late 1980s , when all societal groups - workers , corporations , politicians and unions - pulled together and agreed that something has to change . " we have to become more flexible , " bohn said .
" for example , when we are unemployed , then we must be prepared to work for three or six months at ' below cost . " ' gainful employment is n't everything bildunterschrift : getting training to find a new job flexibility is the magic word for industrial psychologists .
examples are to be found in britian and the usa .
here , as in germany , many people find themselves temporarily without work , but there they use the time to gain further qualifications to give them competitive advantage in the job market . german politicians attack the problem too one-sidedly by constantly blaming the private economy for not creating more jobs .
there has to be a mental paradigm shift , bohn said . " we continue to define ourselves primarily through our occupation , and this is , after all , the basis for our material existence , " he added .
" if we could have a change in attitude at the societal level , then that would provide a foundation for dealing with unemployment on an individual basis . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caring for the elderly is not valued enough gainful employment is not the only way to justify one 's self , one 's personality , and feeling of self-worth , bohn said .
society should place more value on volunteer work and other occupations that benefit society at large . generous insurance and efficient placements the danes also changed their mental attitudes after the economic crisis a decade ago .

at the same time , job placement programs find tailor made traineeships , even if the demands on the job seekers are quite high . the austrians have also begun to feel the crunch in the past years .

but the threat is limited , experts say . kazakhstan this week confirmed an outbreak of bird flu in the north of the country where 400 geese died at a poultry farm in late july , but scientists have yet to determine whether the virus poses a threat to humans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 bird flu virus the news follows the discovery of bird flu cases in 18 siberian villages , where russian authorities have ordered the culling of poultry .
the virus found there has been identified as the highly pathogenic h5n1 strain -lrb- photo -rrb- of the avian influenza virus that has killed more than 50 people in south-east asia since 2003 .
" the disease probably arrived in siberia from asia through wild birds and there 's no doubt that birds from there fly to europe , " bernard vallat , the director-general of the world animal health body oie , told reuters .
different farm structure reduces risk of outbreak but because farm structures are very different in europe , it will be a lot more difficult for the virus to spread and infect humans , vallat said . " farms here are enclosed and separated from one another , " he said .
in asia , small backyard farms and unregulated local markets have allowed the disease to take hold as well as maximizing the contact between people and infected birds .
so far all humans infected by the virus had contracted it directly from the animals .
the outbreaks in russia and kazakhstan extend the number of countries affected by the disease .
however , it is hard to quantify to what extent this increases the risk of spreading it to europe and beyond , said susanne glasmacher of the robert-koch-institut in berlin , germany 's national institute charged with researching and surveying the spread of infectious diseases .
virus mutation poses the real danger " the real danger lies in the possibility that the deadly bird flu virus mutates into a form that transmits easily between humans , " glasmacher said .
the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- fears that in this case the virus could kill millions of people worldwide .
this is also confirmed by uk and us researchers who used computer models to simulate the spread of a mutated form of the virus .
contingency plans in place a senior russian veterinary official said the netherlands and france were potential destinations for migratory wildfowl .
the dutch farm ministry played down the threat , saying , after a risk assessment , that further measures were unnecessary .
surveillance and eradication plans had already been stepped up following a major outbreak in the netherlands of the less dangerous h7n7 bird flu strain in 2003 , when 30 million birds were destroyed at a direct cost of more than 150 million euros -lrb- $ 185.5 million -rrb- .
in germany , the robert-koch-institut presented the last part of a national " pandemic contingency plan " in may outlining a coordinated response by the authorities to an outbreak of the deadly virus among humans .
vaccines key to containing outbreak in humans experts agree that a key to fighting a pandemic is that vaccines and anti-viral medication are available quickly and in sufficient quantities in the concerned regions .
swiss firm roche said this week it was in talks with the who on donating substantial quantities of its anti-bird flu drug tamiflu to the un agency .
and britain 's acambis said it was developing a potentially breakthrough new shot that could offer permanent protection against all types of flu . dw staff -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans move to prevent bird flu after the outbreak of the deadly avian flu virus in asia , experts warned that migratory birds could carry the virus across the globe .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 bird flu virus the news follows the discovery of bird flu cases in 18 siberian villages , where russian authorities have ordered the culling of poultry .
the virus found there has been identified as the highly pathogenic h5n1 strain -lrb- photo -rrb- of the avian influenza virus that has killed more than 50 people in south-east asia since 2003 .
" the disease probably arrived in siberia from asia through wild birds and there 's no doubt that birds from there fly to europe , " bernard vallat , the director-general of the world animal health body oie , told reuters .
different farm structure reduces risk of outbreak but because farm structures are very different in europe , it will be a lot more difficult for the virus to spread and infect humans , vallat said . " farms here are enclosed and separated from one another , " he said .
in asia , small backyard farms and unregulated local markets have allowed the disease to take hold as well as maximizing the contact between people and infected birds .
so far all humans infected by the virus had contracted it directly from the animals .
the outbreaks in russia and kazakhstan extend the number of countries affected by the disease .
however , it is hard to quantify to what extent this increases the risk of spreading it to europe and beyond , said susanne glasmacher of the robert-koch-institut in berlin , germany 's national institute charged with researching and surveying the spread of infectious diseases .
virus mutation poses the real danger " the real danger lies in the possibility that the deadly bird flu virus mutates into a form that transmits easily between humans , " glasmacher said .
the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- fears that in this case the virus could kill millions of people worldwide .
this is also confirmed by uk and us researchers who used computer models to simulate the spread of a mutated form of the virus .
contingency plans in place a senior russian veterinary official said the netherlands and france were potential destinations for migratory wildfowl .
the dutch farm ministry played down the threat , saying , after a risk assessment , that further measures were unnecessary .
surveillance and eradication plans had already been stepped up following a major outbreak in the netherlands of the less dangerous h7n7 bird flu strain in 2003 , when 30 million birds were destroyed at a direct cost of more than 150 million euros -lrb- $ 185.5 million -rrb- .
in germany , the robert-koch-institut presented the last part of a national " pandemic contingency plan " in may outlining a coordinated response by the authorities to an outbreak of the deadly virus among humans .
vaccines key to containing outbreak in humans experts agree that a key to fighting a pandemic is that vaccines and anti-viral medication are available quickly and in sufficient quantities in the concerned regions .
swiss firm roche said this week it was in talks with the who on donating substantial quantities of its anti-bird flu drug tamiflu to the un agency .
and britain 's acambis said it was developing a potentially breakthrough new shot that could offer permanent protection against all types of flu . dw staff -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans move to prevent bird flu after the outbreak of the deadly avian flu virus in asia , experts warned that migratory birds could carry the virus across the globe .

but the threat is limited , experts say . kazakhstan this week confirmed an outbreak of bird flu in the north of the country where 400 geese died at a poultry farm in late july , but scientists have yet to determine whether the virus poses a threat to humans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 bird flu virus the news follows the discovery of bird flu cases in 18 siberian villages , where russian authorities have ordered the culling of poultry .
the virus found there has been identified as the highly pathogenic h5n1 strain -lrb- photo -rrb- of the avian influenza virus that has killed more than 50 people in south-east asia since 2003 .
" the disease probably arrived in siberia from asia through wild birds and there 's no doubt that birds from there fly to europe , " bernard vallat , the director-general of the world animal health body oie , told reuters .
different farm structure reduces risk of outbreak but because farm structures are very different in europe , it will be a lot more difficult for the virus to spread and infect humans , vallat said . " farms here are enclosed and separated from one another , " he said .
in asia , small backyard farms and unregulated local markets have allowed the disease to take hold as well as maximizing the contact between people and infected birds .
so far all humans infected by the virus had contracted it directly from the animals .
the outbreaks in russia and kazakhstan extend the number of countries affected by the disease .
however , it is hard to quantify to what extent this increases the risk of spreading it to europe and beyond , said susanne glasmacher of the robert-koch-institut in berlin , germany 's national institute charged with researching and surveying the spread of infectious diseases .
virus mutation poses the real danger " the real danger lies in the possibility that the deadly bird flu virus mutates into a form that transmits easily between humans , " glasmacher said .
the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- fears that in this case the virus could kill millions of people worldwide .
this is also confirmed by uk and us researchers who used computer models to simulate the spread of a mutated form of the virus .
contingency plans in place a senior russian veterinary official said the netherlands and france were potential destinations for migratory wildfowl .
the dutch farm ministry played down the threat , saying , after a risk assessment , that further measures were unnecessary .
surveillance and eradication plans had already been stepped up following a major outbreak in the netherlands of the less dangerous h7n7 bird flu strain in 2003 , when 30 million birds were destroyed at a direct cost of more than 150 million euros -lrb- $ 185.5 million -rrb- .
in germany , the robert-koch-institut presented the last part of a national " pandemic contingency plan " in may outlining a coordinated response by the authorities to an outbreak of the deadly virus among humans .
vaccines key to containing outbreak in humans experts agree that a key to fighting a pandemic is that vaccines and anti-viral medication are available quickly and in sufficient quantities in the concerned regions .
swiss firm roche said this week it was in talks with the who on donating substantial quantities of its anti-bird flu drug tamiflu to the un agency .
and britain 's acambis said it was developing a potentially breakthrough new shot that could offer permanent protection against all types of flu . dw staff -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans move to prevent bird flu after the outbreak of the deadly avian flu virus in asia , experts warned that migratory birds could carry the virus across the globe .

german national team striker miroslav klose only needed 24 seconds to get the scoring underway for bremen , who hosted arminia bielefeld in the bundesliga 's first week of play .
klose , who scored again in the 82nd minute , got some assistance from croatian international ivan klasnic who had two goals of his own in the league 's highest scoring game of the week .
" after the preseason preparations , you never know where you stand , " bremen coach thomas schaaf said after the game .
" we wanted to give our fans a good match in the first home game , and i think we did it . "

björn schlicke signaled cologne 's successful return to the german top flight by burying his shot from the penalty spot .
this could be an early signal that mainz , who in 2004 spent their first every year in the bundesliga 's first division , have moved past soccer 's stage of beginner 's luck .

but the threat is limited , experts say . kazakhstan this week confirmed an outbreak of bird flu in the north of the country where 400 geese died at a poultry farm in late july , but scientists have yet to determine whether the virus poses a threat to humans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 bird flu virus the news follows the discovery of bird flu cases in 18 siberian villages , where russian authorities have ordered the culling of poultry .
the virus found there has been identified as the highly pathogenic h5n1 strain -lrb- photo -rrb- of the avian influenza virus that has killed more than 50 people in south-east asia since 2003 .
" the disease probably arrived in siberia from asia through wild birds and there 's no doubt that birds from there fly to europe , " bernard vallat , the director-general of the world animal health body oie , told reuters .
different farm structure reduces risk of outbreak but because farm structures are very different in europe , it will be a lot more difficult for the virus to spread and infect humans , vallat said . " farms here are enclosed and separated from one another , " he said .
in asia , small backyard farms and unregulated local markets have allowed the disease to take hold as well as maximizing the contact between people and infected birds .
so far all humans infected by the virus had contracted it directly from the animals .
the outbreaks in russia and kazakhstan extend the number of countries affected by the disease .
however , it is hard to quantify to what extent this increases the risk of spreading it to europe and beyond , said susanne glasmacher of the robert-koch-institut in berlin , germany 's national institute charged with researching and surveying the spread of infectious diseases .
virus mutation poses the real danger " the real danger lies in the possibility that the deadly bird flu virus mutates into a form that transmits easily between humans , " glasmacher said .
the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- fears that in this case the virus could kill millions of people worldwide .
this is also confirmed by uk and us researchers who used computer models to simulate the spread of a mutated form of the virus .
contingency plans in place a senior russian veterinary official said the netherlands and france were potential destinations for migratory wildfowl .
the dutch farm ministry played down the threat , saying , after a risk assessment , that further measures were unnecessary .
surveillance and eradication plans had already been stepped up following a major outbreak in the netherlands of the less dangerous h7n7 bird flu strain in 2003 , when 30 million birds were destroyed at a direct cost of more than 150 million euros -lrb- $ 185.5 million -rrb- .
in germany , the robert-koch-institut presented the last part of a national " pandemic contingency plan " in may outlining a coordinated response by the authorities to an outbreak of the deadly virus among humans .
vaccines key to containing outbreak in humans experts agree that a key to fighting a pandemic is that vaccines and anti-viral medication are available quickly and in sufficient quantities in the concerned regions .
swiss firm roche said this week it was in talks with the who on donating substantial quantities of its anti-bird flu drug tamiflu to the un agency .
and britain 's acambis said it was developing a potentially breakthrough new shot that could offer permanent protection against all types of flu . dw staff -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans move to prevent bird flu after the outbreak of the deadly avian flu virus in asia , experts warned that migratory birds could carry the virus across the globe .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 bird flu virus the news follows the discovery of bird flu cases in 18 siberian villages , where russian authorities have ordered the culling of poultry .
the virus found there has been identified as the highly pathogenic h5n1 strain -lrb- photo -rrb- of the avian influenza virus that has killed more than 50 people in south-east asia since 2003 .
" the disease probably arrived in siberia from asia through wild birds and there 's no doubt that birds from there fly to europe , " bernard vallat , the director-general of the world animal health body oie , told reuters .
different farm structure reduces risk of outbreak but because farm structures are very different in europe , it will be a lot more difficult for the virus to spread and infect humans , vallat said . " farms here are enclosed and separated from one another , " he said .
in asia , small backyard farms and unregulated local markets have allowed the disease to take hold as well as maximizing the contact between people and infected birds .
so far all humans infected by the virus had contracted it directly from the animals .
the outbreaks in russia and kazakhstan extend the number of countries affected by the disease .

in germany , the robert-koch-institut presented the last part of a national " pandemic contingency plan " in may outlining a coordinated response by the authorities to an outbreak of the deadly virus among humans .
vaccines key to containing outbreak in humans experts agree that a key to fighting a pandemic is that vaccines and anti-viral medication are available quickly and in sufficient quantities in the concerned regions .

germany 's neighbors have similar problems , but the fear seems less severe . " germany is a country in which many people are unhappy and do n't have a job any more , " a dutch correspondent once described the ' german disease . '

" the disease probably arrived in siberia from asia through wild birds and there 's no doubt that birds from there fly to europe , " bernard vallat , the director-general of the world animal health body oie , told reuters .
different farm structure reduces risk of outbreak but because farm structures are very different in europe , it will be a lot more difficult for the virus to spread and infect humans , vallat said . " farms here are enclosed and separated from one another , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.08.2005 bird flu heading for europe ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 5000 head of poultry were culled in siberia to contain the virus the discovery of bird flu in siberia has sparked renewed concerns about an outbreak of the deadly virus in europe .
but the threat is limited , experts say . kazakhstan this week confirmed an outbreak of bird flu in the north of the country where 400 geese died at a poultry farm in late july , but scientists have yet to determine whether the virus poses a threat to humans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 bird flu virus the news follows the discovery of bird flu cases in 18 siberian villages , where russian authorities have ordered the culling of poultry .
the virus found there has been identified as the highly pathogenic h5n1 strain -lrb- photo -rrb- of the avian influenza virus that has killed more than 50 people in south-east asia since 2003 .
" the disease probably arrived in siberia from asia through wild birds and there 's no doubt that birds from there fly to europe , " bernard vallat , the director-general of the world animal health body oie , told reuters .
different farm structure reduces risk of outbreak but because farm structures are very different in europe , it will be a lot more difficult for the virus to spread and infect humans , vallat said . " farms here are enclosed and separated from one another , " he said .
in asia , small backyard farms and unregulated local markets have allowed the disease to take hold as well as maximizing the contact between people and infected birds .
so far all humans infected by the virus had contracted it directly from the animals .
the outbreaks in russia and kazakhstan extend the number of countries affected by the disease .
however , it is hard to quantify to what extent this increases the risk of spreading it to europe and beyond , said susanne glasmacher of the robert-koch-institut in berlin , germany 's national institute charged with researching and surveying the spread of infectious diseases .
virus mutation poses the real danger " the real danger lies in the possibility that the deadly bird flu virus mutates into a form that transmits easily between humans , " glasmacher said .
the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- fears that in this case the virus could kill millions of people worldwide .
this is also confirmed by uk and us researchers who used computer models to simulate the spread of a mutated form of the virus .
contingency plans in place a senior russian veterinary official said the netherlands and france were potential destinations for migratory wildfowl .
the dutch farm ministry played down the threat , saying , after a risk assessment , that further measures were unnecessary .
surveillance and eradication plans had already been stepped up following a major outbreak in the netherlands of the less dangerous h7n7 bird flu strain in 2003 , when 30 million birds were destroyed at a direct cost of more than 150 million euros -lrb- $ 185.5 million -rrb- .
in germany , the robert-koch-institut presented the last part of a national " pandemic contingency plan " in may outlining a coordinated response by the authorities to an outbreak of the deadly virus among humans .
vaccines key to containing outbreak in humans experts agree that a key to fighting a pandemic is that vaccines and anti-viral medication are available quickly and in sufficient quantities in the concerned regions .
swiss firm roche said this week it was in talks with the who on donating substantial quantities of its anti-bird flu drug tamiflu to the un agency .

angst over the hovering specter of unemployment reached an all-time high last january as the number of unemployed climbed to over five million .
germany 's neighbors have similar problems , but the fear seems less severe . " germany is a country in which many people are unhappy and do n't have a job any more , " a dutch correspondent once described the ' german disease . '
" if they do , however , have a job , then they want to work as little as possible . " the questions is what has gone wrong in germany so that the mood has soured to this degree and politicians lack the courage to lead with confidence .
high unemployment has seemingly laid germany lame .
everyone today has an unemployed friend or relative , said bernd bohn , a psychologist at the university of bremen .
and thus the feeling has spread : nothing is secure any more , the question is only : when will it hit me ?
in neighboring countries , however , the problem is dealt with differently . " we saw in britain in the 1970s how maggie thatcher gave a proper crash course in flexibility , " bohn said .
a more relaxed approach was taken in the netherlands in the late 1980s , when all societal groups - workers , corporations , politicians and unions - pulled together and agreed that something has to change . " we have to become more flexible , " bohn said .
" for example , when we are unemployed , then we must be prepared to work for three or six months at ' below cost . " ' gainful employment is n't everything bildunterschrift : getting training to find a new job flexibility is the magic word for industrial psychologists .
examples are to be found in britian and the usa .
here , as in germany , many people find themselves temporarily without work , but there they use the time to gain further qualifications to give them competitive advantage in the job market . german politicians attack the problem too one-sidedly by constantly blaming the private economy for not creating more jobs .
there has to be a mental paradigm shift , bohn said . " we continue to define ourselves primarily through our occupation , and this is , after all , the basis for our material existence , " he added .
" if we could have a change in attitude at the societal level , then that would provide a foundation for dealing with unemployment on an individual basis . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caring for the elderly is not valued enough gainful employment is not the only way to justify one 's self , one 's personality , and feeling of self-worth , bohn said .

but the threat is limited , experts say . kazakhstan this week confirmed an outbreak of bird flu in the north of the country where 400 geese died at a poultry farm in late july , but scientists have yet to determine whether the virus poses a threat to humans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 bird flu virus the news follows the discovery of bird flu cases in 18 siberian villages , where russian authorities have ordered the culling of poultry .
the virus found there has been identified as the highly pathogenic h5n1 strain -lrb- photo -rrb- of the avian influenza virus that has killed more than 50 people in south-east asia since 2003 .
" the disease probably arrived in siberia from asia through wild birds and there 's no doubt that birds from there fly to europe , " bernard vallat , the director-general of the world animal health body oie , told reuters .
different farm structure reduces risk of outbreak but because farm structures are very different in europe , it will be a lot more difficult for the virus to spread and infect humans , vallat said . " farms here are enclosed and separated from one another , " he said .
in asia , small backyard farms and unregulated local markets have allowed the disease to take hold as well as maximizing the contact between people and infected birds .
so far all humans infected by the virus had contracted it directly from the animals .
the outbreaks in russia and kazakhstan extend the number of countries affected by the disease .
however , it is hard to quantify to what extent this increases the risk of spreading it to europe and beyond , said susanne glasmacher of the robert-koch-institut in berlin , germany 's national institute charged with researching and surveying the spread of infectious diseases .
virus mutation poses the real danger " the real danger lies in the possibility that the deadly bird flu virus mutates into a form that transmits easily between humans , " glasmacher said .
the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- fears that in this case the virus could kill millions of people worldwide .
this is also confirmed by uk and us researchers who used computer models to simulate the spread of a mutated form of the virus .
contingency plans in place a senior russian veterinary official said the netherlands and france were potential destinations for migratory wildfowl .
the dutch farm ministry played down the threat , saying , after a risk assessment , that further measures were unnecessary .
surveillance and eradication plans had already been stepped up following a major outbreak in the netherlands of the less dangerous h7n7 bird flu strain in 2003 , when 30 million birds were destroyed at a direct cost of more than 150 million euros -lrb- $ 185.5 million -rrb- .
in germany , the robert-koch-institut presented the last part of a national " pandemic contingency plan " in may outlining a coordinated response by the authorities to an outbreak of the deadly virus among humans .
vaccines key to containing outbreak in humans experts agree that a key to fighting a pandemic is that vaccines and anti-viral medication are available quickly and in sufficient quantities in the concerned regions .
swiss firm roche said this week it was in talks with the who on donating substantial quantities of its anti-bird flu drug tamiflu to the un agency .
and britain 's acambis said it was developing a potentially breakthrough new shot that could offer permanent protection against all types of flu . dw staff -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans move to prevent bird flu after the outbreak of the deadly avian flu virus in asia , experts warned that migratory birds could carry the virus across the globe .

but the threat is limited , experts say . kazakhstan this week confirmed an outbreak of bird flu in the north of the country where 400 geese died at a poultry farm in late july , but scientists have yet to determine whether the virus poses a threat to humans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 bird flu virus the news follows the discovery of bird flu cases in 18 siberian villages , where russian authorities have ordered the culling of poultry .
the virus found there has been identified as the highly pathogenic h5n1 strain -lrb- photo -rrb- of the avian influenza virus that has killed more than 50 people in south-east asia since 2003 .
" the disease probably arrived in siberia from asia through wild birds and there 's no doubt that birds from there fly to europe , " bernard vallat , the director-general of the world animal health body oie , told reuters .
different farm structure reduces risk of outbreak but because farm structures are very different in europe , it will be a lot more difficult for the virus to spread and infect humans , vallat said . " farms here are enclosed and separated from one another , " he said .
in asia , small backyard farms and unregulated local markets have allowed the disease to take hold as well as maximizing the contact between people and infected birds .
so far all humans infected by the virus had contracted it directly from the animals .
the outbreaks in russia and kazakhstan extend the number of countries affected by the disease .
however , it is hard to quantify to what extent this increases the risk of spreading it to europe and beyond , said susanne glasmacher of the robert-koch-institut in berlin , germany 's national institute charged with researching and surveying the spread of infectious diseases .
virus mutation poses the real danger " the real danger lies in the possibility that the deadly bird flu virus mutates into a form that transmits easily between humans , " glasmacher said .
the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- fears that in this case the virus could kill millions of people worldwide .
this is also confirmed by uk and us researchers who used computer models to simulate the spread of a mutated form of the virus .
contingency plans in place a senior russian veterinary official said the netherlands and france were potential destinations for migratory wildfowl .
the dutch farm ministry played down the threat , saying , after a risk assessment , that further measures were unnecessary .
surveillance and eradication plans had already been stepped up following a major outbreak in the netherlands of the less dangerous h7n7 bird flu strain in 2003 , when 30 million birds were destroyed at a direct cost of more than 150 million euros -lrb- $ 185.5 million -rrb- .
in germany , the robert-koch-institut presented the last part of a national " pandemic contingency plan " in may outlining a coordinated response by the authorities to an outbreak of the deadly virus among humans .
vaccines key to containing outbreak in humans experts agree that a key to fighting a pandemic is that vaccines and anti-viral medication are available quickly and in sufficient quantities in the concerned regions .
swiss firm roche said this week it was in talks with the who on donating substantial quantities of its anti-bird flu drug tamiflu to the un agency .
and britain 's acambis said it was developing a potentially breakthrough new shot that could offer permanent protection against all types of flu . dw staff -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans move to prevent bird flu after the outbreak of the deadly avian flu virus in asia , experts warned that migratory birds could carry the virus across the globe .

angst over the hovering specter of unemployment reached an all-time high last january as the number of unemployed climbed to over five million .
germany 's neighbors have similar problems , but the fear seems less severe . " germany is a country in which many people are unhappy and do n't have a job any more , " a dutch correspondent once described the ' german disease . '
" if they do , however , have a job , then they want to work as little as possible . " the questions is what has gone wrong in germany so that the mood has soured to this degree and politicians lack the courage to lead with confidence .
high unemployment has seemingly laid germany lame .
everyone today has an unemployed friend or relative , said bernd bohn , a psychologist at the university of bremen .
and thus the feeling has spread : nothing is secure any more , the question is only : when will it hit me ?
in neighboring countries , however , the problem is dealt with differently . " we saw in britain in the 1970s how maggie thatcher gave a proper crash course in flexibility , " bohn said .
a more relaxed approach was taken in the netherlands in the late 1980s , when all societal groups - workers , corporations , politicians and unions - pulled together and agreed that something has to change . " we have to become more flexible , " bohn said .

there has to be a mental paradigm shift , bohn said . " we continue to define ourselves primarily through our occupation , and this is , after all , the basis for our material existence , " he added .
" if we could have a change in attitude at the societal level , then that would provide a foundation for dealing with unemployment on an individual basis . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caring for the elderly is not valued enough gainful employment is not the only way to justify one 's self , one 's personality , and feeling of self-worth , bohn said .

angst over the hovering specter of unemployment reached an all-time high last january as the number of unemployed climbed to over five million .
germany 's neighbors have similar problems , but the fear seems less severe . " germany is a country in which many people are unhappy and do n't have a job any more , " a dutch correspondent once described the ' german disease . '
" if they do , however , have a job , then they want to work as little as possible . " the questions is what has gone wrong in germany so that the mood has soured to this degree and politicians lack the courage to lead with confidence .
high unemployment has seemingly laid germany lame .
everyone today has an unemployed friend or relative , said bernd bohn , a psychologist at the university of bremen .
and thus the feeling has spread : nothing is secure any more , the question is only : when will it hit me ?
in neighboring countries , however , the problem is dealt with differently . " we saw in britain in the 1970s how maggie thatcher gave a proper crash course in flexibility , " bohn said .
a more relaxed approach was taken in the netherlands in the late 1980s , when all societal groups - workers , corporations , politicians and unions - pulled together and agreed that something has to change . " we have to become more flexible , " bohn said .

there has to be a mental paradigm shift , bohn said . " we continue to define ourselves primarily through our occupation , and this is , after all , the basis for our material existence , " he added .
" if we could have a change in attitude at the societal level , then that would provide a foundation for dealing with unemployment on an individual basis .

but the threat is limited , experts say . kazakhstan this week confirmed an outbreak of bird flu in the north of the country where 400 geese died at a poultry farm in late july , but scientists have yet to determine whether the virus poses a threat to humans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 bird flu virus the news follows the discovery of bird flu cases in 18 siberian villages , where russian authorities have ordered the culling of poultry .
the virus found there has been identified as the highly pathogenic h5n1 strain -lrb- photo -rrb- of the avian influenza virus that has killed more than 50 people in south-east asia since 2003 .
" the disease probably arrived in siberia from asia through wild birds and there 's no doubt that birds from there fly to europe , " bernard vallat , the director-general of the world animal health body oie , told reuters .
different farm structure reduces risk of outbreak but because farm structures are very different in europe , it will be a lot more difficult for the virus to spread and infect humans , vallat said . " farms here are enclosed and separated from one another , " he said .
in asia , small backyard farms and unregulated local markets have allowed the disease to take hold as well as maximizing the contact between people and infected birds .
so far all humans infected by the virus had contracted it directly from the animals .
the outbreaks in russia and kazakhstan extend the number of countries affected by the disease .
however , it is hard to quantify to what extent this increases the risk of spreading it to europe and beyond , said susanne glasmacher of the robert-koch-institut in berlin , germany 's national institute charged with researching and surveying the spread of infectious diseases .
virus mutation poses the real danger " the real danger lies in the possibility that the deadly bird flu virus mutates into a form that transmits easily between humans , " glasmacher said .
the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- fears that in this case the virus could kill millions of people worldwide .
this is also confirmed by uk and us researchers who used computer models to simulate the spread of a mutated form of the virus .
contingency plans in place a senior russian veterinary official said the netherlands and france were potential destinations for migratory wildfowl .
the dutch farm ministry played down the threat , saying , after a risk assessment , that further measures were unnecessary .
surveillance and eradication plans had already been stepped up following a major outbreak in the netherlands of the less dangerous h7n7 bird flu strain in 2003 , when 30 million birds were destroyed at a direct cost of more than 150 million euros -lrb- $ 185.5 million -rrb- .
in germany , the robert-koch-institut presented the last part of a national " pandemic contingency plan " in may outlining a coordinated response by the authorities to an outbreak of the deadly virus among humans .
vaccines key to containing outbreak in humans experts agree that a key to fighting a pandemic is that vaccines and anti-viral medication are available quickly and in sufficient quantities in the concerned regions .
swiss firm roche said this week it was in talks with the who on donating substantial quantities of its anti-bird flu drug tamiflu to the un agency .
and britain 's acambis said it was developing a potentially breakthrough new shot that could offer permanent protection against all types of flu . dw staff -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans move to prevent bird flu after the outbreak of the deadly avian flu virus in asia , experts warned that migratory birds could carry the virus across the globe .
in germany , scientists are studying how to prevent this from happening .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 bird flu virus the news follows the discovery of bird flu cases in 18 siberian villages , where russian authorities have ordered the culling of poultry .
the virus found there has been identified as the highly pathogenic h5n1 strain -lrb- photo -rrb- of the avian influenza virus that has killed more than 50 people in south-east asia since 2003 .
" the disease probably arrived in siberia from asia through wild birds and there 's no doubt that birds from there fly to europe , " bernard vallat , the director-general of the world animal health body oie , told reuters .
different farm structure reduces risk of outbreak but because farm structures are very different in europe , it will be a lot more difficult for the virus to spread and infect humans , vallat said . " farms here are enclosed and separated from one another , " he said .
in asia , small backyard farms and unregulated local markets have allowed the disease to take hold as well as maximizing the contact between people and infected birds .
so far all humans infected by the virus had contracted it directly from the animals .
the outbreaks in russia and kazakhstan extend the number of countries affected by the disease .
however , it is hard to quantify to what extent this increases the risk of spreading it to europe and beyond , said susanne glasmacher of the robert-koch-institut in berlin , germany 's national institute charged with researching and surveying the spread of infectious diseases .
virus mutation poses the real danger " the real danger lies in the possibility that the deadly bird flu virus mutates into a form that transmits easily between humans , " glasmacher said .
the world health organization -lrb- who -rrb- fears that in this case the virus could kill millions of people worldwide .
this is also confirmed by uk and us researchers who used computer models to simulate the spread of a mutated form of the virus .
contingency plans in place a senior russian veterinary official said the netherlands and france were potential destinations for migratory wildfowl .
the dutch farm ministry played down the threat , saying , after a risk assessment , that further measures were unnecessary .
surveillance and eradication plans had already been stepped up following a major outbreak in the netherlands of the less dangerous h7n7 bird flu strain in 2003 , when 30 million birds were destroyed at a direct cost of more than 150 million euros -lrb- $ 185.5 million -rrb- .
in germany , the robert-koch-institut presented the last part of a national " pandemic contingency plan " in may outlining a coordinated response by the authorities to an outbreak of the deadly virus among humans .
vaccines key to containing outbreak in humans experts agree that a key to fighting a pandemic is that vaccines and anti-viral medication are available quickly and in sufficient quantities in the concerned regions .
swiss firm roche said this week it was in talks with the who on donating substantial quantities of its anti-bird flu drug tamiflu to the un agency .
and britain 's acambis said it was developing a potentially breakthrough new shot that could offer permanent protection against all types of flu . dw staff -lrb- rri -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans move to prevent bird flu after the outbreak of the deadly avian flu virus in asia , experts warned that migratory birds could carry the virus across the globe .

angst over the hovering specter of unemployment reached an all-time high last january as the number of unemployed climbed to over five million .
germany 's neighbors have similar problems , but the fear seems less severe . " germany is a country in which many people are unhappy and do n't have a job any more , " a dutch correspondent once described the ' german disease . '
" if they do , however , have a job , then they want to work as little as possible . " the questions is what has gone wrong in germany so that the mood has soured to this degree and politicians lack the courage to lead with confidence .

everyone today has an unemployed friend or relative , said bernd bohn , a psychologist at the university of bremen .
and thus the feeling has spread : nothing is secure any more , the question is only : when will it hit me ?
in neighboring countries , however , the problem is dealt with differently . " we saw in britain in the 1970s how maggie thatcher gave a proper crash course in flexibility , " bohn said .
a more relaxed approach was taken in the netherlands in the late 1980s , when all societal groups - workers , corporations , politicians and unions - pulled together and agreed that something has to change . " we have to become more flexible , " bohn said .

there has to be a mental paradigm shift , bohn said . " we continue to define ourselves primarily through our occupation , and this is , after all , the basis for our material existence , " he added .

germany 's neighbors have similar problems , but the fear seems less severe . " germany is a country in which many people are unhappy and do n't have a job any more , " a dutch correspondent once described the ' german disease . '
" if they do , however , have a job , then they want to work as little as possible . " the questions is what has gone wrong in germany so that the mood has soured to this degree and politicians lack the courage to lead with confidence .
high unemployment has seemingly laid germany lame .
everyone today has an unemployed friend or relative , said bernd bohn , a psychologist at the university of bremen .
and thus the feeling has spread : nothing is secure any more , the question is only : when will it hit me ?
in neighboring countries , however , the problem is dealt with differently . " we saw in britain in the 1970s how maggie thatcher gave a proper crash course in flexibility , " bohn said .
a more relaxed approach was taken in the netherlands in the late 1980s , when all societal groups - workers , corporations , politicians and unions - pulled together and agreed that something has to change . " we have to become more flexible , " bohn said .
" for example , when we are unemployed , then we must be prepared to work for three or six months at ' below cost . " ' gainful employment is n't everything bildunterschrift : getting training to find a new job flexibility is the magic word for industrial psychologists .
examples are to be found in britian and the usa .
here , as in germany , many people find themselves temporarily without work , but there they use the time to gain further qualifications to give them competitive advantage in the job market . german politicians attack the problem too one-sidedly by constantly blaming the private economy for not creating more jobs .
there has to be a mental paradigm shift , bohn said . " we continue to define ourselves primarily through our occupation , and this is , after all , the basis for our material existence , " he added .
" if we could have a change in attitude at the societal level , then that would provide a foundation for dealing with unemployment on an individual basis . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caring for the elderly is not valued enough gainful employment is not the only way to justify one 's self , one 's personality , and feeling of self-worth , bohn said .

but the threat is limited , experts say . kazakhstan this week confirmed an outbreak of bird flu in the north of the country where 400 geese died at a poultry farm in late july , but scientists have yet to determine whether the virus poses a threat to humans .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the h5n1 bird flu virus the news follows the discovery of bird flu cases in 18 siberian villages , where russian authorities have ordered the culling of poultry .
the virus found there has been identified as the highly pathogenic h5n1 strain -lrb- photo -rrb- of the avian influenza virus that has killed more than 50 people in south-east asia since 2003 .

construction cranes have become as much a part of berlin as the brandenburg gate , and while renovations are sure to continue during the 2006 world cup , organizers are checking to make sure work at the venues is finished . preparations for the 2006 world cup in the german capital are moving along but not fast enough to put organizing committee members at ease .
they wanted some answers from city 's mayor klaus wowereit on friday .
in it 's letter the world cup organizing committee , led by german soccer legend franz beckenbauer , wanted to know about construction progress at the schlossplatz , and pariser platz as well as how the adidas mini-stadium planed to be set up in front of the reichstag and spectator areas along the spree river were coming along .
bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's fans are ready for the tournament berlin behind other host cities though the organizing committee pointed out that its letter dealt only with " questions " and not " complaints , " in the midst of campaigning for germany 's early federal elections politicians in berlin 's opposition parties are using the opportunity to criticize the social democratic party 's organizational abilities .
" huge construction sites now threaten the world cup , " nicolas zimmer , head of berlin 's christian democratic union , told the newspaper die welt on saturday .
" while other host cities are obviously world-class , berlin is playing in the amateur leagues . "

construction cranes have become as much a part of berlin as the brandenburg gate , and while renovations are sure to continue during the 2006 world cup , organizers are checking to make sure work at the venues is finished . preparations for the 2006 world cup in the german capital are moving along but not fast enough to put organizing committee members at ease .
they wanted some answers from city 's mayor klaus wowereit on friday .
in it 's letter the world cup organizing committee , led by german soccer legend franz beckenbauer , wanted to know about construction progress at the schlossplatz , and pariser platz as well as how the adidas mini-stadium planed to be set up in front of the reichstag and spectator areas along the spree river were coming along .
bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's fans are ready for the tournament berlin behind other host cities though the organizing committee pointed out that its letter dealt only with " questions " and not " complaints , " in the midst of campaigning for germany 's early federal elections politicians in berlin 's opposition parties are using the opportunity to criticize the social democratic party 's organizational abilities .
" huge construction sites now threaten the world cup , " nicolas zimmer , head of berlin 's christian democratic union , told the newspaper die welt on saturday .
" while other host cities are obviously world-class , berlin is playing in the amateur leagues . "
anything less than complete precision could have serious effects on the tournament , as some street and pipeline repairs are scheduled to conclude near the end of may , just two weeks before the world cup kicks off on june 9 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's preparations have to stay on schedule or expect traffic delays during the world cup without referring to the state of berlin 's preparations and citing financial reasons , german public broadcaster ard also announced last week it would broadcast from cologne and not from a glass-walled studio close to the brandenburg gate as planners in berlin hoped .

angst over the hovering specter of unemployment reached an all-time high last january as the number of unemployed climbed to over five million .
germany 's neighbors have similar problems , but the fear seems less severe . " germany is a country in which many people are unhappy and do n't have a job any more , " a dutch correspondent once described the ' german disease . '
" if they do , however , have a job , then they want to work as little as possible . " the questions is what has gone wrong in germany so that the mood has soured to this degree and politicians lack the courage to lead with confidence .
high unemployment has seemingly laid germany lame .
everyone today has an unemployed friend or relative , said bernd bohn , a psychologist at the university of bremen .
and thus the feeling has spread : nothing is secure any more , the question is only : when will it hit me ?
in neighboring countries , however , the problem is dealt with differently . " we saw in britain in the 1970s how maggie thatcher gave a proper crash course in flexibility , " bohn said .
a more relaxed approach was taken in the netherlands in the late 1980s , when all societal groups - workers , corporations , politicians and unions - pulled together and agreed that something has to change . " we have to become more flexible , " bohn said .
" for example , when we are unemployed , then we must be prepared to work for three or six months at ' below cost . " ' gainful employment is n't everything bildunterschrift : getting training to find a new job flexibility is the magic word for industrial psychologists .
examples are to be found in britian and the usa .
here , as in germany , many people find themselves temporarily without work , but there they use the time to gain further qualifications to give them competitive advantage in the job market . german politicians attack the problem too one-sidedly by constantly blaming the private economy for not creating more jobs .
there has to be a mental paradigm shift , bohn said . " we continue to define ourselves primarily through our occupation , and this is , after all , the basis for our material existence , " he added .
" if we could have a change in attitude at the societal level , then that would provide a foundation for dealing with unemployment on an individual basis . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : caring for the elderly is not valued enough gainful employment is not the only way to justify one 's self , one 's personality , and feeling of self-worth , bohn said .
society should place more value on volunteer work and other occupations that benefit society at large . generous insurance and efficient placements the danes also changed their mental attitudes after the economic crisis a decade ago .
the tiny northern neighbor has an extremely flexible labor market with hardly any protection against getting fired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : she 'll get generous unemployment money should she need it instead denmark has one of europe 's most generous unemployment insurance plans .
it pays up to 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,226 -rrb- per month over a four-year period .
at the same time , job placement programs find tailor made traineeships , even if the demands on the job seekers are quite high . the austrians have also begun to feel the crunch in the past years .
there the long-term unemployed are still better compensated than in germany , and the placement system is more efficient .
in the alpine republic , the rule is : if the placement agencies work efficiently , then the state can be more generous . monika lohmüller -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : schröder under attack for remarks german chancellor gerhard schröder has come under fire for saying that german corporate heads are failing to create new jobs in spite of business-friendly reforms initiated by his government .

it was early morning , before 0600 , but already it was hot .
the bright , sunny august morning with barely a cloud in the sky was almost the same conditions as those of that day 60 years before .
yuri kitamura , now 79 , was just 19 when the bomb exploded above the city , killing tens of thousands of hiroshima 's people .
she has come back to the park to remember .
" it 's been many years and months to get to where we are today , " she said .
" but it does n't matter how long it has taken .
the memories of the day come back vividly .
they still cause me pain . "
promote peace alan james and john larkin , who had come here from corby in north lancashire , told me there was a feeling of serenity in the park .
tom , from canada , said there was no alternative to world peace .
" i want to spread the word back home , " he said .
barra mckenzie , from new zealand , said it would be so much more impressive if other countries could promote peace in the same way that japan does .
" it was very moving .
it 's a hot day and there 's not much shade but it really brings it home to you .
it 's amazing that all these japanese people are actively promoting peace . "
around the edges of the main ceremony , different rituals and commemorations were taking place .
shinto priests in their flowing white robes celebrated an elaborate ritual in front of the mound which contains the ashes of 70,000 of those who died .
on the other side of the mound , buddhist monks were chanting .
heads bowed occasionally , an elderly man or woman would step forward and gently place some flowers on the makeshift shrine .
at 0815 the peace bell rang out across the park and instantly people stopped where they were , some even in the middle of the road , and bowed their heads .
on one side of the park , a small group of demonstrators protested against the presence of japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi here .
shouting through the silence , they were watched closely by the police .
after the main ceremony finished , many people stayed around , soaking up the atmosphere in the park .
it got hotter and hotter as the morning wore on , but no-one seemed to care .
many , it seemed , felt like this was the right place to be today .
it was almost as if they wanted to stay to share the memories of lost loved ones .
old men showed children their yellowing photographs .
others just sat quietly under the trees , lost in their own thoughts .
and from time to time , the peace bell rang out still , as people clambered up on to the pedestal to ring it for themselves and signal their desire to rid the world of nuclear weapons .

the us had backed the package , which includes a proposal to let iran develop a civilian nuclear programme if it halts uranium enrichment activities .
tehran has threatened to resume nuclear activities next week that have been suspended since november 2004 .
its rejection of the eu proposals came as the new hardline president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , was sworn in .
iran says its nuclear programme is peaceful , but western countries suspect it is a front hiding efforts to build atomic bombs .
the european union - through britain , germany and france - has been trying to find a compromise solution over iran 's nuclear plans for two years .
but correspondents say the latest proposals fail to contain any fundamental new concessions .
' unacceptable ' " the europeans ' submitted proposals regarding the nuclear case are not acceptable for iran , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi was quoted as saying .
we think this proposal is a good one for the iranians to consider and we would urge that they do so nicholas burns us under-secretary of state " the proposals are unacceptable because iran 's right to enrich uranium is not included , " mr asefi said .
he added that a full response to the eu 's proposals would come on saturday or sunday .
earlier , under-secretary of state nicholas burns said the us hoped iran would take the proposal seriously and that washington was " very much in support " of efforts by the three european states .
bbc state department correspondent jonathan beale said the us move was highly significant , given that until recently , the us opposed iran having its own civilian nuclear programme , as it suspected tehran of wanting to develop nuclear weapons .
the eu plan - which has not been made public - is said to offer recognition of iran 's right to produce nuclear power for civilian purposes , as well improved trade relations with the eu and guarantees of alternative nuclear fuel sources from europe and russia .
in return , the europeans reportedly insist that tehran should permanently give up nuclear enrichment and construction of a heavy-water reactor , which could be used to make a bomb .
emergency meeting last week , tehran said work at the uranium conversion plant near isfahan would start again on wednesday and cited lack of progress in talks with the uk , france and germany .
britain , france and germany have called an emergency meeting of the un 's nuclear agency , the iaea , on tuesday .
the agency could refer the matter to the un security council .

the us had backed the package , which includes a proposal to let iran develop a civilian nuclear programme if it halts uranium enrichment activities .
tehran has threatened to resume nuclear activities next week that have been suspended since november 2004 .
its rejection of the eu proposals came as the new hardline president , mahmoud ahmadinejad , was sworn in .
iran says its nuclear programme is peaceful , but western countries suspect it is a front hiding efforts to build atomic bombs .
the european union - through britain , germany and france - has been trying to find a compromise solution over iran 's nuclear plans for two years .
but correspondents say the latest proposals fail to contain any fundamental new concessions .
' unacceptable ' " the europeans ' submitted proposals regarding the nuclear case are not acceptable for iran , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi was quoted as saying .
we think this proposal is a good one for the iranians to consider and we would urge that they do so nicholas burns us under-secretary of state " the proposals are unacceptable because iran 's right to enrich uranium is not included , " mr asefi said .
he added that a full response to the eu 's proposals would come on saturday or sunday .
earlier , under-secretary of state nicholas burns said the us hoped iran would take the proposal seriously and that washington was " very much in support " of efforts by the three european states .
bbc state department correspondent jonathan beale said the us move was highly significant , given that until recently , the us opposed iran having its own civilian nuclear programme , as it suspected tehran of wanting to develop nuclear weapons .
the eu plan - which has not been made public - is said to offer recognition of iran 's right to produce nuclear power for civilian purposes , as well improved trade relations with the eu and guarantees of alternative nuclear fuel sources from europe and russia .
in return , the europeans reportedly insist that tehran should permanently give up nuclear enrichment and construction of a heavy-water reactor , which could be used to make a bomb .
emergency meeting last week , tehran said work at the uranium conversion plant near isfahan would start again on wednesday and cited lack of progress in talks with the uk , france and germany .
britain , france and germany have called an emergency meeting of the un 's nuclear agency , the iaea , on tuesday .
the agency could refer the matter to the un security council .
