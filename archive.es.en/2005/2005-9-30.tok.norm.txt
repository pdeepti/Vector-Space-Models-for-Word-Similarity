program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on women wage gap between the sexes widens in germany work-life balance gets boost in germany " glass ceiling " lawsuit takes aim at german bank eu takes slow road to gender equity germany -pipe- 30.09.2005 changing the rules of the men-only game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is holding her own in untested waters despite equality laws , quotas for women and vitriolic feminists , germany has yet to see a woman climb to the highest rung of political power .
all eyes are now on angela merkel to see if she gains entry to the boys ’ club . the inconclusive poll on sept 18 which has plunged germany into political paralysis and triggered horse-trading between the main parties has overshadowed another aspect of the election that generated much excitement : whether europe ’ s largest economy will , for the first time in its postwar history , be led by a woman . the answer to that no longer seems clear after the conservatives ' disastrous election result and challenges to angela merkel 's claim to the chancellorship . but there 's no denying that merkel 's candidacy for the highest political post has been nothing short of historic in a country where the reins of power are overwhelmingly in the hands of men . katja husen , spokesperson for women 's issues at the green party pointed out that women in germany are persistently absent from top jobs . " the fact that we ’ ve never had a female chancellor before is one aspect .
but it 's the same in company boardrooms - we 've just never had famous women in top positions of power . " broader representation in politics however , statistics show that compared to the german corporate world , women have undeniably been more successful at breaking through the so-called glass ceiling when it comes to politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female participation in politics has gradually risen over the years ever since conservative chancellor konrad adenauer reluctantly appointed the country 's first female minister , elisabeth schwarzhaupt -lrb- photo -rrb- , to his cabinet in 1961 . today , six out of 13 ministries in chancellor schröder ’ s government are led by women - a big leap from the two female ministers in former chancellor helmut kohl ’ s cabinet .
and women 's share in parliament currently hovers at 32 percent , up from a mere 9 percent in 1980 . the proportionately better representation of women in politics is attributed to a slew of laws and policies guaranteeing gender equality and equality of opportunity that were put in place in the 1980s and 1990s . the crucial quota bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast , center , will be co-chairing the leadership of the greens together with her male colleague , fritz kuhn but , most agree that it 's the " women 's quota , " first introduced by the green party in the 1980s with a strict 50 percent reservation of party seats and posts for women , that was the trigger for an explosive increase in the number of women politicians . " it 's been the most effective instrument to boost women 's participation in politics , better than all the equality legislation and confidence-boosting measures for women , " said husen . " thanks to it , men have no choice but to see to it that they recruit more women . " the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- followed suit in 1988 , committing itself to filling 40 percent of its posts with women while the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- finally agreed in 1996 to include more women in its ranks , but remained noncommittal about the exact proportion . the old boys ' network the measures may have indeed led to more representation for women in politics , but many point out that it has n't really given women tangible influence or allowed them to penetrate the highest echelons of political power in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler , left with chancellor schröder one major reason , according to katja husen , is the fact that high-level german politics is still exclusively a boys ' club . " power structures in germany are very homogenous - they 're dominated by male academics and the rules of the game are thus set by men too , " said husen . " there 's no sense of bringing in diversity or encouraging people with different backgrounds - it 's a very german way of thinking . " in a recent article , germany 's leading feminist alice schwarzer likened chancellor schröder 's punch-drunk performance on the evening of the election - where he dismissed merkel 's claim to the chancellorship insisting he should carry on instead - to a matter of honor .
schwarzer said schröder was behaving like a tyrant and could n't bear the thought of losing out to a woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sixty years after hitler and 87 years after gaining the right for women to vote , the people may have elected her -lrb- merkel -rrb- , but the majority of the powerful are still far removed from conceding the highest office to a woman , " schwarzer -lrb- photo -rrb- wrote . lack of role models but macho attitudes are n't the only problem . claudia neusüss , a former executive director of the heinrich böll foundation , pointed out that a strong domestic image of women as taking responsibility for family and children that originated in west germany in the 1970s and 1980s still dominates the current political sphere to an extent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " though it 's all changing now , women too tend to think along those lines .
besides , juggling a career and family in germany is n't easy either , " she said . a lack of role models is a further hurdle to women aiming high in politics . though germany has seen three female presidents of the bundestag and a woman presiding over the constitutional court , the trend has stopped when it comes to leading the country , either in the role of president or chancellor , or even one of the two big political parties - until merkel , that is . " women have to develop their own rules of the game , they have to know what they want and learn to move away from typically ' soft ' topics such as health and education and take on the harder ones , " said neusüss . " merkel needs to do more " given the odds , angela merkel 's rise to the top - albeit facilitated by the cdu 's damaging party scandal that led to helmut kohl ’ s departure - has , most agree , sent an important signal to women aspiring for higher positions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with her team " the very fact that it 's possible for a woman from a conservative party to become chancellor is very progressive , " said neusüss , adding that merkel needed to do much more for women than the rather flimsy promises on family and equality in her party platform . " being a woman at the top is n't enough , " neusüss said . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and the female question with less than three weeks to go to the elections , germany is wondering what it will mean to have its first woman chancellor .

all eyes are now on angela merkel to see if she gains entry to the boys ’ club . the inconclusive poll on sept 18 which has plunged germany into political paralysis and triggered horse-trading between the main parties has overshadowed another aspect of the election that generated much excitement : whether europe ’ s largest economy will , for the first time in its postwar history , be led by a woman . the answer to that no longer seems clear after the conservatives ' disastrous election result and challenges to angela merkel 's claim to the chancellorship . but there 's no denying that merkel 's candidacy for the highest political post has been nothing short of historic in a country where the reins of power are overwhelmingly in the hands of men . katja husen , spokesperson for women 's issues at the green party pointed out that women in germany are persistently absent from top jobs . " the fact that we ’ ve never had a female chancellor before is one aspect .
but it 's the same in company boardrooms - we 've just never had famous women in top positions of power . " broader representation in politics however , statistics show that compared to the german corporate world , women have undeniably been more successful at breaking through the so-called glass ceiling when it comes to politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female participation in politics has gradually risen over the years ever since conservative chancellor konrad adenauer reluctantly appointed the country 's first female minister , elisabeth schwarzhaupt -lrb- photo -rrb- , to his cabinet in 1961 . today , six out of 13 ministries in chancellor schröder ’ s government are led by women - a big leap from the two female ministers in former chancellor helmut kohl ’ s cabinet .
and women 's share in parliament currently hovers at 32 percent , up from a mere 9 percent in 1980 . the proportionately better representation of women in politics is attributed to a slew of laws and policies guaranteeing gender equality and equality of opportunity that were put in place in the 1980s and 1990s . the crucial quota bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast , center , will be co-chairing the leadership of the greens together with her male colleague , fritz kuhn but , most agree that it 's the " women 's quota , " first introduced by the green party in the 1980s with a strict 50 percent reservation of party seats and posts for women , that was the trigger for an explosive increase in the number of women politicians . " it 's been the most effective instrument to boost women 's participation in politics , better than all the equality legislation and confidence-boosting measures for women , " said husen . " thanks to it , men have no choice but to see to it that they recruit more women . " the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- followed suit in 1988 , committing itself to filling 40 percent of its posts with women while the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- finally agreed in 1996 to include more women in its ranks , but remained noncommittal about the exact proportion . the old boys ' network the measures may have indeed led to more representation for women in politics , but many point out that it has n't really given women tangible influence or allowed them to penetrate the highest echelons of political power in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler , left with chancellor schröder one major reason , according to katja husen , is the fact that high-level german politics is still exclusively a boys ' club . " power structures in germany are very homogenous - they 're dominated by male academics and the rules of the game are thus set by men too , " said husen . " there 's no sense of bringing in diversity or encouraging people with different backgrounds - it 's a very german way of thinking . " in a recent article , germany 's leading feminist alice schwarzer likened chancellor schröder 's punch-drunk performance on the evening of the election - where he dismissed merkel 's claim to the chancellorship insisting he should carry on instead - to a matter of honor .
schwarzer said schröder was behaving like a tyrant and could n't bear the thought of losing out to a woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sixty years after hitler and 87 years after gaining the right for women to vote , the people may have elected her -lrb- merkel -rrb- , but the majority of the powerful are still far removed from conceding the highest office to a woman , " schwarzer -lrb- photo -rrb- wrote . lack of role models but macho attitudes are n't the only problem . claudia neusüss , a former executive director of the heinrich böll foundation , pointed out that a strong domestic image of women as taking responsibility for family and children that originated in west germany in the 1970s and 1980s still dominates the current political sphere to an extent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " though it 's all changing now , women too tend to think along those lines .
besides , juggling a career and family in germany is n't easy either , " she said . a lack of role models is a further hurdle to women aiming high in politics . though germany has seen three female presidents of the bundestag and a woman presiding over the constitutional court , the trend has stopped when it comes to leading the country , either in the role of president or chancellor , or even one of the two big political parties - until merkel , that is . " women have to develop their own rules of the game , they have to know what they want and learn to move away from typically ' soft ' topics such as health and education and take on the harder ones , " said neusüss . " merkel needs to do more " given the odds , angela merkel 's rise to the top - albeit facilitated by the cdu 's damaging party scandal that led to helmut kohl ’ s departure - has , most agree , sent an important signal to women aspiring for higher positions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with her team " the very fact that it 's possible for a woman from a conservative party to become chancellor is very progressive , " said neusüss , adding that merkel needed to do much more for women than the rather flimsy promises on family and equality in her party platform . " being a woman at the top is n't enough , " neusüss said . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and the female question with less than three weeks to go to the elections , germany is wondering what it will mean to have its first woman chancellor .

negotiations for turkey 's possible entry to the european union are rocky even before they have started .
deutsche welle 's baha güngör believes that the eu-turkey project does n't have a realistic chance . whether membership talks with turkey can begin , as planned , on monday will be decided at the last minute .
after ambassadors from the 25 member states failed to agree on a negotiating mandate at their meeting on thursday , eu foreign ministers now have to attend a special session in luxembourg on sunday , since unanimous approval is mandatory for the negotiations to start .
none of the 25 eu member states , not even cyprus , wants to be the spoilsport , which is why there will probably be a last minute agreement to go ahead with the negotiations .
but even if that 's the case , the eu-turkey project is hardly realistic .
anyone who still thinks that one day in the distant future , after 10 or 15 years of negotiations , turkey will become an eu member , is either naive or has no clue about the country 's inner workings .
turkey is a country on the periphery of europe and therefore , a country whose stability means much politically , economically , and in terms of security , to europe .
those who are sensible would want to include turkey in the continent 's integration process and to get ankara to pursue the values and visions of europe .
domestic politics at the center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's " non " to the eu constitution was for many a rejection of turkey yet before accession negotiations started , many eu countries turned the process into a self-serve buffet , looking to further their own national interests .
the election campaign in germany , as well as the french rejection of the eu constitution , which to a great deal was a rejection of turkey , reveal this clearly .
demands too high , too soon if the negotiations indeed start on monday , it will be less a question of whether they will ever successfully be brought to an end .
rather , the question will be when they can be deemed to have failed , or at least be interrupted for a few years .
grounds for failure wo n't be the eu 's regulations , the so-called " acquis communautaire . "
a lengthy transition period or permanent security clauses could be agreed .
turkey is by far the largest and most densely populated country that has ever attempted eu entry .
in many economic areas , it still lags far behind the eu average .
but for all of these problems , solutions could be found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern , turkish cypriots supported reunification of the island that 's been divided since 1974 but the eu is making a big mistake by demanding the maximum from turkey , i.e. recognizing cyprus or dealing with the armenian genocide , right at the start of the negotiations .
they 're playing their trump cards wrongly , creating resentment and hardening the country that could , and also has to , address such topics in the course of drawing closer to european values .
euphoria long gone turks ' enthusiasm for europe has , for the most part , disappeared .
the country 's nationalists are gaining in popularity and are reconquering territory it had lost before .
it 's no secret that in the next elections , expected in two years , turkish nationalism will experience a rebirth .
the feeling is growing among turks that the numerous reforms in the past and the strengthening of democratic forces in asia minor since the signing of the 1963 association agreement with the eu have all been for naught .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish flag and an image of the country 's founder , kemal atatürk it is a shame that the eu will have clumsily dropped its chance to achieve its goal of becoming a " global player " and its credibility in fostering dialogue between cultures and religions .
for turkey , it 's a shame that the country 's development into a democratic state will be threatened with large setbacks .
for when the eu and turkey start negotiations as planned , the participants will already be sapped of their strength .
they will be short of breath for the long road ahead - unless a miracle happens . baha güngör -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu turkey talks threatened eu foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting sunday to talk about membership talks with turkey after their ambassadors failed to reach an agreement on a negotiating mandate thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on women wage gap between the sexes widens in germany work-life balance gets boost in germany " glass ceiling " lawsuit takes aim at german bank eu takes slow road to gender equity germany -pipe- 30.09.2005 changing the rules of the men-only game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is holding her own in untested waters despite equality laws , quotas for women and vitriolic feminists , germany has yet to see a woman climb to the highest rung of political power .
all eyes are now on angela merkel to see if she gains entry to the boys ’ club . the inconclusive poll on sept 18 which has plunged germany into political paralysis and triggered horse-trading between the main parties has overshadowed another aspect of the election that generated much excitement : whether europe ’ s largest economy will , for the first time in its postwar history , be led by a woman . the answer to that no longer seems clear after the conservatives ' disastrous election result and challenges to angela merkel 's claim to the chancellorship . but there 's no denying that merkel 's candidacy for the highest political post has been nothing short of historic in a country where the reins of power are overwhelmingly in the hands of men . katja husen , spokesperson for women 's issues at the green party pointed out that women in germany are persistently absent from top jobs . " the fact that we ’ ve never had a female chancellor before is one aspect .
but it 's the same in company boardrooms - we 've just never had famous women in top positions of power . " broader representation in politics however , statistics show that compared to the german corporate world , women have undeniably been more successful at breaking through the so-called glass ceiling when it comes to politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female participation in politics has gradually risen over the years ever since conservative chancellor konrad adenauer reluctantly appointed the country 's first female minister , elisabeth schwarzhaupt -lrb- photo -rrb- , to his cabinet in 1961 . today , six out of 13 ministries in chancellor schröder ’ s government are led by women - a big leap from the two female ministers in former chancellor helmut kohl ’ s cabinet .
and women 's share in parliament currently hovers at 32 percent , up from a mere 9 percent in 1980 . the proportionately better representation of women in politics is attributed to a slew of laws and policies guaranteeing gender equality and equality of opportunity that were put in place in the 1980s and 1990s . the crucial quota bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast , center , will be co-chairing the leadership of the greens together with her male colleague , fritz kuhn but , most agree that it 's the " women 's quota , " first introduced by the green party in the 1980s with a strict 50 percent reservation of party seats and posts for women , that was the trigger for an explosive increase in the number of women politicians . " it 's been the most effective instrument to boost women 's participation in politics , better than all the equality legislation and confidence-boosting measures for women , " said husen . " thanks to it , men have no choice but to see to it that they recruit more women . " the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- followed suit in 1988 , committing itself to filling 40 percent of its posts with women while the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- finally agreed in 1996 to include more women in its ranks , but remained noncommittal about the exact proportion . the old boys ' network the measures may have indeed led to more representation for women in politics , but many point out that it has n't really given women tangible influence or allowed them to penetrate the highest echelons of political power in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler , left with chancellor schröder one major reason , according to katja husen , is the fact that high-level german politics is still exclusively a boys ' club . " power structures in germany are very homogenous - they 're dominated by male academics and the rules of the game are thus set by men too , " said husen . " there 's no sense of bringing in diversity or encouraging people with different backgrounds - it 's a very german way of thinking . " in a recent article , germany 's leading feminist alice schwarzer likened chancellor schröder 's punch-drunk performance on the evening of the election - where he dismissed merkel 's claim to the chancellorship insisting he should carry on instead - to a matter of honor .
schwarzer said schröder was behaving like a tyrant and could n't bear the thought of losing out to a woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sixty years after hitler and 87 years after gaining the right for women to vote , the people may have elected her -lrb- merkel -rrb- , but the majority of the powerful are still far removed from conceding the highest office to a woman , " schwarzer -lrb- photo -rrb- wrote . lack of role models but macho attitudes are n't the only problem . claudia neusüss , a former executive director of the heinrich böll foundation , pointed out that a strong domestic image of women as taking responsibility for family and children that originated in west germany in the 1970s and 1980s still dominates the current political sphere to an extent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " though it 's all changing now , women too tend to think along those lines .
besides , juggling a career and family in germany is n't easy either , " she said . a lack of role models is a further hurdle to women aiming high in politics . though germany has seen three female presidents of the bundestag and a woman presiding over the constitutional court , the trend has stopped when it comes to leading the country , either in the role of president or chancellor , or even one of the two big political parties - until merkel , that is . " women have to develop their own rules of the game , they have to know what they want and learn to move away from typically ' soft ' topics such as health and education and take on the harder ones , " said neusüss . " merkel needs to do more " given the odds , angela merkel 's rise to the top - albeit facilitated by the cdu 's damaging party scandal that led to helmut kohl ’ s departure - has , most agree , sent an important signal to women aspiring for higher positions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with her team " the very fact that it 's possible for a woman from a conservative party to become chancellor is very progressive , " said neusüss , adding that merkel needed to do much more for women than the rather flimsy promises on family and equality in her party platform . " being a woman at the top is n't enough , " neusüss said . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and the female question with less than three weeks to go to the elections , germany is wondering what it will mean to have its first woman chancellor .

and women 's share in parliament currently hovers at 32 percent , up from a mere 9 percent in 1980 . the proportionately better representation of women in politics is attributed to a slew of laws and policies guaranteeing gender equality and equality of opportunity that were put in place in the 1980s and 1990s . the crucial quota bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast , center , will be co-chairing the leadership of the greens together with her male colleague , fritz kuhn but , most agree that it 's the " women 's quota , " first introduced by the green party in the 1980s with a strict 50 percent reservation of party seats and posts for women , that was the trigger for an explosive increase in the number of women politicians . " it 's been the most effective instrument to boost women 's participation in politics , better than all the equality legislation and confidence-boosting measures for women , " said husen . " thanks to it , men have no choice but to see to it that they recruit more women . " the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- followed suit in 1988 , committing itself to filling 40 percent of its posts with women while the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- finally agreed in 1996 to include more women in its ranks , but remained noncommittal about the exact proportion . the old boys ' network the measures may have indeed led to more representation for women in politics , but many point out that it has n't really given women tangible influence or allowed them to penetrate the highest echelons of political power in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler , left with chancellor schröder one major reason , according to katja husen , is the fact that high-level german politics is still exclusively a boys ' club . " power structures in germany are very homogenous - they 're dominated by male academics and the rules of the game are thus set by men too , " said husen . " there 's no sense of bringing in diversity or encouraging people with different backgrounds - it 's a very german way of thinking . " in a recent article , germany 's leading feminist alice schwarzer likened chancellor schröder 's punch-drunk performance on the evening of the election - where he dismissed merkel 's claim to the chancellorship insisting he should carry on instead - to a matter of honor .
schwarzer said schröder was behaving like a tyrant and could n't bear the thought of losing out to a woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sixty years after hitler and 87 years after gaining the right for women to vote , the people may have elected her -lrb- merkel -rrb- , but the majority of the powerful are still far removed from conceding the highest office to a woman , " schwarzer -lrb- photo -rrb- wrote . lack of role models but macho attitudes are n't the only problem . claudia neusüss , a former executive director of the heinrich böll foundation , pointed out that a strong domestic image of women as taking responsibility for family and children that originated in west germany in the 1970s and 1980s still dominates the current political sphere to an extent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " though it 's all changing now , women too tend to think along those lines .
besides , juggling a career and family in germany is n't easy either , " she said . a lack of role models is a further hurdle to women aiming high in politics . though germany has seen three female presidents of the bundestag and a woman presiding over the constitutional court , the trend has stopped when it comes to leading the country , either in the role of president or chancellor , or even one of the two big political parties - until merkel , that is . " women have to develop their own rules of the game , they have to know what they want and learn to move away from typically ' soft ' topics such as health and education and take on the harder ones , " said neusüss . " merkel needs to do more " given the odds , angela merkel 's rise to the top - albeit facilitated by the cdu 's damaging party scandal that led to helmut kohl ’ s departure - has , most agree , sent an important signal to women aspiring for higher positions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with her team " the very fact that it 's possible for a woman from a conservative party to become chancellor is very progressive , " said neusüss , adding that merkel needed to do much more for women than the rather flimsy promises on family and equality in her party platform .

all eyes are now on angela merkel to see if she gains entry to the boys ’ club . the inconclusive poll on sept 18 which has plunged germany into political paralysis and triggered horse-trading between the main parties has overshadowed another aspect of the election that generated much excitement : whether europe ’ s largest economy will , for the first time in its postwar history , be led by a woman . the answer to that no longer seems clear after the conservatives ' disastrous election result and challenges to angela merkel 's claim to the chancellorship . but there 's no denying that merkel 's candidacy for the highest political post has been nothing short of historic in a country where the reins of power are overwhelmingly in the hands of men . katja husen , spokesperson for women 's issues at the green party pointed out that women in germany are persistently absent from top jobs . " the fact that we ’ ve never had a female chancellor before is one aspect .
but it 's the same in company boardrooms - we 've just never had famous women in top positions of power .

" no one expects us to go to luxembourg before seeing the negotiation framework document , " said gül , who would be responsible for heading the turkish negotiating delegation .
" of course there is a possibility that negotiations will not start . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign affairs minister abdullah gül will be heading negotiations on monday - if they start gül -lrb- photo -rrb- would not comment on a non-binding resolution that passed european parliament on thursday that attempts to place new conditions on ankara before starting talks , including recognition of the 1915 killing of armenians as genocide regional election dictates austrian course with an important regional election the governing parties in vienna want to win and 80 percent of austrians against admitting turkey to the bloc , domestic politics have motivated austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel 's decision not to back down in the confrontation with ankara , according to political scientist fritz plasser . " he believed he could rally germany and france to the idea of a ' privileged partnership , " ' plasser said .
" when schüssel understood that he would not be joined by berlin and paris , and saw that the european parliament backed opening negotiations with ankara , he had no other choice but to block -lrb- the talks -rrb- in order not to convey any sign of weakness to his public . " turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan played down the importance of the austrian position and said he did n't " think it 's a very serious problem " to the start of talks .
he also emphasized that turkey would not accept anything less than full eu membership at the end of accession negotiations , which are expected to last at least 10 years . the ankara-zagreb connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia should n't be left in the " eternal waiting room , " according to schüssel austria 's insistence at linking negotiations with turkey to an immediate opening of talks with croatia has been another source of the most recent diplomatic wrangling .
the eu cancelled negotiations with croatia in march after brussels said zagreb was not doing enough to catch and prosecute suspected war criminal ante gotovina . german conservatives in the european parliament supported the austrian position and argued that croatia should n't be denied talks because of one man while there were still gross violations of human rights in turkey . " if we trust turkey to make further progress , we should trust croatia too , " schüssel told the financial times .
" it 's in europe 's best interest to start negotiations with croatia immediately . " other european politicians refused to see talks with the two countries connected . " turkey and croatia are naturally separated topics , conditions were given for both of them , " british european affairs minister , douglas alexander said .
" the council of foreign ministers will decide objectively based on these conditions . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : eu-turkey project hardly realistic negotiations for turkey 's possible entry to the european union are rocky even before they have started .

" no one expects us to go to luxembourg before seeing the negotiation framework document , " said gül , who would be responsible for heading the turkish negotiating delegation .
" of course there is a possibility that negotiations will not start . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign affairs minister abdullah gül will be heading negotiations on monday - if they start gül -lrb- photo -rrb- would not comment on a non-binding resolution that passed european parliament on thursday that attempts to place new conditions on ankara before starting talks , including recognition of the 1915 killing of armenians as genocide regional election dictates austrian course with an important regional election the governing parties in vienna want to win and 80 percent of austrians against admitting turkey to the bloc , domestic politics have motivated austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel 's decision not to back down in the confrontation with ankara , according to political scientist fritz plasser . " he believed he could rally germany and france to the idea of a ' privileged partnership , " ' plasser said .
" when schüssel understood that he would not be joined by berlin and paris , and saw that the european parliament backed opening negotiations with ankara , he had no other choice but to block -lrb- the talks -rrb- in order not to convey any sign of weakness to his public . " turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan played down the importance of the austrian position and said he did n't " think it 's a very serious problem " to the start of talks .
he also emphasized that turkey would not accept anything less than full eu membership at the end of accession negotiations , which are expected to last at least 10 years . the ankara-zagreb connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia should n't be left in the " eternal waiting room , " according to schüssel austria 's insistence at linking negotiations with turkey to an immediate opening of talks with croatia has been another source of the most recent diplomatic wrangling .
the eu cancelled negotiations with croatia in march after brussels said zagreb was not doing enough to catch and prosecute suspected war criminal ante gotovina . german conservatives in the european parliament supported the austrian position and argued that croatia should n't be denied talks because of one man while there were still gross violations of human rights in turkey . " if we trust turkey to make further progress , we should trust croatia too , " schüssel told the financial times .
" it 's in europe 's best interest to start negotiations with croatia immediately . " other european politicians refused to see talks with the two countries connected . " turkey and croatia are naturally separated topics , conditions were given for both of them , " british european affairs minister , douglas alexander said .

negotiations for turkey 's possible entry to the european union are rocky even before they have started .
deutsche welle 's baha güngör believes that the eu-turkey project does n't have a realistic chance . whether membership talks with turkey can begin , as planned , on monday will be decided at the last minute .
after ambassadors from the 25 member states failed to agree on a negotiating mandate at their meeting on thursday , eu foreign ministers now have to attend a special session in luxembourg on sunday , since unanimous approval is mandatory for the negotiations to start .
none of the 25 eu member states , not even cyprus , wants to be the spoilsport , which is why there will probably be a last minute agreement to go ahead with the negotiations .
but even if that 's the case , the eu-turkey project is hardly realistic .
anyone who still thinks that one day in the distant future , after 10 or 15 years of negotiations , turkey will become an eu member , is either naive or has no clue about the country 's inner workings .
turkey is a country on the periphery of europe and therefore , a country whose stability means much politically , economically , and in terms of security , to europe .
those who are sensible would want to include turkey in the continent 's integration process and to get ankara to pursue the values and visions of europe .
domestic politics at the center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's " non " to the eu constitution was for many a rejection of turkey yet before accession negotiations started , many eu countries turned the process into a self-serve buffet , looking to further their own national interests .
the election campaign in germany , as well as the french rejection of the eu constitution , which to a great deal was a rejection of turkey , reveal this clearly .
demands too high , too soon if the negotiations indeed start on monday , it will be less a question of whether they will ever successfully be brought to an end .
rather , the question will be when they can be deemed to have failed , or at least be interrupted for a few years .
grounds for failure wo n't be the eu 's regulations , the so-called " acquis communautaire . "
a lengthy transition period or permanent security clauses could be agreed .
turkey is by far the largest and most densely populated country that has ever attempted eu entry .
in many economic areas , it still lags far behind the eu average .
but for all of these problems , solutions could be found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern , turkish cypriots supported reunification of the island that 's been divided since 1974 but the eu is making a big mistake by demanding the maximum from turkey , i.e. recognizing cyprus or dealing with the armenian genocide , right at the start of the negotiations .
they 're playing their trump cards wrongly , creating resentment and hardening the country that could , and also has to , address such topics in the course of drawing closer to european values .
euphoria long gone turks ' enthusiasm for europe has , for the most part , disappeared .
the country 's nationalists are gaining in popularity and are reconquering territory it had lost before .
it 's no secret that in the next elections , expected in two years , turkish nationalism will experience a rebirth .
the feeling is growing among turks that the numerous reforms in the past and the strengthening of democratic forces in asia minor since the signing of the 1963 association agreement with the eu have all been for naught .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish flag and an image of the country 's founder , kemal atatürk it is a shame that the eu will have clumsily dropped its chance to achieve its goal of becoming a " global player " and its credibility in fostering dialogue between cultures and religions .
for turkey , it 's a shame that the country 's development into a democratic state will be threatened with large setbacks .
for when the eu and turkey start negotiations as planned , the participants will already be sapped of their strength .
they will be short of breath for the long road ahead - unless a miracle happens . baha güngör -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu turkey talks threatened eu foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting sunday to talk about membership talks with turkey after their ambassadors failed to reach an agreement on a negotiating mandate thursday .

the automobile companies are examples of improvements taking place in germany 's most important industry . the pictures are easy to compare as new managers take the wheel at volkswagen and mercedes .
mercedes ' dieter zetsche and volkswagen 's wolfgang bernhard both presented their new models with smiling faces at this month 's frankfurt international motor show , but soon after both men dropped the happy faces they showed the press . as mercedes this week announced it would cut 8,500 jobs in germany , and volkswagen employees in a german plant agreed to work for less to keep production of a new sport utility vehicle from moving to portugal , both managers claimed they were just getting started with their work of putting their companies back in order . transforming germany 's car industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : job cuts followed the auto show shine at mercedes the two car manufacturers even discussed investing in each other as a protection against hostile takeovers .
though talks on the topic have been put off until next year , mercedes and vw do n't expect antitrust difficulties as the investments would stay below 20 percent and the companies would not exchange board members , according to a report in der spiegel newsmagazine . germany 's automobile industry is at the beginning of a radical change .
some studies already show that mass manufacturing of automobiles in germany could be completely phased out in as little as 15 years time with factories continuing their migration to china , and india as well as japan and korea to avoid the western europe 's relatively high production costs . the threat of moving to less expensive countries as a way of pressuring employees to work longer for less or watch their jobs disappear seems to be the only answer coming from the auto industry brass .
at the same time managers ' billion-dollar bad decisions go unpunished , giving the workforces a first-hand lesson in globalization . staff celebrates job cuts there 's more that connects dieter zetsche and wolfgang bernhard than they way they 've started their work in germany .
the pair was also responsible for reorganizing daimlerchrysler 's us subsidiary , chrysler , where they cut 26,000 jobs and closed several factories . the workforce in detroit celebrated zetsche 's return to germany - not because they wanted to get rid of him , but because they realized the cuts were the only way to keep the company running at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler 's staff agreed cuts needed to be made now , back home in germany , the men are left to iron out the problems caused by their all-too visionary predecessors , and there are hard times ahead for germany 's production line workers . the stock market has already rewarded zetsche and bernhard for doing their unenviable task , pushing share prices up to heights they have n't seen in a long time .
how long it lasts is an open question , but the markets always bet on the future and one thing is for sure : production in germany is moving forward . henrik böhme -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mercedes announces massive job cuts daimlerchrysler announced that one out of nine jobs would be cut from the workforce at its german mercedes unit in an effort to reduce costs .

all eyes are now on angela merkel to see if she gains entry to the boys ’ club . the inconclusive poll on sept 18 which has plunged germany into political paralysis and triggered horse-trading between the main parties has overshadowed another aspect of the election that generated much excitement : whether europe ’ s largest economy will , for the first time in its postwar history , be led by a woman . the answer to that no longer seems clear after the conservatives ' disastrous election result and challenges to angela merkel 's claim to the chancellorship . but there 's no denying that merkel 's candidacy for the highest political post has been nothing short of historic in a country where the reins of power are overwhelmingly in the hands of men . katja husen , spokesperson for women 's issues at the green party pointed out that women in germany are persistently absent from top jobs . " the fact that we ’ ve never had a female chancellor before is one aspect .
but it 's the same in company boardrooms - we 've just never had famous women in top positions of power . " broader representation in politics however , statistics show that compared to the german corporate world , women have undeniably been more successful at breaking through the so-called glass ceiling when it comes to politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female participation in politics has gradually risen over the years ever since conservative chancellor konrad adenauer reluctantly appointed the country 's first female minister , elisabeth schwarzhaupt -lrb- photo -rrb- , to his cabinet in 1961 . today , six out of 13 ministries in chancellor schröder ’ s government are led by women - a big leap from the two female ministers in former chancellor helmut kohl ’ s cabinet .
and women 's share in parliament currently hovers at 32 percent , up from a mere 9 percent in 1980 . the proportionately better representation of women in politics is attributed to a slew of laws and policies guaranteeing gender equality and equality of opportunity that were put in place in the 1980s and 1990s . the crucial quota bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast , center , will be co-chairing the leadership of the greens together with her male colleague , fritz kuhn but , most agree that it 's the " women 's quota , " first introduced by the green party in the 1980s with a strict 50 percent reservation of party seats and posts for women , that was the trigger for an explosive increase in the number of women politicians . " it 's been the most effective instrument to boost women 's participation in politics , better than all the equality legislation and confidence-boosting measures for women , " said husen . " thanks to it , men have no choice but to see to it that they recruit more women . " the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- followed suit in 1988 , committing itself to filling 40 percent of its posts with women while the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- finally agreed in 1996 to include more women in its ranks , but remained noncommittal about the exact proportion . the old boys ' network the measures may have indeed led to more representation for women in politics , but many point out that it has n't really given women tangible influence or allowed them to penetrate the highest echelons of political power in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler , left with chancellor schröder one major reason , according to katja husen , is the fact that high-level german politics is still exclusively a boys ' club . " power structures in germany are very homogenous - they 're dominated by male academics and the rules of the game are thus set by men too , " said husen . " there 's no sense of bringing in diversity or encouraging people with different backgrounds - it 's a very german way of thinking . " in a recent article , germany 's leading feminist alice schwarzer likened chancellor schröder 's punch-drunk performance on the evening of the election - where he dismissed merkel 's claim to the chancellorship insisting he should carry on instead - to a matter of honor .
schwarzer said schröder was behaving like a tyrant and could n't bear the thought of losing out to a woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sixty years after hitler and 87 years after gaining the right for women to vote , the people may have elected her -lrb- merkel -rrb- , but the majority of the powerful are still far removed from conceding the highest office to a woman , " schwarzer -lrb- photo -rrb- wrote . lack of role models but macho attitudes are n't the only problem . claudia neusüss , a former executive director of the heinrich böll foundation , pointed out that a strong domestic image of women as taking responsibility for family and children that originated in west germany in the 1970s and 1980s still dominates the current political sphere to an extent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " though it 's all changing now , women too tend to think along those lines .
besides , juggling a career and family in germany is n't easy either , " she said . a lack of role models is a further hurdle to women aiming high in politics . though germany has seen three female presidents of the bundestag and a woman presiding over the constitutional court , the trend has stopped when it comes to leading the country , either in the role of president or chancellor , or even one of the two big political parties - until merkel , that is . " women have to develop their own rules of the game , they have to know what they want and learn to move away from typically ' soft ' topics such as health and education and take on the harder ones , " said neusüss . " merkel needs to do more " given the odds , angela merkel 's rise to the top - albeit facilitated by the cdu 's damaging party scandal that led to helmut kohl ’ s departure - has , most agree , sent an important signal to women aspiring for higher positions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with her team " the very fact that it 's possible for a woman from a conservative party to become chancellor is very progressive , " said neusüss , adding that merkel needed to do much more for women than the rather flimsy promises on family and equality in her party platform . " being a woman at the top is n't enough , " neusüss said . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and the female question with less than three weeks to go to the elections , germany is wondering what it will mean to have its first woman chancellor .

" the fact that we ’ ve never had a female chancellor before is one aspect .
but it 's the same in company boardrooms - we 've just never had famous women in top positions of power . " broader representation in politics however , statistics show that compared to the german corporate world , women have undeniably been more successful at breaking through the so-called glass ceiling when it comes to politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female participation in politics has gradually risen over the years ever since conservative chancellor konrad adenauer reluctantly appointed the country 's first female minister , elisabeth schwarzhaupt -lrb- photo -rrb- , to his cabinet in 1961 . today , six out of 13 ministries in chancellor schröder ’ s government are led by women - a big leap from the two female ministers in former chancellor helmut kohl ’ s cabinet .
and women 's share in parliament currently hovers at 32 percent , up from a mere 9 percent in 1980 . the proportionately better representation of women in politics is attributed to a slew of laws and policies guaranteeing gender equality and equality of opportunity that were put in place in the 1980s and 1990s . the crucial quota bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast , center , will be co-chairing the leadership of the greens together with her male colleague , fritz kuhn but , most agree that it 's the " women 's quota , " first introduced by the green party in the 1980s with a strict 50 percent reservation of party seats and posts for women , that was the trigger for an explosive increase in the number of women politicians . " it 's been the most effective instrument to boost women 's participation in politics , better than all the equality legislation and confidence-boosting measures for women , " said husen . " thanks to it , men have no choice but to see to it that they recruit more women . " the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- followed suit in 1988 , committing itself to filling 40 percent of its posts with women while the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- finally agreed in 1996 to include more women in its ranks , but remained noncommittal about the exact proportion . the old boys ' network the measures may have indeed led to more representation for women in politics , but many point out that it has n't really given women tangible influence or allowed them to penetrate the highest echelons of political power in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler , left with chancellor schröder one major reason , according to katja husen , is the fact that high-level german politics is still exclusively a boys ' club . " power structures in germany are very homogenous - they 're dominated by male academics and the rules of the game are thus set by men too , " said husen . " there 's no sense of bringing in diversity or encouraging people with different backgrounds - it 's a very german way of thinking . " in a recent article , germany 's leading feminist alice schwarzer likened chancellor schröder 's punch-drunk performance on the evening of the election - where he dismissed merkel 's claim to the chancellorship insisting he should carry on instead - to a matter of honor .
schwarzer said schröder was behaving like a tyrant and could n't bear the thought of losing out to a woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sixty years after hitler and 87 years after gaining the right for women to vote , the people may have elected her -lrb- merkel -rrb- , but the majority of the powerful are still far removed from conceding the highest office to a woman , " schwarzer -lrb- photo -rrb- wrote . lack of role models but macho attitudes are n't the only problem . claudia neusüss , a former executive director of the heinrich böll foundation , pointed out that a strong domestic image of women as taking responsibility for family and children that originated in west germany in the 1970s and 1980s still dominates the current political sphere to an extent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " though it 's all changing now , women too tend to think along those lines .
besides , juggling a career and family in germany is n't easy either , " she said . a lack of role models is a further hurdle to women aiming high in politics . though germany has seen three female presidents of the bundestag and a woman presiding over the constitutional court , the trend has stopped when it comes to leading the country , either in the role of president or chancellor , or even one of the two big political parties - until merkel , that is . " women have to develop their own rules of the game , they have to know what they want and learn to move away from typically ' soft ' topics such as health and education and take on the harder ones , " said neusüss . " merkel needs to do more " given the odds , angela merkel 's rise to the top - albeit facilitated by the cdu 's damaging party scandal that led to helmut kohl ’ s departure - has , most agree , sent an important signal to women aspiring for higher positions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with her team " the very fact that it 's possible for a woman from a conservative party to become chancellor is very progressive , " said neusüss , adding that merkel needed to do much more for women than the rather flimsy promises on family and equality in her party platform . " being a woman at the top is n't enough , " neusüss said . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and the female question with less than three weeks to go to the elections , germany is wondering what it will mean to have its first woman chancellor .

some studies already show that mass manufacturing of automobiles in germany could be completely phased out in as little as 15 years time with factories continuing their migration to china , and india as well as japan and korea to avoid the western europe 's relatively high production costs . the threat of moving to less expensive countries as a way of pressuring employees to work longer for less or watch their jobs disappear seems to be the only answer coming from the auto industry brass .
at the same time managers ' billion-dollar bad decisions go unpunished , giving the workforces a first-hand lesson in globalization . staff celebrates job cuts there 's more that connects dieter zetsche and wolfgang bernhard than they way they 've started their work in germany .
the pair was also responsible for reorganizing daimlerchrysler 's us subsidiary , chrysler , where they cut 26,000 jobs and closed several factories . the workforce in detroit celebrated zetsche 's return to germany - not because they wanted to get rid of him , but because they realized the cuts were the only way to keep the company running at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler 's staff agreed cuts needed to be made now , back home in germany , the men are left to iron out the problems caused by their all-too visionary predecessors , and there are hard times ahead for germany 's production line workers . the stock market has already rewarded zetsche and bernhard for doing their unenviable task , pushing share prices up to heights they have n't seen in a long time .
how long it lasts is an open question , but the markets always bet on the future and one thing is for sure : production in germany is moving forward . henrik böhme -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mercedes announces massive job cuts daimlerchrysler announced that one out of nine jobs would be cut from the workforce at its german mercedes unit in an effort to reduce costs .

the consequences for germany and the world are drought , floods and glacial melt . german film director roland emmerich filmed it with his big-budget natural catastrophe movie " the day after tomorrow . "
the united nations is seeking to slow it down with the kyoto protocol .
and photos of the alps from the early 20th century compared with 2005 show it clearly : global warming .
now , the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg has presented its most recent assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
according to its simulations , global warming is worse than once believed .
it 's an alarming announcement , considering how drastic earlier predictions were .
" our most recent results are more solid than before , " said jochem marotze , the institute 's director .
" we are convinced that they are dependable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising sea levels would wipe cities like new york from the map the results : earth 's temperature will rise on average up to four degrees celsius -lrb- 7.2 fahrenheit -rrb- by the year 2100 and sea levels will increase up to 30 centimeters -lrb- 11.8 inches -rrb- .
one scientist said that this rapid warming of the earth is the " strongest climate change in the last one million years . "
dry spells and floods become the norm the drought and insufferable heat that hit most of western europe , including germany , in 2003 will be a normal occurrence in 50 years .
averages of 30 degrees celsius will no longer be unusual in the june , july and august .
in the winter , instead of snow falling , rain will , and whenever it does so , then it will last longer and be heavier .
" weather situations in which extreme floods occur will increase , " said study leader erich roeckner .
floods like those in southern germany and austria this summer or the elbe flood in 2002 could happen regularly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will skiing become an indoor activity in europe ?
in addition , the mild temperature will mean the end of alpine glaciers by the end of this century .
they will melt away due to the higher temperatures , causing flooding at that time .
but rivers like the rhine , which depend on glacial melt , will turn into a trickle of their former strength .
but not only those living on river flood plains must worry .
due to predominantly westerly winds in the winter , residents along the north sea will encounter sea levels up 43 centimeters , over 40 percent above the average expected increase .
and where will polar bears go ?
over 1,000 scientists from around the world helped collect data for the most recent ipcc assessment report .
in 2007 , a final report will be presented to governments around the world .
the climatologists have reached a consensus on what lies behind the rapid pace of climate change .
" humans have had a large one-of-a-kind influence on the climate , " roeckner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polar bears wo n't be too happy with loss of their habitat foresters will have to adapt to the new climate by planting new varieties of trees .
the polar ice cap will shrink in size , and by 2100 , it is possible that the arctic will be ice free in the summer .
the annual melt of the arctic the past three years equaled 1.3 million square kilometers -lrb- 502,000 square miles -rrb- or four times that the area of germany .
the polar bear , dependent on ice floes to catch and kill its prey , will face more and more difficulties .
" how are polar bears going to survive ? "

" no one expects us to go to luxembourg before seeing the negotiation framework document , " said gül , who would be responsible for heading the turkish negotiating delegation .

" he believed he could rally germany and france to the idea of a ' privileged partnership , " ' plasser said .
" when schüssel understood that he would not be joined by berlin and paris , and saw that the european parliament backed opening negotiations with ankara , he had no other choice but to block -lrb- the talks -rrb- in order not to convey any sign of weakness to his public . " turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan played down the importance of the austrian position and said he did n't " think it 's a very serious problem " to the start of talks .
he also emphasized that turkey would not accept anything less than full eu membership at the end of accession negotiations , which are expected to last at least 10 years . the ankara-zagreb connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia should n't be left in the " eternal waiting room , " according to schüssel austria 's insistence at linking negotiations with turkey to an immediate opening of talks with croatia has been another source of the most recent diplomatic wrangling .
the eu cancelled negotiations with croatia in march after brussels said zagreb was not doing enough to catch and prosecute suspected war criminal ante gotovina . german conservatives in the european parliament supported the austrian position and argued that croatia should n't be denied talks because of one man while there were still gross violations of human rights in turkey . " if we trust turkey to make further progress , we should trust croatia too , " schüssel told the financial times .
" it 's in europe 's best interest to start negotiations with croatia immediately . " other european politicians refused to see talks with the two countries connected . " turkey and croatia are naturally separated topics , conditions were given for both of them , " british european affairs minister , douglas alexander said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.09.2005 foreign media warm up to grand coalition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the black-red coalition might just tango together on reforms most foreign media painted a bleak picture of germany 's prospects after the country 's inconclusive poll .
but with a grand coalition likely to take power , many foreign correspondents feel it may not be the worst option . germany has been in the grip of political deadlock for over a week as the conservatives led by angela merkel huddle with chancellor schröder 's social democrats in a string of exploratory talks to see whether the two can work together in a so-called grand coalition . both national and international media is closely following events as the jockeying over prime posts and ministries plays out in the german capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , right , with bavarian premier stoiber at the same time , it 's not exactly easy for foreign journalists based in berlin to explain the tangled negotiations and the quirks of the german political system to their audience back home . but , as opposed to the gloom that the election result triggered in the eu , many foreign media now seems to think that a grand coalition may indeed still be able to drive the eu 's largest economy towards economic and labor reforms . foreign hacks optimistic pascal thibaut from radio france international is confident that a grand coalition would mean anything but stagnation . " i think there probably will be more reforms , " he said .
" there are quite a lot of topics - economic but also social ones where the two parties are able to find a compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are n't so many differences on the big issue of taxes too .
so , i think it will possible to find a compromise which would be able to satisfy german industry , " he added . kobayashi makoto , the head of japan broadcasting corporation in berlin , was optimistic too , saying it would probably be best suited to serve the interests of voters . makoto also pointed out that important bills may in future be passed with a comfortable parliamentary majority . " they -lrb- the grand coalition -rrb- would have a huge majority in the bundestag and the bundesrat - there 's a huge possibility to go further , " he said . concerns over reform pace others however feel that though the two parties might strike some compromises , the pace of reform might indeed suffer . andrew purvis , who heads the berlin office of time life international , said that a grand coalition in germany is n't a disaster , but it would n't be ideal for the country 's much-needed reform process . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder " it clearly would slow the pace of reforms relative to what the cdu -lrb- christian democratic party -rrb- and most of the business community hope for , " purvis said . " it would be difficult for the cdu to progress with any attempt to weaken the negotiating power of the unions or other aspects of labor flexibility , " he said , adding that he still believed that some progress could be made . elina ravantti , who works for the finnish broadcasting company and whose own country currently has a governing coalition was also skeptical about whether a coalition of the social democrats and the conservatives would be able to produce concrete results . " it depends , if the parties are able to find common ground , " she said .
" and it 's not just common ground , but if they have a clear view of how they want to reform the country , then it might be good .
but if they only get this feel-good factor , there wo n't be so many reforms . " no worries over us-german ties doubts over the reform appetite of a grand coalition are also echoed by the wall street journal correspondent david crawford . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but he rejected allegations that a grand coalition as such would have a negative impact on us investors in their business policy towards germany .

negotiations for turkey 's possible entry to the european union are rocky even before they have started .
deutsche welle 's baha güngör believes that the eu-turkey project does n't have a realistic chance . whether membership talks with turkey can begin , as planned , on monday will be decided at the last minute .
after ambassadors from the 25 member states failed to agree on a negotiating mandate at their meeting on thursday , eu foreign ministers now have to attend a special session in luxembourg on sunday , since unanimous approval is mandatory for the negotiations to start .
none of the 25 eu member states , not even cyprus , wants to be the spoilsport , which is why there will probably be a last minute agreement to go ahead with the negotiations .
but even if that 's the case , the eu-turkey project is hardly realistic .
anyone who still thinks that one day in the distant future , after 10 or 15 years of negotiations , turkey will become an eu member , is either naive or has no clue about the country 's inner workings .
turkey is a country on the periphery of europe and therefore , a country whose stability means much politically , economically , and in terms of security , to europe .
those who are sensible would want to include turkey in the continent 's integration process and to get ankara to pursue the values and visions of europe .
domestic politics at the center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's " non " to the eu constitution was for many a rejection of turkey yet before accession negotiations started , many eu countries turned the process into a self-serve buffet , looking to further their own national interests .
the election campaign in germany , as well as the french rejection of the eu constitution , which to a great deal was a rejection of turkey , reveal this clearly .
demands too high , too soon if the negotiations indeed start on monday , it will be less a question of whether they will ever successfully be brought to an end .
rather , the question will be when they can be deemed to have failed , or at least be interrupted for a few years .
grounds for failure wo n't be the eu 's regulations , the so-called " acquis communautaire . "
a lengthy transition period or permanent security clauses could be agreed .
turkey is by far the largest and most densely populated country that has ever attempted eu entry .
in many economic areas , it still lags far behind the eu average .
but for all of these problems , solutions could be found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern , turkish cypriots supported reunification of the island that 's been divided since 1974 but the eu is making a big mistake by demanding the maximum from turkey , i.e. recognizing cyprus or dealing with the armenian genocide , right at the start of the negotiations .
they 're playing their trump cards wrongly , creating resentment and hardening the country that could , and also has to , address such topics in the course of drawing closer to european values .
euphoria long gone turks ' enthusiasm for europe has , for the most part , disappeared .
the country 's nationalists are gaining in popularity and are reconquering territory it had lost before .
it 's no secret that in the next elections , expected in two years , turkish nationalism will experience a rebirth .
the feeling is growing among turks that the numerous reforms in the past and the strengthening of democratic forces in asia minor since the signing of the 1963 association agreement with the eu have all been for naught .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish flag and an image of the country 's founder , kemal atatürk it is a shame that the eu will have clumsily dropped its chance to achieve its goal of becoming a " global player " and its credibility in fostering dialogue between cultures and religions .
for turkey , it 's a shame that the country 's development into a democratic state will be threatened with large setbacks .
for when the eu and turkey start negotiations as planned , the participants will already be sapped of their strength .
they will be short of breath for the long road ahead - unless a miracle happens . baha güngör -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu turkey talks threatened eu foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting sunday to talk about membership talks with turkey after their ambassadors failed to reach an agreement on a negotiating mandate thursday .

18 , which produced a narrow three-seat advantage for merkel 's christian democrats over the social democrats which fell well short of what was required for a governing majority . yet the election could have a psychological impact on the intense negotiations to come before a new government is formed . although three seats are at stake , the christian democrats can at worst only lose one seat because of the complex german electoral system which is a mixture of the majority and proportional systems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , some believe that the delayed vote in dresden , two weeks after general elections in the rest of the country , may still speed up the process of forming a coalition - most likely a " grand coalition " between the spd and the conservatives . chancellor issue plagues talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder both still claim the chancellorship but a chief stumbling block is the insistence of both schröder and merkel that they should be chancellor .
schröder claims he still has a mandate for a third term as chancellor , but merkel said her alliance won the election and therefore she should govern . " the biggest political party in a coalition has the prerogative to put forward a chancellor , " merkel said in an interview with friday 's edition of the sächsische zeitung newspaper which covers the dresden area . merkel added that the negotiations to form a grand coalition - and the horse-trading of ministerial posts that involves - would only begin once a decision had been made on who will be chancellor . schröder however told the same newspaper that the chancellery issue should form part of the negotiations . " we can not say that the negotiations will only begin once we have made concessions , " he said . the social democrats meanwhile poured cold water on claims from the conservatives that schröder would stand aside after the voting in dresden . franz müntefering , the leader of the social democrats , said on thursday : " there is nothing in this .
our demand remains the same : we want to govern with gerhard schröder as chancellor . " calls for schröder to step down yet , guido westerwelle , the leader of the free-market liberal fdp , the conservatives ' real preferred coalition partner , said he " fully expected " that schröder would step aside following the dresden vote . " i assume that will be the occasion for schröder to make way , " westerwelle said . and michael glos , a leading member of the christian social union , the christian democrats ' sister party in bavaria , said he also expected schröder would step down on monday . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign media warm up to grand coalition most foreign media painted a bleak picture of germany 's prospects after the country 's inconclusive poll .

but who gets the credit ?
two top stylists have rival claims to this cinderella story . in politics , image is everything .
and in the run-up to the sept .
18 general election , even the famously non-flamboyant conservative leader angela merkel took this message to heart , trading in her wash ' n ' go pudding bowl hairstyle for a softer , more stylish look .
flattering make-up and the addition of brighter , more fitted suits to her wardrobe completed merkel 's transformation from " kohl 's girl " to " angie . " but merkel did n't do it alone .
the question is , which top german stylist should take the credit for her makeover ?
martina acht , a hairdresser whose salon is in the western city of offenbach , told reuters that her influence was decisive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transformation was already pronounced when merkel met with us president george w. bush " she came to me for advice just before -lrb- us president -rrb- george w. bush came to germany -lrb- in february -rrb- and ever since then , her look has been completely different , " acht said . " since then , she seems so much more feminine , " she added . but celebrity hairdresser udo walz , whose swanky berlin salon is frequented by models and politicians alike , begs to differ .
walz said that he has been working on merkel 's hair for a long time and that she has an appointment with him every four weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrity hairdresser udo walz -lrb- right -rrb- , pictured here with talkshow host sabine christiansen , says merkel is his client " martina acht might have used a blow-dryer on my client 's hair , but she did not cut it , " walz said , laying down the gauntlet in a battle of the scissors that has gleefully been picked up by the german tabloids .
" there are always people around who want to jump on the bandwagon . " walz is also closely acquainted with the hair of the man currently battling merkel for the office of chancellor - incumbent gerhard schröder .
in a 2002 court challenge against a german news agency that said schröder dyed his hair black , walz played the role of key witness .
he testified that , despite his youthful appearance , the 61-year-old schröder does have some grey hairs , but that they are only visible at close range . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rolling stones no fans of " angie " how rock n ' roll is angela merkel ?

negotiations for turkey 's possible entry to the european union are rocky even before they have started .
deutsche welle 's baha güngör believes that the eu-turkey project does n't have a realistic chance . whether membership talks with turkey can begin , as planned , on monday will be decided at the last minute .
after ambassadors from the 25 member states failed to agree on a negotiating mandate at their meeting on thursday , eu foreign ministers now have to attend a special session in luxembourg on sunday , since unanimous approval is mandatory for the negotiations to start .
none of the 25 eu member states , not even cyprus , wants to be the spoilsport , which is why there will probably be a last minute agreement to go ahead with the negotiations .
but even if that 's the case , the eu-turkey project is hardly realistic .
anyone who still thinks that one day in the distant future , after 10 or 15 years of negotiations , turkey will become an eu member , is either naive or has no clue about the country 's inner workings .
turkey is a country on the periphery of europe and therefore , a country whose stability means much politically , economically , and in terms of security , to europe .
those who are sensible would want to include turkey in the continent 's integration process and to get ankara to pursue the values and visions of europe .
domestic politics at the center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's " non " to the eu constitution was for many a rejection of turkey yet before accession negotiations started , many eu countries turned the process into a self-serve buffet , looking to further their own national interests .
the election campaign in germany , as well as the french rejection of the eu constitution , which to a great deal was a rejection of turkey , reveal this clearly .
demands too high , too soon if the negotiations indeed start on monday , it will be less a question of whether they will ever successfully be brought to an end .
rather , the question will be when they can be deemed to have failed , or at least be interrupted for a few years .
grounds for failure wo n't be the eu 's regulations , the so-called " acquis communautaire . "
a lengthy transition period or permanent security clauses could be agreed .
turkey is by far the largest and most densely populated country that has ever attempted eu entry .
in many economic areas , it still lags far behind the eu average .
but for all of these problems , solutions could be found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern , turkish cypriots supported reunification of the island that 's been divided since 1974 but the eu is making a big mistake by demanding the maximum from turkey , i.e. recognizing cyprus or dealing with the armenian genocide , right at the start of the negotiations .
they 're playing their trump cards wrongly , creating resentment and hardening the country that could , and also has to , address such topics in the course of drawing closer to european values .
euphoria long gone turks ' enthusiasm for europe has , for the most part , disappeared .
the country 's nationalists are gaining in popularity and are reconquering territory it had lost before .
it 's no secret that in the next elections , expected in two years , turkish nationalism will experience a rebirth .

" there are always people around who want to jump on the bandwagon . " walz is also closely acquainted with the hair of the man currently battling merkel for the office of chancellor - incumbent gerhard schröder .

but who gets the credit ?
two top stylists have rival claims to this cinderella story . in politics , image is everything .
and in the run-up to the sept .
18 general election , even the famously non-flamboyant conservative leader angela merkel took this message to heart , trading in her wash ' n ' go pudding bowl hairstyle for a softer , more stylish look .
flattering make-up and the addition of brighter , more fitted suits to her wardrobe completed merkel 's transformation from " kohl 's girl " to " angie . " but merkel did n't do it alone .
the question is , which top german stylist should take the credit for her makeover ?
martina acht , a hairdresser whose salon is in the western city of offenbach , told reuters that her influence was decisive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transformation was already pronounced when merkel met with us president george w. bush " she came to me for advice just before -lrb- us president -rrb- george w. bush came to germany -lrb- in february -rrb- and ever since then , her look has been completely different , " acht said . " since then , she seems so much more feminine , " she added . but celebrity hairdresser udo walz , whose swanky berlin salon is frequented by models and politicians alike , begs to differ .
walz said that he has been working on merkel 's hair for a long time and that she has an appointment with him every four weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrity hairdresser udo walz -lrb- right -rrb- , pictured here with talkshow host sabine christiansen , says merkel is his client " martina acht might have used a blow-dryer on my client 's hair , but she did not cut it , " walz said , laying down the gauntlet in a battle of the scissors that has gleefully been picked up by the german tabloids .
" there are always people around who want to jump on the bandwagon . " walz is also closely acquainted with the hair of the man currently battling merkel for the office of chancellor - incumbent gerhard schröder .
in a 2002 court challenge against a german news agency that said schröder dyed his hair black , walz played the role of key witness .
he testified that , despite his youthful appearance , the 61-year-old schröder does have some grey hairs , but that they are only visible at close range . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rolling stones no fans of " angie " how rock n ' roll is angela merkel ?
not rock n ' roll enough to be allowed to use a rolling stones ' song following her campaign speeches .
-lrb- aug .
22 , 2005 -rrb- no sweat , angela chancellor candidate angela merkel 's apricot ensemble attracted all eyes at the premiere of the richard wagner festival .
and some did n't like what they saw , including an editor with a liberal approach towards photoshop .
-lrb- july 28 , 2005 -rrb- changing the rules of the men-only game despite equality laws , quotas for women and vitriolic feminists , germany has yet to see a woman climb to the highest rung of political power .
all eyes are now on angela merkel to see if she gains entry to the boys ’ club .

all eyes are now on angela merkel to see if she gains entry to the boys ’ club . the inconclusive poll on sept 18 which has plunged germany into political paralysis and triggered horse-trading between the main parties has overshadowed another aspect of the election that generated much excitement : whether europe ’ s largest economy will , for the first time in its postwar history , be led by a woman . the answer to that no longer seems clear after the conservatives ' disastrous election result and challenges to angela merkel 's claim to the chancellorship . but there 's no denying that merkel 's candidacy for the highest political post has been nothing short of historic in a country where the reins of power are overwhelmingly in the hands of men . katja husen , spokesperson for women 's issues at the green party pointed out that women in germany are persistently absent from top jobs . " the fact that we ’ ve never had a female chancellor before is one aspect .
but it 's the same in company boardrooms - we 've just never had famous women in top positions of power . " broader representation in politics however , statistics show that compared to the german corporate world , women have undeniably been more successful at breaking through the so-called glass ceiling when it comes to politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female participation in politics has gradually risen over the years ever since conservative chancellor konrad adenauer reluctantly appointed the country 's first female minister , elisabeth schwarzhaupt -lrb- photo -rrb- , to his cabinet in 1961 . today , six out of 13 ministries in chancellor schröder ’ s government are led by women - a big leap from the two female ministers in former chancellor helmut kohl ’ s cabinet .
and women 's share in parliament currently hovers at 32 percent , up from a mere 9 percent in 1980 . the proportionately better representation of women in politics is attributed to a slew of laws and policies guaranteeing gender equality and equality of opportunity that were put in place in the 1980s and 1990s . the crucial quota bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast , center , will be co-chairing the leadership of the greens together with her male colleague , fritz kuhn but , most agree that it 's the " women 's quota , " first introduced by the green party in the 1980s with a strict 50 percent reservation of party seats and posts for women , that was the trigger for an explosive increase in the number of women politicians . " it 's been the most effective instrument to boost women 's participation in politics , better than all the equality legislation and confidence-boosting measures for women , " said husen . " thanks to it , men have no choice but to see to it that they recruit more women . " the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- followed suit in 1988 , committing itself to filling 40 percent of its posts with women while the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- finally agreed in 1996 to include more women in its ranks , but remained noncommittal about the exact proportion . the old boys ' network the measures may have indeed led to more representation for women in politics , but many point out that it has n't really given women tangible influence or allowed them to penetrate the highest echelons of political power in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler , left with chancellor schröder one major reason , according to katja husen , is the fact that high-level german politics is still exclusively a boys ' club . " power structures in germany are very homogenous - they 're dominated by male academics and the rules of the game are thus set by men too , " said husen . " there 's no sense of bringing in diversity or encouraging people with different backgrounds - it 's a very german way of thinking . " in a recent article , germany 's leading feminist alice schwarzer likened chancellor schröder 's punch-drunk performance on the evening of the election - where he dismissed merkel 's claim to the chancellorship insisting he should carry on instead - to a matter of honor .
schwarzer said schröder was behaving like a tyrant and could n't bear the thought of losing out to a woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sixty years after hitler and 87 years after gaining the right for women to vote , the people may have elected her -lrb- merkel -rrb- , but the majority of the powerful are still far removed from conceding the highest office to a woman , " schwarzer -lrb- photo -rrb- wrote . lack of role models but macho attitudes are n't the only problem . claudia neusüss , a former executive director of the heinrich böll foundation , pointed out that a strong domestic image of women as taking responsibility for family and children that originated in west germany in the 1970s and 1980s still dominates the current political sphere to an extent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " though it 's all changing now , women too tend to think along those lines .

" women have to develop their own rules of the game , they have to know what they want and learn to move away from typically ' soft ' topics such as health and education and take on the harder ones , " said neusüss . " merkel needs to do more " given the odds , angela merkel 's rise to the top - albeit facilitated by the cdu 's damaging party scandal that led to helmut kohl ’ s departure - has , most agree , sent an important signal to women aspiring for higher positions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with her team " the very fact that it 's possible for a woman from a conservative party to become chancellor is very progressive , " said neusüss , adding that merkel needed to do much more for women than the rather flimsy promises on family and equality in her party platform .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on women wage gap between the sexes widens in germany work-life balance gets boost in germany " glass ceiling " lawsuit takes aim at german bank eu takes slow road to gender equity germany -pipe- 30.09.2005 changing the rules of the men-only game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is holding her own in untested waters despite equality laws , quotas for women and vitriolic feminists , germany has yet to see a woman climb to the highest rung of political power .
all eyes are now on angela merkel to see if she gains entry to the boys ’ club . the inconclusive poll on sept 18 which has plunged germany into political paralysis and triggered horse-trading between the main parties has overshadowed another aspect of the election that generated much excitement : whether europe ’ s largest economy will , for the first time in its postwar history , be led by a woman . the answer to that no longer seems clear after the conservatives ' disastrous election result and challenges to angela merkel 's claim to the chancellorship . but there 's no denying that merkel 's candidacy for the highest political post has been nothing short of historic in a country where the reins of power are overwhelmingly in the hands of men . katja husen , spokesperson for women 's issues at the green party pointed out that women in germany are persistently absent from top jobs . " the fact that we ’ ve never had a female chancellor before is one aspect .
but it 's the same in company boardrooms - we 've just never had famous women in top positions of power . " broader representation in politics however , statistics show that compared to the german corporate world , women have undeniably been more successful at breaking through the so-called glass ceiling when it comes to politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female participation in politics has gradually risen over the years ever since conservative chancellor konrad adenauer reluctantly appointed the country 's first female minister , elisabeth schwarzhaupt -lrb- photo -rrb- , to his cabinet in 1961 . today , six out of 13 ministries in chancellor schröder ’ s government are led by women - a big leap from the two female ministers in former chancellor helmut kohl ’ s cabinet .
and women 's share in parliament currently hovers at 32 percent , up from a mere 9 percent in 1980 . the proportionately better representation of women in politics is attributed to a slew of laws and policies guaranteeing gender equality and equality of opportunity that were put in place in the 1980s and 1990s . the crucial quota bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast , center , will be co-chairing the leadership of the greens together with her male colleague , fritz kuhn but , most agree that it 's the " women 's quota , " first introduced by the green party in the 1980s with a strict 50 percent reservation of party seats and posts for women , that was the trigger for an explosive increase in the number of women politicians . " it 's been the most effective instrument to boost women 's participation in politics , better than all the equality legislation and confidence-boosting measures for women , " said husen . " thanks to it , men have no choice but to see to it that they recruit more women . " the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- followed suit in 1988 , committing itself to filling 40 percent of its posts with women while the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- finally agreed in 1996 to include more women in its ranks , but remained noncommittal about the exact proportion . the old boys ' network the measures may have indeed led to more representation for women in politics , but many point out that it has n't really given women tangible influence or allowed them to penetrate the highest echelons of political power in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler , left with chancellor schröder one major reason , according to katja husen , is the fact that high-level german politics is still exclusively a boys ' club . " power structures in germany are very homogenous - they 're dominated by male academics and the rules of the game are thus set by men too , " said husen . " there 's no sense of bringing in diversity or encouraging people with different backgrounds - it 's a very german way of thinking . " in a recent article , germany 's leading feminist alice schwarzer likened chancellor schröder 's punch-drunk performance on the evening of the election - where he dismissed merkel 's claim to the chancellorship insisting he should carry on instead - to a matter of honor .
schwarzer said schröder was behaving like a tyrant and could n't bear the thought of losing out to a woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sixty years after hitler and 87 years after gaining the right for women to vote , the people may have elected her -lrb- merkel -rrb- , but the majority of the powerful are still far removed from conceding the highest office to a woman , " schwarzer -lrb- photo -rrb- wrote . lack of role models but macho attitudes are n't the only problem . claudia neusüss , a former executive director of the heinrich böll foundation , pointed out that a strong domestic image of women as taking responsibility for family and children that originated in west germany in the 1970s and 1980s still dominates the current political sphere to an extent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " though it 's all changing now , women too tend to think along those lines .
besides , juggling a career and family in germany is n't easy either , " she said . a lack of role models is a further hurdle to women aiming high in politics . though germany has seen three female presidents of the bundestag and a woman presiding over the constitutional court , the trend has stopped when it comes to leading the country , either in the role of president or chancellor , or even one of the two big political parties - until merkel , that is .

the consequences for germany and the world are drought , floods and glacial melt . german film director roland emmerich filmed it with his big-budget natural catastrophe movie " the day after tomorrow . "
the united nations is seeking to slow it down with the kyoto protocol .
and photos of the alps from the early 20th century compared with 2005 show it clearly : global warming .
now , the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg has presented its most recent assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
according to its simulations , global warming is worse than once believed .
it 's an alarming announcement , considering how drastic earlier predictions were .
" our most recent results are more solid than before , " said jochem marotze , the institute 's director .
" we are convinced that they are dependable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising sea levels would wipe cities like new york from the map the results : earth 's temperature will rise on average up to four degrees celsius -lrb- 7.2 fahrenheit -rrb- by the year 2100 and sea levels will increase up to 30 centimeters -lrb- 11.8 inches -rrb- .
one scientist said that this rapid warming of the earth is the " strongest climate change in the last one million years . "
dry spells and floods become the norm the drought and insufferable heat that hit most of western europe , including germany , in 2003 will be a normal occurrence in 50 years .
averages of 30 degrees celsius will no longer be unusual in the june , july and august .
in the winter , instead of snow falling , rain will , and whenever it does so , then it will last longer and be heavier .
" weather situations in which extreme floods occur will increase , " said study leader erich roeckner .
floods like those in southern germany and austria this summer or the elbe flood in 2002 could happen regularly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will skiing become an indoor activity in europe ?
in addition , the mild temperature will mean the end of alpine glaciers by the end of this century .
they will melt away due to the higher temperatures , causing flooding at that time .
but rivers like the rhine , which depend on glacial melt , will turn into a trickle of their former strength .
but not only those living on river flood plains must worry .
due to predominantly westerly winds in the winter , residents along the north sea will encounter sea levels up 43 centimeters , over 40 percent above the average expected increase .
and where will polar bears go ?
over 1,000 scientists from around the world helped collect data for the most recent ipcc assessment report .
in 2007 , a final report will be presented to governments around the world .
the climatologists have reached a consensus on what lies behind the rapid pace of climate change .
" humans have had a large one-of-a-kind influence on the climate , " roeckner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polar bears wo n't be too happy with loss of their habitat foresters will have to adapt to the new climate by planting new varieties of trees .
the polar ice cap will shrink in size , and by 2100 , it is possible that the arctic will be ice free in the summer .
the annual melt of the arctic the past three years equaled 1.3 million square kilometers -lrb- 502,000 square miles -rrb- or four times that the area of germany .
the polar bear , dependent on ice floes to catch and kill its prey , will face more and more difficulties .
" how are polar bears going to survive ? "

now , the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg has presented its most recent assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
according to its simulations , global warming is worse than once believed .
it 's an alarming announcement , considering how drastic earlier predictions were .
" our most recent results are more solid than before , " said jochem marotze , the institute 's director .
" we are convinced that they are dependable . "

one scientist said that this rapid warming of the earth is the " strongest climate change in the last one million years . "
dry spells and floods become the norm the drought and insufferable heat that hit most of western europe , including germany , in 2003 will be a normal occurrence in 50 years .
averages of 30 degrees celsius will no longer be unusual in the june , july and august .
in the winter , instead of snow falling , rain will , and whenever it does so , then it will last longer and be heavier .

but rivers like the rhine , which depend on glacial melt , will turn into a trickle of their former strength .
but not only those living on river flood plains must worry .
due to predominantly westerly winds in the winter , residents along the north sea will encounter sea levels up 43 centimeters , over 40 percent above the average expected increase .
and where will polar bears go ?
over 1,000 scientists from around the world helped collect data for the most recent ipcc assessment report .
in 2007 , a final report will be presented to governments around the world .
the climatologists have reached a consensus on what lies behind the rapid pace of climate change .

the polar ice cap will shrink in size , and by 2100 , it is possible that the arctic will be ice free in the summer .
the annual melt of the arctic the past three years equaled 1.3 million square kilometers -lrb- 502,000 square miles -rrb- or four times that the area of germany .

all eyes are now on angela merkel to see if she gains entry to the boys ’ club . the inconclusive poll on sept 18 which has plunged germany into political paralysis and triggered horse-trading between the main parties has overshadowed another aspect of the election that generated much excitement : whether europe ’ s largest economy will , for the first time in its postwar history , be led by a woman . the answer to that no longer seems clear after the conservatives ' disastrous election result and challenges to angela merkel 's claim to the chancellorship . but there 's no denying that merkel 's candidacy for the highest political post has been nothing short of historic in a country where the reins of power are overwhelmingly in the hands of men . katja husen , spokesperson for women 's issues at the green party pointed out that women in germany are persistently absent from top jobs . " the fact that we ’ ve never had a female chancellor before is one aspect .
but it 's the same in company boardrooms - we 've just never had famous women in top positions of power . " broader representation in politics however , statistics show that compared to the german corporate world , women have undeniably been more successful at breaking through the so-called glass ceiling when it comes to politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female participation in politics has gradually risen over the years ever since conservative chancellor konrad adenauer reluctantly appointed the country 's first female minister , elisabeth schwarzhaupt -lrb- photo -rrb- , to his cabinet in 1961 . today , six out of 13 ministries in chancellor schröder ’ s government are led by women - a big leap from the two female ministers in former chancellor helmut kohl ’ s cabinet .
and women 's share in parliament currently hovers at 32 percent , up from a mere 9 percent in 1980 . the proportionately better representation of women in politics is attributed to a slew of laws and policies guaranteeing gender equality and equality of opportunity that were put in place in the 1980s and 1990s . the crucial quota bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast , center , will be co-chairing the leadership of the greens together with her male colleague , fritz kuhn but , most agree that it 's the " women 's quota , " first introduced by the green party in the 1980s with a strict 50 percent reservation of party seats and posts for women , that was the trigger for an explosive increase in the number of women politicians . " it 's been the most effective instrument to boost women 's participation in politics , better than all the equality legislation and confidence-boosting measures for women , " said husen . " thanks to it , men have no choice but to see to it that they recruit more women . " the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- followed suit in 1988 , committing itself to filling 40 percent of its posts with women while the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- finally agreed in 1996 to include more women in its ranks , but remained noncommittal about the exact proportion . the old boys ' network the measures may have indeed led to more representation for women in politics , but many point out that it has n't really given women tangible influence or allowed them to penetrate the highest echelons of political power in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler , left with chancellor schröder one major reason , according to katja husen , is the fact that high-level german politics is still exclusively a boys ' club . " power structures in germany are very homogenous - they 're dominated by male academics and the rules of the game are thus set by men too , " said husen . " there 's no sense of bringing in diversity or encouraging people with different backgrounds - it 's a very german way of thinking . " in a recent article , germany 's leading feminist alice schwarzer likened chancellor schröder 's punch-drunk performance on the evening of the election - where he dismissed merkel 's claim to the chancellorship insisting he should carry on instead - to a matter of honor .
schwarzer said schröder was behaving like a tyrant and could n't bear the thought of losing out to a woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sixty years after hitler and 87 years after gaining the right for women to vote , the people may have elected her -lrb- merkel -rrb- , but the majority of the powerful are still far removed from conceding the highest office to a woman , " schwarzer -lrb- photo -rrb- wrote . lack of role models but macho attitudes are n't the only problem . claudia neusüss , a former executive director of the heinrich böll foundation , pointed out that a strong domestic image of women as taking responsibility for family and children that originated in west germany in the 1970s and 1980s still dominates the current political sphere to an extent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " though it 's all changing now , women too tend to think along those lines .
besides , juggling a career and family in germany is n't easy either , " she said . a lack of role models is a further hurdle to women aiming high in politics . though germany has seen three female presidents of the bundestag and a woman presiding over the constitutional court , the trend has stopped when it comes to leading the country , either in the role of president or chancellor , or even one of the two big political parties - until merkel , that is . " women have to develop their own rules of the game , they have to know what they want and learn to move away from typically ' soft ' topics such as health and education and take on the harder ones , " said neusüss . " merkel needs to do more " given the odds , angela merkel 's rise to the top - albeit facilitated by the cdu 's damaging party scandal that led to helmut kohl ’ s departure - has , most agree , sent an important signal to women aspiring for higher positions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with her team " the very fact that it 's possible for a woman from a conservative party to become chancellor is very progressive , " said neusüss , adding that merkel needed to do much more for women than the rather flimsy promises on family and equality in her party platform . " being a woman at the top is n't enough , " neusüss said . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and the female question with less than three weeks to go to the elections , germany is wondering what it will mean to have its first woman chancellor .

negotiations for turkey 's possible entry to the european union are rocky even before they have started .
deutsche welle 's baha güngör believes that the eu-turkey project does n't have a realistic chance . whether membership talks with turkey can begin , as planned , on monday will be decided at the last minute .
after ambassadors from the 25 member states failed to agree on a negotiating mandate at their meeting on thursday , eu foreign ministers now have to attend a special session in luxembourg on sunday , since unanimous approval is mandatory for the negotiations to start .
none of the 25 eu member states , not even cyprus , wants to be the spoilsport , which is why there will probably be a last minute agreement to go ahead with the negotiations .
but even if that 's the case , the eu-turkey project is hardly realistic .
anyone who still thinks that one day in the distant future , after 10 or 15 years of negotiations , turkey will become an eu member , is either naive or has no clue about the country 's inner workings .
turkey is a country on the periphery of europe and therefore , a country whose stability means much politically , economically , and in terms of security , to europe .
those who are sensible would want to include turkey in the continent 's integration process and to get ankara to pursue the values and visions of europe .
domestic politics at the center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's " non " to the eu constitution was for many a rejection of turkey yet before accession negotiations started , many eu countries turned the process into a self-serve buffet , looking to further their own national interests .
the election campaign in germany , as well as the french rejection of the eu constitution , which to a great deal was a rejection of turkey , reveal this clearly .
demands too high , too soon if the negotiations indeed start on monday , it will be less a question of whether they will ever successfully be brought to an end .
rather , the question will be when they can be deemed to have failed , or at least be interrupted for a few years .
grounds for failure wo n't be the eu 's regulations , the so-called " acquis communautaire . "
a lengthy transition period or permanent security clauses could be agreed .
turkey is by far the largest and most densely populated country that has ever attempted eu entry .
in many economic areas , it still lags far behind the eu average .
but for all of these problems , solutions could be found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern , turkish cypriots supported reunification of the island that 's been divided since 1974 but the eu is making a big mistake by demanding the maximum from turkey , i.e. recognizing cyprus or dealing with the armenian genocide , right at the start of the negotiations .
they 're playing their trump cards wrongly , creating resentment and hardening the country that could , and also has to , address such topics in the course of drawing closer to european values .
euphoria long gone turks ' enthusiasm for europe has , for the most part , disappeared .
the country 's nationalists are gaining in popularity and are reconquering territory it had lost before .
it 's no secret that in the next elections , expected in two years , turkish nationalism will experience a rebirth .
the feeling is growing among turks that the numerous reforms in the past and the strengthening of democratic forces in asia minor since the signing of the 1963 association agreement with the eu have all been for naught .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish flag and an image of the country 's founder , kemal atatürk it is a shame that the eu will have clumsily dropped its chance to achieve its goal of becoming a " global player " and its credibility in fostering dialogue between cultures and religions .
for turkey , it 's a shame that the country 's development into a democratic state will be threatened with large setbacks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on women wage gap between the sexes widens in germany work-life balance gets boost in germany " glass ceiling " lawsuit takes aim at german bank eu takes slow road to gender equity germany -pipe- 30.09.2005 changing the rules of the men-only game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is holding her own in untested waters despite equality laws , quotas for women and vitriolic feminists , germany has yet to see a woman climb to the highest rung of political power .
all eyes are now on angela merkel to see if she gains entry to the boys ’ club . the inconclusive poll on sept 18 which has plunged germany into political paralysis and triggered horse-trading between the main parties has overshadowed another aspect of the election that generated much excitement : whether europe ’ s largest economy will , for the first time in its postwar history , be led by a woman . the answer to that no longer seems clear after the conservatives ' disastrous election result and challenges to angela merkel 's claim to the chancellorship . but there 's no denying that merkel 's candidacy for the highest political post has been nothing short of historic in a country where the reins of power are overwhelmingly in the hands of men . katja husen , spokesperson for women 's issues at the green party pointed out that women in germany are persistently absent from top jobs . " the fact that we ’ ve never had a female chancellor before is one aspect .
but it 's the same in company boardrooms - we 've just never had famous women in top positions of power . " broader representation in politics however , statistics show that compared to the german corporate world , women have undeniably been more successful at breaking through the so-called glass ceiling when it comes to politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female participation in politics has gradually risen over the years ever since conservative chancellor konrad adenauer reluctantly appointed the country 's first female minister , elisabeth schwarzhaupt -lrb- photo -rrb- , to his cabinet in 1961 . today , six out of 13 ministries in chancellor schröder ’ s government are led by women - a big leap from the two female ministers in former chancellor helmut kohl ’ s cabinet .
and women 's share in parliament currently hovers at 32 percent , up from a mere 9 percent in 1980 . the proportionately better representation of women in politics is attributed to a slew of laws and policies guaranteeing gender equality and equality of opportunity that were put in place in the 1980s and 1990s . the crucial quota bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast , center , will be co-chairing the leadership of the greens together with her male colleague , fritz kuhn but , most agree that it 's the " women 's quota , " first introduced by the green party in the 1980s with a strict 50 percent reservation of party seats and posts for women , that was the trigger for an explosive increase in the number of women politicians . " it 's been the most effective instrument to boost women 's participation in politics , better than all the equality legislation and confidence-boosting measures for women , " said husen . " thanks to it , men have no choice but to see to it that they recruit more women . " the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- followed suit in 1988 , committing itself to filling 40 percent of its posts with women while the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- finally agreed in 1996 to include more women in its ranks , but remained noncommittal about the exact proportion . the old boys ' network the measures may have indeed led to more representation for women in politics , but many point out that it has n't really given women tangible influence or allowed them to penetrate the highest echelons of political power in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler , left with chancellor schröder one major reason , according to katja husen , is the fact that high-level german politics is still exclusively a boys ' club . " power structures in germany are very homogenous - they 're dominated by male academics and the rules of the game are thus set by men too , " said husen . " there 's no sense of bringing in diversity or encouraging people with different backgrounds - it 's a very german way of thinking . " in a recent article , germany 's leading feminist alice schwarzer likened chancellor schröder 's punch-drunk performance on the evening of the election - where he dismissed merkel 's claim to the chancellorship insisting he should carry on instead - to a matter of honor .
schwarzer said schröder was behaving like a tyrant and could n't bear the thought of losing out to a woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sixty years after hitler and 87 years after gaining the right for women to vote , the people may have elected her -lrb- merkel -rrb- , but the majority of the powerful are still far removed from conceding the highest office to a woman , " schwarzer -lrb- photo -rrb- wrote . lack of role models but macho attitudes are n't the only problem . claudia neusüss , a former executive director of the heinrich böll foundation , pointed out that a strong domestic image of women as taking responsibility for family and children that originated in west germany in the 1970s and 1980s still dominates the current political sphere to an extent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " though it 's all changing now , women too tend to think along those lines .
besides , juggling a career and family in germany is n't easy either , " she said . a lack of role models is a further hurdle to women aiming high in politics . though germany has seen three female presidents of the bundestag and a woman presiding over the constitutional court , the trend has stopped when it comes to leading the country , either in the role of president or chancellor , or even one of the two big political parties - until merkel , that is . " women have to develop their own rules of the game , they have to know what they want and learn to move away from typically ' soft ' topics such as health and education and take on the harder ones , " said neusüss . " merkel needs to do more " given the odds , angela merkel 's rise to the top - albeit facilitated by the cdu 's damaging party scandal that led to helmut kohl ’ s departure - has , most agree , sent an important signal to women aspiring for higher positions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with her team " the very fact that it 's possible for a woman from a conservative party to become chancellor is very progressive , " said neusüss , adding that merkel needed to do much more for women than the rather flimsy promises on family and equality in her party platform . " being a woman at the top is n't enough , " neusüss said . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and the female question with less than three weeks to go to the elections , germany is wondering what it will mean to have its first woman chancellor .

all eyes are now on angela merkel to see if she gains entry to the boys ’ club . the inconclusive poll on sept 18 which has plunged germany into political paralysis and triggered horse-trading between the main parties has overshadowed another aspect of the election that generated much excitement : whether europe ’ s largest economy will , for the first time in its postwar history , be led by a woman . the answer to that no longer seems clear after the conservatives ' disastrous election result and challenges to angela merkel 's claim to the chancellorship . but there 's no denying that merkel 's candidacy for the highest political post has been nothing short of historic in a country where the reins of power are overwhelmingly in the hands of men . katja husen , spokesperson for women 's issues at the green party pointed out that women in germany are persistently absent from top jobs . " the fact that we ’ ve never had a female chancellor before is one aspect .
but it 's the same in company boardrooms - we 've just never had famous women in top positions of power . " broader representation in politics however , statistics show that compared to the german corporate world , women have undeniably been more successful at breaking through the so-called glass ceiling when it comes to politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female participation in politics has gradually risen over the years ever since conservative chancellor konrad adenauer reluctantly appointed the country 's first female minister , elisabeth schwarzhaupt -lrb- photo -rrb- , to his cabinet in 1961 . today , six out of 13 ministries in chancellor schröder ’ s government are led by women - a big leap from the two female ministers in former chancellor helmut kohl ’ s cabinet .
and women 's share in parliament currently hovers at 32 percent , up from a mere 9 percent in 1980 . the proportionately better representation of women in politics is attributed to a slew of laws and policies guaranteeing gender equality and equality of opportunity that were put in place in the 1980s and 1990s . the crucial quota bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast , center , will be co-chairing the leadership of the greens together with her male colleague , fritz kuhn but , most agree that it 's the " women 's quota , " first introduced by the green party in the 1980s with a strict 50 percent reservation of party seats and posts for women , that was the trigger for an explosive increase in the number of women politicians . " it 's been the most effective instrument to boost women 's participation in politics , better than all the equality legislation and confidence-boosting measures for women , " said husen . " thanks to it , men have no choice but to see to it that they recruit more women . " the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- followed suit in 1988 , committing itself to filling 40 percent of its posts with women while the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- finally agreed in 1996 to include more women in its ranks , but remained noncommittal about the exact proportion . the old boys ' network the measures may have indeed led to more representation for women in politics , but many point out that it has n't really given women tangible influence or allowed them to penetrate the highest echelons of political power in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler , left with chancellor schröder one major reason , according to katja husen , is the fact that high-level german politics is still exclusively a boys ' club . " power structures in germany are very homogenous - they 're dominated by male academics and the rules of the game are thus set by men too , " said husen . " there 's no sense of bringing in diversity or encouraging people with different backgrounds - it 's a very german way of thinking . " in a recent article , germany 's leading feminist alice schwarzer likened chancellor schröder 's punch-drunk performance on the evening of the election - where he dismissed merkel 's claim to the chancellorship insisting he should carry on instead - to a matter of honor .
schwarzer said schröder was behaving like a tyrant and could n't bear the thought of losing out to a woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sixty years after hitler and 87 years after gaining the right for women to vote , the people may have elected her -lrb- merkel -rrb- , but the majority of the powerful are still far removed from conceding the highest office to a woman , " schwarzer -lrb- photo -rrb- wrote . lack of role models but macho attitudes are n't the only problem . claudia neusüss , a former executive director of the heinrich böll foundation , pointed out that a strong domestic image of women as taking responsibility for family and children that originated in west germany in the 1970s and 1980s still dominates the current political sphere to an extent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " though it 's all changing now , women too tend to think along those lines .
besides , juggling a career and family in germany is n't easy either , " she said . a lack of role models is a further hurdle to women aiming high in politics . though germany has seen three female presidents of the bundestag and a woman presiding over the constitutional court , the trend has stopped when it comes to leading the country , either in the role of president or chancellor , or even one of the two big political parties - until merkel , that is . " women have to develop their own rules of the game , they have to know what they want and learn to move away from typically ' soft ' topics such as health and education and take on the harder ones , " said neusüss . " merkel needs to do more " given the odds , angela merkel 's rise to the top - albeit facilitated by the cdu 's damaging party scandal that led to helmut kohl ’ s departure - has , most agree , sent an important signal to women aspiring for higher positions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with her team " the very fact that it 's possible for a woman from a conservative party to become chancellor is very progressive , " said neusüss , adding that merkel needed to do much more for women than the rather flimsy promises on family and equality in her party platform . " being a woman at the top is n't enough , " neusüss said . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and the female question with less than three weeks to go to the elections , germany is wondering what it will mean to have its first woman chancellor .
angela merkel , however , is not promising a feminist or even a particularly feminine future .

negotiations for turkey 's possible entry to the european union are rocky even before they have started .
deutsche welle 's baha güngör believes that the eu-turkey project does n't have a realistic chance . whether membership talks with turkey can begin , as planned , on monday will be decided at the last minute .
after ambassadors from the 25 member states failed to agree on a negotiating mandate at their meeting on thursday , eu foreign ministers now have to attend a special session in luxembourg on sunday , since unanimous approval is mandatory for the negotiations to start .
none of the 25 eu member states , not even cyprus , wants to be the spoilsport , which is why there will probably be a last minute agreement to go ahead with the negotiations .
but even if that 's the case , the eu-turkey project is hardly realistic .
anyone who still thinks that one day in the distant future , after 10 or 15 years of negotiations , turkey will become an eu member , is either naive or has no clue about the country 's inner workings .
turkey is a country on the periphery of europe and therefore , a country whose stability means much politically , economically , and in terms of security , to europe .
those who are sensible would want to include turkey in the continent 's integration process and to get ankara to pursue the values and visions of europe .

the election campaign in germany , as well as the french rejection of the eu constitution , which to a great deal was a rejection of turkey , reveal this clearly .
demands too high , too soon if the negotiations indeed start on monday , it will be less a question of whether they will ever successfully be brought to an end .
rather , the question will be when they can be deemed to have failed , or at least be interrupted for a few years .

negotiations for turkey 's possible entry to the european union are rocky even before they have started .
deutsche welle 's baha güngör believes that the eu-turkey project does n't have a realistic chance . whether membership talks with turkey can begin , as planned , on monday will be decided at the last minute .
after ambassadors from the 25 member states failed to agree on a negotiating mandate at their meeting on thursday , eu foreign ministers now have to attend a special session in luxembourg on sunday , since unanimous approval is mandatory for the negotiations to start .
none of the 25 eu member states , not even cyprus , wants to be the spoilsport , which is why there will probably be a last minute agreement to go ahead with the negotiations .
but even if that 's the case , the eu-turkey project is hardly realistic .
anyone who still thinks that one day in the distant future , after 10 or 15 years of negotiations , turkey will become an eu member , is either naive or has no clue about the country 's inner workings .
turkey is a country on the periphery of europe and therefore , a country whose stability means much politically , economically , and in terms of security , to europe .
those who are sensible would want to include turkey in the continent 's integration process and to get ankara to pursue the values and visions of europe .
domestic politics at the center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's " non " to the eu constitution was for many a rejection of turkey yet before accession negotiations started , many eu countries turned the process into a self-serve buffet , looking to further their own national interests .
the election campaign in germany , as well as the french rejection of the eu constitution , which to a great deal was a rejection of turkey , reveal this clearly .
demands too high , too soon if the negotiations indeed start on monday , it will be less a question of whether they will ever successfully be brought to an end .
rather , the question will be when they can be deemed to have failed , or at least be interrupted for a few years .
grounds for failure wo n't be the eu 's regulations , the so-called " acquis communautaire . "
a lengthy transition period or permanent security clauses could be agreed .
turkey is by far the largest and most densely populated country that has ever attempted eu entry .
in many economic areas , it still lags far behind the eu average .
but for all of these problems , solutions could be found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern , turkish cypriots supported reunification of the island that 's been divided since 1974 but the eu is making a big mistake by demanding the maximum from turkey , i.e. recognizing cyprus or dealing with the armenian genocide , right at the start of the negotiations .
they 're playing their trump cards wrongly , creating resentment and hardening the country that could , and also has to , address such topics in the course of drawing closer to european values .
euphoria long gone turks ' enthusiasm for europe has , for the most part , disappeared .
the country 's nationalists are gaining in popularity and are reconquering territory it had lost before .
it 's no secret that in the next elections , expected in two years , turkish nationalism will experience a rebirth .
the feeling is growing among turks that the numerous reforms in the past and the strengthening of democratic forces in asia minor since the signing of the 1963 association agreement with the eu have all been for naught .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish flag and an image of the country 's founder , kemal atatürk it is a shame that the eu will have clumsily dropped its chance to achieve its goal of becoming a " global player " and its credibility in fostering dialogue between cultures and religions .
for turkey , it 's a shame that the country 's development into a democratic state will be threatened with large setbacks .
for when the eu and turkey start negotiations as planned , the participants will already be sapped of their strength .

prosiebensat1 said in a statement that the offer price of 14.11 euros -lrb- $ 16.93 -rrb- per preference share " meets the statutory requirements . "
nevertheless , " irrespective of compliance of the offer price with applicable legal requirements , the executive and supervisory boards take the view that the offer price does not reflect the full value of the prosiebensat1 preference share , " the statement said .
as a result , neither the executive nor the supervisory board was willing to make a recommendation whether shareholders should accept or decline the offer , prosiebensat1 said .
prosieben preference shares closed at 14.29 euros on thursday .
minority shareholders hold around 37.5 percent of the capital .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 30.09.2005 signs of change at mercedes , vw großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes and vw are bringing movement into the auto industry the brands mercedes and volkswagen are known around the world , but their fame remains in the past - for now .
the automobile companies are examples of improvements taking place in germany 's most important industry . the pictures are easy to compare as new managers take the wheel at volkswagen and mercedes .
mercedes ' dieter zetsche and volkswagen 's wolfgang bernhard both presented their new models with smiling faces at this month 's frankfurt international motor show , but soon after both men dropped the happy faces they showed the press . as mercedes this week announced it would cut 8,500 jobs in germany , and volkswagen employees in a german plant agreed to work for less to keep production of a new sport utility vehicle from moving to portugal , both managers claimed they were just getting started with their work of putting their companies back in order . transforming germany 's car industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : job cuts followed the auto show shine at mercedes the two car manufacturers even discussed investing in each other as a protection against hostile takeovers .
though talks on the topic have been put off until next year , mercedes and vw do n't expect antitrust difficulties as the investments would stay below 20 percent and the companies would not exchange board members , according to a report in der spiegel newsmagazine . germany 's automobile industry is at the beginning of a radical change .
some studies already show that mass manufacturing of automobiles in germany could be completely phased out in as little as 15 years time with factories continuing their migration to china , and india as well as japan and korea to avoid the western europe 's relatively high production costs . the threat of moving to less expensive countries as a way of pressuring employees to work longer for less or watch their jobs disappear seems to be the only answer coming from the auto industry brass .
at the same time managers ' billion-dollar bad decisions go unpunished , giving the workforces a first-hand lesson in globalization . staff celebrates job cuts there 's more that connects dieter zetsche and wolfgang bernhard than they way they 've started their work in germany .
the pair was also responsible for reorganizing daimlerchrysler 's us subsidiary , chrysler , where they cut 26,000 jobs and closed several factories . the workforce in detroit celebrated zetsche 's return to germany - not because they wanted to get rid of him , but because they realized the cuts were the only way to keep the company running at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler 's staff agreed cuts needed to be made now , back home in germany , the men are left to iron out the problems caused by their all-too visionary predecessors , and there are hard times ahead for germany 's production line workers . the stock market has already rewarded zetsche and bernhard for doing their unenviable task , pushing share prices up to heights they have n't seen in a long time .
how long it lasts is an open question , but the markets always bet on the future and one thing is for sure : production in germany is moving forward . henrik böhme -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mercedes announces massive job cuts daimlerchrysler announced that one out of nine jobs would be cut from the workforce at its german mercedes unit in an effort to reduce costs .

some studies already show that mass manufacturing of automobiles in germany could be completely phased out in as little as 15 years time with factories continuing their migration to china , and india as well as japan and korea to avoid the western europe 's relatively high production costs . the threat of moving to less expensive countries as a way of pressuring employees to work longer for less or watch their jobs disappear seems to be the only answer coming from the auto industry brass .
at the same time managers ' billion-dollar bad decisions go unpunished , giving the workforces a first-hand lesson in globalization . staff celebrates job cuts there 's more that connects dieter zetsche and wolfgang bernhard than they way they 've started their work in germany .
the pair was also responsible for reorganizing daimlerchrysler 's us subsidiary , chrysler , where they cut 26,000 jobs and closed several factories . the workforce in detroit celebrated zetsche 's return to germany - not because they wanted to get rid of him , but because they realized the cuts were the only way to keep the company running at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler 's staff agreed cuts needed to be made now , back home in germany , the men are left to iron out the problems caused by their all-too visionary predecessors , and there are hard times ahead for germany 's production line workers . the stock market has already rewarded zetsche and bernhard for doing their unenviable task , pushing share prices up to heights they have n't seen in a long time .
how long it lasts is an open question , but the markets always bet on the future and one thing is for sure : production in germany is moving forward . henrik böhme -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mercedes announces massive job cuts daimlerchrysler announced that one out of nine jobs would be cut from the workforce at its german mercedes unit in an effort to reduce costs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on women wage gap between the sexes widens in germany work-life balance gets boost in germany " glass ceiling " lawsuit takes aim at german bank eu takes slow road to gender equity germany -pipe- 30.09.2005 changing the rules of the men-only game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is holding her own in untested waters despite equality laws , quotas for women and vitriolic feminists , germany has yet to see a woman climb to the highest rung of political power .
all eyes are now on angela merkel to see if she gains entry to the boys ’ club . the inconclusive poll on sept 18 which has plunged germany into political paralysis and triggered horse-trading between the main parties has overshadowed another aspect of the election that generated much excitement : whether europe ’ s largest economy will , for the first time in its postwar history , be led by a woman . the answer to that no longer seems clear after the conservatives ' disastrous election result and challenges to angela merkel 's claim to the chancellorship . but there 's no denying that merkel 's candidacy for the highest political post has been nothing short of historic in a country where the reins of power are overwhelmingly in the hands of men . katja husen , spokesperson for women 's issues at the green party pointed out that women in germany are persistently absent from top jobs . " the fact that we ’ ve never had a female chancellor before is one aspect .
but it 's the same in company boardrooms - we 've just never had famous women in top positions of power . " broader representation in politics however , statistics show that compared to the german corporate world , women have undeniably been more successful at breaking through the so-called glass ceiling when it comes to politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female participation in politics has gradually risen over the years ever since conservative chancellor konrad adenauer reluctantly appointed the country 's first female minister , elisabeth schwarzhaupt -lrb- photo -rrb- , to his cabinet in 1961 . today , six out of 13 ministries in chancellor schröder ’ s government are led by women - a big leap from the two female ministers in former chancellor helmut kohl ’ s cabinet .
and women 's share in parliament currently hovers at 32 percent , up from a mere 9 percent in 1980 . the proportionately better representation of women in politics is attributed to a slew of laws and policies guaranteeing gender equality and equality of opportunity that were put in place in the 1980s and 1990s . the crucial quota bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast , center , will be co-chairing the leadership of the greens together with her male colleague , fritz kuhn but , most agree that it 's the " women 's quota , " first introduced by the green party in the 1980s with a strict 50 percent reservation of party seats and posts for women , that was the trigger for an explosive increase in the number of women politicians . " it 's been the most effective instrument to boost women 's participation in politics , better than all the equality legislation and confidence-boosting measures for women , " said husen . " thanks to it , men have no choice but to see to it that they recruit more women . " the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- followed suit in 1988 , committing itself to filling 40 percent of its posts with women while the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- finally agreed in 1996 to include more women in its ranks , but remained noncommittal about the exact proportion . the old boys ' network the measures may have indeed led to more representation for women in politics , but many point out that it has n't really given women tangible influence or allowed them to penetrate the highest echelons of political power in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler , left with chancellor schröder one major reason , according to katja husen , is the fact that high-level german politics is still exclusively a boys ' club . " power structures in germany are very homogenous - they 're dominated by male academics and the rules of the game are thus set by men too , " said husen . " there 's no sense of bringing in diversity or encouraging people with different backgrounds - it 's a very german way of thinking . " in a recent article , germany 's leading feminist alice schwarzer likened chancellor schröder 's punch-drunk performance on the evening of the election - where he dismissed merkel 's claim to the chancellorship insisting he should carry on instead - to a matter of honor .
schwarzer said schröder was behaving like a tyrant and could n't bear the thought of losing out to a woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sixty years after hitler and 87 years after gaining the right for women to vote , the people may have elected her -lrb- merkel -rrb- , but the majority of the powerful are still far removed from conceding the highest office to a woman , " schwarzer -lrb- photo -rrb- wrote . lack of role models but macho attitudes are n't the only problem . claudia neusüss , a former executive director of the heinrich böll foundation , pointed out that a strong domestic image of women as taking responsibility for family and children that originated in west germany in the 1970s and 1980s still dominates the current political sphere to an extent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " though it 's all changing now , women too tend to think along those lines .
besides , juggling a career and family in germany is n't easy either , " she said . a lack of role models is a further hurdle to women aiming high in politics . though germany has seen three female presidents of the bundestag and a woman presiding over the constitutional court , the trend has stopped when it comes to leading the country , either in the role of president or chancellor , or even one of the two big political parties - until merkel , that is . " women have to develop their own rules of the game , they have to know what they want and learn to move away from typically ' soft ' topics such as health and education and take on the harder ones , " said neusüss . " merkel needs to do more " given the odds , angela merkel 's rise to the top - albeit facilitated by the cdu 's damaging party scandal that led to helmut kohl ’ s departure - has , most agree , sent an important signal to women aspiring for higher positions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with her team " the very fact that it 's possible for a woman from a conservative party to become chancellor is very progressive , " said neusüss , adding that merkel needed to do much more for women than the rather flimsy promises on family and equality in her party platform . " being a woman at the top is n't enough , " neusüss said . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and the female question with less than three weeks to go to the elections , germany is wondering what it will mean to have its first woman chancellor .

all eyes are now on angela merkel to see if she gains entry to the boys ’ club . the inconclusive poll on sept 18 which has plunged germany into political paralysis and triggered horse-trading between the main parties has overshadowed another aspect of the election that generated much excitement : whether europe ’ s largest economy will , for the first time in its postwar history , be led by a woman . the answer to that no longer seems clear after the conservatives ' disastrous election result and challenges to angela merkel 's claim to the chancellorship . but there 's no denying that merkel 's candidacy for the highest political post has been nothing short of historic in a country where the reins of power are overwhelmingly in the hands of men . katja husen , spokesperson for women 's issues at the green party pointed out that women in germany are persistently absent from top jobs . " the fact that we ’ ve never had a female chancellor before is one aspect .
but it 's the same in company boardrooms - we 've just never had famous women in top positions of power . " broader representation in politics however , statistics show that compared to the german corporate world , women have undeniably been more successful at breaking through the so-called glass ceiling when it comes to politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female participation in politics has gradually risen over the years ever since conservative chancellor konrad adenauer reluctantly appointed the country 's first female minister , elisabeth schwarzhaupt -lrb- photo -rrb- , to his cabinet in 1961 . today , six out of 13 ministries in chancellor schröder ’ s government are led by women - a big leap from the two female ministers in former chancellor helmut kohl ’ s cabinet .
and women 's share in parliament currently hovers at 32 percent , up from a mere 9 percent in 1980 . the proportionately better representation of women in politics is attributed to a slew of laws and policies guaranteeing gender equality and equality of opportunity that were put in place in the 1980s and 1990s . the crucial quota bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast , center , will be co-chairing the leadership of the greens together with her male colleague , fritz kuhn but , most agree that it 's the " women 's quota , " first introduced by the green party in the 1980s with a strict 50 percent reservation of party seats and posts for women , that was the trigger for an explosive increase in the number of women politicians . " it 's been the most effective instrument to boost women 's participation in politics , better than all the equality legislation and confidence-boosting measures for women , " said husen . " thanks to it , men have no choice but to see to it that they recruit more women . " the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- followed suit in 1988 , committing itself to filling 40 percent of its posts with women while the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- finally agreed in 1996 to include more women in its ranks , but remained noncommittal about the exact proportion . the old boys ' network the measures may have indeed led to more representation for women in politics , but many point out that it has n't really given women tangible influence or allowed them to penetrate the highest echelons of political power in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler , left with chancellor schröder one major reason , according to katja husen , is the fact that high-level german politics is still exclusively a boys ' club . " power structures in germany are very homogenous - they 're dominated by male academics and the rules of the game are thus set by men too , " said husen . " there 's no sense of bringing in diversity or encouraging people with different backgrounds - it 's a very german way of thinking . " in a recent article , germany 's leading feminist alice schwarzer likened chancellor schröder 's punch-drunk performance on the evening of the election - where he dismissed merkel 's claim to the chancellorship insisting he should carry on instead - to a matter of honor .
schwarzer said schröder was behaving like a tyrant and could n't bear the thought of losing out to a woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sixty years after hitler and 87 years after gaining the right for women to vote , the people may have elected her -lrb- merkel -rrb- , but the majority of the powerful are still far removed from conceding the highest office to a woman , " schwarzer -lrb- photo -rrb- wrote . lack of role models but macho attitudes are n't the only problem . claudia neusüss , a former executive director of the heinrich böll foundation , pointed out that a strong domestic image of women as taking responsibility for family and children that originated in west germany in the 1970s and 1980s still dominates the current political sphere to an extent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " though it 's all changing now , women too tend to think along those lines .
besides , juggling a career and family in germany is n't easy either , " she said . a lack of role models is a further hurdle to women aiming high in politics . though germany has seen three female presidents of the bundestag and a woman presiding over the constitutional court , the trend has stopped when it comes to leading the country , either in the role of president or chancellor , or even one of the two big political parties - until merkel , that is . " women have to develop their own rules of the game , they have to know what they want and learn to move away from typically ' soft ' topics such as health and education and take on the harder ones , " said neusüss . " merkel needs to do more " given the odds , angela merkel 's rise to the top - albeit facilitated by the cdu 's damaging party scandal that led to helmut kohl ’ s departure - has , most agree , sent an important signal to women aspiring for higher positions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with her team " the very fact that it 's possible for a woman from a conservative party to become chancellor is very progressive , " said neusüss , adding that merkel needed to do much more for women than the rather flimsy promises on family and equality in her party platform . " being a woman at the top is n't enough , " neusüss said . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and the female question with less than three weeks to go to the elections , germany is wondering what it will mean to have its first woman chancellor .

besides , juggling a career and family in germany is n't easy either , " she said . a lack of role models is a further hurdle to women aiming high in politics . though germany has seen three female presidents of the bundestag and a woman presiding over the constitutional court , the trend has stopped when it comes to leading the country , either in the role of president or chancellor , or even one of the two big political parties - until merkel , that is . " women have to develop their own rules of the game , they have to know what they want and learn to move away from typically ' soft ' topics such as health and education and take on the harder ones , " said neusüss . " merkel needs to do more " given the odds , angela merkel 's rise to the top - albeit facilitated by the cdu 's damaging party scandal that led to helmut kohl ’ s departure - has , most agree , sent an important signal to women aspiring for higher positions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with her team " the very fact that it 's possible for a woman from a conservative party to become chancellor is very progressive , " said neusüss , adding that merkel needed to do much more for women than the rather flimsy promises on family and equality in her party platform . " being a woman at the top is n't enough , " neusüss said . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and the female question with less than three weeks to go to the elections , germany is wondering what it will mean to have its first woman chancellor .
angela merkel , however , is not promising a feminist or even a particularly feminine future .

18 , which produced a narrow three-seat advantage for merkel 's christian democrats over the social democrats which fell well short of what was required for a governing majority . yet the election could have a psychological impact on the intense negotiations to come before a new government is formed . although three seats are at stake , the christian democrats can at worst only lose one seat because of the complex german electoral system which is a mixture of the majority and proportional systems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , some believe that the delayed vote in dresden , two weeks after general elections in the rest of the country , may still speed up the process of forming a coalition - most likely a " grand coalition " between the spd and the conservatives . chancellor issue plagues talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder both still claim the chancellorship but a chief stumbling block is the insistence of both schröder and merkel that they should be chancellor .
schröder claims he still has a mandate for a third term as chancellor , but merkel said her alliance won the election and therefore she should govern . " the biggest political party in a coalition has the prerogative to put forward a chancellor , " merkel said in an interview with friday 's edition of the sächsische zeitung newspaper which covers the dresden area . merkel added that the negotiations to form a grand coalition - and the horse-trading of ministerial posts that involves - would only begin once a decision had been made on who will be chancellor . schröder however told the same newspaper that the chancellery issue should form part of the negotiations . " we can not say that the negotiations will only begin once we have made concessions , " he said . the social democrats meanwhile poured cold water on claims from the conservatives that schröder would stand aside after the voting in dresden . franz müntefering , the leader of the social democrats , said on thursday : " there is nothing in this .
our demand remains the same : we want to govern with gerhard schröder as chancellor . " calls for schröder to step down yet , guido westerwelle , the leader of the free-market liberal fdp , the conservatives ' real preferred coalition partner , said he " fully expected " that schröder would step aside following the dresden vote . " i assume that will be the occasion for schröder to make way , " westerwelle said . and michael glos , a leading member of the christian social union , the christian democrats ' sister party in bavaria , said he also expected schröder would step down on monday . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign media warm up to grand coalition most foreign media painted a bleak picture of germany 's prospects after the country 's inconclusive poll .

prosiebensat1 said in a statement that the offer price of 14.11 euros -lrb- $ 16.93 -rrb- per preference share " meets the statutory requirements . "
nevertheless , " irrespective of compliance of the offer price with applicable legal requirements , the executive and supervisory boards take the view that the offer price does not reflect the full value of the prosiebensat1 preference share , " the statement said .
as a result , neither the executive nor the supervisory board was willing to make a recommendation whether shareholders should accept or decline the offer , prosiebensat1 said .
prosieben preference shares closed at 14.29 euros on thursday .
minority shareholders hold around 37.5 percent of the capital .

negotiations for turkey 's possible entry to the european union are rocky even before they have started .
deutsche welle 's baha güngör believes that the eu-turkey project does n't have a realistic chance . whether membership talks with turkey can begin , as planned , on monday will be decided at the last minute .
after ambassadors from the 25 member states failed to agree on a negotiating mandate at their meeting on thursday , eu foreign ministers now have to attend a special session in luxembourg on sunday , since unanimous approval is mandatory for the negotiations to start .
none of the 25 eu member states , not even cyprus , wants to be the spoilsport , which is why there will probably be a last minute agreement to go ahead with the negotiations .
but even if that 's the case , the eu-turkey project is hardly realistic .
anyone who still thinks that one day in the distant future , after 10 or 15 years of negotiations , turkey will become an eu member , is either naive or has no clue about the country 's inner workings .
turkey is a country on the periphery of europe and therefore , a country whose stability means much politically , economically , and in terms of security , to europe .
those who are sensible would want to include turkey in the continent 's integration process and to get ankara to pursue the values and visions of europe .
domestic politics at the center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's " non " to the eu constitution was for many a rejection of turkey yet before accession negotiations started , many eu countries turned the process into a self-serve buffet , looking to further their own national interests .
the election campaign in germany , as well as the french rejection of the eu constitution , which to a great deal was a rejection of turkey , reveal this clearly .
demands too high , too soon if the negotiations indeed start on monday , it will be less a question of whether they will ever successfully be brought to an end .
rather , the question will be when they can be deemed to have failed , or at least be interrupted for a few years .
grounds for failure wo n't be the eu 's regulations , the so-called " acquis communautaire . "
a lengthy transition period or permanent security clauses could be agreed .
turkey is by far the largest and most densely populated country that has ever attempted eu entry .
in many economic areas , it still lags far behind the eu average .
but for all of these problems , solutions could be found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern , turkish cypriots supported reunification of the island that 's been divided since 1974 but the eu is making a big mistake by demanding the maximum from turkey , i.e. recognizing cyprus or dealing with the armenian genocide , right at the start of the negotiations .
they 're playing their trump cards wrongly , creating resentment and hardening the country that could , and also has to , address such topics in the course of drawing closer to european values .
euphoria long gone turks ' enthusiasm for europe has , for the most part , disappeared .
the country 's nationalists are gaining in popularity and are reconquering territory it had lost before .
it 's no secret that in the next elections , expected in two years , turkish nationalism will experience a rebirth .
the feeling is growing among turks that the numerous reforms in the past and the strengthening of democratic forces in asia minor since the signing of the 1963 association agreement with the eu have all been for naught .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish flag and an image of the country 's founder , kemal atatürk it is a shame that the eu will have clumsily dropped its chance to achieve its goal of becoming a " global player " and its credibility in fostering dialogue between cultures and religions .
for turkey , it 's a shame that the country 's development into a democratic state will be threatened with large setbacks .
for when the eu and turkey start negotiations as planned , the participants will already be sapped of their strength .
they will be short of breath for the long road ahead - unless a miracle happens . baha güngör -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu turkey talks threatened eu foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting sunday to talk about membership talks with turkey after their ambassadors failed to reach an agreement on a negotiating mandate thursday .

negotiations for turkey 's possible entry to the european union are rocky even before they have started .
deutsche welle 's baha güngör believes that the eu-turkey project does n't have a realistic chance . whether membership talks with turkey can begin , as planned , on monday will be decided at the last minute .
after ambassadors from the 25 member states failed to agree on a negotiating mandate at their meeting on thursday , eu foreign ministers now have to attend a special session in luxembourg on sunday , since unanimous approval is mandatory for the negotiations to start .
none of the 25 eu member states , not even cyprus , wants to be the spoilsport , which is why there will probably be a last minute agreement to go ahead with the negotiations .
but even if that 's the case , the eu-turkey project is hardly realistic .
anyone who still thinks that one day in the distant future , after 10 or 15 years of negotiations , turkey will become an eu member , is either naive or has no clue about the country 's inner workings .
turkey is a country on the periphery of europe and therefore , a country whose stability means much politically , economically , and in terms of security , to europe .
those who are sensible would want to include turkey in the continent 's integration process and to get ankara to pursue the values and visions of europe .
domestic politics at the center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's " non " to the eu constitution was for many a rejection of turkey yet before accession negotiations started , many eu countries turned the process into a self-serve buffet , looking to further their own national interests .
the election campaign in germany , as well as the french rejection of the eu constitution , which to a great deal was a rejection of turkey , reveal this clearly .
demands too high , too soon if the negotiations indeed start on monday , it will be less a question of whether they will ever successfully be brought to an end .
rather , the question will be when they can be deemed to have failed , or at least be interrupted for a few years .
grounds for failure wo n't be the eu 's regulations , the so-called " acquis communautaire . "
a lengthy transition period or permanent security clauses could be agreed .
turkey is by far the largest and most densely populated country that has ever attempted eu entry .
in many economic areas , it still lags far behind the eu average .
but for all of these problems , solutions could be found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern , turkish cypriots supported reunification of the island that 's been divided since 1974 but the eu is making a big mistake by demanding the maximum from turkey , i.e. recognizing cyprus or dealing with the armenian genocide , right at the start of the negotiations .
they 're playing their trump cards wrongly , creating resentment and hardening the country that could , and also has to , address such topics in the course of drawing closer to european values .
euphoria long gone turks ' enthusiasm for europe has , for the most part , disappeared .
the country 's nationalists are gaining in popularity and are reconquering territory it had lost before .
it 's no secret that in the next elections , expected in two years , turkish nationalism will experience a rebirth .
the feeling is growing among turks that the numerous reforms in the past and the strengthening of democratic forces in asia minor since the signing of the 1963 association agreement with the eu have all been for naught .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish flag and an image of the country 's founder , kemal atatürk it is a shame that the eu will have clumsily dropped its chance to achieve its goal of becoming a " global player " and its credibility in fostering dialogue between cultures and religions .
for turkey , it 's a shame that the country 's development into a democratic state will be threatened with large setbacks .
for when the eu and turkey start negotiations as planned , the participants will already be sapped of their strength .
they will be short of breath for the long road ahead - unless a miracle happens . baha güngör -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu turkey talks threatened eu foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting sunday to talk about membership talks with turkey after their ambassadors failed to reach an agreement on a negotiating mandate thursday .

but who gets the credit ?
two top stylists have rival claims to this cinderella story . in politics , image is everything .
and in the run-up to the sept .
18 general election , even the famously non-flamboyant conservative leader angela merkel took this message to heart , trading in her wash ' n ' go pudding bowl hairstyle for a softer , more stylish look .
flattering make-up and the addition of brighter , more fitted suits to her wardrobe completed merkel 's transformation from " kohl 's girl " to " angie . " but merkel did n't do it alone .
the question is , which top german stylist should take the credit for her makeover ?
martina acht , a hairdresser whose salon is in the western city of offenbach , told reuters that her influence was decisive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transformation was already pronounced when merkel met with us president george w. bush " she came to me for advice just before -lrb- us president -rrb- george w. bush came to germany -lrb- in february -rrb- and ever since then , her look has been completely different , " acht said . " since then , she seems so much more feminine , " she added . but celebrity hairdresser udo walz , whose swanky berlin salon is frequented by models and politicians alike , begs to differ .
walz said that he has been working on merkel 's hair for a long time and that she has an appointment with him every four weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrity hairdresser udo walz -lrb- right -rrb- , pictured here with talkshow host sabine christiansen , says merkel is his client " martina acht might have used a blow-dryer on my client 's hair , but she did not cut it , " walz said , laying down the gauntlet in a battle of the scissors that has gleefully been picked up by the german tabloids .
" there are always people around who want to jump on the bandwagon . " walz is also closely acquainted with the hair of the man currently battling merkel for the office of chancellor - incumbent gerhard schröder .
in a 2002 court challenge against a german news agency that said schröder dyed his hair black , walz played the role of key witness .
he testified that , despite his youthful appearance , the 61-year-old schröder does have some grey hairs , but that they are only visible at close range . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rolling stones no fans of " angie " how rock n ' roll is angela merkel ?

22 , 2005 -rrb- no sweat , angela chancellor candidate angela merkel 's apricot ensemble attracted all eyes at the premiere of the richard wagner festival .
and some did n't like what they saw , including an editor with a liberal approach towards photoshop .
-lrb- july 28 , 2005 -rrb- changing the rules of the men-only game despite equality laws , quotas for women and vitriolic feminists , germany has yet to see a woman climb to the highest rung of political power .
all eyes are now on angela merkel to see if she gains entry to the boys ’ club .

bonvicini ‘ s award-winning work entitled " never again " was on show at an exhibition in the hamburger bahnhof alongside the works of the other three shortlisted artists .
it ’ s an installation with metal frames , leather hammocks and chains .
the members of the final jury , dan cameron -lrb- new museum of modern art , new york -rrb- , erika hoffmann-koenige -lrb- hoffmann collection , berlin -rrb- and dr. angela schneider -lrb- nationalgalerie , berlin -rrb- , praised bonvicini ’ s work because it is grounded in the socio-political fundamentals of society .
they were won over by the way bonvicini exposes the actions and vulnerability of our physical being in her sculptures and installations .
the audience prize went to the canadian artist angela bulloch for her haunting installation " the disenchanted forest " .
like all the other shortlisted artists she lives and works in berlin .
established in 2000 by the friends of the nationalgalerie , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the association that organised the hugely successful art events " moma in berlin " in 2004 and the goya exhibition in 2005 , the nationalgalerie prize for young art was awarded for the third time .
as media partner dw-tv produced short video profiles of all four artists , which were on show exclusively at the hamburger bahnhof exhibition .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monica bonvicini monica bonvicini was born in venice , italy in 1965 .
since the mid 1980s she ’ s been living and working in berlin and challenging the art world from this base .
in her radical work she uses materials such as metal frames , leather mats , chains , studs and rivets – an intimidating collection of instruments for ... what exactly ?
builders use such things ; some people reputedly also use such equipment for erotic games .
bonvicini calls it a playground for adults with 12 love swings hanging in it , which she hopes people will use .
as always , provoking a reaction from her audience is an integral part of her work .
she also likes playing with our fears . her see-through toilet cabin at the art basel in 2004 was a typical bonvicini puzzle : reflecting glass walls ensured that the outside world could be seen from the inside , but no-one on the outside was able to look in .
playful , provocative and perplexing bonvicini ‘ s biting irony is sure to you stop in your tracks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela bulloch angela bulloch was born in 1966 in fort frances , canada .
she often works with large-scale light and sound installations .
in some of these , stacked illuminated boxes show only a single pixel of an image that has been enlarged beyond recognition .
bulloch unsettles us with her abstract codes and ciphers with which she explores the rules and norms of our societies and investigates our patterns of behaviour .
her trademark clear forms and cool aesthetics keep the viewer at a distance , but at the same time the viewers are often part of bullock ’ s installations – as their every move triggers a reaction in her interactive works .
bullock creates what she calls a kind of " hermetic art work " in which the experience of art is very physical .
challenging us to confront the boundaries of our perception bullock investigates how far electronic media has changed the way we see and how we look on the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anri sala anri sala was born 1974 in tirana , albania .
this video artist has always been a restless traveller in the world .
he ’ s always on the lookout for those seemingly unsignificant details of everyday life that he transforms into expressive " tableaux vivants " : a horse in darkness , fireworks , the colourful facades of tirana .
moments full of poetry , captured by sala and enhanced with light or shadow , sound or absolute silence .
in his hands moments that otherwise have passed unnoticed are turned into precious jewels .
anri sala is a melancholic poet – always searching for the spectacular in the unspectacular and not afraid of touching our emotions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john bock john bock was born in 1965 on the northern german coast . his distinguishing feature : wild hair on top of his head and wild ideas inside .
take the outlandish costumes he designs for his performances : enormous heads stuffed with cotton wool .
on one the eyelids have flaps with zippers , and out of them spill knitted arms that reach out endlessly .
using simple techniques such as sewing , carpentry and modelling john bock creates the strange trashy worlds for his comically absurd and enigmatic performances and installations .
his weird and wonderful work is in great demand and can be admired in major museums .
john bock has been invited to all the international biennials from sao paulo to venice , and even to the triennial in yokohama .
theatre of the absurd verging on dada , performed in a naively serious manner is a trademark of john bock , who happens to be a trained economist .

the members of the final jury , dan cameron -lrb- new museum of modern art , new york -rrb- , erika hoffmann-koenige -lrb- hoffmann collection , berlin -rrb- and dr. angela schneider -lrb- nationalgalerie , berlin -rrb- , praised bonvicini ’ s work because it is grounded in the socio-political fundamentals of society .
they were won over by the way bonvicini exposes the actions and vulnerability of our physical being in her sculptures and installations .
the audience prize went to the canadian artist angela bulloch for her haunting installation " the disenchanted forest " .
like all the other shortlisted artists she lives and works in berlin .
established in 2000 by the friends of the nationalgalerie , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the association that organised the hugely successful art events " moma in berlin " in 2004 and the goya exhibition in 2005 , the nationalgalerie prize for young art was awarded for the third time .
as media partner dw-tv produced short video profiles of all four artists , which were on show exclusively at the hamburger bahnhof exhibition .
you can find these portraits below as video-on-demand !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monica bonvicini monica bonvicini was born in venice , italy in 1965 .
since the mid 1980s she ’ s been living and working in berlin and challenging the art world from this base .
in her radical work she uses materials such as metal frames , leather mats , chains , studs and rivets – an intimidating collection of instruments for ... what exactly ?
builders use such things ; some people reputedly also use such equipment for erotic games .
bonvicini calls it a playground for adults with 12 love swings hanging in it , which she hopes people will use .
as always , provoking a reaction from her audience is an integral part of her work .
she also likes playing with our fears . her see-through toilet cabin at the art basel in 2004 was a typical bonvicini puzzle : reflecting glass walls ensured that the outside world could be seen from the inside , but no-one on the outside was able to look in .
playful , provocative and perplexing bonvicini ‘ s biting irony is sure to you stop in your tracks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela bulloch angela bulloch was born in 1966 in fort frances , canada .
she often works with large-scale light and sound installations .
in some of these , stacked illuminated boxes show only a single pixel of an image that has been enlarged beyond recognition .
bulloch unsettles us with her abstract codes and ciphers with which she explores the rules and norms of our societies and investigates our patterns of behaviour .
her trademark clear forms and cool aesthetics keep the viewer at a distance , but at the same time the viewers are often part of bullock ’ s installations – as their every move triggers a reaction in her interactive works .
bullock creates what she calls a kind of " hermetic art work " in which the experience of art is very physical .
challenging us to confront the boundaries of our perception bullock investigates how far electronic media has changed the way we see and how we look on the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anri sala anri sala was born 1974 in tirana , albania .
this video artist has always been a restless traveller in the world .
he ’ s always on the lookout for those seemingly unsignificant details of everyday life that he transforms into expressive " tableaux vivants " : a horse in darkness , fireworks , the colourful facades of tirana .
moments full of poetry , captured by sala and enhanced with light or shadow , sound or absolute silence .
in his hands moments that otherwise have passed unnoticed are turned into precious jewels .
anri sala is a melancholic poet – always searching for the spectacular in the unspectacular and not afraid of touching our emotions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john bock john bock was born in 1965 on the northern german coast . his distinguishing feature : wild hair on top of his head and wild ideas inside .
take the outlandish costumes he designs for his performances : enormous heads stuffed with cotton wool .
on one the eyelids have flaps with zippers , and out of them spill knitted arms that reach out endlessly .
using simple techniques such as sewing , carpentry and modelling john bock creates the strange trashy worlds for his comically absurd and enigmatic performances and installations .
his weird and wonderful work is in great demand and can be admired in major museums .
john bock has been invited to all the international biennials from sao paulo to venice , and even to the triennial in yokohama .
theatre of the absurd verging on dada , performed in a naively serious manner is a trademark of john bock , who happens to be a trained economist .

" there are always people around who want to jump on the bandwagon . " walz is also closely acquainted with the hair of the man currently battling merkel for the office of chancellor - incumbent gerhard schröder .
in a 2002 court challenge against a german news agency that said schröder dyed his hair black , walz played the role of key witness .

walz said that he has been working on merkel 's hair for a long time and that she has an appointment with him every four weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrity hairdresser udo walz -lrb- right -rrb- , pictured here with talkshow host sabine christiansen , says merkel is his client " martina acht might have used a blow-dryer on my client 's hair , but she did not cut it , " walz said , laying down the gauntlet in a battle of the scissors that has gleefully been picked up by the german tabloids .
" there are always people around who want to jump on the bandwagon . " walz is also closely acquainted with the hair of the man currently battling merkel for the office of chancellor - incumbent gerhard schröder .
in a 2002 court challenge against a german news agency that said schröder dyed his hair black , walz played the role of key witness .
he testified that , despite his youthful appearance , the 61-year-old schröder does have some grey hairs , but that they are only visible at close range . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rolling stones no fans of " angie " how rock n ' roll is angela merkel ?

but who gets the credit ?
two top stylists have rival claims to this cinderella story . in politics , image is everything .
and in the run-up to the sept .
18 general election , even the famously non-flamboyant conservative leader angela merkel took this message to heart , trading in her wash ' n ' go pudding bowl hairstyle for a softer , more stylish look .
flattering make-up and the addition of brighter , more fitted suits to her wardrobe completed merkel 's transformation from " kohl 's girl " to " angie . " but merkel did n't do it alone .
the question is , which top german stylist should take the credit for her makeover ?
martina acht , a hairdresser whose salon is in the western city of offenbach , told reuters that her influence was decisive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transformation was already pronounced when merkel met with us president george w. bush " she came to me for advice just before -lrb- us president -rrb- george w. bush came to germany -lrb- in february -rrb- and ever since then , her look has been completely different , " acht said . " since then , she seems so much more feminine , " she added . but celebrity hairdresser udo walz , whose swanky berlin salon is frequented by models and politicians alike , begs to differ .
walz said that he has been working on merkel 's hair for a long time and that she has an appointment with him every four weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrity hairdresser udo walz -lrb- right -rrb- , pictured here with talkshow host sabine christiansen , says merkel is his client " martina acht might have used a blow-dryer on my client 's hair , but she did not cut it , " walz said , laying down the gauntlet in a battle of the scissors that has gleefully been picked up by the german tabloids .
" there are always people around who want to jump on the bandwagon . " walz is also closely acquainted with the hair of the man currently battling merkel for the office of chancellor - incumbent gerhard schröder .
in a 2002 court challenge against a german news agency that said schröder dyed his hair black , walz played the role of key witness .
he testified that , despite his youthful appearance , the 61-year-old schröder does have some grey hairs , but that they are only visible at close range . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rolling stones no fans of " angie " how rock n ' roll is angela merkel ?

schröder told blair in a telephone conversation that " he wanted to move towards a solution " on the eu budget for the 2007-2013 period .
negotiations on the budget collapsed without a solution at a brussels summit in june .
the german government 's chief spokesman , bela anda , told a press conference that schröder had told blair that " the proposals made by the luxembourg presidency , which were acceptable for the large majority of the 25 member states , were still on the table . "
luxembourg , which held the rotating eu presidency in the first half of this year , proposed spending limits and the phasing-out of britain 's rebate on contributions to the collective pot , but blair refused to compromise .
britain , which took over the eu rotating presidency on july 1 , has committed to finding an agreement on the budget before the end of the year .

schröder told blair in a telephone conversation that " he wanted to move towards a solution " on the eu budget for the 2007-2013 period .
negotiations on the budget collapsed without a solution at a brussels summit in june .
the german government 's chief spokesman , bela anda , told a press conference that schröder had told blair that " the proposals made by the luxembourg presidency , which were acceptable for the large majority of the 25 member states , were still on the table . "
luxembourg , which held the rotating eu presidency in the first half of this year , proposed spending limits and the phasing-out of britain 's rebate on contributions to the collective pot , but blair refused to compromise .
britain , which took over the eu rotating presidency on july 1 , has committed to finding an agreement on the budget before the end of the year .
germany was at the forefront of countries calling for the rebate to be renegotiated .

but who gets the credit ?
two top stylists have rival claims to this cinderella story . in politics , image is everything .
and in the run-up to the sept .
18 general election , even the famously non-flamboyant conservative leader angela merkel took this message to heart , trading in her wash ' n ' go pudding bowl hairstyle for a softer , more stylish look .
flattering make-up and the addition of brighter , more fitted suits to her wardrobe completed merkel 's transformation from " kohl 's girl " to " angie . " but merkel did n't do it alone .
the question is , which top german stylist should take the credit for her makeover ?
martina acht , a hairdresser whose salon is in the western city of offenbach , told reuters that her influence was decisive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transformation was already pronounced when merkel met with us president george w. bush " she came to me for advice just before -lrb- us president -rrb- george w. bush came to germany -lrb- in february -rrb- and ever since then , her look has been completely different , " acht said . " since then , she seems so much more feminine , " she added . but celebrity hairdresser udo walz , whose swanky berlin salon is frequented by models and politicians alike , begs to differ .
walz said that he has been working on merkel 's hair for a long time and that she has an appointment with him every four weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrity hairdresser udo walz -lrb- right -rrb- , pictured here with talkshow host sabine christiansen , says merkel is his client " martina acht might have used a blow-dryer on my client 's hair , but she did not cut it , " walz said , laying down the gauntlet in a battle of the scissors that has gleefully been picked up by the german tabloids .
" there are always people around who want to jump on the bandwagon . " walz is also closely acquainted with the hair of the man currently battling merkel for the office of chancellor - incumbent gerhard schröder .
in a 2002 court challenge against a german news agency that said schröder dyed his hair black , walz played the role of key witness .
he testified that , despite his youthful appearance , the 61-year-old schröder does have some grey hairs , but that they are only visible at close range . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rolling stones no fans of " angie " how rock n ' roll is angela merkel ?
not rock n ' roll enough to be allowed to use a rolling stones ' song following her campaign speeches .

22 , 2005 -rrb- no sweat , angela chancellor candidate angela merkel 's apricot ensemble attracted all eyes at the premiere of the richard wagner festival .
and some did n't like what they saw , including an editor with a liberal approach towards photoshop .
-lrb- july 28 , 2005 -rrb- changing the rules of the men-only game despite equality laws , quotas for women and vitriolic feminists , germany has yet to see a woman climb to the highest rung of political power .
all eyes are now on angela merkel to see if she gains entry to the boys ’ club .

negotiations for turkey 's possible entry to the european union are rocky even before they have started .
deutsche welle 's baha güngör believes that the eu-turkey project does n't have a realistic chance . whether membership talks with turkey can begin , as planned , on monday will be decided at the last minute .
after ambassadors from the 25 member states failed to agree on a negotiating mandate at their meeting on thursday , eu foreign ministers now have to attend a special session in luxembourg on sunday , since unanimous approval is mandatory for the negotiations to start .
none of the 25 eu member states , not even cyprus , wants to be the spoilsport , which is why there will probably be a last minute agreement to go ahead with the negotiations .
but even if that 's the case , the eu-turkey project is hardly realistic .
anyone who still thinks that one day in the distant future , after 10 or 15 years of negotiations , turkey will become an eu member , is either naive or has no clue about the country 's inner workings .
turkey is a country on the periphery of europe and therefore , a country whose stability means much politically , economically , and in terms of security , to europe .
those who are sensible would want to include turkey in the continent 's integration process and to get ankara to pursue the values and visions of europe .
domestic politics at the center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's " non " to the eu constitution was for many a rejection of turkey yet before accession negotiations started , many eu countries turned the process into a self-serve buffet , looking to further their own national interests .
the election campaign in germany , as well as the french rejection of the eu constitution , which to a great deal was a rejection of turkey , reveal this clearly .
demands too high , too soon if the negotiations indeed start on monday , it will be less a question of whether they will ever successfully be brought to an end .
rather , the question will be when they can be deemed to have failed , or at least be interrupted for a few years .
grounds for failure wo n't be the eu 's regulations , the so-called " acquis communautaire . "
a lengthy transition period or permanent security clauses could be agreed .
turkey is by far the largest and most densely populated country that has ever attempted eu entry .
in many economic areas , it still lags far behind the eu average .
but for all of these problems , solutions could be found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern , turkish cypriots supported reunification of the island that 's been divided since 1974 but the eu is making a big mistake by demanding the maximum from turkey , i.e. recognizing cyprus or dealing with the armenian genocide , right at the start of the negotiations .
they 're playing their trump cards wrongly , creating resentment and hardening the country that could , and also has to , address such topics in the course of drawing closer to european values .
euphoria long gone turks ' enthusiasm for europe has , for the most part , disappeared .
the country 's nationalists are gaining in popularity and are reconquering territory it had lost before .
it 's no secret that in the next elections , expected in two years , turkish nationalism will experience a rebirth .
the feeling is growing among turks that the numerous reforms in the past and the strengthening of democratic forces in asia minor since the signing of the 1963 association agreement with the eu have all been for naught .

for turkey , it 's a shame that the country 's development into a democratic state will be threatened with large setbacks .

negotiations for turkey 's possible entry to the european union are rocky even before they have started .
deutsche welle 's baha güngör believes that the eu-turkey project does n't have a realistic chance . whether membership talks with turkey can begin , as planned , on monday will be decided at the last minute .
after ambassadors from the 25 member states failed to agree on a negotiating mandate at their meeting on thursday , eu foreign ministers now have to attend a special session in luxembourg on sunday , since unanimous approval is mandatory for the negotiations to start .
none of the 25 eu member states , not even cyprus , wants to be the spoilsport , which is why there will probably be a last minute agreement to go ahead with the negotiations .
but even if that 's the case , the eu-turkey project is hardly realistic .
anyone who still thinks that one day in the distant future , after 10 or 15 years of negotiations , turkey will become an eu member , is either naive or has no clue about the country 's inner workings .
turkey is a country on the periphery of europe and therefore , a country whose stability means much politically , economically , and in terms of security , to europe .
those who are sensible would want to include turkey in the continent 's integration process and to get ankara to pursue the values and visions of europe .
domestic politics at the center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's " non " to the eu constitution was for many a rejection of turkey yet before accession negotiations started , many eu countries turned the process into a self-serve buffet , looking to further their own national interests .
the election campaign in germany , as well as the french rejection of the eu constitution , which to a great deal was a rejection of turkey , reveal this clearly .
demands too high , too soon if the negotiations indeed start on monday , it will be less a question of whether they will ever successfully be brought to an end .
rather , the question will be when they can be deemed to have failed , or at least be interrupted for a few years .
grounds for failure wo n't be the eu 's regulations , the so-called " acquis communautaire . "
a lengthy transition period or permanent security clauses could be agreed .
turkey is by far the largest and most densely populated country that has ever attempted eu entry .
in many economic areas , it still lags far behind the eu average .
but for all of these problems , solutions could be found .

but who gets the credit ?
two top stylists have rival claims to this cinderella story . in politics , image is everything .
and in the run-up to the sept .
18 general election , even the famously non-flamboyant conservative leader angela merkel took this message to heart , trading in her wash ' n ' go pudding bowl hairstyle for a softer , more stylish look .
flattering make-up and the addition of brighter , more fitted suits to her wardrobe completed merkel 's transformation from " kohl 's girl " to " angie . " but merkel did n't do it alone .
the question is , which top german stylist should take the credit for her makeover ?
martina acht , a hairdresser whose salon is in the western city of offenbach , told reuters that her influence was decisive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transformation was already pronounced when merkel met with us president george w. bush " she came to me for advice just before -lrb- us president -rrb- george w. bush came to germany -lrb- in february -rrb- and ever since then , her look has been completely different , " acht said . " since then , she seems so much more feminine , " she added . but celebrity hairdresser udo walz , whose swanky berlin salon is frequented by models and politicians alike , begs to differ .
walz said that he has been working on merkel 's hair for a long time and that she has an appointment with him every four weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrity hairdresser udo walz -lrb- right -rrb- , pictured here with talkshow host sabine christiansen , says merkel is his client " martina acht might have used a blow-dryer on my client 's hair , but she did not cut it , " walz said , laying down the gauntlet in a battle of the scissors that has gleefully been picked up by the german tabloids .
" there are always people around who want to jump on the bandwagon . " walz is also closely acquainted with the hair of the man currently battling merkel for the office of chancellor - incumbent gerhard schröder .

all eyes are now on angela merkel to see if she gains entry to the boys ’ club . the inconclusive poll on sept 18 which has plunged germany into political paralysis and triggered horse-trading between the main parties has overshadowed another aspect of the election that generated much excitement : whether europe ’ s largest economy will , for the first time in its postwar history , be led by a woman . the answer to that no longer seems clear after the conservatives ' disastrous election result and challenges to angela merkel 's claim to the chancellorship . but there 's no denying that merkel 's candidacy for the highest political post has been nothing short of historic in a country where the reins of power are overwhelmingly in the hands of men . katja husen , spokesperson for women 's issues at the green party pointed out that women in germany are persistently absent from top jobs . " the fact that we ’ ve never had a female chancellor before is one aspect .
but it 's the same in company boardrooms - we 've just never had famous women in top positions of power . " broader representation in politics however , statistics show that compared to the german corporate world , women have undeniably been more successful at breaking through the so-called glass ceiling when it comes to politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female participation in politics has gradually risen over the years ever since conservative chancellor konrad adenauer reluctantly appointed the country 's first female minister , elisabeth schwarzhaupt -lrb- photo -rrb- , to his cabinet in 1961 . today , six out of 13 ministries in chancellor schröder ’ s government are led by women - a big leap from the two female ministers in former chancellor helmut kohl ’ s cabinet .
and women 's share in parliament currently hovers at 32 percent , up from a mere 9 percent in 1980 . the proportionately better representation of women in politics is attributed to a slew of laws and policies guaranteeing gender equality and equality of opportunity that were put in place in the 1980s and 1990s . the crucial quota bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast , center , will be co-chairing the leadership of the greens together with her male colleague , fritz kuhn but , most agree that it 's the " women 's quota , " first introduced by the green party in the 1980s with a strict 50 percent reservation of party seats and posts for women , that was the trigger for an explosive increase in the number of women politicians . " it 's been the most effective instrument to boost women 's participation in politics , better than all the equality legislation and confidence-boosting measures for women , " said husen . " thanks to it , men have no choice but to see to it that they recruit more women . " the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- followed suit in 1988 , committing itself to filling 40 percent of its posts with women while the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- finally agreed in 1996 to include more women in its ranks , but remained noncommittal about the exact proportion . the old boys ' network the measures may have indeed led to more representation for women in politics , but many point out that it has n't really given women tangible influence or allowed them to penetrate the highest echelons of political power in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler , left with chancellor schröder one major reason , according to katja husen , is the fact that high-level german politics is still exclusively a boys ' club . " power structures in germany are very homogenous - they 're dominated by male academics and the rules of the game are thus set by men too , " said husen . " there 's no sense of bringing in diversity or encouraging people with different backgrounds - it 's a very german way of thinking . " in a recent article , germany 's leading feminist alice schwarzer likened chancellor schröder 's punch-drunk performance on the evening of the election - where he dismissed merkel 's claim to the chancellorship insisting he should carry on instead - to a matter of honor .
schwarzer said schröder was behaving like a tyrant and could n't bear the thought of losing out to a woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sixty years after hitler and 87 years after gaining the right for women to vote , the people may have elected her -lrb- merkel -rrb- , but the majority of the powerful are still far removed from conceding the highest office to a woman , " schwarzer -lrb- photo -rrb- wrote . lack of role models but macho attitudes are n't the only problem . claudia neusüss , a former executive director of the heinrich böll foundation , pointed out that a strong domestic image of women as taking responsibility for family and children that originated in west germany in the 1970s and 1980s still dominates the current political sphere to an extent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " though it 's all changing now , women too tend to think along those lines .
besides , juggling a career and family in germany is n't easy either , " she said . a lack of role models is a further hurdle to women aiming high in politics . though germany has seen three female presidents of the bundestag and a woman presiding over the constitutional court , the trend has stopped when it comes to leading the country , either in the role of president or chancellor , or even one of the two big political parties - until merkel , that is . " women have to develop their own rules of the game , they have to know what they want and learn to move away from typically ' soft ' topics such as health and education and take on the harder ones , " said neusüss . " merkel needs to do more " given the odds , angela merkel 's rise to the top - albeit facilitated by the cdu 's damaging party scandal that led to helmut kohl ’ s departure - has , most agree , sent an important signal to women aspiring for higher positions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with her team " the very fact that it 's possible for a woman from a conservative party to become chancellor is very progressive , " said neusüss , adding that merkel needed to do much more for women than the rather flimsy promises on family and equality in her party platform .

all eyes are now on angela merkel to see if she gains entry to the boys ’ club . the inconclusive poll on sept 18 which has plunged germany into political paralysis and triggered horse-trading between the main parties has overshadowed another aspect of the election that generated much excitement : whether europe ’ s largest economy will , for the first time in its postwar history , be led by a woman . the answer to that no longer seems clear after the conservatives ' disastrous election result and challenges to angela merkel 's claim to the chancellorship . but there 's no denying that merkel 's candidacy for the highest political post has been nothing short of historic in a country where the reins of power are overwhelmingly in the hands of men . katja husen , spokesperson for women 's issues at the green party pointed out that women in germany are persistently absent from top jobs . " the fact that we ’ ve never had a female chancellor before is one aspect .
but it 's the same in company boardrooms - we 've just never had famous women in top positions of power . " broader representation in politics however , statistics show that compared to the german corporate world , women have undeniably been more successful at breaking through the so-called glass ceiling when it comes to politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female participation in politics has gradually risen over the years ever since conservative chancellor konrad adenauer reluctantly appointed the country 's first female minister , elisabeth schwarzhaupt -lrb- photo -rrb- , to his cabinet in 1961 . today , six out of 13 ministries in chancellor schröder ’ s government are led by women - a big leap from the two female ministers in former chancellor helmut kohl ’ s cabinet .
and women 's share in parliament currently hovers at 32 percent , up from a mere 9 percent in 1980 . the proportionately better representation of women in politics is attributed to a slew of laws and policies guaranteeing gender equality and equality of opportunity that were put in place in the 1980s and 1990s . the crucial quota bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast , center , will be co-chairing the leadership of the greens together with her male colleague , fritz kuhn but , most agree that it 's the " women 's quota , " first introduced by the green party in the 1980s with a strict 50 percent reservation of party seats and posts for women , that was the trigger for an explosive increase in the number of women politicians . " it 's been the most effective instrument to boost women 's participation in politics , better than all the equality legislation and confidence-boosting measures for women , " said husen . " thanks to it , men have no choice but to see to it that they recruit more women . " the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- followed suit in 1988 , committing itself to filling 40 percent of its posts with women while the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- finally agreed in 1996 to include more women in its ranks , but remained noncommittal about the exact proportion . the old boys ' network the measures may have indeed led to more representation for women in politics , but many point out that it has n't really given women tangible influence or allowed them to penetrate the highest echelons of political power in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler , left with chancellor schröder one major reason , according to katja husen , is the fact that high-level german politics is still exclusively a boys ' club . " power structures in germany are very homogenous - they 're dominated by male academics and the rules of the game are thus set by men too , " said husen . " there 's no sense of bringing in diversity or encouraging people with different backgrounds - it 's a very german way of thinking . " in a recent article , germany 's leading feminist alice schwarzer likened chancellor schröder 's punch-drunk performance on the evening of the election - where he dismissed merkel 's claim to the chancellorship insisting he should carry on instead - to a matter of honor .
schwarzer said schröder was behaving like a tyrant and could n't bear the thought of losing out to a woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sixty years after hitler and 87 years after gaining the right for women to vote , the people may have elected her -lrb- merkel -rrb- , but the majority of the powerful are still far removed from conceding the highest office to a woman , " schwarzer -lrb- photo -rrb- wrote . lack of role models but macho attitudes are n't the only problem . claudia neusüss , a former executive director of the heinrich böll foundation , pointed out that a strong domestic image of women as taking responsibility for family and children that originated in west germany in the 1970s and 1980s still dominates the current political sphere to an extent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " though it 's all changing now , women too tend to think along those lines .
besides , juggling a career and family in germany is n't easy either , " she said . a lack of role models is a further hurdle to women aiming high in politics . though germany has seen three female presidents of the bundestag and a woman presiding over the constitutional court , the trend has stopped when it comes to leading the country , either in the role of president or chancellor , or even one of the two big political parties - until merkel , that is . " women have to develop their own rules of the game , they have to know what they want and learn to move away from typically ' soft ' topics such as health and education and take on the harder ones , " said neusüss . " merkel needs to do more " given the odds , angela merkel 's rise to the top - albeit facilitated by the cdu 's damaging party scandal that led to helmut kohl ’ s departure - has , most agree , sent an important signal to women aspiring for higher positions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with her team " the very fact that it 's possible for a woman from a conservative party to become chancellor is very progressive , " said neusüss , adding that merkel needed to do much more for women than the rather flimsy promises on family and equality in her party platform . " being a woman at the top is n't enough , " neusüss said . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and the female question with less than three weeks to go to the elections , germany is wondering what it will mean to have its first woman chancellor .

and women 's share in parliament currently hovers at 32 percent , up from a mere 9 percent in 1980 . the proportionately better representation of women in politics is attributed to a slew of laws and policies guaranteeing gender equality and equality of opportunity that were put in place in the 1980s and 1990s . the crucial quota bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast , center , will be co-chairing the leadership of the greens together with her male colleague , fritz kuhn but , most agree that it 's the " women 's quota , " first introduced by the green party in the 1980s with a strict 50 percent reservation of party seats and posts for women , that was the trigger for an explosive increase in the number of women politicians . " it 's been the most effective instrument to boost women 's participation in politics , better than all the equality legislation and confidence-boosting measures for women , " said husen . " thanks to it , men have no choice but to see to it that they recruit more women . " the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- followed suit in 1988 , committing itself to filling 40 percent of its posts with women while the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- finally agreed in 1996 to include more women in its ranks , but remained noncommittal about the exact proportion . the old boys ' network the measures may have indeed led to more representation for women in politics , but many point out that it has n't really given women tangible influence or allowed them to penetrate the highest echelons of political power in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler , left with chancellor schröder one major reason , according to katja husen , is the fact that high-level german politics is still exclusively a boys ' club . " power structures in germany are very homogenous - they 're dominated by male academics and the rules of the game are thus set by men too , " said husen . " there 's no sense of bringing in diversity or encouraging people with different backgrounds - it 's a very german way of thinking . " in a recent article , germany 's leading feminist alice schwarzer likened chancellor schröder 's punch-drunk performance on the evening of the election - where he dismissed merkel 's claim to the chancellorship insisting he should carry on instead - to a matter of honor .
schwarzer said schröder was behaving like a tyrant and could n't bear the thought of losing out to a woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sixty years after hitler and 87 years after gaining the right for women to vote , the people may have elected her -lrb- merkel -rrb- , but the majority of the powerful are still far removed from conceding the highest office to a woman , " schwarzer -lrb- photo -rrb- wrote . lack of role models but macho attitudes are n't the only problem . claudia neusüss , a former executive director of the heinrich böll foundation , pointed out that a strong domestic image of women as taking responsibility for family and children that originated in west germany in the 1970s and 1980s still dominates the current political sphere to an extent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " though it 's all changing now , women too tend to think along those lines .
besides , juggling a career and family in germany is n't easy either , " she said . a lack of role models is a further hurdle to women aiming high in politics . though germany has seen three female presidents of the bundestag and a woman presiding over the constitutional court , the trend has stopped when it comes to leading the country , either in the role of president or chancellor , or even one of the two big political parties - until merkel , that is . " women have to develop their own rules of the game , they have to know what they want and learn to move away from typically ' soft ' topics such as health and education and take on the harder ones , " said neusüss . " merkel needs to do more " given the odds , angela merkel 's rise to the top - albeit facilitated by the cdu 's damaging party scandal that led to helmut kohl ’ s departure - has , most agree , sent an important signal to women aspiring for higher positions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with her team " the very fact that it 's possible for a woman from a conservative party to become chancellor is very progressive , " said neusüss , adding that merkel needed to do much more for women than the rather flimsy promises on family and equality in her party platform . " being a woman at the top is n't enough , " neusüss said . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and the female question with less than three weeks to go to the elections , germany is wondering what it will mean to have its first woman chancellor .

some studies already show that mass manufacturing of automobiles in germany could be completely phased out in as little as 15 years time with factories continuing their migration to china , and india as well as japan and korea to avoid the western europe 's relatively high production costs . the threat of moving to less expensive countries as a way of pressuring employees to work longer for less or watch their jobs disappear seems to be the only answer coming from the auto industry brass .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.09.2005 german poll reaches finale in dresden großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making their final push : schröder and merkel german chancellor schröder and his conservative rival merkel are back on the campaign trail friday ahead of a delayed vote in dresden on the weekend which will complete the inconclusive general election . around 220,000 voters will go to the polls on sunday to cast their votes and decide the final seats in the bundestag or lower house of parliament . voting in dresden was delayed for two weeks by the death of a neo-nazi candidate during the election campaign . both german chancellor gerhard schröder and his conservative challenger , angela merkel hit the campaign trail in the eastern city , south of berlin , on friday . merkel is set to address supporters along with dresden 's premier georg milbradt in the city 's old quarter , while schröder will rally supporters together with leader of the social democrats ' franz müntefering in a beer garden on the banks of the river elbe . dresden wo n't tip the balance yet sunday 's results will not change the overall picture from the general election on sept .
18 , which produced a narrow three-seat advantage for merkel 's christian democrats over the social democrats which fell well short of what was required for a governing majority . yet the election could have a psychological impact on the intense negotiations to come before a new government is formed . although three seats are at stake , the christian democrats can at worst only lose one seat because of the complex german electoral system which is a mixture of the majority and proportional systems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , some believe that the delayed vote in dresden , two weeks after general elections in the rest of the country , may still speed up the process of forming a coalition - most likely a " grand coalition " between the spd and the conservatives . chancellor issue plagues talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder both still claim the chancellorship but a chief stumbling block is the insistence of both schröder and merkel that they should be chancellor .
schröder claims he still has a mandate for a third term as chancellor , but merkel said her alliance won the election and therefore she should govern . " the biggest political party in a coalition has the prerogative to put forward a chancellor , " merkel said in an interview with friday 's edition of the sächsische zeitung newspaper which covers the dresden area . merkel added that the negotiations to form a grand coalition - and the horse-trading of ministerial posts that involves - would only begin once a decision had been made on who will be chancellor . schröder however told the same newspaper that the chancellery issue should form part of the negotiations . " we can not say that the negotiations will only begin once we have made concessions , " he said . the social democrats meanwhile poured cold water on claims from the conservatives that schröder would stand aside after the voting in dresden . franz müntefering , the leader of the social democrats , said on thursday : " there is nothing in this .
our demand remains the same : we want to govern with gerhard schröder as chancellor . " calls for schröder to step down yet , guido westerwelle , the leader of the free-market liberal fdp , the conservatives ' real preferred coalition partner , said he " fully expected " that schröder would step aside following the dresden vote . " i assume that will be the occasion for schröder to make way , " westerwelle said . and michael glos , a leading member of the christian social union , the christian democrats ' sister party in bavaria , said he also expected schröder would step down on monday . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign media warm up to grand coalition most foreign media painted a bleak picture of germany 's prospects after the country 's inconclusive poll .

but with a grand coalition likely to take power , many foreign correspondents feel it may not be the worst option . germany has been in the grip of political deadlock for over a week as the conservatives led by angela merkel huddle with chancellor schröder 's social democrats in a string of exploratory talks to see whether the two can work together in a so-called grand coalition . both national and international media is closely following events as the jockeying over prime posts and ministries plays out in the german capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , right , with bavarian premier stoiber at the same time , it 's not exactly easy for foreign journalists based in berlin to explain the tangled negotiations and the quirks of the german political system to their audience back home . but , as opposed to the gloom that the election result triggered in the eu , many foreign media now seems to think that a grand coalition may indeed still be able to drive the eu 's largest economy towards economic and labor reforms . foreign hacks optimistic pascal thibaut from radio france international is confident that a grand coalition would mean anything but stagnation . " i think there probably will be more reforms , " he said .
" there are quite a lot of topics - economic but also social ones where the two parties are able to find a compromise . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are n't so many differences on the big issue of taxes too .

" and it 's not just common ground , but if they have a clear view of how they want to reform the country , then it might be good .

our demand remains the same : we want to govern with gerhard schröder as chancellor .

the automobile companies are examples of improvements taking place in germany 's most important industry . the pictures are easy to compare as new managers take the wheel at volkswagen and mercedes .
mercedes ' dieter zetsche and volkswagen 's wolfgang bernhard both presented their new models with smiling faces at this month 's frankfurt international motor show , but soon after both men dropped the happy faces they showed the press . as mercedes this week announced it would cut 8,500 jobs in germany , and volkswagen employees in a german plant agreed to work for less to keep production of a new sport utility vehicle from moving to portugal , both managers claimed they were just getting started with their work of putting their companies back in order . transforming germany 's car industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : job cuts followed the auto show shine at mercedes the two car manufacturers even discussed investing in each other as a protection against hostile takeovers .
though talks on the topic have been put off until next year , mercedes and vw do n't expect antitrust difficulties as the investments would stay below 20 percent and the companies would not exchange board members , according to a report in der spiegel newsmagazine . germany 's automobile industry is at the beginning of a radical change .
some studies already show that mass manufacturing of automobiles in germany could be completely phased out in as little as 15 years time with factories continuing their migration to china , and india as well as japan and korea to avoid the western europe 's relatively high production costs . the threat of moving to less expensive countries as a way of pressuring employees to work longer for less or watch their jobs disappear seems to be the only answer coming from the auto industry brass .
at the same time managers ' billion-dollar bad decisions go unpunished , giving the workforces a first-hand lesson in globalization . staff celebrates job cuts there 's more that connects dieter zetsche and wolfgang bernhard than they way they 've started their work in germany .
the pair was also responsible for reorganizing daimlerchrysler 's us subsidiary , chrysler , where they cut 26,000 jobs and closed several factories . the workforce in detroit celebrated zetsche 's return to germany - not because they wanted to get rid of him , but because they realized the cuts were the only way to keep the company running at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler 's staff agreed cuts needed to be made now , back home in germany , the men are left to iron out the problems caused by their all-too visionary predecessors , and there are hard times ahead for germany 's production line workers . the stock market has already rewarded zetsche and bernhard for doing their unenviable task , pushing share prices up to heights they have n't seen in a long time .
how long it lasts is an open question , but the markets always bet on the future and one thing is for sure : production in germany is moving forward . henrik böhme -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mercedes announces massive job cuts daimlerchrysler announced that one out of nine jobs would be cut from the workforce at its german mercedes unit in an effort to reduce costs .

the automobile companies are examples of improvements taking place in germany 's most important industry . the pictures are easy to compare as new managers take the wheel at volkswagen and mercedes .
mercedes ' dieter zetsche and volkswagen 's wolfgang bernhard both presented their new models with smiling faces at this month 's frankfurt international motor show , but soon after both men dropped the happy faces they showed the press . as mercedes this week announced it would cut 8,500 jobs in germany , and volkswagen employees in a german plant agreed to work for less to keep production of a new sport utility vehicle from moving to portugal , both managers claimed they were just getting started with their work of putting their companies back in order . transforming germany 's car industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : job cuts followed the auto show shine at mercedes the two car manufacturers even discussed investing in each other as a protection against hostile takeovers .
though talks on the topic have been put off until next year , mercedes and vw do n't expect antitrust difficulties as the investments would stay below 20 percent and the companies would not exchange board members , according to a report in der spiegel newsmagazine . germany 's automobile industry is at the beginning of a radical change .
some studies already show that mass manufacturing of automobiles in germany could be completely phased out in as little as 15 years time with factories continuing their migration to china , and india as well as japan and korea to avoid the western europe 's relatively high production costs . the threat of moving to less expensive countries as a way of pressuring employees to work longer for less or watch their jobs disappear seems to be the only answer coming from the auto industry brass .
at the same time managers ' billion-dollar bad decisions go unpunished , giving the workforces a first-hand lesson in globalization . staff celebrates job cuts there 's more that connects dieter zetsche and wolfgang bernhard than they way they 've started their work in germany .
the pair was also responsible for reorganizing daimlerchrysler 's us subsidiary , chrysler , where they cut 26,000 jobs and closed several factories . the workforce in detroit celebrated zetsche 's return to germany - not because they wanted to get rid of him , but because they realized the cuts were the only way to keep the company running at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler 's staff agreed cuts needed to be made now , back home in germany , the men are left to iron out the problems caused by their all-too visionary predecessors , and there are hard times ahead for germany 's production line workers . the stock market has already rewarded zetsche and bernhard for doing their unenviable task , pushing share prices up to heights they have n't seen in a long time .
how long it lasts is an open question , but the markets always bet on the future and one thing is for sure : production in germany is moving forward . henrik böhme -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mercedes announces massive job cuts daimlerchrysler announced that one out of nine jobs would be cut from the workforce at its german mercedes unit in an effort to reduce costs .

the consequences for germany and the world are drought , floods and glacial melt . german film director roland emmerich filmed it with his big-budget natural catastrophe movie " the day after tomorrow . "
the united nations is seeking to slow it down with the kyoto protocol .
and photos of the alps from the early 20th century compared with 2005 show it clearly : global warming .
now , the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg has presented its most recent assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
according to its simulations , global warming is worse than once believed .
it 's an alarming announcement , considering how drastic earlier predictions were .
" our most recent results are more solid than before , " said jochem marotze , the institute 's director .
" we are convinced that they are dependable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising sea levels would wipe cities like new york from the map the results : earth 's temperature will rise on average up to four degrees celsius -lrb- 7.2 fahrenheit -rrb- by the year 2100 and sea levels will increase up to 30 centimeters -lrb- 11.8 inches -rrb- .
one scientist said that this rapid warming of the earth is the " strongest climate change in the last one million years . "
dry spells and floods become the norm the drought and insufferable heat that hit most of western europe , including germany , in 2003 will be a normal occurrence in 50 years .
averages of 30 degrees celsius will no longer be unusual in the june , july and august .
in the winter , instead of snow falling , rain will , and whenever it does so , then it will last longer and be heavier .
" weather situations in which extreme floods occur will increase , " said study leader erich roeckner .
floods like those in southern germany and austria this summer or the elbe flood in 2002 could happen regularly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will skiing become an indoor activity in europe ?
in addition , the mild temperature will mean the end of alpine glaciers by the end of this century .
they will melt away due to the higher temperatures , causing flooding at that time .
but rivers like the rhine , which depend on glacial melt , will turn into a trickle of their former strength .
but not only those living on river flood plains must worry .
due to predominantly westerly winds in the winter , residents along the north sea will encounter sea levels up 43 centimeters , over 40 percent above the average expected increase .
and where will polar bears go ?
over 1,000 scientists from around the world helped collect data for the most recent ipcc assessment report .
in 2007 , a final report will be presented to governments around the world .
the climatologists have reached a consensus on what lies behind the rapid pace of climate change .
" humans have had a large one-of-a-kind influence on the climate , " roeckner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polar bears wo n't be too happy with loss of their habitat foresters will have to adapt to the new climate by planting new varieties of trees .
the polar ice cap will shrink in size , and by 2100 , it is possible that the arctic will be ice free in the summer .
the annual melt of the arctic the past three years equaled 1.3 million square kilometers -lrb- 502,000 square miles -rrb- or four times that the area of germany .
the polar bear , dependent on ice floes to catch and kill its prey , will face more and more difficulties .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on women wage gap between the sexes widens in germany work-life balance gets boost in germany " glass ceiling " lawsuit takes aim at german bank eu takes slow road to gender equity germany -pipe- 30.09.2005 changing the rules of the men-only game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is holding her own in untested waters despite equality laws , quotas for women and vitriolic feminists , germany has yet to see a woman climb to the highest rung of political power .
all eyes are now on angela merkel to see if she gains entry to the boys ’ club . the inconclusive poll on sept 18 which has plunged germany into political paralysis and triggered horse-trading between the main parties has overshadowed another aspect of the election that generated much excitement : whether europe ’ s largest economy will , for the first time in its postwar history , be led by a woman . the answer to that no longer seems clear after the conservatives ' disastrous election result and challenges to angela merkel 's claim to the chancellorship . but there 's no denying that merkel 's candidacy for the highest political post has been nothing short of historic in a country where the reins of power are overwhelmingly in the hands of men . katja husen , spokesperson for women 's issues at the green party pointed out that women in germany are persistently absent from top jobs . " the fact that we ’ ve never had a female chancellor before is one aspect .
but it 's the same in company boardrooms - we 've just never had famous women in top positions of power . " broader representation in politics however , statistics show that compared to the german corporate world , women have undeniably been more successful at breaking through the so-called glass ceiling when it comes to politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female participation in politics has gradually risen over the years ever since conservative chancellor konrad adenauer reluctantly appointed the country 's first female minister , elisabeth schwarzhaupt -lrb- photo -rrb- , to his cabinet in 1961 . today , six out of 13 ministries in chancellor schröder ’ s government are led by women - a big leap from the two female ministers in former chancellor helmut kohl ’ s cabinet .
and women 's share in parliament currently hovers at 32 percent , up from a mere 9 percent in 1980 . the proportionately better representation of women in politics is attributed to a slew of laws and policies guaranteeing gender equality and equality of opportunity that were put in place in the 1980s and 1990s . the crucial quota bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast , center , will be co-chairing the leadership of the greens together with her male colleague , fritz kuhn but , most agree that it 's the " women 's quota , " first introduced by the green party in the 1980s with a strict 50 percent reservation of party seats and posts for women , that was the trigger for an explosive increase in the number of women politicians . " it 's been the most effective instrument to boost women 's participation in politics , better than all the equality legislation and confidence-boosting measures for women , " said husen . " thanks to it , men have no choice but to see to it that they recruit more women . " the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- followed suit in 1988 , committing itself to filling 40 percent of its posts with women while the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- finally agreed in 1996 to include more women in its ranks , but remained noncommittal about the exact proportion . the old boys ' network the measures may have indeed led to more representation for women in politics , but many point out that it has n't really given women tangible influence or allowed them to penetrate the highest echelons of political power in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler , left with chancellor schröder one major reason , according to katja husen , is the fact that high-level german politics is still exclusively a boys ' club . " power structures in germany are very homogenous - they 're dominated by male academics and the rules of the game are thus set by men too , " said husen . " there 's no sense of bringing in diversity or encouraging people with different backgrounds - it 's a very german way of thinking . " in a recent article , germany 's leading feminist alice schwarzer likened chancellor schröder 's punch-drunk performance on the evening of the election - where he dismissed merkel 's claim to the chancellorship insisting he should carry on instead - to a matter of honor .
schwarzer said schröder was behaving like a tyrant and could n't bear the thought of losing out to a woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sixty years after hitler and 87 years after gaining the right for women to vote , the people may have elected her -lrb- merkel -rrb- , but the majority of the powerful are still far removed from conceding the highest office to a woman , " schwarzer -lrb- photo -rrb- wrote . lack of role models but macho attitudes are n't the only problem . claudia neusüss , a former executive director of the heinrich böll foundation , pointed out that a strong domestic image of women as taking responsibility for family and children that originated in west germany in the 1970s and 1980s still dominates the current political sphere to an extent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " though it 's all changing now , women too tend to think along those lines .
besides , juggling a career and family in germany is n't easy either , " she said . a lack of role models is a further hurdle to women aiming high in politics . though germany has seen three female presidents of the bundestag and a woman presiding over the constitutional court , the trend has stopped when it comes to leading the country , either in the role of president or chancellor , or even one of the two big political parties - until merkel , that is . " women have to develop their own rules of the game , they have to know what they want and learn to move away from typically ' soft ' topics such as health and education and take on the harder ones , " said neusüss . " merkel needs to do more " given the odds , angela merkel 's rise to the top - albeit facilitated by the cdu 's damaging party scandal that led to helmut kohl ’ s departure - has , most agree , sent an important signal to women aspiring for higher positions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with her team " the very fact that it 's possible for a woman from a conservative party to become chancellor is very progressive , " said neusüss , adding that merkel needed to do much more for women than the rather flimsy promises on family and equality in her party platform . " being a woman at the top is n't enough , " neusüss said . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and the female question with less than three weeks to go to the elections , germany is wondering what it will mean to have its first woman chancellor .

18 , which produced a narrow three-seat advantage for merkel 's christian democrats over the social democrats which fell well short of what was required for a governing majority . yet the election could have a psychological impact on the intense negotiations to come before a new government is formed . although three seats are at stake , the christian democrats can at worst only lose one seat because of the complex german electoral system which is a mixture of the majority and proportional systems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , some believe that the delayed vote in dresden , two weeks after general elections in the rest of the country , may still speed up the process of forming a coalition - most likely a " grand coalition " between the spd and the conservatives . chancellor issue plagues talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder both still claim the chancellorship but a chief stumbling block is the insistence of both schröder and merkel that they should be chancellor .
schröder claims he still has a mandate for a third term as chancellor , but merkel said her alliance won the election and therefore she should govern . " the biggest political party in a coalition has the prerogative to put forward a chancellor , " merkel said in an interview with friday 's edition of the sächsische zeitung newspaper which covers the dresden area . merkel added that the negotiations to form a grand coalition - and the horse-trading of ministerial posts that involves - would only begin once a decision had been made on who will be chancellor . schröder however told the same newspaper that the chancellery issue should form part of the negotiations . " we can not say that the negotiations will only begin once we have made concessions , " he said . the social democrats meanwhile poured cold water on claims from the conservatives that schröder would stand aside after the voting in dresden . franz müntefering , the leader of the social democrats , said on thursday : " there is nothing in this .
our demand remains the same : we want to govern with gerhard schröder as chancellor . " calls for schröder to step down yet , guido westerwelle , the leader of the free-market liberal fdp , the conservatives ' real preferred coalition partner , said he " fully expected " that schröder would step aside following the dresden vote . " i assume that will be the occasion for schröder to make way , " westerwelle said . and michael glos , a leading member of the christian social union , the christian democrats ' sister party in bavaria , said he also expected schröder would step down on monday . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign media warm up to grand coalition most foreign media painted a bleak picture of germany 's prospects after the country 's inconclusive poll .

but with a grand coalition likely to take power , many foreign correspondents feel it may not be the worst option . germany has been in the grip of political deadlock for over a week as the conservatives led by angela merkel huddle with chancellor schröder 's social democrats in a string of exploratory talks to see whether the two can work together in a so-called grand coalition . both national and international media is closely following events as the jockeying over prime posts and ministries plays out in the german capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , right , with bavarian premier stoiber at the same time , it 's not exactly easy for foreign journalists based in berlin to explain the tangled negotiations and the quirks of the german political system to their audience back home . but , as opposed to the gloom that the election result triggered in the eu , many foreign media now seems to think that a grand coalition may indeed still be able to drive the eu 's largest economy towards economic and labor reforms . foreign hacks optimistic pascal thibaut from radio france international is confident that a grand coalition would mean anything but stagnation . " i think there probably will be more reforms , " he said .

but with a grand coalition likely to take power , many foreign correspondents feel it may not be the worst option . germany has been in the grip of political deadlock for over a week as the conservatives led by angela merkel huddle with chancellor schröder 's social democrats in a string of exploratory talks to see whether the two can work together in a so-called grand coalition . both national and international media is closely following events as the jockeying over prime posts and ministries plays out in the german capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , right , with bavarian premier stoiber at the same time , it 's not exactly easy for foreign journalists based in berlin to explain the tangled negotiations and the quirks of the german political system to their audience back home . but , as opposed to the gloom that the election result triggered in the eu , many foreign media now seems to think that a grand coalition may indeed still be able to drive the eu 's largest economy towards economic and labor reforms . foreign hacks optimistic pascal thibaut from radio france international is confident that a grand coalition would mean anything but stagnation . " i think there probably will be more reforms , " he said .

all eyes are now on angela merkel to see if she gains entry to the boys ’ club . the inconclusive poll on sept 18 which has plunged germany into political paralysis and triggered horse-trading between the main parties has overshadowed another aspect of the election that generated much excitement : whether europe ’ s largest economy will , for the first time in its postwar history , be led by a woman . the answer to that no longer seems clear after the conservatives ' disastrous election result and challenges to angela merkel 's claim to the chancellorship . but there 's no denying that merkel 's candidacy for the highest political post has been nothing short of historic in a country where the reins of power are overwhelmingly in the hands of men . katja husen , spokesperson for women 's issues at the green party pointed out that women in germany are persistently absent from top jobs . " the fact that we ’ ve never had a female chancellor before is one aspect .
but it 's the same in company boardrooms - we 've just never had famous women in top positions of power . " broader representation in politics however , statistics show that compared to the german corporate world , women have undeniably been more successful at breaking through the so-called glass ceiling when it comes to politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female participation in politics has gradually risen over the years ever since conservative chancellor konrad adenauer reluctantly appointed the country 's first female minister , elisabeth schwarzhaupt -lrb- photo -rrb- , to his cabinet in 1961 . today , six out of 13 ministries in chancellor schröder ’ s government are led by women - a big leap from the two female ministers in former chancellor helmut kohl ’ s cabinet .
and women 's share in parliament currently hovers at 32 percent , up from a mere 9 percent in 1980 . the proportionately better representation of women in politics is attributed to a slew of laws and policies guaranteeing gender equality and equality of opportunity that were put in place in the 1980s and 1990s . the crucial quota bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast , center , will be co-chairing the leadership of the greens together with her male colleague , fritz kuhn but , most agree that it 's the " women 's quota , " first introduced by the green party in the 1980s with a strict 50 percent reservation of party seats and posts for women , that was the trigger for an explosive increase in the number of women politicians . " it 's been the most effective instrument to boost women 's participation in politics , better than all the equality legislation and confidence-boosting measures for women , " said husen . " thanks to it , men have no choice but to see to it that they recruit more women . " the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- followed suit in 1988 , committing itself to filling 40 percent of its posts with women while the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- finally agreed in 1996 to include more women in its ranks , but remained noncommittal about the exact proportion . the old boys ' network the measures may have indeed led to more representation for women in politics , but many point out that it has n't really given women tangible influence or allowed them to penetrate the highest echelons of political power in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler , left with chancellor schröder one major reason , according to katja husen , is the fact that high-level german politics is still exclusively a boys ' club . " power structures in germany are very homogenous - they 're dominated by male academics and the rules of the game are thus set by men too , " said husen . " there 's no sense of bringing in diversity or encouraging people with different backgrounds - it 's a very german way of thinking . " in a recent article , germany 's leading feminist alice schwarzer likened chancellor schröder 's punch-drunk performance on the evening of the election - where he dismissed merkel 's claim to the chancellorship insisting he should carry on instead - to a matter of honor .
schwarzer said schröder was behaving like a tyrant and could n't bear the thought of losing out to a woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sixty years after hitler and 87 years after gaining the right for women to vote , the people may have elected her -lrb- merkel -rrb- , but the majority of the powerful are still far removed from conceding the highest office to a woman , " schwarzer -lrb- photo -rrb- wrote . lack of role models but macho attitudes are n't the only problem . claudia neusüss , a former executive director of the heinrich böll foundation , pointed out that a strong domestic image of women as taking responsibility for family and children that originated in west germany in the 1970s and 1980s still dominates the current political sphere to an extent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " though it 's all changing now , women too tend to think along those lines .
besides , juggling a career and family in germany is n't easy either , " she said . a lack of role models is a further hurdle to women aiming high in politics . though germany has seen three female presidents of the bundestag and a woman presiding over the constitutional court , the trend has stopped when it comes to leading the country , either in the role of president or chancellor , or even one of the two big political parties - until merkel , that is . " women have to develop their own rules of the game , they have to know what they want and learn to move away from typically ' soft ' topics such as health and education and take on the harder ones , " said neusüss . " merkel needs to do more " given the odds , angela merkel 's rise to the top - albeit facilitated by the cdu 's damaging party scandal that led to helmut kohl ’ s departure - has , most agree , sent an important signal to women aspiring for higher positions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with her team " the very fact that it 's possible for a woman from a conservative party to become chancellor is very progressive , " said neusüss , adding that merkel needed to do much more for women than the rather flimsy promises on family and equality in her party platform . " being a woman at the top is n't enough , " neusüss said . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and the female question with less than three weeks to go to the elections , germany is wondering what it will mean to have its first woman chancellor .

" no one expects us to go to luxembourg before seeing the negotiation framework document , " said gül , who would be responsible for heading the turkish negotiating delegation .
" of course there is a possibility that negotiations will not start . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign affairs minister abdullah gül will be heading negotiations on monday - if they start gül -lrb- photo -rrb- would not comment on a non-binding resolution that passed european parliament on thursday that attempts to place new conditions on ankara before starting talks , including recognition of the 1915 killing of armenians as genocide regional election dictates austrian course with an important regional election the governing parties in vienna want to win and 80 percent of austrians against admitting turkey to the bloc , domestic politics have motivated austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel 's decision not to back down in the confrontation with ankara , according to political scientist fritz plasser . " he believed he could rally germany and france to the idea of a ' privileged partnership , " ' plasser said .
" when schüssel understood that he would not be joined by berlin and paris , and saw that the european parliament backed opening negotiations with ankara , he had no other choice but to block -lrb- the talks -rrb- in order not to convey any sign of weakness to his public . " turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan played down the importance of the austrian position and said he did n't " think it 's a very serious problem " to the start of talks .
he also emphasized that turkey would not accept anything less than full eu membership at the end of accession negotiations , which are expected to last at least 10 years . the ankara-zagreb connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia should n't be left in the " eternal waiting room , " according to schüssel austria 's insistence at linking negotiations with turkey to an immediate opening of talks with croatia has been another source of the most recent diplomatic wrangling .
the eu cancelled negotiations with croatia in march after brussels said zagreb was not doing enough to catch and prosecute suspected war criminal ante gotovina . german conservatives in the european parliament supported the austrian position and argued that croatia should n't be denied talks because of one man while there were still gross violations of human rights in turkey . " if we trust turkey to make further progress , we should trust croatia too , " schüssel told the financial times .
" it 's in europe 's best interest to start negotiations with croatia immediately . " other european politicians refused to see talks with the two countries connected .

negotiations for turkey 's possible entry to the european union are rocky even before they have started .
deutsche welle 's baha güngör believes that the eu-turkey project does n't have a realistic chance . whether membership talks with turkey can begin , as planned , on monday will be decided at the last minute .
after ambassadors from the 25 member states failed to agree on a negotiating mandate at their meeting on thursday , eu foreign ministers now have to attend a special session in luxembourg on sunday , since unanimous approval is mandatory for the negotiations to start .
none of the 25 eu member states , not even cyprus , wants to be the spoilsport , which is why there will probably be a last minute agreement to go ahead with the negotiations .
but even if that 's the case , the eu-turkey project is hardly realistic .
anyone who still thinks that one day in the distant future , after 10 or 15 years of negotiations , turkey will become an eu member , is either naive or has no clue about the country 's inner workings .
turkey is a country on the periphery of europe and therefore , a country whose stability means much politically , economically , and in terms of security , to europe .
those who are sensible would want to include turkey in the continent 's integration process and to get ankara to pursue the values and visions of europe .
domestic politics at the center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's " non " to the eu constitution was for many a rejection of turkey yet before accession negotiations started , many eu countries turned the process into a self-serve buffet , looking to further their own national interests .
the election campaign in germany , as well as the french rejection of the eu constitution , which to a great deal was a rejection of turkey , reveal this clearly .
demands too high , too soon if the negotiations indeed start on monday , it will be less a question of whether they will ever successfully be brought to an end .
rather , the question will be when they can be deemed to have failed , or at least be interrupted for a few years .
grounds for failure wo n't be the eu 's regulations , the so-called " acquis communautaire . "
a lengthy transition period or permanent security clauses could be agreed .
turkey is by far the largest and most densely populated country that has ever attempted eu entry .
in many economic areas , it still lags far behind the eu average .
but for all of these problems , solutions could be found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern , turkish cypriots supported reunification of the island that 's been divided since 1974 but the eu is making a big mistake by demanding the maximum from turkey , i.e. recognizing cyprus or dealing with the armenian genocide , right at the start of the negotiations .
they 're playing their trump cards wrongly , creating resentment and hardening the country that could , and also has to , address such topics in the course of drawing closer to european values .
euphoria long gone turks ' enthusiasm for europe has , for the most part , disappeared .
the country 's nationalists are gaining in popularity and are reconquering territory it had lost before .
it 's no secret that in the next elections , expected in two years , turkish nationalism will experience a rebirth .
the feeling is growing among turks that the numerous reforms in the past and the strengthening of democratic forces in asia minor since the signing of the 1963 association agreement with the eu have all been for naught .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish flag and an image of the country 's founder , kemal atatürk it is a shame that the eu will have clumsily dropped its chance to achieve its goal of becoming a " global player " and its credibility in fostering dialogue between cultures and religions .

the automobile companies are examples of improvements taking place in germany 's most important industry . the pictures are easy to compare as new managers take the wheel at volkswagen and mercedes .
mercedes ' dieter zetsche and volkswagen 's wolfgang bernhard both presented their new models with smiling faces at this month 's frankfurt international motor show , but soon after both men dropped the happy faces they showed the press . as mercedes this week announced it would cut 8,500 jobs in germany , and volkswagen employees in a german plant agreed to work for less to keep production of a new sport utility vehicle from moving to portugal , both managers claimed they were just getting started with their work of putting their companies back in order . transforming germany 's car industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : job cuts followed the auto show shine at mercedes the two car manufacturers even discussed investing in each other as a protection against hostile takeovers .
though talks on the topic have been put off until next year , mercedes and vw do n't expect antitrust difficulties as the investments would stay below 20 percent and the companies would not exchange board members , according to a report in der spiegel newsmagazine . germany 's automobile industry is at the beginning of a radical change .
some studies already show that mass manufacturing of automobiles in germany could be completely phased out in as little as 15 years time with factories continuing their migration to china , and india as well as japan and korea to avoid the western europe 's relatively high production costs . the threat of moving to less expensive countries as a way of pressuring employees to work longer for less or watch their jobs disappear seems to be the only answer coming from the auto industry brass .
at the same time managers ' billion-dollar bad decisions go unpunished , giving the workforces a first-hand lesson in globalization . staff celebrates job cuts there 's more that connects dieter zetsche and wolfgang bernhard than they way they 've started their work in germany .
the pair was also responsible for reorganizing daimlerchrysler 's us subsidiary , chrysler , where they cut 26,000 jobs and closed several factories . the workforce in detroit celebrated zetsche 's return to germany - not because they wanted to get rid of him , but because they realized the cuts were the only way to keep the company running at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chrysler 's staff agreed cuts needed to be made now , back home in germany , the men are left to iron out the problems caused by their all-too visionary predecessors , and there are hard times ahead for germany 's production line workers . the stock market has already rewarded zetsche and bernhard for doing their unenviable task , pushing share prices up to heights they have n't seen in a long time .

the consequences for germany and the world are drought , floods and glacial melt . german film director roland emmerich filmed it with his big-budget natural catastrophe movie " the day after tomorrow . "
the united nations is seeking to slow it down with the kyoto protocol .
and photos of the alps from the early 20th century compared with 2005 show it clearly : global warming .
now , the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg has presented its most recent assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
according to its simulations , global warming is worse than once believed .
it 's an alarming announcement , considering how drastic earlier predictions were .
" our most recent results are more solid than before , " said jochem marotze , the institute 's director .
" we are convinced that they are dependable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising sea levels would wipe cities like new york from the map the results : earth 's temperature will rise on average up to four degrees celsius -lrb- 7.2 fahrenheit -rrb- by the year 2100 and sea levels will increase up to 30 centimeters -lrb- 11.8 inches -rrb- .
one scientist said that this rapid warming of the earth is the " strongest climate change in the last one million years . "
dry spells and floods become the norm the drought and insufferable heat that hit most of western europe , including germany , in 2003 will be a normal occurrence in 50 years .
averages of 30 degrees celsius will no longer be unusual in the june , july and august .
in the winter , instead of snow falling , rain will , and whenever it does so , then it will last longer and be heavier .
" weather situations in which extreme floods occur will increase , " said study leader erich roeckner .
floods like those in southern germany and austria this summer or the elbe flood in 2002 could happen regularly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will skiing become an indoor activity in europe ?
in addition , the mild temperature will mean the end of alpine glaciers by the end of this century .
they will melt away due to the higher temperatures , causing flooding at that time .
but rivers like the rhine , which depend on glacial melt , will turn into a trickle of their former strength .
but not only those living on river flood plains must worry .
due to predominantly westerly winds in the winter , residents along the north sea will encounter sea levels up 43 centimeters , over 40 percent above the average expected increase .
and where will polar bears go ?
over 1,000 scientists from around the world helped collect data for the most recent ipcc assessment report .
in 2007 , a final report will be presented to governments around the world .
the climatologists have reached a consensus on what lies behind the rapid pace of climate change .
" humans have had a large one-of-a-kind influence on the climate , " roeckner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polar bears wo n't be too happy with loss of their habitat foresters will have to adapt to the new climate by planting new varieties of trees .
the polar ice cap will shrink in size , and by 2100 , it is possible that the arctic will be ice free in the summer .
the annual melt of the arctic the past three years equaled 1.3 million square kilometers -lrb- 502,000 square miles -rrb- or four times that the area of germany .
the polar bear , dependent on ice floes to catch and kill its prey , will face more and more difficulties .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.09.2005 opinion : eu-turkey project hardly realistic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey and the eu : two incompatible constellations ?
negotiations for turkey 's possible entry to the european union are rocky even before they have started .
deutsche welle 's baha güngör believes that the eu-turkey project does n't have a realistic chance . whether membership talks with turkey can begin , as planned , on monday will be decided at the last minute .
after ambassadors from the 25 member states failed to agree on a negotiating mandate at their meeting on thursday , eu foreign ministers now have to attend a special session in luxembourg on sunday , since unanimous approval is mandatory for the negotiations to start .
none of the 25 eu member states , not even cyprus , wants to be the spoilsport , which is why there will probably be a last minute agreement to go ahead with the negotiations .
but even if that 's the case , the eu-turkey project is hardly realistic .
anyone who still thinks that one day in the distant future , after 10 or 15 years of negotiations , turkey will become an eu member , is either naive or has no clue about the country 's inner workings .
turkey is a country on the periphery of europe and therefore , a country whose stability means much politically , economically , and in terms of security , to europe .
those who are sensible would want to include turkey in the continent 's integration process and to get ankara to pursue the values and visions of europe .
domestic politics at the center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's " non " to the eu constitution was for many a rejection of turkey yet before accession negotiations started , many eu countries turned the process into a self-serve buffet , looking to further their own national interests .
the election campaign in germany , as well as the french rejection of the eu constitution , which to a great deal was a rejection of turkey , reveal this clearly .
demands too high , too soon if the negotiations indeed start on monday , it will be less a question of whether they will ever successfully be brought to an end .
rather , the question will be when they can be deemed to have failed , or at least be interrupted for a few years .
grounds for failure wo n't be the eu 's regulations , the so-called " acquis communautaire . "
a lengthy transition period or permanent security clauses could be agreed .
turkey is by far the largest and most densely populated country that has ever attempted eu entry .
in many economic areas , it still lags far behind the eu average .
but for all of these problems , solutions could be found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern , turkish cypriots supported reunification of the island that 's been divided since 1974 but the eu is making a big mistake by demanding the maximum from turkey , i.e. recognizing cyprus or dealing with the armenian genocide , right at the start of the negotiations .
they 're playing their trump cards wrongly , creating resentment and hardening the country that could , and also has to , address such topics in the course of drawing closer to european values .
euphoria long gone turks ' enthusiasm for europe has , for the most part , disappeared .
the country 's nationalists are gaining in popularity and are reconquering territory it had lost before .
it 's no secret that in the next elections , expected in two years , turkish nationalism will experience a rebirth .
the feeling is growing among turks that the numerous reforms in the past and the strengthening of democratic forces in asia minor since the signing of the 1963 association agreement with the eu have all been for naught .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish flag and an image of the country 's founder , kemal atatürk it is a shame that the eu will have clumsily dropped its chance to achieve its goal of becoming a " global player " and its credibility in fostering dialogue between cultures and religions .
for turkey , it 's a shame that the country 's development into a democratic state will be threatened with large setbacks .
for when the eu and turkey start negotiations as planned , the participants will already be sapped of their strength .

all eyes are now on angela merkel to see if she gains entry to the boys ’ club . the inconclusive poll on sept 18 which has plunged germany into political paralysis and triggered horse-trading between the main parties has overshadowed another aspect of the election that generated much excitement : whether europe ’ s largest economy will , for the first time in its postwar history , be led by a woman . the answer to that no longer seems clear after the conservatives ' disastrous election result and challenges to angela merkel 's claim to the chancellorship . but there 's no denying that merkel 's candidacy for the highest political post has been nothing short of historic in a country where the reins of power are overwhelmingly in the hands of men . katja husen , spokesperson for women 's issues at the green party pointed out that women in germany are persistently absent from top jobs . " the fact that we ’ ve never had a female chancellor before is one aspect .
but it 's the same in company boardrooms - we 've just never had famous women in top positions of power . " broader representation in politics however , statistics show that compared to the german corporate world , women have undeniably been more successful at breaking through the so-called glass ceiling when it comes to politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female participation in politics has gradually risen over the years ever since conservative chancellor konrad adenauer reluctantly appointed the country 's first female minister , elisabeth schwarzhaupt -lrb- photo -rrb- , to his cabinet in 1961 . today , six out of 13 ministries in chancellor schröder ’ s government are led by women - a big leap from the two female ministers in former chancellor helmut kohl ’ s cabinet .
and women 's share in parliament currently hovers at 32 percent , up from a mere 9 percent in 1980 . the proportionately better representation of women in politics is attributed to a slew of laws and policies guaranteeing gender equality and equality of opportunity that were put in place in the 1980s and 1990s . the crucial quota bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast , center , will be co-chairing the leadership of the greens together with her male colleague , fritz kuhn but , most agree that it 's the " women 's quota , " first introduced by the green party in the 1980s with a strict 50 percent reservation of party seats and posts for women , that was the trigger for an explosive increase in the number of women politicians . " it 's been the most effective instrument to boost women 's participation in politics , better than all the equality legislation and confidence-boosting measures for women , " said husen . " thanks to it , men have no choice but to see to it that they recruit more women . " the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- followed suit in 1988 , committing itself to filling 40 percent of its posts with women while the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- finally agreed in 1996 to include more women in its ranks , but remained noncommittal about the exact proportion . the old boys ' network the measures may have indeed led to more representation for women in politics , but many point out that it has n't really given women tangible influence or allowed them to penetrate the highest echelons of political power in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler , left with chancellor schröder one major reason , according to katja husen , is the fact that high-level german politics is still exclusively a boys ' club . " power structures in germany are very homogenous - they 're dominated by male academics and the rules of the game are thus set by men too , " said husen . " there 's no sense of bringing in diversity or encouraging people with different backgrounds - it 's a very german way of thinking . " in a recent article , germany 's leading feminist alice schwarzer likened chancellor schröder 's punch-drunk performance on the evening of the election - where he dismissed merkel 's claim to the chancellorship insisting he should carry on instead - to a matter of honor .
schwarzer said schröder was behaving like a tyrant and could n't bear the thought of losing out to a woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sixty years after hitler and 87 years after gaining the right for women to vote , the people may have elected her -lrb- merkel -rrb- , but the majority of the powerful are still far removed from conceding the highest office to a woman , " schwarzer -lrb- photo -rrb- wrote . lack of role models but macho attitudes are n't the only problem . claudia neusüss , a former executive director of the heinrich böll foundation , pointed out that a strong domestic image of women as taking responsibility for family and children that originated in west germany in the 1970s and 1980s still dominates the current political sphere to an extent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " though it 's all changing now , women too tend to think along those lines .
besides , juggling a career and family in germany is n't easy either , " she said . a lack of role models is a further hurdle to women aiming high in politics . though germany has seen three female presidents of the bundestag and a woman presiding over the constitutional court , the trend has stopped when it comes to leading the country , either in the role of president or chancellor , or even one of the two big political parties - until merkel , that is . " women have to develop their own rules of the game , they have to know what they want and learn to move away from typically ' soft ' topics such as health and education and take on the harder ones , " said neusüss . " merkel needs to do more " given the odds , angela merkel 's rise to the top - albeit facilitated by the cdu 's damaging party scandal that led to helmut kohl ’ s departure - has , most agree , sent an important signal to women aspiring for higher positions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with her team " the very fact that it 's possible for a woman from a conservative party to become chancellor is very progressive , " said neusüss , adding that merkel needed to do much more for women than the rather flimsy promises on family and equality in her party platform . " being a woman at the top is n't enough , " neusüss said . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and the female question with less than three weeks to go to the elections , germany is wondering what it will mean to have its first woman chancellor .

the consequences for germany and the world are drought , floods and glacial melt . german film director roland emmerich filmed it with his big-budget natural catastrophe movie " the day after tomorrow . "
the united nations is seeking to slow it down with the kyoto protocol .
and photos of the alps from the early 20th century compared with 2005 show it clearly : global warming .
now , the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg has presented its most recent assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
according to its simulations , global warming is worse than once believed .
it 's an alarming announcement , considering how drastic earlier predictions were .
" our most recent results are more solid than before , " said jochem marotze , the institute 's director .
" we are convinced that they are dependable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising sea levels would wipe cities like new york from the map the results : earth 's temperature will rise on average up to four degrees celsius -lrb- 7.2 fahrenheit -rrb- by the year 2100 and sea levels will increase up to 30 centimeters -lrb- 11.8 inches -rrb- .
one scientist said that this rapid warming of the earth is the " strongest climate change in the last one million years . "
dry spells and floods become the norm the drought and insufferable heat that hit most of western europe , including germany , in 2003 will be a normal occurrence in 50 years .
averages of 30 degrees celsius will no longer be unusual in the june , july and august .
in the winter , instead of snow falling , rain will , and whenever it does so , then it will last longer and be heavier .
" weather situations in which extreme floods occur will increase , " said study leader erich roeckner .
floods like those in southern germany and austria this summer or the elbe flood in 2002 could happen regularly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will skiing become an indoor activity in europe ?
in addition , the mild temperature will mean the end of alpine glaciers by the end of this century .
they will melt away due to the higher temperatures , causing flooding at that time .
but rivers like the rhine , which depend on glacial melt , will turn into a trickle of their former strength .
but not only those living on river flood plains must worry .
due to predominantly westerly winds in the winter , residents along the north sea will encounter sea levels up 43 centimeters , over 40 percent above the average expected increase .
and where will polar bears go ?
over 1,000 scientists from around the world helped collect data for the most recent ipcc assessment report .
in 2007 , a final report will be presented to governments around the world .
the climatologists have reached a consensus on what lies behind the rapid pace of climate change .
" humans have had a large one-of-a-kind influence on the climate , " roeckner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polar bears wo n't be too happy with loss of their habitat foresters will have to adapt to the new climate by planting new varieties of trees .
the polar ice cap will shrink in size , and by 2100 , it is possible that the arctic will be ice free in the summer .
the annual melt of the arctic the past three years equaled 1.3 million square kilometers -lrb- 502,000 square miles -rrb- or four times that the area of germany .

negotiations for turkey 's possible entry to the european union are rocky even before they have started .
deutsche welle 's baha güngör believes that the eu-turkey project does n't have a realistic chance . whether membership talks with turkey can begin , as planned , on monday will be decided at the last minute .
after ambassadors from the 25 member states failed to agree on a negotiating mandate at their meeting on thursday , eu foreign ministers now have to attend a special session in luxembourg on sunday , since unanimous approval is mandatory for the negotiations to start .
none of the 25 eu member states , not even cyprus , wants to be the spoilsport , which is why there will probably be a last minute agreement to go ahead with the negotiations .
but even if that 's the case , the eu-turkey project is hardly realistic .
anyone who still thinks that one day in the distant future , after 10 or 15 years of negotiations , turkey will become an eu member , is either naive or has no clue about the country 's inner workings .
turkey is a country on the periphery of europe and therefore , a country whose stability means much politically , economically , and in terms of security , to europe .
those who are sensible would want to include turkey in the continent 's integration process and to get ankara to pursue the values and visions of europe .
domestic politics at the center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's " non " to the eu constitution was for many a rejection of turkey yet before accession negotiations started , many eu countries turned the process into a self-serve buffet , looking to further their own national interests .
the election campaign in germany , as well as the french rejection of the eu constitution , which to a great deal was a rejection of turkey , reveal this clearly .
demands too high , too soon if the negotiations indeed start on monday , it will be less a question of whether they will ever successfully be brought to an end .
rather , the question will be when they can be deemed to have failed , or at least be interrupted for a few years .
grounds for failure wo n't be the eu 's regulations , the so-called " acquis communautaire . "
a lengthy transition period or permanent security clauses could be agreed .
turkey is by far the largest and most densely populated country that has ever attempted eu entry .
in many economic areas , it still lags far behind the eu average .
but for all of these problems , solutions could be found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern , turkish cypriots supported reunification of the island that 's been divided since 1974 but the eu is making a big mistake by demanding the maximum from turkey , i.e. recognizing cyprus or dealing with the armenian genocide , right at the start of the negotiations .
they 're playing their trump cards wrongly , creating resentment and hardening the country that could , and also has to , address such topics in the course of drawing closer to european values .
euphoria long gone turks ' enthusiasm for europe has , for the most part , disappeared .
the country 's nationalists are gaining in popularity and are reconquering territory it had lost before .
it 's no secret that in the next elections , expected in two years , turkish nationalism will experience a rebirth .
the feeling is growing among turks that the numerous reforms in the past and the strengthening of democratic forces in asia minor since the signing of the 1963 association agreement with the eu have all been for naught .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish flag and an image of the country 's founder , kemal atatürk it is a shame that the eu will have clumsily dropped its chance to achieve its goal of becoming a " global player " and its credibility in fostering dialogue between cultures and religions .
for turkey , it 's a shame that the country 's development into a democratic state will be threatened with large setbacks .
for when the eu and turkey start negotiations as planned , the participants will already be sapped of their strength .

" he believed he could rally germany and france to the idea of a ' privileged partnership , " ' plasser said .
" when schüssel understood that he would not be joined by berlin and paris , and saw that the european parliament backed opening negotiations with ankara , he had no other choice but to block -lrb- the talks -rrb- in order not to convey any sign of weakness to his public . " turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan played down the importance of the austrian position and said he did n't " think it 's a very serious problem " to the start of talks .
he also emphasized that turkey would not accept anything less than full eu membership at the end of accession negotiations , which are expected to last at least 10 years . the ankara-zagreb connection bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croatia should n't be left in the " eternal waiting room , " according to schüssel austria 's insistence at linking negotiations with turkey to an immediate opening of talks with croatia has been another source of the most recent diplomatic wrangling .
the eu cancelled negotiations with croatia in march after brussels said zagreb was not doing enough to catch and prosecute suspected war criminal ante gotovina . german conservatives in the european parliament supported the austrian position and argued that croatia should n't be denied talks because of one man while there were still gross violations of human rights in turkey . " if we trust turkey to make further progress , we should trust croatia too , " schüssel told the financial times .
" it 's in europe 's best interest to start negotiations with croatia immediately . " other european politicians refused to see talks with the two countries connected .

negotiations for turkey 's possible entry to the european union are rocky even before they have started .
deutsche welle 's baha güngör believes that the eu-turkey project does n't have a realistic chance . whether membership talks with turkey can begin , as planned , on monday will be decided at the last minute .
after ambassadors from the 25 member states failed to agree on a negotiating mandate at their meeting on thursday , eu foreign ministers now have to attend a special session in luxembourg on sunday , since unanimous approval is mandatory for the negotiations to start .
none of the 25 eu member states , not even cyprus , wants to be the spoilsport , which is why there will probably be a last minute agreement to go ahead with the negotiations .
but even if that 's the case , the eu-turkey project is hardly realistic .
anyone who still thinks that one day in the distant future , after 10 or 15 years of negotiations , turkey will become an eu member , is either naive or has no clue about the country 's inner workings .
turkey is a country on the periphery of europe and therefore , a country whose stability means much politically , economically , and in terms of security , to europe .
those who are sensible would want to include turkey in the continent 's integration process and to get ankara to pursue the values and visions of europe .
domestic politics at the center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's " non " to the eu constitution was for many a rejection of turkey yet before accession negotiations started , many eu countries turned the process into a self-serve buffet , looking to further their own national interests .
the election campaign in germany , as well as the french rejection of the eu constitution , which to a great deal was a rejection of turkey , reveal this clearly .
demands too high , too soon if the negotiations indeed start on monday , it will be less a question of whether they will ever successfully be brought to an end .
rather , the question will be when they can be deemed to have failed , or at least be interrupted for a few years .
grounds for failure wo n't be the eu 's regulations , the so-called " acquis communautaire . "
a lengthy transition period or permanent security clauses could be agreed .
turkey is by far the largest and most densely populated country that has ever attempted eu entry .
in many economic areas , it still lags far behind the eu average .
but for all of these problems , solutions could be found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern , turkish cypriots supported reunification of the island that 's been divided since 1974 but the eu is making a big mistake by demanding the maximum from turkey , i.e. recognizing cyprus or dealing with the armenian genocide , right at the start of the negotiations .
they 're playing their trump cards wrongly , creating resentment and hardening the country that could , and also has to , address such topics in the course of drawing closer to european values .
euphoria long gone turks ' enthusiasm for europe has , for the most part , disappeared .
the country 's nationalists are gaining in popularity and are reconquering territory it had lost before .
it 's no secret that in the next elections , expected in two years , turkish nationalism will experience a rebirth .
the feeling is growing among turks that the numerous reforms in the past and the strengthening of democratic forces in asia minor since the signing of the 1963 association agreement with the eu have all been for naught .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish flag and an image of the country 's founder , kemal atatürk it is a shame that the eu will have clumsily dropped its chance to achieve its goal of becoming a " global player " and its credibility in fostering dialogue between cultures and religions .
for turkey , it 's a shame that the country 's development into a democratic state will be threatened with large setbacks .
for when the eu and turkey start negotiations as planned , the participants will already be sapped of their strength .
they will be short of breath for the long road ahead - unless a miracle happens . baha güngör -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu turkey talks threatened eu foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting sunday to talk about membership talks with turkey after their ambassadors failed to reach an agreement on a negotiating mandate thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on women wage gap between the sexes widens in germany work-life balance gets boost in germany " glass ceiling " lawsuit takes aim at german bank eu takes slow road to gender equity germany -pipe- 30.09.2005 changing the rules of the men-only game großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel is holding her own in untested waters despite equality laws , quotas for women and vitriolic feminists , germany has yet to see a woman climb to the highest rung of political power .
all eyes are now on angela merkel to see if she gains entry to the boys ’ club . the inconclusive poll on sept 18 which has plunged germany into political paralysis and triggered horse-trading between the main parties has overshadowed another aspect of the election that generated much excitement : whether europe ’ s largest economy will , for the first time in its postwar history , be led by a woman . the answer to that no longer seems clear after the conservatives ' disastrous election result and challenges to angela merkel 's claim to the chancellorship . but there 's no denying that merkel 's candidacy for the highest political post has been nothing short of historic in a country where the reins of power are overwhelmingly in the hands of men . katja husen , spokesperson for women 's issues at the green party pointed out that women in germany are persistently absent from top jobs . " the fact that we ’ ve never had a female chancellor before is one aspect .
but it 's the same in company boardrooms - we 've just never had famous women in top positions of power . " broader representation in politics however , statistics show that compared to the german corporate world , women have undeniably been more successful at breaking through the so-called glass ceiling when it comes to politics . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : female participation in politics has gradually risen over the years ever since conservative chancellor konrad adenauer reluctantly appointed the country 's first female minister , elisabeth schwarzhaupt -lrb- photo -rrb- , to his cabinet in 1961 . today , six out of 13 ministries in chancellor schröder ’ s government are led by women - a big leap from the two female ministers in former chancellor helmut kohl ’ s cabinet .
and women 's share in parliament currently hovers at 32 percent , up from a mere 9 percent in 1980 . the proportionately better representation of women in politics is attributed to a slew of laws and policies guaranteeing gender equality and equality of opportunity that were put in place in the 1980s and 1990s . the crucial quota bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast , center , will be co-chairing the leadership of the greens together with her male colleague , fritz kuhn but , most agree that it 's the " women 's quota , " first introduced by the green party in the 1980s with a strict 50 percent reservation of party seats and posts for women , that was the trigger for an explosive increase in the number of women politicians . " it 's been the most effective instrument to boost women 's participation in politics , better than all the equality legislation and confidence-boosting measures for women , " said husen . " thanks to it , men have no choice but to see to it that they recruit more women . " the center-left social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- followed suit in 1988 , committing itself to filling 40 percent of its posts with women while the center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- finally agreed in 1996 to include more women in its ranks , but remained noncommittal about the exact proportion . the old boys ' network the measures may have indeed led to more representation for women in politics , but many point out that it has n't really given women tangible influence or allowed them to penetrate the highest echelons of political power in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german president horst köhler , left with chancellor schröder one major reason , according to katja husen , is the fact that high-level german politics is still exclusively a boys ' club . " power structures in germany are very homogenous - they 're dominated by male academics and the rules of the game are thus set by men too , " said husen . " there 's no sense of bringing in diversity or encouraging people with different backgrounds - it 's a very german way of thinking . " in a recent article , germany 's leading feminist alice schwarzer likened chancellor schröder 's punch-drunk performance on the evening of the election - where he dismissed merkel 's claim to the chancellorship insisting he should carry on instead - to a matter of honor .
schwarzer said schröder was behaving like a tyrant and could n't bear the thought of losing out to a woman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " sixty years after hitler and 87 years after gaining the right for women to vote , the people may have elected her -lrb- merkel -rrb- , but the majority of the powerful are still far removed from conceding the highest office to a woman , " schwarzer -lrb- photo -rrb- wrote . lack of role models but macho attitudes are n't the only problem . claudia neusüss , a former executive director of the heinrich böll foundation , pointed out that a strong domestic image of women as taking responsibility for family and children that originated in west germany in the 1970s and 1980s still dominates the current political sphere to an extent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " though it 's all changing now , women too tend to think along those lines .
besides , juggling a career and family in germany is n't easy either , " she said . a lack of role models is a further hurdle to women aiming high in politics . though germany has seen three female presidents of the bundestag and a woman presiding over the constitutional court , the trend has stopped when it comes to leading the country , either in the role of president or chancellor , or even one of the two big political parties - until merkel , that is . " women have to develop their own rules of the game , they have to know what they want and learn to move away from typically ' soft ' topics such as health and education and take on the harder ones , " said neusüss . " merkel needs to do more " given the odds , angela merkel 's rise to the top - albeit facilitated by the cdu 's damaging party scandal that led to helmut kohl ’ s departure - has , most agree , sent an important signal to women aspiring for higher positions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with her team " the very fact that it 's possible for a woman from a conservative party to become chancellor is very progressive , " said neusüss , adding that merkel needed to do much more for women than the rather flimsy promises on family and equality in her party platform . " being a woman at the top is n't enough , " neusüss said . sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel and the female question with less than three weeks to go to the elections , germany is wondering what it will mean to have its first woman chancellor .

and women 's share in parliament currently hovers at 32 percent , up from a mere 9 percent in 1980 . the proportionately better representation of women in politics is attributed to a slew of laws and policies guaranteeing gender equality and equality of opportunity that were put in place in the 1980s and 1990s . the crucial quota bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renate künast , center , will be co-chairing the leadership of the greens together with her male colleague , fritz kuhn but , most agree that it 's the " women 's quota , " first introduced by the green party in the 1980s with a strict 50 percent reservation of party seats and posts for women , that was the trigger for an explosive increase in the number of women politicians .

18 , which produced a narrow three-seat advantage for merkel 's christian democrats over the social democrats which fell well short of what was required for a governing majority . yet the election could have a psychological impact on the intense negotiations to come before a new government is formed . although three seats are at stake , the christian democrats can at worst only lose one seat because of the complex german electoral system which is a mixture of the majority and proportional systems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , some believe that the delayed vote in dresden , two weeks after general elections in the rest of the country , may still speed up the process of forming a coalition - most likely a " grand coalition " between the spd and the conservatives . chancellor issue plagues talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder both still claim the chancellorship but a chief stumbling block is the insistence of both schröder and merkel that they should be chancellor .
schröder claims he still has a mandate for a third term as chancellor , but merkel said her alliance won the election and therefore she should govern . " the biggest political party in a coalition has the prerogative to put forward a chancellor , " merkel said in an interview with friday 's edition of the sächsische zeitung newspaper which covers the dresden area . merkel added that the negotiations to form a grand coalition - and the horse-trading of ministerial posts that involves - would only begin once a decision had been made on who will be chancellor . schröder however told the same newspaper that the chancellery issue should form part of the negotiations . " we can not say that the negotiations will only begin once we have made concessions , " he said . the social democrats meanwhile poured cold water on claims from the conservatives that schröder would stand aside after the voting in dresden . franz müntefering , the leader of the social democrats , said on thursday : " there is nothing in this .
our demand remains the same : we want to govern with gerhard schröder as chancellor . " calls for schröder to step down yet , guido westerwelle , the leader of the free-market liberal fdp , the conservatives ' real preferred coalition partner , said he " fully expected " that schröder would step aside following the dresden vote . " i assume that will be the occasion for schröder to make way , " westerwelle said . and michael glos , a leading member of the christian social union , the christian democrats ' sister party in bavaria , said he also expected schröder would step down on monday . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign media warm up to grand coalition most foreign media painted a bleak picture of germany 's prospects after the country 's inconclusive poll .

all eyes are now on angela merkel to see if she gains entry to the boys ’ club . the inconclusive poll on sept 18 which has plunged germany into political paralysis and triggered horse-trading between the main parties has overshadowed another aspect of the election that generated much excitement : whether europe ’ s largest economy will , for the first time in its postwar history , be led by a woman . the answer to that no longer seems clear after the conservatives ' disastrous election result and challenges to angela merkel 's claim to the chancellorship . but there 's no denying that merkel 's candidacy for the highest political post has been nothing short of historic in a country where the reins of power are overwhelmingly in the hands of men . katja husen , spokesperson for women 's issues at the green party pointed out that women in germany are persistently absent from top jobs . " the fact that we ’ ve never had a female chancellor before is one aspect .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 30.09.2005 opinion : eu-turkey project hardly realistic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey and the eu : two incompatible constellations ?
negotiations for turkey 's possible entry to the european union are rocky even before they have started .
deutsche welle 's baha güngör believes that the eu-turkey project does n't have a realistic chance . whether membership talks with turkey can begin , as planned , on monday will be decided at the last minute .
after ambassadors from the 25 member states failed to agree on a negotiating mandate at their meeting on thursday , eu foreign ministers now have to attend a special session in luxembourg on sunday , since unanimous approval is mandatory for the negotiations to start .
none of the 25 eu member states , not even cyprus , wants to be the spoilsport , which is why there will probably be a last minute agreement to go ahead with the negotiations .
but even if that 's the case , the eu-turkey project is hardly realistic .
anyone who still thinks that one day in the distant future , after 10 or 15 years of negotiations , turkey will become an eu member , is either naive or has no clue about the country 's inner workings .
turkey is a country on the periphery of europe and therefore , a country whose stability means much politically , economically , and in terms of security , to europe .
those who are sensible would want to include turkey in the continent 's integration process and to get ankara to pursue the values and visions of europe .
domestic politics at the center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's " non " to the eu constitution was for many a rejection of turkey yet before accession negotiations started , many eu countries turned the process into a self-serve buffet , looking to further their own national interests .
the election campaign in germany , as well as the french rejection of the eu constitution , which to a great deal was a rejection of turkey , reveal this clearly .
demands too high , too soon if the negotiations indeed start on monday , it will be less a question of whether they will ever successfully be brought to an end .
rather , the question will be when they can be deemed to have failed , or at least be interrupted for a few years .
grounds for failure wo n't be the eu 's regulations , the so-called " acquis communautaire . "
a lengthy transition period or permanent security clauses could be agreed .
turkey is by far the largest and most densely populated country that has ever attempted eu entry .
in many economic areas , it still lags far behind the eu average .
but for all of these problems , solutions could be found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern , turkish cypriots supported reunification of the island that 's been divided since 1974 but the eu is making a big mistake by demanding the maximum from turkey , i.e. recognizing cyprus or dealing with the armenian genocide , right at the start of the negotiations .
they 're playing their trump cards wrongly , creating resentment and hardening the country that could , and also has to , address such topics in the course of drawing closer to european values .
euphoria long gone turks ' enthusiasm for europe has , for the most part , disappeared .
the country 's nationalists are gaining in popularity and are reconquering territory it had lost before .
it 's no secret that in the next elections , expected in two years , turkish nationalism will experience a rebirth .
the feeling is growing among turks that the numerous reforms in the past and the strengthening of democratic forces in asia minor since the signing of the 1963 association agreement with the eu have all been for naught .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish flag and an image of the country 's founder , kemal atatürk it is a shame that the eu will have clumsily dropped its chance to achieve its goal of becoming a " global player " and its credibility in fostering dialogue between cultures and religions .
for turkey , it 's a shame that the country 's development into a democratic state will be threatened with large setbacks .
for when the eu and turkey start negotiations as planned , the participants will already be sapped of their strength .
they will be short of breath for the long road ahead - unless a miracle happens . baha güngör -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu turkey talks threatened eu foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting sunday to talk about membership talks with turkey after their ambassadors failed to reach an agreement on a negotiating mandate thursday .

anyone who still thinks that one day in the distant future , after 10 or 15 years of negotiations , turkey will become an eu member , is either naive or has no clue about the country 's inner workings .
turkey is a country on the periphery of europe and therefore , a country whose stability means much politically , economically , and in terms of security , to europe .
those who are sensible would want to include turkey in the continent 's integration process and to get ankara to pursue the values and visions of europe .
domestic politics at the center bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's " non " to the eu constitution was for many a rejection of turkey yet before accession negotiations started , many eu countries turned the process into a self-serve buffet , looking to further their own national interests .
the election campaign in germany , as well as the french rejection of the eu constitution , which to a great deal was a rejection of turkey , reveal this clearly .
demands too high , too soon if the negotiations indeed start on monday , it will be less a question of whether they will ever successfully be brought to an end .
rather , the question will be when they can be deemed to have failed , or at least be interrupted for a few years .
grounds for failure wo n't be the eu 's regulations , the so-called " acquis communautaire . "
a lengthy transition period or permanent security clauses could be agreed .
turkey is by far the largest and most densely populated country that has ever attempted eu entry .
in many economic areas , it still lags far behind the eu average .
but for all of these problems , solutions could be found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : northern , turkish cypriots supported reunification of the island that 's been divided since 1974 but the eu is making a big mistake by demanding the maximum from turkey , i.e. recognizing cyprus or dealing with the armenian genocide , right at the start of the negotiations .
they 're playing their trump cards wrongly , creating resentment and hardening the country that could , and also has to , address such topics in the course of drawing closer to european values .
euphoria long gone turks ' enthusiasm for europe has , for the most part , disappeared .
the country 's nationalists are gaining in popularity and are reconquering territory it had lost before .
it 's no secret that in the next elections , expected in two years , turkish nationalism will experience a rebirth .
the feeling is growing among turks that the numerous reforms in the past and the strengthening of democratic forces in asia minor since the signing of the 1963 association agreement with the eu have all been for naught .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a turkish flag and an image of the country 's founder , kemal atatürk it is a shame that the eu will have clumsily dropped its chance to achieve its goal of becoming a " global player " and its credibility in fostering dialogue between cultures and religions .
for turkey , it 's a shame that the country 's development into a democratic state will be threatened with large setbacks .
for when the eu and turkey start negotiations as planned , the participants will already be sapped of their strength .
they will be short of breath for the long road ahead - unless a miracle happens . baha güngör -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu turkey talks threatened eu foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting sunday to talk about membership talks with turkey after their ambassadors failed to reach an agreement on a negotiating mandate thursday .

the consequences for germany and the world are drought , floods and glacial melt . german film director roland emmerich filmed it with his big-budget natural catastrophe movie " the day after tomorrow . "
the united nations is seeking to slow it down with the kyoto protocol .
and photos of the alps from the early 20th century compared with 2005 show it clearly : global warming .
now , the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg has presented its most recent assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
according to its simulations , global warming is worse than once believed .
it 's an alarming announcement , considering how drastic earlier predictions were .
" our most recent results are more solid than before , " said jochem marotze , the institute 's director .
" we are convinced that they are dependable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising sea levels would wipe cities like new york from the map the results : earth 's temperature will rise on average up to four degrees celsius -lrb- 7.2 fahrenheit -rrb- by the year 2100 and sea levels will increase up to 30 centimeters -lrb- 11.8 inches -rrb- .
one scientist said that this rapid warming of the earth is the " strongest climate change in the last one million years . "
dry spells and floods become the norm the drought and insufferable heat that hit most of western europe , including germany , in 2003 will be a normal occurrence in 50 years .
averages of 30 degrees celsius will no longer be unusual in the june , july and august .
in the winter , instead of snow falling , rain will , and whenever it does so , then it will last longer and be heavier .
" weather situations in which extreme floods occur will increase , " said study leader erich roeckner .
floods like those in southern germany and austria this summer or the elbe flood in 2002 could happen regularly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will skiing become an indoor activity in europe ?
in addition , the mild temperature will mean the end of alpine glaciers by the end of this century .
they will melt away due to the higher temperatures , causing flooding at that time .
but rivers like the rhine , which depend on glacial melt , will turn into a trickle of their former strength .
but not only those living on river flood plains must worry .
due to predominantly westerly winds in the winter , residents along the north sea will encounter sea levels up 43 centimeters , over 40 percent above the average expected increase .
and where will polar bears go ?
over 1,000 scientists from around the world helped collect data for the most recent ipcc assessment report .
in 2007 , a final report will be presented to governments around the world .
the climatologists have reached a consensus on what lies behind the rapid pace of climate change .
" humans have had a large one-of-a-kind influence on the climate , " roeckner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polar bears wo n't be too happy with loss of their habitat foresters will have to adapt to the new climate by planting new varieties of trees .
the polar ice cap will shrink in size , and by 2100 , it is possible that the arctic will be ice free in the summer .
the annual melt of the arctic the past three years equaled 1.3 million square kilometers -lrb- 502,000 square miles -rrb- or four times that the area of germany .
the polar bear , dependent on ice floes to catch and kill its prey , will face more and more difficulties .

18 , which produced a narrow three-seat advantage for merkel 's christian democrats over the social democrats which fell well short of what was required for a governing majority . yet the election could have a psychological impact on the intense negotiations to come before a new government is formed . although three seats are at stake , the christian democrats can at worst only lose one seat because of the complex german electoral system which is a mixture of the majority and proportional systems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , some believe that the delayed vote in dresden , two weeks after general elections in the rest of the country , may still speed up the process of forming a coalition - most likely a " grand coalition " between the spd and the conservatives . chancellor issue plagues talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder both still claim the chancellorship but a chief stumbling block is the insistence of both schröder and merkel that they should be chancellor .
schröder claims he still has a mandate for a third term as chancellor , but merkel said her alliance won the election and therefore she should govern . " the biggest political party in a coalition has the prerogative to put forward a chancellor , " merkel said in an interview with friday 's edition of the sächsische zeitung newspaper which covers the dresden area . merkel added that the negotiations to form a grand coalition - and the horse-trading of ministerial posts that involves - would only begin once a decision had been made on who will be chancellor . schröder however told the same newspaper that the chancellery issue should form part of the negotiations . " we can not say that the negotiations will only begin once we have made concessions , " he said . the social democrats meanwhile poured cold water on claims from the conservatives that schröder would stand aside after the voting in dresden . franz müntefering , the leader of the social democrats , said on thursday : " there is nothing in this .
our demand remains the same : we want to govern with gerhard schröder as chancellor . " calls for schröder to step down yet , guido westerwelle , the leader of the free-market liberal fdp , the conservatives ' real preferred coalition partner , said he " fully expected " that schröder would step aside following the dresden vote . " i assume that will be the occasion for schröder to make way , " westerwelle said . and michael glos , a leading member of the christian social union , the christian democrats ' sister party in bavaria , said he also expected schröder would step down on monday . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign media warm up to grand coalition most foreign media painted a bleak picture of germany 's prospects after the country 's inconclusive poll .

18 , which produced a narrow three-seat advantage for merkel 's christian democrats over the social democrats which fell well short of what was required for a governing majority . yet the election could have a psychological impact on the intense negotiations to come before a new government is formed . although three seats are at stake , the christian democrats can at worst only lose one seat because of the complex german electoral system which is a mixture of the majority and proportional systems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , some believe that the delayed vote in dresden , two weeks after general elections in the rest of the country , may still speed up the process of forming a coalition - most likely a " grand coalition " between the spd and the conservatives . chancellor issue plagues talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder both still claim the chancellorship but a chief stumbling block is the insistence of both schröder and merkel that they should be chancellor .
schröder claims he still has a mandate for a third term as chancellor , but merkel said her alliance won the election and therefore she should govern . " the biggest political party in a coalition has the prerogative to put forward a chancellor , " merkel said in an interview with friday 's edition of the sächsische zeitung newspaper which covers the dresden area . merkel added that the negotiations to form a grand coalition - and the horse-trading of ministerial posts that involves - would only begin once a decision had been made on who will be chancellor . schröder however told the same newspaper that the chancellery issue should form part of the negotiations . " we can not say that the negotiations will only begin once we have made concessions , " he said . the social democrats meanwhile poured cold water on claims from the conservatives that schröder would stand aside after the voting in dresden . franz müntefering , the leader of the social democrats , said on thursday : " there is nothing in this .
our demand remains the same : we want to govern with gerhard schröder as chancellor . " calls for schröder to step down yet , guido westerwelle , the leader of the free-market liberal fdp , the conservatives ' real preferred coalition partner , said he " fully expected " that schröder would step aside following the dresden vote . " i assume that will be the occasion for schröder to make way , " westerwelle said . and michael glos , a leading member of the christian social union , the christian democrats ' sister party in bavaria , said he also expected schröder would step down on monday . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign media warm up to grand coalition most foreign media painted a bleak picture of germany 's prospects after the country 's inconclusive poll .

the consequences for germany and the world are drought , floods and glacial melt . german film director roland emmerich filmed it with his big-budget natural catastrophe movie " the day after tomorrow . "
the united nations is seeking to slow it down with the kyoto protocol .
and photos of the alps from the early 20th century compared with 2005 show it clearly : global warming .
now , the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg has presented its most recent assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
according to its simulations , global warming is worse than once believed .
it 's an alarming announcement , considering how drastic earlier predictions were .
" our most recent results are more solid than before , " said jochem marotze , the institute 's director .
" we are convinced that they are dependable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising sea levels would wipe cities like new york from the map the results : earth 's temperature will rise on average up to four degrees celsius -lrb- 7.2 fahrenheit -rrb- by the year 2100 and sea levels will increase up to 30 centimeters -lrb- 11.8 inches -rrb- .
one scientist said that this rapid warming of the earth is the " strongest climate change in the last one million years . "
dry spells and floods become the norm the drought and insufferable heat that hit most of western europe , including germany , in 2003 will be a normal occurrence in 50 years .
averages of 30 degrees celsius will no longer be unusual in the june , july and august .
in the winter , instead of snow falling , rain will , and whenever it does so , then it will last longer and be heavier .
" weather situations in which extreme floods occur will increase , " said study leader erich roeckner .
floods like those in southern germany and austria this summer or the elbe flood in 2002 could happen regularly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will skiing become an indoor activity in europe ?
in addition , the mild temperature will mean the end of alpine glaciers by the end of this century .
they will melt away due to the higher temperatures , causing flooding at that time .
but rivers like the rhine , which depend on glacial melt , will turn into a trickle of their former strength .
but not only those living on river flood plains must worry .
due to predominantly westerly winds in the winter , residents along the north sea will encounter sea levels up 43 centimeters , over 40 percent above the average expected increase .
and where will polar bears go ?
over 1,000 scientists from around the world helped collect data for the most recent ipcc assessment report .
in 2007 , a final report will be presented to governments around the world .
the climatologists have reached a consensus on what lies behind the rapid pace of climate change .
" humans have had a large one-of-a-kind influence on the climate , " roeckner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polar bears wo n't be too happy with loss of their habitat foresters will have to adapt to the new climate by planting new varieties of trees .
the polar ice cap will shrink in size , and by 2100 , it is possible that the arctic will be ice free in the summer .
the annual melt of the arctic the past three years equaled 1.3 million square kilometers -lrb- 502,000 square miles -rrb- or four times that the area of germany .
the polar bear , dependent on ice floes to catch and kill its prey , will face more and more difficulties .
" how are polar bears going to survive ? "
roger barry from the us national snow and ice data center -lrb- nsdic -rrb- asked . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un calls for reduced oil dependency as a conference on sustainable development begins in berlin , director of the un environment program klaus töpfer says katrina taught the world that it 's time for a new global energy policy .

6 , 2005 -rrb- the cost of environmental pollution germany may be an eco-friendly place , but support for the environment does come at a price - a fact that some organizations are trying to disprove .
but environmental groups themselves are n't so sure .
-lrb- aug .
4 , 2005 -rrb- kyoto takes effect but unep worries the head of the kenya-based un environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- warned wednesday that the effects of climate change may lead to earth " spinning out of control " and urged immediate steps to halt global warming .

the cutting edge of art in 2005 was showcased this autumn at berlin ‘ s hamburger bahnhof , one of the world 's finest contemporary art museums . the italian artist monica bonvicini -lrb- 40 -rrb- was this year ’ s winner of the nationalgalerie prize for young art 2005 , which is worth 50.000 euro and is as prestigious as london ’ s turner .
she was a clear favourite with the international jury that had to chose from a short list that included john bock , angela bulloch and anri sala .
bonvicini ‘ s award-winning work entitled " never again " was on show at an exhibition in the hamburger bahnhof alongside the works of the other three shortlisted artists .
it ’ s an installation with metal frames , leather hammocks and chains .
the members of the final jury , dan cameron -lrb- new museum of modern art , new york -rrb- , erika hoffmann-koenige -lrb- hoffmann collection , berlin -rrb- and dr. angela schneider -lrb- nationalgalerie , berlin -rrb- , praised bonvicini ’ s work because it is grounded in the socio-political fundamentals of society .
they were won over by the way bonvicini exposes the actions and vulnerability of our physical being in her sculptures and installations .
the audience prize went to the canadian artist angela bulloch for her haunting installation " the disenchanted forest " .
like all the other shortlisted artists she lives and works in berlin .
established in 2000 by the friends of the nationalgalerie , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the association that organised the hugely successful art events " moma in berlin " in 2004 and the goya exhibition in 2005 , the nationalgalerie prize for young art was awarded for the third time .
as media partner dw-tv produced short video profiles of all four artists , which were on show exclusively at the hamburger bahnhof exhibition .
you can find these portraits below as video-on-demand !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monica bonvicini monica bonvicini was born in venice , italy in 1965 .
since the mid 1980s she ’ s been living and working in berlin and challenging the art world from this base .
in her radical work she uses materials such as metal frames , leather mats , chains , studs and rivets – an intimidating collection of instruments for ... what exactly ?
builders use such things ; some people reputedly also use such equipment for erotic games .
bonvicini calls it a playground for adults with 12 love swings hanging in it , which she hopes people will use .
as always , provoking a reaction from her audience is an integral part of her work .
she also likes playing with our fears . her see-through toilet cabin at the art basel in 2004 was a typical bonvicini puzzle : reflecting glass walls ensured that the outside world could be seen from the inside , but no-one on the outside was able to look in .
playful , provocative and perplexing bonvicini ‘ s biting irony is sure to you stop in your tracks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela bulloch angela bulloch was born in 1966 in fort frances , canada .
she often works with large-scale light and sound installations .
in some of these , stacked illuminated boxes show only a single pixel of an image that has been enlarged beyond recognition .
bulloch unsettles us with her abstract codes and ciphers with which she explores the rules and norms of our societies and investigates our patterns of behaviour .
her trademark clear forms and cool aesthetics keep the viewer at a distance , but at the same time the viewers are often part of bullock ’ s installations – as their every move triggers a reaction in her interactive works .
bullock creates what she calls a kind of " hermetic art work " in which the experience of art is very physical .
challenging us to confront the boundaries of our perception bullock investigates how far electronic media has changed the way we see and how we look on the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anri sala anri sala was born 1974 in tirana , albania .
this video artist has always been a restless traveller in the world .
he ’ s always on the lookout for those seemingly unsignificant details of everyday life that he transforms into expressive " tableaux vivants " : a horse in darkness , fireworks , the colourful facades of tirana .
moments full of poetry , captured by sala and enhanced with light or shadow , sound or absolute silence .
in his hands moments that otherwise have passed unnoticed are turned into precious jewels .
anri sala is a melancholic poet – always searching for the spectacular in the unspectacular and not afraid of touching our emotions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john bock john bock was born in 1965 on the northern german coast . his distinguishing feature : wild hair on top of his head and wild ideas inside .
take the outlandish costumes he designs for his performances : enormous heads stuffed with cotton wool .
on one the eyelids have flaps with zippers , and out of them spill knitted arms that reach out endlessly .
using simple techniques such as sewing , carpentry and modelling john bock creates the strange trashy worlds for his comically absurd and enigmatic performances and installations .
his weird and wonderful work is in great demand and can be admired in major museums .
john bock has been invited to all the international biennials from sao paulo to venice , and even to the triennial in yokohama .
theatre of the absurd verging on dada , performed in a naively serious manner is a trademark of john bock , who happens to be a trained economist .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monica bonvicini monica bonvicini was born in venice , italy in 1965 .
since the mid 1980s she ’ s been living and working in berlin and challenging the art world from this base .
in her radical work she uses materials such as metal frames , leather mats , chains , studs and rivets – an intimidating collection of instruments for ... what exactly ?
builders use such things ; some people reputedly also use such equipment for erotic games .
bonvicini calls it a playground for adults with 12 love swings hanging in it , which she hopes people will use .
as always , provoking a reaction from her audience is an integral part of her work .
she also likes playing with our fears . her see-through toilet cabin at the art basel in 2004 was a typical bonvicini puzzle : reflecting glass walls ensured that the outside world could be seen from the inside , but no-one on the outside was able to look in .
playful , provocative and perplexing bonvicini ‘ s biting irony is sure to you stop in your tracks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela bulloch angela bulloch was born in 1966 in fort frances , canada .
she often works with large-scale light and sound installations .
in some of these , stacked illuminated boxes show only a single pixel of an image that has been enlarged beyond recognition .
bulloch unsettles us with her abstract codes and ciphers with which she explores the rules and norms of our societies and investigates our patterns of behaviour .
her trademark clear forms and cool aesthetics keep the viewer at a distance , but at the same time the viewers are often part of bullock ’ s installations – as their every move triggers a reaction in her interactive works .
bullock creates what she calls a kind of " hermetic art work " in which the experience of art is very physical .
challenging us to confront the boundaries of our perception bullock investigates how far electronic media has changed the way we see and how we look on the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anri sala anri sala was born 1974 in tirana , albania .
this video artist has always been a restless traveller in the world .
he ’ s always on the lookout for those seemingly unsignificant details of everyday life that he transforms into expressive " tableaux vivants " : a horse in darkness , fireworks , the colourful facades of tirana .
moments full of poetry , captured by sala and enhanced with light or shadow , sound or absolute silence .
in his hands moments that otherwise have passed unnoticed are turned into precious jewels .
anri sala is a melancholic poet – always searching for the spectacular in the unspectacular and not afraid of touching our emotions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john bock john bock was born in 1965 on the northern german coast . his distinguishing feature : wild hair on top of his head and wild ideas inside .
take the outlandish costumes he designs for his performances : enormous heads stuffed with cotton wool .
on one the eyelids have flaps with zippers , and out of them spill knitted arms that reach out endlessly .
using simple techniques such as sewing , carpentry and modelling john bock creates the strange trashy worlds for his comically absurd and enigmatic performances and installations .
his weird and wonderful work is in great demand and can be admired in major museums .
john bock has been invited to all the international biennials from sao paulo to venice , and even to the triennial in yokohama .
theatre of the absurd verging on dada , performed in a naively serious manner is a trademark of john bock , who happens to be a trained economist .

since the mid 1980s she ’ s been living and working in berlin and challenging the art world from this base .
in her radical work she uses materials such as metal frames , leather mats , chains , studs and rivets – an intimidating collection of instruments for ... what exactly ?
builders use such things ; some people reputedly also use such equipment for erotic games .
bonvicini calls it a playground for adults with 12 love swings hanging in it , which she hopes people will use .
as always , provoking a reaction from her audience is an integral part of her work .
she also likes playing with our fears . her see-through toilet cabin at the art basel in 2004 was a typical bonvicini puzzle : reflecting glass walls ensured that the outside world could be seen from the inside , but no-one on the outside was able to look in .
playful , provocative and perplexing bonvicini ‘ s biting irony is sure to you stop in your tracks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela bulloch angela bulloch was born in 1966 in fort frances , canada .
she often works with large-scale light and sound installations .
in some of these , stacked illuminated boxes show only a single pixel of an image that has been enlarged beyond recognition .
bulloch unsettles us with her abstract codes and ciphers with which she explores the rules and norms of our societies and investigates our patterns of behaviour .
her trademark clear forms and cool aesthetics keep the viewer at a distance , but at the same time the viewers are often part of bullock ’ s installations – as their every move triggers a reaction in her interactive works .
bullock creates what she calls a kind of " hermetic art work " in which the experience of art is very physical .
challenging us to confront the boundaries of our perception bullock investigates how far electronic media has changed the way we see and how we look on the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anri sala anri sala was born 1974 in tirana , albania .
this video artist has always been a restless traveller in the world .
he ’ s always on the lookout for those seemingly unsignificant details of everyday life that he transforms into expressive " tableaux vivants " : a horse in darkness , fireworks , the colourful facades of tirana .
moments full of poetry , captured by sala and enhanced with light or shadow , sound or absolute silence .
in his hands moments that otherwise have passed unnoticed are turned into precious jewels .
anri sala is a melancholic poet – always searching for the spectacular in the unspectacular and not afraid of touching our emotions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john bock john bock was born in 1965 on the northern german coast . his distinguishing feature : wild hair on top of his head and wild ideas inside .
take the outlandish costumes he designs for his performances : enormous heads stuffed with cotton wool .
on one the eyelids have flaps with zippers , and out of them spill knitted arms that reach out endlessly .
using simple techniques such as sewing , carpentry and modelling john bock creates the strange trashy worlds for his comically absurd and enigmatic performances and installations .
his weird and wonderful work is in great demand and can be admired in major museums .
john bock has been invited to all the international biennials from sao paulo to venice , and even to the triennial in yokohama .
theatre of the absurd verging on dada , performed in a naively serious manner is a trademark of john bock , who happens to be a trained economist .

the cutting edge of art in 2005 was showcased this autumn at berlin ‘ s hamburger bahnhof , one of the world 's finest contemporary art museums . the italian artist monica bonvicini -lrb- 40 -rrb- was this year ’ s winner of the nationalgalerie prize for young art 2005 , which is worth 50.000 euro and is as prestigious as london ’ s turner .
she was a clear favourite with the international jury that had to chose from a short list that included john bock , angela bulloch and anri sala .
bonvicini ‘ s award-winning work entitled " never again " was on show at an exhibition in the hamburger bahnhof alongside the works of the other three shortlisted artists .
it ’ s an installation with metal frames , leather hammocks and chains .
the members of the final jury , dan cameron -lrb- new museum of modern art , new york -rrb- , erika hoffmann-koenige -lrb- hoffmann collection , berlin -rrb- and dr. angela schneider -lrb- nationalgalerie , berlin -rrb- , praised bonvicini ’ s work because it is grounded in the socio-political fundamentals of society .
they were won over by the way bonvicini exposes the actions and vulnerability of our physical being in her sculptures and installations .
the audience prize went to the canadian artist angela bulloch for her haunting installation " the disenchanted forest " .
like all the other shortlisted artists she lives and works in berlin .
established in 2000 by the friends of the nationalgalerie , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the association that organised the hugely successful art events " moma in berlin " in 2004 and the goya exhibition in 2005 , the nationalgalerie prize for young art was awarded for the third time .
as media partner dw-tv produced short video profiles of all four artists , which were on show exclusively at the hamburger bahnhof exhibition .
you can find these portraits below as video-on-demand !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monica bonvicini monica bonvicini was born in venice , italy in 1965 .
since the mid 1980s she ’ s been living and working in berlin and challenging the art world from this base .
in her radical work she uses materials such as metal frames , leather mats , chains , studs and rivets – an intimidating collection of instruments for ... what exactly ?
builders use such things ; some people reputedly also use such equipment for erotic games .
bonvicini calls it a playground for adults with 12 love swings hanging in it , which she hopes people will use .
as always , provoking a reaction from her audience is an integral part of her work .
she also likes playing with our fears . her see-through toilet cabin at the art basel in 2004 was a typical bonvicini puzzle : reflecting glass walls ensured that the outside world could be seen from the inside , but no-one on the outside was able to look in .

according to its simulations , global warming is worse than once believed .

18 , which produced a narrow three-seat advantage for merkel 's christian democrats over the social democrats which fell well short of what was required for a governing majority . yet the election could have a psychological impact on the intense negotiations to come before a new government is formed . although three seats are at stake , the christian democrats can at worst only lose one seat because of the complex german electoral system which is a mixture of the majority and proportional systems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , some believe that the delayed vote in dresden , two weeks after general elections in the rest of the country , may still speed up the process of forming a coalition - most likely a " grand coalition " between the spd and the conservatives . chancellor issue plagues talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder both still claim the chancellorship but a chief stumbling block is the insistence of both schröder and merkel that they should be chancellor .
schröder claims he still has a mandate for a third term as chancellor , but merkel said her alliance won the election and therefore she should govern . " the biggest political party in a coalition has the prerogative to put forward a chancellor , " merkel said in an interview with friday 's edition of the sächsische zeitung newspaper which covers the dresden area . merkel added that the negotiations to form a grand coalition - and the horse-trading of ministerial posts that involves - would only begin once a decision had been made on who will be chancellor . schröder however told the same newspaper that the chancellery issue should form part of the negotiations . " we can not say that the negotiations will only begin once we have made concessions , " he said . the social democrats meanwhile poured cold water on claims from the conservatives that schröder would stand aside after the voting in dresden . franz müntefering , the leader of the social democrats , said on thursday : " there is nothing in this .
our demand remains the same : we want to govern with gerhard schröder as chancellor . " calls for schröder to step down yet , guido westerwelle , the leader of the free-market liberal fdp , the conservatives ' real preferred coalition partner , said he " fully expected " that schröder would step aside following the dresden vote . " i assume that will be the occasion for schröder to make way , " westerwelle said . and michael glos , a leading member of the christian social union , the christian democrats ' sister party in bavaria , said he also expected schröder would step down on monday . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign media warm up to grand coalition most foreign media painted a bleak picture of germany 's prospects after the country 's inconclusive poll .

the consequences for germany and the world are drought , floods and glacial melt . german film director roland emmerich filmed it with his big-budget natural catastrophe movie " the day after tomorrow . "
the united nations is seeking to slow it down with the kyoto protocol .
and photos of the alps from the early 20th century compared with 2005 show it clearly : global warming .
now , the max planck institute for meteorology in hamburg has presented its most recent assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- .
according to its simulations , global warming is worse than once believed .
it 's an alarming announcement , considering how drastic earlier predictions were .
" our most recent results are more solid than before , " said jochem marotze , the institute 's director .
" we are convinced that they are dependable . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rising sea levels would wipe cities like new york from the map the results : earth 's temperature will rise on average up to four degrees celsius -lrb- 7.2 fahrenheit -rrb- by the year 2100 and sea levels will increase up to 30 centimeters -lrb- 11.8 inches -rrb- .
one scientist said that this rapid warming of the earth is the " strongest climate change in the last one million years . "
dry spells and floods become the norm the drought and insufferable heat that hit most of western europe , including germany , in 2003 will be a normal occurrence in 50 years .
averages of 30 degrees celsius will no longer be unusual in the june , july and august .
in the winter , instead of snow falling , rain will , and whenever it does so , then it will last longer and be heavier .
" weather situations in which extreme floods occur will increase , " said study leader erich roeckner .
floods like those in southern germany and austria this summer or the elbe flood in 2002 could happen regularly .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will skiing become an indoor activity in europe ?
in addition , the mild temperature will mean the end of alpine glaciers by the end of this century .
they will melt away due to the higher temperatures , causing flooding at that time .
but rivers like the rhine , which depend on glacial melt , will turn into a trickle of their former strength .
but not only those living on river flood plains must worry .
due to predominantly westerly winds in the winter , residents along the north sea will encounter sea levels up 43 centimeters , over 40 percent above the average expected increase .
and where will polar bears go ?
over 1,000 scientists from around the world helped collect data for the most recent ipcc assessment report .
in 2007 , a final report will be presented to governments around the world .

but who gets the credit ?
two top stylists have rival claims to this cinderella story . in politics , image is everything .
and in the run-up to the sept .
18 general election , even the famously non-flamboyant conservative leader angela merkel took this message to heart , trading in her wash ' n ' go pudding bowl hairstyle for a softer , more stylish look .
flattering make-up and the addition of brighter , more fitted suits to her wardrobe completed merkel 's transformation from " kohl 's girl " to " angie . " but merkel did n't do it alone .
the question is , which top german stylist should take the credit for her makeover ?
martina acht , a hairdresser whose salon is in the western city of offenbach , told reuters that her influence was decisive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transformation was already pronounced when merkel met with us president george w. bush " she came to me for advice just before -lrb- us president -rrb- george w. bush came to germany -lrb- in february -rrb- and ever since then , her look has been completely different , " acht said . " since then , she seems so much more feminine , " she added . but celebrity hairdresser udo walz , whose swanky berlin salon is frequented by models and politicians alike , begs to differ .
walz said that he has been working on merkel 's hair for a long time and that she has an appointment with him every four weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrity hairdresser udo walz -lrb- right -rrb- , pictured here with talkshow host sabine christiansen , says merkel is his client " martina acht might have used a blow-dryer on my client 's hair , but she did not cut it , " walz said , laying down the gauntlet in a battle of the scissors that has gleefully been picked up by the german tabloids .
" there are always people around who want to jump on the bandwagon . " walz is also closely acquainted with the hair of the man currently battling merkel for the office of chancellor - incumbent gerhard schröder .
in a 2002 court challenge against a german news agency that said schröder dyed his hair black , walz played the role of key witness .
he testified that , despite his youthful appearance , the 61-year-old schröder does have some grey hairs , but that they are only visible at close range . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de rolling stones no fans of " angie " how rock n ' roll is angela merkel ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 30.09.2005 signs of change at mercedes , vw großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mercedes and vw are bringing movement into the auto industry the brands mercedes and volkswagen are known around the world , but their fame remains in the past - for now .
the automobile companies are examples of improvements taking place in germany 's most important industry . the pictures are easy to compare as new managers take the wheel at volkswagen and mercedes .
mercedes ' dieter zetsche and volkswagen 's wolfgang bernhard both presented their new models with smiling faces at this month 's frankfurt international motor show , but soon after both men dropped the happy faces they showed the press . as mercedes this week announced it would cut 8,500 jobs in germany , and volkswagen employees in a german plant agreed to work for less to keep production of a new sport utility vehicle from moving to portugal , both managers claimed they were just getting started with their work of putting their companies back in order . transforming germany 's car industry bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : job cuts followed the auto show shine at mercedes the two car manufacturers even discussed investing in each other as a protection against hostile takeovers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 30.09.2005 german poll reaches finale in dresden großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : making their final push : schröder and merkel german chancellor schröder and his conservative rival merkel are back on the campaign trail friday ahead of a delayed vote in dresden on the weekend which will complete the inconclusive general election . around 220,000 voters will go to the polls on sunday to cast their votes and decide the final seats in the bundestag or lower house of parliament . voting in dresden was delayed for two weeks by the death of a neo-nazi candidate during the election campaign . both german chancellor gerhard schröder and his conservative challenger , angela merkel hit the campaign trail in the eastern city , south of berlin , on friday . merkel is set to address supporters along with dresden 's premier georg milbradt in the city 's old quarter , while schröder will rally supporters together with leader of the social democrats ' franz müntefering in a beer garden on the banks of the river elbe . dresden wo n't tip the balance yet sunday 's results will not change the overall picture from the general election on sept .
18 , which produced a narrow three-seat advantage for merkel 's christian democrats over the social democrats which fell well short of what was required for a governing majority . yet the election could have a psychological impact on the intense negotiations to come before a new government is formed . although three seats are at stake , the christian democrats can at worst only lose one seat because of the complex german electoral system which is a mixture of the majority and proportional systems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , some believe that the delayed vote in dresden , two weeks after general elections in the rest of the country , may still speed up the process of forming a coalition - most likely a " grand coalition " between the spd and the conservatives . chancellor issue plagues talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder both still claim the chancellorship but a chief stumbling block is the insistence of both schröder and merkel that they should be chancellor .
schröder claims he still has a mandate for a third term as chancellor , but merkel said her alliance won the election and therefore she should govern . " the biggest political party in a coalition has the prerogative to put forward a chancellor , " merkel said in an interview with friday 's edition of the sächsische zeitung newspaper which covers the dresden area . merkel added that the negotiations to form a grand coalition - and the horse-trading of ministerial posts that involves - would only begin once a decision had been made on who will be chancellor . schröder however told the same newspaper that the chancellery issue should form part of the negotiations . " we can not say that the negotiations will only begin once we have made concessions , " he said . the social democrats meanwhile poured cold water on claims from the conservatives that schröder would stand aside after the voting in dresden . franz müntefering , the leader of the social democrats , said on thursday : " there is nothing in this .
our demand remains the same : we want to govern with gerhard schröder as chancellor . " calls for schröder to step down yet , guido westerwelle , the leader of the free-market liberal fdp , the conservatives ' real preferred coalition partner , said he " fully expected " that schröder would step aside following the dresden vote . " i assume that will be the occasion for schröder to make way , " westerwelle said . and michael glos , a leading member of the christian social union , the christian democrats ' sister party in bavaria , said he also expected schröder would step down on monday . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign media warm up to grand coalition most foreign media painted a bleak picture of germany 's prospects after the country 's inconclusive poll .

the monument is made up of segments of the original wall , erected along the former borderline which separated communist east from capitalist west berlin between 1961 and 1989 .
berlin artist ben wargin has painted each segment with a series of super-imposed numbers , representing a year and the number of people killed trying to cross the border from the east .
among those gathered for the unveiling of the monument at marie-elisabeth-lüders house , the parliamentary library , was the bundestag 's outgoing speaker wolfgang thierse .
parts of the berlin wall can still be found in the german capital which has seen several monuments , notably at bernauer street , spring up since the wall was demolished in 1989 as the communist regime of east germany was toppled . dw-world.de wall memorial razed in berlin a controversial memorial to honor people who died while trying to flee the former east germany by crossing the berlin wall was demolished early monday despite fears that the action could harm the city 's image .

18 , which produced a narrow three-seat advantage for merkel 's christian democrats over the social democrats which fell well short of what was required for a governing majority . yet the election could have a psychological impact on the intense negotiations to come before a new government is formed . although three seats are at stake , the christian democrats can at worst only lose one seat because of the complex german electoral system which is a mixture of the majority and proportional systems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , some believe that the delayed vote in dresden , two weeks after general elections in the rest of the country , may still speed up the process of forming a coalition - most likely a " grand coalition " between the spd and the conservatives . chancellor issue plagues talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and schröder both still claim the chancellorship but a chief stumbling block is the insistence of both schröder and merkel that they should be chancellor .
schröder claims he still has a mandate for a third term as chancellor , but merkel said her alliance won the election and therefore she should govern . " the biggest political party in a coalition has the prerogative to put forward a chancellor , " merkel said in an interview with friday 's edition of the sächsische zeitung newspaper which covers the dresden area . merkel added that the negotiations to form a grand coalition - and the horse-trading of ministerial posts that involves - would only begin once a decision had been made on who will be chancellor . schröder however told the same newspaper that the chancellery issue should form part of the negotiations . " we can not say that the negotiations will only begin once we have made concessions , " he said . the social democrats meanwhile poured cold water on claims from the conservatives that schröder would stand aside after the voting in dresden . franz müntefering , the leader of the social democrats , said on thursday : " there is nothing in this .
our demand remains the same : we want to govern with gerhard schröder as chancellor . " calls for schröder to step down yet , guido westerwelle , the leader of the free-market liberal fdp , the conservatives ' real preferred coalition partner , said he " fully expected " that schröder would step aside following the dresden vote . " i assume that will be the occasion for schröder to make way , " westerwelle said . and michael glos , a leading member of the christian social union , the christian democrats ' sister party in bavaria , said he also expected schröder would step down on monday . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de foreign media warm up to grand coalition most foreign media painted a bleak picture of germany 's prospects after the country 's inconclusive poll .

program guide programs arts.21 video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de home / dw-tv asia + : arts.21 arts.21 -pipe- 30.09.2005 spectacular and edgy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nationalgalerie prize for young art : four candidates , four works of art .
the cutting edge of art in 2005 was showcased this autumn at berlin ‘ s hamburger bahnhof , one of the world 's finest contemporary art museums . the italian artist monica bonvicini -lrb- 40 -rrb- was this year ’ s winner of the nationalgalerie prize for young art 2005 , which is worth 50.000 euro and is as prestigious as london ’ s turner .
she was a clear favourite with the international jury that had to chose from a short list that included john bock , angela bulloch and anri sala .
bonvicini ‘ s award-winning work entitled " never again " was on show at an exhibition in the hamburger bahnhof alongside the works of the other three shortlisted artists .
it ’ s an installation with metal frames , leather hammocks and chains .
the members of the final jury , dan cameron -lrb- new museum of modern art , new york -rrb- , erika hoffmann-koenige -lrb- hoffmann collection , berlin -rrb- and dr. angela schneider -lrb- nationalgalerie , berlin -rrb- , praised bonvicini ’ s work because it is grounded in the socio-political fundamentals of society .
they were won over by the way bonvicini exposes the actions and vulnerability of our physical being in her sculptures and installations .
the audience prize went to the canadian artist angela bulloch for her haunting installation " the disenchanted forest " .
like all the other shortlisted artists she lives and works in berlin .
established in 2000 by the friends of the nationalgalerie , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the association that organised the hugely successful art events " moma in berlin " in 2004 and the goya exhibition in 2005 , the nationalgalerie prize for young art was awarded for the third time .
as media partner dw-tv produced short video profiles of all four artists , which were on show exclusively at the hamburger bahnhof exhibition .
you can find these portraits below as video-on-demand !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monica bonvicini monica bonvicini was born in venice , italy in 1965 .
since the mid 1980s she ’ s been living and working in berlin and challenging the art world from this base .
in her radical work she uses materials such as metal frames , leather mats , chains , studs and rivets – an intimidating collection of instruments for ... what exactly ?
builders use such things ; some people reputedly also use such equipment for erotic games .
bonvicini calls it a playground for adults with 12 love swings hanging in it , which she hopes people will use .
as always , provoking a reaction from her audience is an integral part of her work .
she also likes playing with our fears . her see-through toilet cabin at the art basel in 2004 was a typical bonvicini puzzle : reflecting glass walls ensured that the outside world could be seen from the inside , but no-one on the outside was able to look in .
playful , provocative and perplexing bonvicini ‘ s biting irony is sure to you stop in your tracks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela bulloch angela bulloch was born in 1966 in fort frances , canada .
she often works with large-scale light and sound installations .
in some of these , stacked illuminated boxes show only a single pixel of an image that has been enlarged beyond recognition .
bulloch unsettles us with her abstract codes and ciphers with which she explores the rules and norms of our societies and investigates our patterns of behaviour .
her trademark clear forms and cool aesthetics keep the viewer at a distance , but at the same time the viewers are often part of bullock ’ s installations – as their every move triggers a reaction in her interactive works .
bullock creates what she calls a kind of " hermetic art work " in which the experience of art is very physical .
challenging us to confront the boundaries of our perception bullock investigates how far electronic media has changed the way we see and how we look on the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anri sala anri sala was born 1974 in tirana , albania .
this video artist has always been a restless traveller in the world .
he ’ s always on the lookout for those seemingly unsignificant details of everyday life that he transforms into expressive " tableaux vivants " : a horse in darkness , fireworks , the colourful facades of tirana .
moments full of poetry , captured by sala and enhanced with light or shadow , sound or absolute silence .

the cutting edge of art in 2005 was showcased this autumn at berlin ‘ s hamburger bahnhof , one of the world 's finest contemporary art museums . the italian artist monica bonvicini -lrb- 40 -rrb- was this year ’ s winner of the nationalgalerie prize for young art 2005 , which is worth 50.000 euro and is as prestigious as london ’ s turner .
she was a clear favourite with the international jury that had to chose from a short list that included john bock , angela bulloch and anri sala .
bonvicini ‘ s award-winning work entitled " never again " was on show at an exhibition in the hamburger bahnhof alongside the works of the other three shortlisted artists .
it ’ s an installation with metal frames , leather hammocks and chains .
the members of the final jury , dan cameron -lrb- new museum of modern art , new york -rrb- , erika hoffmann-koenige -lrb- hoffmann collection , berlin -rrb- and dr. angela schneider -lrb- nationalgalerie , berlin -rrb- , praised bonvicini ’ s work because it is grounded in the socio-political fundamentals of society .
they were won over by the way bonvicini exposes the actions and vulnerability of our physical being in her sculptures and installations .
the audience prize went to the canadian artist angela bulloch for her haunting installation " the disenchanted forest " .
like all the other shortlisted artists she lives and works in berlin .
established in 2000 by the friends of the nationalgalerie , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the association that organised the hugely successful art events " moma in berlin " in 2004 and the goya exhibition in 2005 , the nationalgalerie prize for young art was awarded for the third time .
as media partner dw-tv produced short video profiles of all four artists , which were on show exclusively at the hamburger bahnhof exhibition .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monica bonvicini monica bonvicini was born in venice , italy in 1965 .
since the mid 1980s she ’ s been living and working in berlin and challenging the art world from this base .
in her radical work she uses materials such as metal frames , leather mats , chains , studs and rivets – an intimidating collection of instruments for ... what exactly ?
builders use such things ; some people reputedly also use such equipment for erotic games .
bonvicini calls it a playground for adults with 12 love swings hanging in it , which she hopes people will use .
as always , provoking a reaction from her audience is an integral part of her work .
she also likes playing with our fears . her see-through toilet cabin at the art basel in 2004 was a typical bonvicini puzzle : reflecting glass walls ensured that the outside world could be seen from the inside , but no-one on the outside was able to look in .
playful , provocative and perplexing bonvicini ‘ s biting irony is sure to you stop in your tracks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela bulloch angela bulloch was born in 1966 in fort frances , canada .
she often works with large-scale light and sound installations .
in some of these , stacked illuminated boxes show only a single pixel of an image that has been enlarged beyond recognition .
bulloch unsettles us with her abstract codes and ciphers with which she explores the rules and norms of our societies and investigates our patterns of behaviour .
her trademark clear forms and cool aesthetics keep the viewer at a distance , but at the same time the viewers are often part of bullock ’ s installations – as their every move triggers a reaction in her interactive works .
bullock creates what she calls a kind of " hermetic art work " in which the experience of art is very physical .
challenging us to confront the boundaries of our perception bullock investigates how far electronic media has changed the way we see and how we look on the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anri sala anri sala was born 1974 in tirana , albania .
this video artist has always been a restless traveller in the world .
he ’ s always on the lookout for those seemingly unsignificant details of everyday life that he transforms into expressive " tableaux vivants " : a horse in darkness , fireworks , the colourful facades of tirana .
moments full of poetry , captured by sala and enhanced with light or shadow , sound or absolute silence .
in his hands moments that otherwise have passed unnoticed are turned into precious jewels .
anri sala is a melancholic poet – always searching for the spectacular in the unspectacular and not afraid of touching our emotions .

the cutting edge of art in 2005 was showcased this autumn at berlin ‘ s hamburger bahnhof , one of the world 's finest contemporary art museums . the italian artist monica bonvicini -lrb- 40 -rrb- was this year ’ s winner of the nationalgalerie prize for young art 2005 , which is worth 50.000 euro and is as prestigious as london ’ s turner .
she was a clear favourite with the international jury that had to chose from a short list that included john bock , angela bulloch and anri sala .
bonvicini ‘ s award-winning work entitled " never again " was on show at an exhibition in the hamburger bahnhof alongside the works of the other three shortlisted artists .
it ’ s an installation with metal frames , leather hammocks and chains .
the members of the final jury , dan cameron -lrb- new museum of modern art , new york -rrb- , erika hoffmann-koenige -lrb- hoffmann collection , berlin -rrb- and dr. angela schneider -lrb- nationalgalerie , berlin -rrb- , praised bonvicini ’ s work because it is grounded in the socio-political fundamentals of society .
they were won over by the way bonvicini exposes the actions and vulnerability of our physical being in her sculptures and installations .
the audience prize went to the canadian artist angela bulloch for her haunting installation " the disenchanted forest " .
like all the other shortlisted artists she lives and works in berlin .
established in 2000 by the friends of the nationalgalerie , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the association that organised the hugely successful art events " moma in berlin " in 2004 and the goya exhibition in 2005 , the nationalgalerie prize for young art was awarded for the third time .
as media partner dw-tv produced short video profiles of all four artists , which were on show exclusively at the hamburger bahnhof exhibition .
you can find these portraits below as video-on-demand !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monica bonvicini monica bonvicini was born in venice , italy in 1965 .
since the mid 1980s she ’ s been living and working in berlin and challenging the art world from this base .
in her radical work she uses materials such as metal frames , leather mats , chains , studs and rivets – an intimidating collection of instruments for ... what exactly ?
builders use such things ; some people reputedly also use such equipment for erotic games .
bonvicini calls it a playground for adults with 12 love swings hanging in it , which she hopes people will use .
as always , provoking a reaction from her audience is an integral part of her work .
she also likes playing with our fears . her see-through toilet cabin at the art basel in 2004 was a typical bonvicini puzzle : reflecting glass walls ensured that the outside world could be seen from the inside , but no-one on the outside was able to look in .
playful , provocative and perplexing bonvicini ‘ s biting irony is sure to you stop in your tracks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela bulloch angela bulloch was born in 1966 in fort frances , canada .
she often works with large-scale light and sound installations .
in some of these , stacked illuminated boxes show only a single pixel of an image that has been enlarged beyond recognition .
bulloch unsettles us with her abstract codes and ciphers with which she explores the rules and norms of our societies and investigates our patterns of behaviour .
her trademark clear forms and cool aesthetics keep the viewer at a distance , but at the same time the viewers are often part of bullock ’ s installations – as their every move triggers a reaction in her interactive works .
bullock creates what she calls a kind of " hermetic art work " in which the experience of art is very physical .
challenging us to confront the boundaries of our perception bullock investigates how far electronic media has changed the way we see and how we look on the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anri sala anri sala was born 1974 in tirana , albania .
this video artist has always been a restless traveller in the world .
he ’ s always on the lookout for those seemingly unsignificant details of everyday life that he transforms into expressive " tableaux vivants " : a horse in darkness , fireworks , the colourful facades of tirana .
moments full of poetry , captured by sala and enhanced with light or shadow , sound or absolute silence .
in his hands moments that otherwise have passed unnoticed are turned into precious jewels .
anri sala is a melancholic poet – always searching for the spectacular in the unspectacular and not afraid of touching our emotions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john bock john bock was born in 1965 on the northern german coast . his distinguishing feature : wild hair on top of his head and wild ideas inside .
take the outlandish costumes he designs for his performances : enormous heads stuffed with cotton wool .
on one the eyelids have flaps with zippers , and out of them spill knitted arms that reach out endlessly .
using simple techniques such as sewing , carpentry and modelling john bock creates the strange trashy worlds for his comically absurd and enigmatic performances and installations .
his weird and wonderful work is in great demand and can be admired in major museums .
john bock has been invited to all the international biennials from sao paulo to venice , and even to the triennial in yokohama .

the cutting edge of art in 2005 was showcased this autumn at berlin ‘ s hamburger bahnhof , one of the world 's finest contemporary art museums . the italian artist monica bonvicini -lrb- 40 -rrb- was this year ’ s winner of the nationalgalerie prize for young art 2005 , which is worth 50.000 euro and is as prestigious as london ’ s turner .
she was a clear favourite with the international jury that had to chose from a short list that included john bock , angela bulloch and anri sala .
bonvicini ‘ s award-winning work entitled " never again " was on show at an exhibition in the hamburger bahnhof alongside the works of the other three shortlisted artists .
it ’ s an installation with metal frames , leather hammocks and chains .
the members of the final jury , dan cameron -lrb- new museum of modern art , new york -rrb- , erika hoffmann-koenige -lrb- hoffmann collection , berlin -rrb- and dr. angela schneider -lrb- nationalgalerie , berlin -rrb- , praised bonvicini ’ s work because it is grounded in the socio-political fundamentals of society .
they were won over by the way bonvicini exposes the actions and vulnerability of our physical being in her sculptures and installations .
the audience prize went to the canadian artist angela bulloch for her haunting installation " the disenchanted forest " .
like all the other shortlisted artists she lives and works in berlin .
established in 2000 by the friends of the nationalgalerie , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the association that organised the hugely successful art events " moma in berlin " in 2004 and the goya exhibition in 2005 , the nationalgalerie prize for young art was awarded for the third time .
as media partner dw-tv produced short video profiles of all four artists , which were on show exclusively at the hamburger bahnhof exhibition .
you can find these portraits below as video-on-demand !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monica bonvicini monica bonvicini was born in venice , italy in 1965 .
since the mid 1980s she ’ s been living and working in berlin and challenging the art world from this base .
in her radical work she uses materials such as metal frames , leather mats , chains , studs and rivets – an intimidating collection of instruments for ... what exactly ?
builders use such things ; some people reputedly also use such equipment for erotic games .
bonvicini calls it a playground for adults with 12 love swings hanging in it , which she hopes people will use .
as always , provoking a reaction from her audience is an integral part of her work .
she also likes playing with our fears . her see-through toilet cabin at the art basel in 2004 was a typical bonvicini puzzle : reflecting glass walls ensured that the outside world could be seen from the inside , but no-one on the outside was able to look in .
playful , provocative and perplexing bonvicini ‘ s biting irony is sure to you stop in your tracks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela bulloch angela bulloch was born in 1966 in fort frances , canada .
she often works with large-scale light and sound installations .
in some of these , stacked illuminated boxes show only a single pixel of an image that has been enlarged beyond recognition .
bulloch unsettles us with her abstract codes and ciphers with which she explores the rules and norms of our societies and investigates our patterns of behaviour .
her trademark clear forms and cool aesthetics keep the viewer at a distance , but at the same time the viewers are often part of bullock ’ s installations – as their every move triggers a reaction in her interactive works .
bullock creates what she calls a kind of " hermetic art work " in which the experience of art is very physical .
challenging us to confront the boundaries of our perception bullock investigates how far electronic media has changed the way we see and how we look on the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anri sala anri sala was born 1974 in tirana , albania .
this video artist has always been a restless traveller in the world .
he ’ s always on the lookout for those seemingly unsignificant details of everyday life that he transforms into expressive " tableaux vivants " : a horse in darkness , fireworks , the colourful facades of tirana .
moments full of poetry , captured by sala and enhanced with light or shadow , sound or absolute silence .
in his hands moments that otherwise have passed unnoticed are turned into precious jewels .
anri sala is a melancholic poet – always searching for the spectacular in the unspectacular and not afraid of touching our emotions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john bock john bock was born in 1965 on the northern german coast . his distinguishing feature : wild hair on top of his head and wild ideas inside .
take the outlandish costumes he designs for his performances : enormous heads stuffed with cotton wool .
on one the eyelids have flaps with zippers , and out of them spill knitted arms that reach out endlessly .
using simple techniques such as sewing , carpentry and modelling john bock creates the strange trashy worlds for his comically absurd and enigmatic performances and installations .
his weird and wonderful work is in great demand and can be admired in major museums .

the cutting edge of art in 2005 was showcased this autumn at berlin ‘ s hamburger bahnhof , one of the world 's finest contemporary art museums . the italian artist monica bonvicini -lrb- 40 -rrb- was this year ’ s winner of the nationalgalerie prize for young art 2005 , which is worth 50.000 euro and is as prestigious as london ’ s turner .
she was a clear favourite with the international jury that had to chose from a short list that included john bock , angela bulloch and anri sala .
bonvicini ‘ s award-winning work entitled " never again " was on show at an exhibition in the hamburger bahnhof alongside the works of the other three shortlisted artists .
it ’ s an installation with metal frames , leather hammocks and chains .
the members of the final jury , dan cameron -lrb- new museum of modern art , new york -rrb- , erika hoffmann-koenige -lrb- hoffmann collection , berlin -rrb- and dr. angela schneider -lrb- nationalgalerie , berlin -rrb- , praised bonvicini ’ s work because it is grounded in the socio-political fundamentals of society .
they were won over by the way bonvicini exposes the actions and vulnerability of our physical being in her sculptures and installations .
the audience prize went to the canadian artist angela bulloch for her haunting installation " the disenchanted forest " .
like all the other shortlisted artists she lives and works in berlin .
established in 2000 by the friends of the nationalgalerie , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the association that organised the hugely successful art events " moma in berlin " in 2004 and the goya exhibition in 2005 , the nationalgalerie prize for young art was awarded for the third time .
as media partner dw-tv produced short video profiles of all four artists , which were on show exclusively at the hamburger bahnhof exhibition .
you can find these portraits below as video-on-demand !
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monica bonvicini monica bonvicini was born in venice , italy in 1965 .
since the mid 1980s she ’ s been living and working in berlin and challenging the art world from this base .
in her radical work she uses materials such as metal frames , leather mats , chains , studs and rivets – an intimidating collection of instruments for ... what exactly ?
builders use such things ; some people reputedly also use such equipment for erotic games .
bonvicini calls it a playground for adults with 12 love swings hanging in it , which she hopes people will use .
as always , provoking a reaction from her audience is an integral part of her work .
she also likes playing with our fears . her see-through toilet cabin at the art basel in 2004 was a typical bonvicini puzzle : reflecting glass walls ensured that the outside world could be seen from the inside , but no-one on the outside was able to look in .
playful , provocative and perplexing bonvicini ‘ s biting irony is sure to you stop in your tracks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela bulloch angela bulloch was born in 1966 in fort frances , canada .
she often works with large-scale light and sound installations .
in some of these , stacked illuminated boxes show only a single pixel of an image that has been enlarged beyond recognition .
bulloch unsettles us with her abstract codes and ciphers with which she explores the rules and norms of our societies and investigates our patterns of behaviour .
her trademark clear forms and cool aesthetics keep the viewer at a distance , but at the same time the viewers are often part of bullock ’ s installations – as their every move triggers a reaction in her interactive works .
bullock creates what she calls a kind of " hermetic art work " in which the experience of art is very physical .
challenging us to confront the boundaries of our perception bullock investigates how far electronic media has changed the way we see and how we look on the world . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anri sala anri sala was born 1974 in tirana , albania .
this video artist has always been a restless traveller in the world .
he ’ s always on the lookout for those seemingly unsignificant details of everyday life that he transforms into expressive " tableaux vivants " : a horse in darkness , fireworks , the colourful facades of tirana .
moments full of poetry , captured by sala and enhanced with light or shadow , sound or absolute silence .
in his hands moments that otherwise have passed unnoticed are turned into precious jewels .
anri sala is a melancholic poet – always searching for the spectacular in the unspectacular and not afraid of touching our emotions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john bock john bock was born in 1965 on the northern german coast . his distinguishing feature : wild hair on top of his head and wild ideas inside .
take the outlandish costumes he designs for his performances : enormous heads stuffed with cotton wool .
on one the eyelids have flaps with zippers , and out of them spill knitted arms that reach out endlessly .
using simple techniques such as sewing , carpentry and modelling john bock creates the strange trashy worlds for his comically absurd and enigmatic performances and installations .
his weird and wonderful work is in great demand and can be admired in major museums .
john bock has been invited to all the international biennials from sao paulo to venice , and even to the triennial in yokohama .

but who gets the credit ?
two top stylists have rival claims to this cinderella story . in politics , image is everything .
and in the run-up to the sept .
18 general election , even the famously non-flamboyant conservative leader angela merkel took this message to heart , trading in her wash ' n ' go pudding bowl hairstyle for a softer , more stylish look .
flattering make-up and the addition of brighter , more fitted suits to her wardrobe completed merkel 's transformation from " kohl 's girl " to " angie . " but merkel did n't do it alone .
the question is , which top german stylist should take the credit for her makeover ?
martina acht , a hairdresser whose salon is in the western city of offenbach , told reuters that her influence was decisive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transformation was already pronounced when merkel met with us president george w. bush " she came to me for advice just before -lrb- us president -rrb- george w. bush came to germany -lrb- in february -rrb- and ever since then , her look has been completely different , " acht said . " since then , she seems so much more feminine , " she added . but celebrity hairdresser udo walz , whose swanky berlin salon is frequented by models and politicians alike , begs to differ .
walz said that he has been working on merkel 's hair for a long time and that she has an appointment with him every four weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrity hairdresser udo walz -lrb- right -rrb- , pictured here with talkshow host sabine christiansen , says merkel is his client " martina acht might have used a blow-dryer on my client 's hair , but she did not cut it , " walz said , laying down the gauntlet in a battle of the scissors that has gleefully been picked up by the german tabloids .
" there are always people around who want to jump on the bandwagon . " walz is also closely acquainted with the hair of the man currently battling merkel for the office of chancellor - incumbent gerhard schröder .
in a 2002 court challenge against a german news agency that said schröder dyed his hair black , walz played the role of key witness .
he testified that , despite his youthful appearance , the 61-year-old schröder does have some grey hairs , but that they are only visible at close range . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : rolling stones no fans of " angie " how rock n ' roll is angela merkel ?

after crunch talks , italy 's cabinet approved measures to cut the deficit by 11bn euros -lrb- £ 7.5bn -rrb- and put forward plans to boost its sluggish economy .
with elections due next year , prime minister silvio berlusconi faced opposition to his proposals from some members of his ruling coalition .
the budget proposals must now be approved by both houses of parliament .
financial rigour silvio berlusconi 's government is under pressure to curb its budget deficit which has exceeded eu limits for several years .
the budget proposals , announced late on thursday , include $ 16bn in spending cuts designed to reduce italy 's deficit . "
there is clearly a big risk that the budget numbers are n't going to add up " marco valli , ubm economist areas targeted include civil service and regional health spending , which will both be cut .

there would be tax breaks of more than 1bn euros for families while companies would have to pay 2bn euros less on social security costs .
prime minister silvio berlusconi said the proposals were fiscally responsible .
" it certainly is n't an electoral budget , " he said .
" we are keeping to our word with absolute rigour , " budget pressure italy 's last budget before elections next year has proved highly contentious .
finance minister domenico siniscalco quit last week amid claims that he was exasperated about divisions over the budget .
italy has been put on notice to reduce its budget deficit , which is forecast to hit 4.3 % this year .
eu rules governing the single currency require countries to keep their budget deficit below 3 % of gross domestic product .
big risk next year 's budget is designed to bring the deficit down to 3.8 % but unions have warned that they will oppose cuts in spending on health and welfare services and may consider strike action .

mr vicari , famous for his paintings of the middle east , says he has become " obsessed " with thomas in the last couple of years .
now five different portraits of thomas , who died in 1953 , are to feature in mr vicari 's latest retrospective .
the artist , originally from port talbot , said he has long had the dream of paying homage to the poet .
five vicari portraits of the poet will appear in an exhibition marking the opening of a new gallery in dubai next month .
dylan thomas has obsessed me for the last two years and this is my way of honouring him andrew vicari the artist , who now lives in monaco and is among the highest paid artists in the world , said he thought it was " disgraceful " how poets were not honoured in the uk until after their death .
swansea-born thomas died aged 39 in new york in november 1953 when he was on a speaking tour of the us .
" there may have been times when he was a bit of a prophet without honour in his homeland , but i think he can feel pleased with what he achieved in his 39 years , " said mr vicari .
" dylan thomas has obsessed me for the last two years and this is my way of honouring him . "
he has read 50 books on the poet and even used extracts from his work in his own speeches .
" to begin with , i thought he was just another mumbles poet , " said mr vicari .
" now every time i go to mumbles i think of him and recall his poetry . "
andrew vicari painted the portraits from memory of meeting the poet he said he had initially found some of thomas ' poetry " too lyrical and parochial " but he has since grown to love his imagery and use of words .
thomas is the latest giant of welsh cultural life to be drawn by mr vicari .
aneurin bevan , augustus john , emlyn williams and stanley baker are among those he had painted .
a triptych tribute showing thomas as a young man , during his bbc days of under milk wood , and one just before he died is in the dubai show .
another is of the writer as mr vicari remembers him .
" i met dylan once when i was studying at the slade , " he said .
homage " it was n't long before his death and was at a time when his global fame had n't reached the levels he enjoys . "
the latest paintings have been done from memories , photos and reminiscences from friends who also knew thomas .
" he was the part of the scenery of my youth , " added mr vicari .
" during the many years i 've spent working in the middle east i 've learned just how important poetry is to the people in that part of the world .
" that 's why i thought it would be appropriate to unveil my homage to dylan in dubai . "

boeing reached a deal with unions after pledging to lift pension payments and cut plans to limit healthcare cover .
almost 20,000 boeing machinists at plants in kansas , oregon and washington state downed tools at the start of this month , delaying plane deliveries .
the stoppages could cost boeing more than $ 2bn -lrb- £ 1.1bn -rrb- , analysts estimate .
' union victory ' more than 80 % of unionised boeing machinists voted to back the proposals .
although staff are not required to resume work until 12 october , many are expected to return on friday . "
our focus now shifts to ensuring a smooth restart of our production system " alan mulally , boeing workers said they believed that union representatives had secured vital concessions over healthcare and pension payments .
" to me , this is a win , " said kent sprague , a machinist who backed the proposals .
" i am little disappointed that boeing did n't offer this initially . "
bonus payments the three-year deal was reached after boeing pledged not to make changes to its healthcare programme , despite rising costs .
it also agreed to keep offering medical benefits to retired workers .
the company will also pay more in pensions to union members , increasing the monthly payout to $ 70 per month for every year worked , up from $ 60 .
workers will also receive an 8 % bonus in the first year , plus $ 3,000 in each of the next two years .
the company also dropped plans to link incentive payments to whether the company meets financial targets .
restarting production boeing said it was pleased about the outcome of the vote while stressing that the financial terms of the agreement were similar to those originally rejected by unions .
" our focus now shifts to ensuring a smooth restart of our production system and a return to a steady flow of airplane deliveries to our customers , " said alan mulally , president and chief executive officer of boeing commercial airplanes .
the strike has caused a delay in deliveries of more than 20 planes .

jerry presley is helping to host some of the big events of the weekend , including a performance by elvis ' gospel group , the sweet inspirations .
an elvis speed dating event is among some of the activities which will take place over the three day festival the event , now in its second year , is thought to be the biggest in europe .
event co-ordinator peter phillips said the festival would be a real boost for tourism in the local area .
he told the bbc news website : " they tell me you ca n't get a hotel room within 10 miles of porthcawl , which has n't happened since the war . "
a cardiff couple will also get married in an " elvis-style ceremony " on the sea front during the convention .
mr phillips said one of the other highlights would be the world 's first speed dating event devoted to the king of rock n ' roll , who died in 1977 .
elvis wedding " it 's speed dating with the common denominator that everyone 's an elvis fan , " he said .
" i do n't think elvis gear is compulsory but it will put you at the front of the queue . "
and mr phillips hopes the dating competition will add to the attractions of next year 's festival .
" as it 's customary that someone gets married during the festival - we hope that next year 's couple meet at this year 's speed dating . "
there are 90 events in 25 venues around porthcawl from friday to sunday , when the carnival closes .
eighties pop star steve strange will be putting in an appearance , as will mario kombou , recently crowned in memphis as the " world champion " elvis .
but if locals or visitors become overwhelmed with presley-mania there is one corner of sanity left in the town - the jolly sailor pub is running an " elvis-free zone " all weekend .

an elvis speed dating event is among some of the activities which will take place over the three day festival the event , now in its second year , is thought to be the biggest in europe .
event co-ordinator peter phillips said the festival would be a real boost for tourism in the local area .
he told the bbc news website : " they tell me you ca n't get a hotel room within 10 miles of porthcawl , which has n't happened since the war . "
a cardiff couple will also get married in an " elvis-style ceremony " on the sea front during the convention .

the bbc global 30 index put on an impressive 250 points , with 85 of those points added by bp and exxon alone .
more significant is that six of the top 10 performers on the index were asian : mizuho financial -lrb- + 21.3 % -rrb- , toyota -lrb- + 18.4 % -rrb- ntt docomo -lrb- + 17.3 % -rrb- , seven- eleven -lrb- + 13.1 % -rrb- , now restructured to include its holding company , ito-yokado , takeda pharmaceutical -lrb- + 13.1 % -rrb- and samsung -lrb- + 11.8 % -rrb- .
much of that follows the exuberance following japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi 's election victory .
" it 's not just the election , " says james stewart of weavering capital .
" what you are seeing is an improved equity market , a deteriorating bond market and the currency under control .
the government is very aware that it must n't loose this advantageous combination . "
a modest rise of 0.5 % for residential land prices and 0.6 % for commercial land added to the excitement over financial stocks , which have been animated by the idea of a revitalised mortgage industry .
it is the first upward movement in prices since the bursting of the property bubble 15 years ago .
takeda pharmaceutical , japan 's biggest drug company made a return to the us market this week with its insomnia treatment rozerem .
it is something of a milestone for the company .
it is the first drug it has developed on its own in five years and the first in six years that it is marketing without the help of a partner in the us .
upmarket mobiles away from japan , samsung electronics has been instrumental in pushing the south korean kospi index up to fresh highs .
the group said it had developed the world 's first 16-gigabit nand flash memory chips using 50-nanometer technology .
this can store the equivalent of 200 years of a 40-page broadsheet daily newspaper on 16.4 billion functional transistors .
it virtually doubles the data storage capacity on digital cameras and music players .
it also announced it will be launching a mobile phone with danish up-market electronics firm bang & olufsen this year .
on top of this , samsung is forecasting flash memory chip sales to rise to $ 6.4bn this year from $ 4.1bn last year , and like nokia -lrb- up 6.9 % this last month -rrb- , it said third quarter mobile phone shipments would beat previous forecasts .
microsoft 's problems now for the bad news , and much of it centres on the us which has only two stocks , exxon and procter & gamble , in the top half of the index .
" partly this is a feature of europe playing catch up , " says mr stewart .
" stocks in europe have been bombed out for so long , investors are concentrating more on them than the us .
" but , more important , they are also increasingly sceptical about the long term durability of the us recovery . "
microsoft is the index 's second worst performer , down 3.3 % on the month .
its shares looked for a while as if they might break out above $ 30 , but simply failed to lift off .
investors seem increasingly doubtful about its ability to grow beyond its existing -lrb- albeit massive -rrb- size .
it was not helped by a court tussle with google over the alleged poaching of its chinese internet expert lee kai-fu .
earlier in the year , microsoft managed to get a block on mr lee starting work at google 's china research centre .
microsoft has now filed a suit against mr lee and google , claiming he violated confidentiality and non-competition agreements with microsoft when he jumped ship in july .
the court heard salacious tales of some colourful language uttered by microsoft chief executive steve ballmer on the subject of what they would like to do with google , and company founder bill gates 's views on china .
all the same , microsoft soldiers on .
it launched a paid search service for the web for advertisers to better hone in on target audiences , again to take on google 's own service .
and it announced it was restructuring , cutting seven divisions down into three to " enhance decision-making and speed of execution " .
global expansion plans the retailers have also been in a trough in recent weeks as the oil price hikes whittle away business .
tesco is the worst performer on the index , down 4.8 % .
it was forced to admit that its energy costs had gone up by about £ 60m in the first half of the year and that petrol costs would reduce the amount its customers would spend in its stores .
wal-mart has had a similarly wearing time and fell 1.1 % this month , but it is continuing to build its global empire .
in central america it has bought a 33 % stake in ahold 's operation , while in hungary it has bought the cora hypermarket chain to go head to head with tesco , which to date is the biggest retailer in the country with plans to increase its operation by more than 20 % .
it seems though that hurricanes and oil prices will not deter procter and gamble 's customers .
it has said it is still on track to hit its first quarter profit targets , and that any downside from katrina -lrb- coffee production in the gulf and , rather bizarrely , health and beauty sales at estee lauder -rrb- had been offset by stronger sales all round .
this last week it said its folgers coffee production unit in new orleans , thought to be the world 's biggest , was back in production .
p & g was one of the best us performers on the index , and rose 7.0 % .
among other us stocks citigroup also fared well , rising 6.5 % as the highly profitable consumer business unit continues to be reorganised a month after the departure of its boss marjorie magner .
german recovery in germany the market has ignored the furore over the political hiatus , after some initial volatility .
hans redeker , head of global foreign exchange strategy at bnp paribas believes the economy has turned the corner .
" regardless of the political situation , all the information shows the economic side has been switched to a green light , " he says .
" one example of germany 's potential is a comparison of unit costs .
they have grown in germany by 8 % since 1998 .
in the us unit cost growth has been 28 % .
there is a huge advantage there .
the german corporate sector realised it was uncompetitive and it has restructured . "
siemens -lrb- + 3.0 % -rrb- is a good example of this .
chief executive klaus kleinfeld announced that another 2,400 jobs would go at its it services unit sbs , as he continued the restructuring that he hopes will boost profitability .
however e.on is down 1.5 % .
it had been hoping a new government would give a fillip to its nuclear power programme .
it has also been hampered by the news of its possible bid for the uk 's scottish power , a deal that would make it the biggest power supplier in the uk .
e.on was also on stage this last month at chancellor schroeder and president putin 's german jamboree signing a deal to build a gas pipeline under the baltic from russia to germany .
basf is part of the agreement too , and its shares were up 7.8 % .
it also got a boost from the german chemical industry body vci which confirmed its forecasts for the sector 's growth this week - sales up 4.5 % , production up 2.5 % .
this is a relief for investors as many had worried whether higher raw material prices would push up prices and choke demand .

the bbc global 30 index put on an impressive 250 points , with 85 of those points added by bp and exxon alone .
more significant is that six of the top 10 performers on the index were asian : mizuho financial -lrb- + 21.3 % -rrb- , toyota -lrb- + 18.4 % -rrb- ntt docomo -lrb- + 17.3 % -rrb- , seven- eleven -lrb- + 13.1 % -rrb- , now restructured to include its holding company , ito-yokado , takeda pharmaceutical -lrb- + 13.1 % -rrb- and samsung -lrb- + 11.8 % -rrb- .

" what you are seeing is an improved equity market , a deteriorating bond market and the currency under control .
the government is very aware that it must n't loose this advantageous combination . "
a modest rise of 0.5 % for residential land prices and 0.6 % for commercial land added to the excitement over financial stocks , which have been animated by the idea of a revitalised mortgage industry .
it is the first upward movement in prices since the bursting of the property bubble 15 years ago .
takeda pharmaceutical , japan 's biggest drug company made a return to the us market this week with its insomnia treatment rozerem .
it is something of a milestone for the company .

microsoft 's problems now for the bad news , and much of it centres on the us which has only two stocks , exxon and procter & gamble , in the top half of the index .
bp and exxon helped lift the index " partly this is a feature of europe playing catch up , " says mr stewart .
" stocks in europe have been bombed out for so long , investors are concentrating more on them than the us .

wal-mart has had a similarly wearing time and fell 1.1 % this month , but it is continuing to build its global empire .

it seems though that hurricanes and oil prices will not deter procter and gamble 's customers .
it has said it is still on track to hit its first quarter profit targets , and that any downside from katrina -lrb- coffee production in the gulf and , rather bizarrely , health and beauty sales at estee lauder -rrb- had been offset by stronger sales all round .
this last week it said its folgers coffee production unit in new orleans , thought to be the world 's biggest , was back in production .

polanski is known for his gritty movies with subjects ranging from the nazi concentration camps of the pianist to the satanic horror of rosemary 's baby .
although dickens ' classic was largely a bleak look at poverty in victorian london , one of its most famous screen adaptations was director sir carol reed 's uplifting musical oliver !
it saw a sprightly fagin , played by ron moody , singing and dancing to you 've got to pick a pocket or two .
the film also included memorable songs such as food glorious food , consider yourself and boys for sale .
polanski 's offering is a darker adaptation , in keeping with murky themes of dickens ' book , but still manages to remain upbeat .
' cheeky chappy ' there have been more than 20 screen adaptations of oliver twist on the big and small screen , with the first as early as 1909 when edith storey played young oliver .
polanski decided he wanted his oliver to be " braver " and " less educated " than previous incarnations , plumping for blond 12-year-old barney clark for the role from a pool of hundreds .
his casting of harry eden as the artful dodger provides a less " cheeky chappy " than in oliver ! , but he is still one of the lighter characters in the film .
sir carol also selected his oliver , mark lester , after auditioning more than 250 young hopefuls .
some adaptations have stuck closer to the original story than others .
the plot of the novel is complex and difficult to keep to in its entirety for the average two-hour film .
david lean 's 1946 version stayed true to the original story , while both polanski and sir carol reed missed out chunks of the story and the major character of monks , who is a key figure in young oliver 's life .
keeping the spirit oliver 's real background remains an unexplored mystery in the two films , while the book delves into his real parentage in more detail .
polanski , along with his screenwriter ronald harwood , opted to eliminate the sub-plots of the book and concentrate on the main storyline and keeping the spirit of the novel .
what polanski offers is a darker look at poverty in victorian london , which saw orphans such as oliver twist forced into workhouses from a tender age .
despite being made 40 years apart , sir carol and polanski 's movies have a similar feel in terms of sets , largely because of the detail provided by dickens about the contrast between industrial london and its slums .
literary and film criticism is divided on whether the character of fagin has a heart and loves the urchins he trains as pickpockets or is purely using them to feather his nest further .
an almost unrecognisable sir ben kingsley takes the role of fagin in polanski 's film , playing it as a decrepit miser feigning a love for his charges .
he said he based his character on photographs of 19th century jews he found in krakow when he was filming schindler 's list .
" i loved them and wanted them to be part of my fagin too , " said sir ben .
the directors both chose to skip over race issues in their films , despite dickens constantly referring to fagin as " the jew " .
monster role both sir ben and ron moody play fagin in an almost pantomime fashion - invaluable in attracting more orphans into his confidence .
polanski stated he wanted his film to be a humorous tale of good fighting evil .
both films feature a largely british cast with jamie forman taking over the role of bill sykes , played so memorably in the musical by oliver reed .
neither have much to endear them to viewers - though foreman makes his sykes even more of a monster .
whether polanski 's film can get close to the five oscars oliver ! won remains to be seen .
but it is unlikely to be the last time a director wants to take on the challenge of putting one of dickens ' most famous characters on the big screen .

barney clark and harry eden play oliver and the artful dodger polanski is known for his gritty movies with subjects ranging from the nazi concentration camps of the pianist to the satanic horror of rosemary 's baby .
although dickens ' classic was largely a bleak look at poverty in victorian london , one of its most famous screen adaptations was director sir carol reed 's uplifting musical oliver !
it saw a sprightly fagin , played by ron moody , singing and dancing to you 've got to pick a pocket or two .
the film also included memorable songs such as food glorious food , consider yourself and boys for sale .
polanski 's offering is a darker adaptation , in keeping with murky themes of dickens ' book , but still manages to remain upbeat .
' cheeky chappy ' there have been more than 20 screen adaptations of oliver twist on the big and small screen , with the first as early as 1909 when edith storey played young oliver .
polanski decided he wanted his oliver to be " braver " and " less educated " than previous incarnations , plumping for blond 12-year-old barney clark for the role from a pool of hundreds .
his casting of harry eden as the artful dodger provides a less " cheeky chappy " than in oliver ! , but he is still one of the lighter characters in the film .
sir ben kingsley takes on fagin sir carol also selected his oliver , mark lester , after auditioning more than 250 young hopefuls .
some adaptations have stuck closer to the original story than others .
the plot of the novel is complex and difficult to keep to in its entirety for the average two-hour film .
david lean 's 1946 version stayed true to the original story , while both polanski and sir carol reed missed out chunks of the story and the major character of monks , who is a key figure in young oliver 's life .
keeping the spirit oliver 's real background remains an unexplored mystery in the two films , while the book delves into his real parentage in more detail .
polanski , along with his screenwriter ronald harwood , opted to eliminate the sub-plots of the book and concentrate on the main storyline and keeping the spirit of the novel .
what polanski offers is a darker look at poverty in victorian london , which saw orphans such as oliver twist forced into workhouses from a tender age .
despite being made 40 years apart , sir carol and polanski 's movies have a similar feel in terms of sets , largely because of the detail provided by dickens about the contrast between industrial london and its slums .
literary and film criticism is divided on whether the character of fagin has a heart and loves the urchins he trains as pickpockets or is purely using them to feather his nest further .
an almost unrecognisable sir ben kingsley takes the role of fagin in polanski 's film , playing it as a decrepit miser feigning a love for his charges .
he said he based his character on photographs of 19th century jews he found in krakow when he was filming schindler 's list .
" i loved them and wanted them to be part of my fagin too , " said sir ben .
the directors both chose to skip over race issues in their films , despite dickens constantly referring to fagin as " the jew " .
monster role both sir ben and ron moody play fagin in an almost pantomime fashion - invaluable in attracting more orphans into his confidence .
polanski stated he wanted his film to be a humorous tale of good fighting evil .
both films feature a largely british cast with jamie forman taking over the role of bill sykes , played so memorably in the musical by oliver reed .
oliver reed was bill sykes in the musical oliver !
neither have much to endear them to viewers - though foreman makes his sykes even more of a monster .
whether polanski 's film can get close to the five oscars oliver ! won remains to be seen .

the government is increasing training places by a quarter and introducing a new contract to improve access - only half the population is registered .
but in an interview on bbc breakfast news , the prime minister said there was no way of forcing dentists to do nhs work instead of private .
more than a third of english dentists ' work is carried out privately - up from about a tenth 15 years ago .
mr blair blamed the rise on a new contract introduced in 1990 which effectively increased workload without a rise in pay .
i do n't think you will see a rush of dentists coming back to the nhs nigel carter , of the british dental health foundation the rise in private work has meant that many people have struggled to find nhs dentists with queues being seen in some parts of the country when a new practice opens .
however , the large number of unregistered people will also include those who have decided not to register themselves .
mr blair said dentistry was the " most difficult aspect of the nhs " .
" we ca n't turn the clock back , because i ca n't force dentists to come back into the nhs . "
the admission comes six years after the prime minister pledged to give everyone access to nhs dentistry within two years .
preventative work the government is attempting to remedy the situation by introducing a new contract in april which allows dentists to spend more time on preventative work in a bid to get away from the " drill and fill " culture .
the number of training places have also expanded by 25 % this year , although it will be five years before those dentists graduate .
nigel cater , of the charity british dental health foundation , said he could not see the situation improving in the short-term .
" i do n't think you will see a rush of dentists coming back to the nhs , although the new contract may stop them leaving , and the new training places are going to take a few years to make a difference . "
and lester ellman , of the british dental association , said the new contract may " lead to more dentists going private " .
your comments we both use her estonian dentist and save a fortune richard simpson , farnborough , uk my wife is estonian , so i visit that country at least twice a year .
we both use her estonian dentist and save a fortune .
we are happy with the treatment , are always seen on time and it costs less than 1/3 of what we used to pay for private dentistry in this country .
it 's no good for emergencies , but if i needed major work such as a crown i could pay the air fare and dental costs and still save on going private here .
richard simpson , farnborough , uk i work for a pct looking at dental contracts and even i ca n't get a dentist to look at me !
j. richards , birmingham i am a dentist .
i care about the standard of care i can provide for my patients .
the nhs does not provide my premises , they do not pay my staff , they do not buy my equipment or maintain it , they do not pay for any of my computers or staff training .
i have financed all this myself in order that i can provide the best for my patients .
when the nhs pays hardly enough to cover the cost of all the above we are left with only one choice- to leave and go private .
michael edgecombe , norfolk , uk my local practice set up about 10 years ago and now that it has built up its practice it is abandoning those nhs patients that have loyally supported them over the years .
and get this , they are now demanding you pay £ 30 a year even to register with them as private patient !
pure greed !
martin , orpington have you ever seen a poor dentist ?
dan , bath i can see the argument that there would be more nhs dentists if the government paid them more , but can i ask you - have you ever seen a poor dentist ?
dan , bath i 've been going to my dentist ever since i had teeth and they have now introduced their own private scheme .
i never need anything done other than a check up and spend literally 2 minutes in the chair twice a year .
their new service wants to charge me a £ 66 registration fee and £ 33 per check up for this .
i have had to leave as i refuse to pay this for 2 minutes work .
luckily i have managed to find one nhs dentist nearby but all others were n't taking on new patients .
sarah harris , warwick , warwickshire people are saying that private dentists are just greedy , but it takes a lot of time and money to run a good practice .
staff are hard to come by , yet they need to be retained , and the government 's made it so that workload has increased and pay has been capped for nhs only dentists .
nick , south yorks my sister left for australia in the 90s as she could n't make a living here doing nhs work and did n't have £ 100,000 or more to buy a share in a practice .
if they train more dentists , more will leave the uk for better jobs abroad .
it 's unfortunate that no-one in new labour is fit to run a business , otherwise they would understand this .
tim , london i have an excellent nhs dentist who has helped me through a lot of treatment despite my extreme dental anxiety .
i think it 's a shame not everyone has access to this type of service , especially people who are anxious or phobic , as we can find it hard enough to find dentists willing to take us on , without dealing with these issues of shortages .
cait hughes , birmingham , uk our nhs dentist whom we have been going to for over 30 years sent us a letter on monday that from 5pm that evening they no longer would care for nhs patients .
we now have to register as private clients in their practice or leave .
alun davies , betws-y-coed if the dentists are being taught at taxpayers ' expense over 5 or so years , i believe they should be forced to work as an nhs dentist for a fixed period of years .
if they decide to go private only , they should be forced to repay the cost of their training .
this is only fair to the taxpayer .
r. brown , london , uk why should the government and the nhs pay for dental care ?
people are prepared to spend thousands of pounds on maintenance of their car for example , but they do n't see why they should spend a penny on their own dental maintenance .
our health is our own responsibility , and i do not see why the taxpayer should subsidise those who are not prepared to look after their own bodies .
preventative healthcare is the key , and that is everyone 's responsibility .
john buckley , reading , uk we have a right to nhs care but are unable to receive it pamela , blairgowrie , scotland our local dentist has recently retired and being unable to find a dentist to take on his practice , we have all had to try to register with other dentists in the area .
we are a town with a population of approx 9000 with one dentist who will not take any more nhs patients and do not have a waiting list for places .
the dentist 5 miles away has shut their satellite surgery and moved their dentist back to the next big city which is 17 miles away .
we have a right to nhs care but are unable to receive it which i feel is ridiculous and unacceptable in this day and age !
pamela , blairgowrie , scotland if you look at other eu countries , such as france , they offer free university education to students studying essential subjects , such as engineering , while those studying other non-essential subjects do not receive grants and pay their own fees and costs .
we have started doing this with teaching and nhs disciplines , maybe we need to extend this to other essential skills such as dentistry .
sian van es , hereford our dentist suddenly no longer takes nhs patients and expects us to join a private insurance scheme at huge expense .
what happens to the nhs contribution which presently goes towards our costs ?
there is no ni reduction .
william douthwaite , milnthorpe , cumbria if the british population took it upon themselves to boycott private dentistry , dentists would have no choice but to return to the nhs .
as long as people are willing to pay ridiculous amounts of money to private dentists they will continue to desert the nhs .
blair is absolutely right , no government can legislate against greed .
jo , kent i have been unable to find an nhs dentist since moving to preston one and a half years ago .
there simply are n't any within 50 miles .
i 've asked nhs direct for help , but they have merely ignored emails i have sent .
andrew hindle , preston , lancashire i went to see a private dentist in leeds who after an x-ray stated i needed 3 fillings for £ 300 , in and out in five minutes tops .
i then -lrb- after a year searching -rrb- got a second opinion from an nhs dentist who gave me a clean and said i did n't need any treatment for about £ 25 !
the private dentists are ripping us off !
anonymous the government took away my dentist and now i have no teeth , i have to drink everything through a straw and it 's disgusting .
anthony bentley , norwich in all fairness they have encouraged new trainee dentists but to claim to be powerless is nonsense .
basic market forces apply - if you need dentists to work for the nhs ...

the government is increasing training places by a quarter and introducing a new contract to improve access - only half the population is registered .
but in an interview on bbc breakfast news , the prime minister said there was no way of forcing dentists to do nhs work instead of private .
more than a third of english dentists ' work is carried out privately - up from about a tenth 15 years ago .
mr blair blamed the rise on a new contract introduced in 1990 which effectively increased workload without a rise in pay .
i do n't think you will see a rush of dentists coming back to the nhs nigel carter , of the british dental health foundation the rise in private work has meant that many people have struggled to find nhs dentists with queues being seen in some parts of the country when a new practice opens .
however , the large number of unregistered people will also include those who have decided not to register themselves .
mr blair said dentistry was the " most difficult aspect of the nhs " .
" we ca n't turn the clock back , because i ca n't force dentists to come back into the nhs . "
the admission comes six years after the prime minister pledged to give everyone access to nhs dentistry within two years .
preventative work the government is attempting to remedy the situation by introducing a new contract in april which allows dentists to spend more time on preventative work in a bid to get away from the " drill and fill " culture .
the number of training places have also expanded by 25 % this year , although it will be five years before those dentists graduate .
nigel cater , of the charity british dental health foundation , said he could not see the situation improving in the short-term .
" i do n't think you will see a rush of dentists coming back to the nhs , although the new contract may stop them leaving , and the new training places are going to take a few years to make a difference . "
and lester ellman , of the british dental association , said the new contract may " lead to more dentists going private " .
your comments we both use her estonian dentist and save a fortune richard simpson , farnborough , uk my wife is estonian , so i visit that country at least twice a year .
we both use her estonian dentist and save a fortune .
we are happy with the treatment , are always seen on time and it costs less than 1/3 of what we used to pay for private dentistry in this country .
it 's no good for emergencies , but if i needed major work such as a crown i could pay the air fare and dental costs and still save on going private here .
richard simpson , farnborough , uk i work for a pct looking at dental contracts and even i ca n't get a dentist to look at me !
j. richards , birmingham i am a dentist .
i care about the standard of care i can provide for my patients .
the nhs does not provide my premises , they do not pay my staff , they do not buy my equipment or maintain it , they do not pay for any of my computers or staff training .
i have financed all this myself in order that i can provide the best for my patients .
when the nhs pays hardly enough to cover the cost of all the above we are left with only one choice- to leave and go private .
michael edgecombe , norfolk , uk my local practice set up about 10 years ago and now that it has built up its practice it is abandoning those nhs patients that have loyally supported them over the years .
and get this , they are now demanding you pay £ 30 a year even to register with them as private patient !
pure greed !
martin , orpington have you ever seen a poor dentist ?
dan , bath i can see the argument that there would be more nhs dentists if the government paid them more , but can i ask you - have you ever seen a poor dentist ?
dan , bath i 've been going to my dentist ever since i had teeth and they have now introduced their own private scheme .
i never need anything done other than a check up and spend literally 2 minutes in the chair twice a year .
their new service wants to charge me a £ 66 registration fee and £ 33 per check up for this .
i have had to leave as i refuse to pay this for 2 minutes work .
luckily i have managed to find one nhs dentist nearby but all others were n't taking on new patients .
sarah harris , warwick , warwickshire people are saying that private dentists are just greedy , but it takes a lot of time and money to run a good practice .
staff are hard to come by , yet they need to be retained , and the government 's made it so that workload has increased and pay has been capped for nhs only dentists .
nick , south yorks my sister left for australia in the 90s as she could n't make a living here doing nhs work and did n't have £ 100,000 or more to buy a share in a practice .
if they train more dentists , more will leave the uk for better jobs abroad .
it 's unfortunate that no-one in new labour is fit to run a business , otherwise they would understand this .
tim , london i have an excellent nhs dentist who has helped me through a lot of treatment despite my extreme dental anxiety .
i think it 's a shame not everyone has access to this type of service , especially people who are anxious or phobic , as we can find it hard enough to find dentists willing to take us on , without dealing with these issues of shortages .
cait hughes , birmingham , uk our nhs dentist whom we have been going to for over 30 years sent us a letter on monday that from 5pm that evening they no longer would care for nhs patients .
we now have to register as private clients in their practice or leave .
alun davies , betws-y-coed if the dentists are being taught at taxpayers ' expense over 5 or so years , i believe they should be forced to work as an nhs dentist for a fixed period of years .
if they decide to go private only , they should be forced to repay the cost of their training .
this is only fair to the taxpayer .
r. brown , london , uk why should the government and the nhs pay for dental care ?
people are prepared to spend thousands of pounds on maintenance of their car for example , but they do n't see why they should spend a penny on their own dental maintenance .
our health is our own responsibility , and i do not see why the taxpayer should subsidise those who are not prepared to look after their own bodies .
preventative healthcare is the key , and that is everyone 's responsibility .
john buckley , reading , uk we have a right to nhs care but are unable to receive it pamela , blairgowrie , scotland our local dentist has recently retired and being unable to find a dentist to take on his practice , we have all had to try to register with other dentists in the area .
we are a town with a population of approx 9000 with one dentist who will not take any more nhs patients and do not have a waiting list for places .
the dentist 5 miles away has shut their satellite surgery and moved their dentist back to the next big city which is 17 miles away .
we have a right to nhs care but are unable to receive it which i feel is ridiculous and unacceptable in this day and age !
pamela , blairgowrie , scotland if you look at other eu countries , such as france , they offer free university education to students studying essential subjects , such as engineering , while those studying other non-essential subjects do not receive grants and pay their own fees and costs .
we have started doing this with teaching and nhs disciplines , maybe we need to extend this to other essential skills such as dentistry .
sian van es , hereford our dentist suddenly no longer takes nhs patients and expects us to join a private insurance scheme at huge expense .
what happens to the nhs contribution which presently goes towards our costs ?
there is no ni reduction .
william douthwaite , milnthorpe , cumbria if the british population took it upon themselves to boycott private dentistry , dentists would have no choice but to return to the nhs .
as long as people are willing to pay ridiculous amounts of money to private dentists they will continue to desert the nhs .
blair is absolutely right , no government can legislate against greed .
jo , kent i have been unable to find an nhs dentist since moving to preston one and a half years ago .
there simply are n't any within 50 miles .
i 've asked nhs direct for help , but they have merely ignored emails i have sent .
andrew hindle , preston , lancashire i went to see a private dentist in leeds who after an x-ray stated i needed 3 fillings for £ 300 , in and out in five minutes tops .
i then -lrb- after a year searching -rrb- got a second opinion from an nhs dentist who gave me a clean and said i did n't need any treatment for about £ 25 !
the private dentists are ripping us off !
anonymous the government took away my dentist and now i have no teeth , i have to drink everything through a straw and it 's disgusting .
anthony bentley , norwich in all fairness they have encouraged new trainee dentists but to claim to be powerless is nonsense .

however , the large number of unregistered people will also include those who have decided not to register themselves .
mr blair said dentistry was the " most difficult aspect of the nhs " .
" we ca n't turn the clock back , because i ca n't force dentists to come back into the nhs . "
the admission comes six years after the prime minister pledged to give everyone access to nhs dentistry within two years .
preventative work the government is attempting to remedy the situation by introducing a new contract in april which allows dentists to spend more time on preventative work in a bid to get away from the " drill and fill " culture .
the number of training places have also expanded by 25 % this year , although it will be five years before those dentists graduate .
nigel cater , of the charity british dental health foundation , said he could not see the situation improving in the short-term .
" i do n't think you will see a rush of dentists coming back to the nhs , although the new contract may stop them leaving , and the new training places are going to take a few years to make a difference . "
and lester ellman , of the british dental association , said the new contract may " lead to more dentists going private " .
your comments we both use her estonian dentist and save a fortune richard simpson , farnborough , uk my wife is estonian , so i visit that country at least twice a year .
we both use her estonian dentist and save a fortune .
we are happy with the treatment , are always seen on time and it costs less than 1/3 of what we used to pay for private dentistry in this country .
it 's no good for emergencies , but if i needed major work such as a crown i could pay the air fare and dental costs and still save on going private here .
richard simpson , farnborough , uk i work for a pct looking at dental contracts and even i ca n't get a dentist to look at me !
j. richards , birmingham i am a dentist .
i care about the standard of care i can provide for my patients .
the nhs does not provide my premises , they do not pay my staff , they do not buy my equipment or maintain it , they do not pay for any of my computers or staff training .
i have financed all this myself in order that i can provide the best for my patients .
when the nhs pays hardly enough to cover the cost of all the above we are left with only one choice- to leave and go private .
michael edgecombe , norfolk , uk my local practice set up about 10 years ago and now that it has built up its practice it is abandoning those nhs patients that have loyally supported them over the years .
and get this , they are now demanding you pay £ 30 a year even to register with them as private patient !
pure greed !
martin , orpington have you ever seen a poor dentist ?
dan , bath i can see the argument that there would be more nhs dentists if the government paid them more , but can i ask you - have you ever seen a poor dentist ?
dan , bath i 've been going to my dentist ever since i had teeth and they have now introduced their own private scheme .
i never need anything done other than a check up and spend literally 2 minutes in the chair twice a year .
their new service wants to charge me a £ 66 registration fee and £ 33 per check up for this .
i have had to leave as i refuse to pay this for 2 minutes work .
luckily i have managed to find one nhs dentist nearby but all others were n't taking on new patients .
sarah harris , warwick , warwickshire people are saying that private dentists are just greedy , but it takes a lot of time and money to run a good practice .
staff are hard to come by , yet they need to be retained , and the government 's made it so that workload has increased and pay has been capped for nhs only dentists .
nick , south yorks my sister left for australia in the 90s as she could n't make a living here doing nhs work and did n't have £ 100,000 or more to buy a share in a practice .
if they train more dentists , more will leave the uk for better jobs abroad .
it 's unfortunate that no-one in new labour is fit to run a business , otherwise they would understand this .
tim , london i have an excellent nhs dentist who has helped me through a lot of treatment despite my extreme dental anxiety .
i think it 's a shame not everyone has access to this type of service , especially people who are anxious or phobic , as we can find it hard enough to find dentists willing to take us on , without dealing with these issues of shortages .
cait hughes , birmingham , uk our nhs dentist whom we have been going to for over 30 years sent us a letter on monday that from 5pm that evening they no longer would care for nhs patients .
we now have to register as private clients in their practice or leave .
alun davies , betws-y-coed if the dentists are being taught at taxpayers ' expense over 5 or so years , i believe they should be forced to work as an nhs dentist for a fixed period of years .
if they decide to go private only , they should be forced to repay the cost of their training .
this is only fair to the taxpayer .
r. brown , london , uk why should the government and the nhs pay for dental care ?
people are prepared to spend thousands of pounds on maintenance of their car for example , but they do n't see why they should spend a penny on their own dental maintenance .
our health is our own responsibility , and i do not see why the taxpayer should subsidise those who are not prepared to look after their own bodies .
preventative healthcare is the key , and that is everyone 's responsibility .
john buckley , reading , uk we have a right to nhs care but are unable to receive it pamela , blairgowrie , scotland our local dentist has recently retired and being unable to find a dentist to take on his practice , we have all had to try to register with other dentists in the area .
we are a town with a population of approx 9000 with one dentist who will not take any more nhs patients and do not have a waiting list for places .
the dentist 5 miles away has shut their satellite surgery and moved their dentist back to the next big city which is 17 miles away .
we have a right to nhs care but are unable to receive it which i feel is ridiculous and unacceptable in this day and age !
pamela , blairgowrie , scotland if you look at other eu countries , such as france , they offer free university education to students studying essential subjects , such as engineering , while those studying other non-essential subjects do not receive grants and pay their own fees and costs .
we have started doing this with teaching and nhs disciplines , maybe we need to extend this to other essential skills such as dentistry .
sian van es , hereford our dentist suddenly no longer takes nhs patients and expects us to join a private insurance scheme at huge expense .
what happens to the nhs contribution which presently goes towards our costs ?
there is no ni reduction .
william douthwaite , milnthorpe , cumbria if the british population took it upon themselves to boycott private dentistry , dentists would have no choice but to return to the nhs .
as long as people are willing to pay ridiculous amounts of money to private dentists they will continue to desert the nhs .
blair is absolutely right , no government can legislate against greed .
jo , kent i have been unable to find an nhs dentist since moving to preston one and a half years ago .
there simply are n't any within 50 miles .
i 've asked nhs direct for help , but they have merely ignored emails i have sent .
andrew hindle , preston , lancashire i went to see a private dentist in leeds who after an x-ray stated i needed 3 fillings for £ 300 , in and out in five minutes tops .
i then -lrb- after a year searching -rrb- got a second opinion from an nhs dentist who gave me a clean and said i did n't need any treatment for about £ 25 !
the private dentists are ripping us off !
anonymous the government took away my dentist and now i have no teeth , i have to drink everything through a straw and it 's disgusting .
anthony bentley , norwich in all fairness they have encouraged new trainee dentists but to claim to be powerless is nonsense .
basic market forces apply - if you need dentists to work for the nhs ...
make it worth their while and pay them on a level that at least " starts " to compete with what they can earn privately .

bbc news -pipe- africa -pipe- a driving force for senegal 's women home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog languages somali french arabic swahili great lakes hausa portuguese africa more last updated : friday , 30 september 2005 , 08:02 gmt 09:02 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version a driving force for senegal 's women by ebrima sillah bbc , dakar hawa sy did not set out to be a role model , or a rebel against senegal 's male-dominated society .
hawa says whatever a man can do , a woman can do just as well but after becoming the country 's first female taxi driver , she urges other women not to stay at home , relying on men to feed the family .
" there is dignity in labour - you do n't have to worry much about what other people say about you , so long as the job you are doing brings you food on your plate . "
after spending more than 10 years in ivory coast , hawa had to leave her lucrative job as a french teacher in a private school due to political instability and attacks on foreigners , seen as sympathising with northern rebels .
since she arrived back in dakar two year ago , hawa has been looking around for a decent job but could not get one .
after consultation with her family , she bought a car and became a taxi-driver , saying : " people need to move " .
' work is work ' hawa says the first two days were difficult because most passengers thought she was driving the taxi for pleasure .
" but after one week , people started getting used to my face and sometimes when i pick up passengers , especially men , they say : ' hi , woman taxi driver , how are you doing today ? '
" inside me , i feel uncomfortable about such statements , but i just laugh them off and continue working . "
i keep honking my car horn and they move on hawa sy while most senegalese see nothing wrong with having a female taxi driver , some in this largely muslim country say they should not be allowed .
unsurprisingly , hawa strongly disagrees : " i do n't want to hear such talk - work is work " .
as in many other african cities , driving in dakar can sometimes be challenging , with taxi-drivers desperate for a fare stopping in the middle of the road to pick up passengers .
" sometimes i feel very angry because you see some of my taxi driver colleagues stopping right in the middle of the road bargaining with the customers blocking the traffic .
" but what i do is i keep honking my car horn and they move on . "
' little money ' in addition there is the problem of security .
hawa says she never works later than around 1930 because " as a woman you know robbers can attack you and rob you of entire day 's work ... so therefore i have no choice but to close early and spend some quality time with my family . "
hawa says she is still looking for an ideal job but for the time being , she will continue driving her taxi as a means of survival because " whatever a man can do , a woman can also do " .
one complaint she shares with her male colleagues is the insistence of all senegalese on bargaining on a fare before entering the taxi , rather than using the meter .
" people always want to pay little money , " she says .

brutal .
short .
this was definitely the most exotic location i have ever done an interview .
i was standing high up in the snowy hills that lie to the south of the great dwarven city of ironforge .
occasionally gryphons and hippogriffs swept majestically overhead taking their riders to elsewhere in azeroth or , as it is also known , the world of warcraft -lrb- wow -rrb- .
at the edge of the computer screen chatter constantly scrolled past as other wow players sought members forguilds , buyers for magical items , help with quests or engaged in idle banter .
player power with more than four million players world of warcraft is the most popular online game or mmorpg -lrb- massively multiplayer online role-playing game -rrb- and after just a few hours of play it is easy to understand its draw .
it is the community aspect of the game that has made it so popular .
everywhere you go people say hello , are happy to team up to plunder a dungeon or cave or share hints about where to go .
there are also guilds to join , more formal groups of adventurers , that co-ordinate the abilities of their characters to take out the most powerful monsters and complete the most difficult quests .
my companion and i were taking a short break to enjoy the view after i 'd mined some copper ore from a lode bearing lump that poked up through the snow .
although he had the outward form of a paladin , a holy knight , in real life my companion was paul younger , one of the co-ordinators of the worldofwar.net website and my guide for the evening around this small section of the warcraft world .
tips for new players concentrate on one character , dividing your time between several can be an exercise in frustration be busy and work on lots of quests , they 'll introduce the world to you and get you exploring work the map , you get extra experience points for discovering new places buy better arms and armour when you can , it helps you stay in the fight longer work hard on your chosen professions , they will help generate quests and cash ensure your net connection is reliable , you do n't want it falling over while you are in combat players of wow take on the role of a standard-issue fantasy world character such as a warrior , thief , magician or priest .
you choose to play that character class , subject to some restrictions , as one of eight races including humans , undead , orcs , trolls , dwarves and cow-like creatures called tauren .
having played fantasy-based computer games before i was expecting a lengthy character creation period once i 'd installed wow - all four gigabytes of it .
instead all i had to do was choose a race , sex and class and then cycle through the choices for how my character should look .
there was no endless weighing of ability scores to get the best balance or struggling with equipment rosters to choose a good selection of starting kit .
wow decides these for you and then leaves it up to you to make the most of what you get .
open outcry for my first foray i decided to play as a dwarf rogue -lrb- thief -rrb- that i called rutherford on the turalyon server -lrb- or realm as wow calls them -rrb- .
if you play on that realm feel free to say hi .
this done i was thrown into the warcraft world and got on with turning my weak character into a rogue to be reckoned with .
gryphons help people get around the warcraft world which is where paul younger came in .
getting started is not difficult in wow but the wealth of choices and possibilities can be overwhelming .
we agreed to play at the same time and , thanks to the globe-spanning chat system , arranged to meet up near the small town of kharanos in dun morogh - the region where dwarf characters start off .
he suggested heading for ironforge to find an expert that could help train rutherford and start turning him from a straight thief into a mining / engineering expert .
professions such as these are a way to round out the characters and give them something else to do , besides kill monsters , to gather experience and improve their abilities .
they also let you create all kinds of artefacts and items that can be used or sold .
but it was when we entered the commons in ironforge that the game 's allure was brought home to me .
not only was the setting impressive , a cavernous hallway riven by trenches of molten metal , but it was bustling like a souk .
players were everywhere , chatting , trading or preparing to go out questing .
some of the buildings in the warcraft world are huge people rode by on snow leopards , horses with flaming hooves or sabre-tooth tigers .
other ran past with devilish minions , voidwalkers and familiars in tow .
for a while i just stood around and gawped like a tourist .
duels were being fought and there was the constant scrolling chatter of all these people talking to each other or looking for help or buyers and sellers for their goods .
character names float over their head in blue text in wow and there were so many in the commons that it looked like a thin layer of smoke .
it is the chatting , social side of it that is encouraged .
learning which keys control in-game chat is a vital skill for players to learn .
this had been brought home to me while adventuring as i got out of my depth in a cave system infested with troll whelps .
luckily i bumped into a priest -lrb- healer -rrb- and we teamed up to fight our way free .
it was a small taste of the community and connections that the game fosters .
but i 'm sure it was nothing to what was going on in the commons and , undoubtedly , elsewhere in the game .
blizzard may have made the world of warcraft but the players are the ones bringing it to life .

brutal .
short .
this was definitely the most exotic location i have ever done an interview .
i was standing high up in the snowy hills that lie to the south of the great dwarven city of ironforge .
occasionally gryphons and hippogriffs swept majestically overhead taking their riders to elsewhere in azeroth or , as it is also known , the world of warcraft -lrb- wow -rrb- .
at the edge of the computer screen chatter constantly scrolled past as other wow players sought members forguilds , buyers for magical items , help with quests or engaged in idle banter .
player power with more than four million players world of warcraft is the most popular online game or mmorpg -lrb- massively multiplayer online role-playing game -rrb- and after just a few hours of play it is easy to understand its draw .
it is the community aspect of the game that has made it so popular .
everywhere you go people say hello , are happy to team up to plunder a dungeon or cave or share hints about where to go .
there are also guilds to join , more formal groups of adventurers , that co-ordinate the abilities of their characters to take out the most powerful monsters and complete the most difficult quests .
my companion and i were taking a short break to enjoy the view after i 'd mined some copper ore from a lode bearing lump that poked up through the snow .
although he had the outward form of a paladin , a holy knight , in real life my companion was paul younger , one of the co-ordinators of the worldofwar.net website and my guide for the evening around this small section of the warcraft world .
tips for new players concentrate on one character , dividing your time between several can be an exercise in frustration be busy and work on lots of quests , they 'll introduce the world to you and get you exploring work the map , you get extra experience points for discovering new places buy better arms and armour when you can , it helps you stay in the fight longer work hard on your chosen professions , they will help generate quests and cash ensure your net connection is reliable , you do n't want it falling over while you are in combat players of wow take on the role of a standard-issue fantasy world character such as a warrior , thief , magician or priest .
you choose to play that character class , subject to some restrictions , as one of eight races including humans , undead , orcs , trolls , dwarves and cow-like creatures called tauren .
having played fantasy-based computer games before i was expecting a lengthy character creation period once i 'd installed wow - all four gigabytes of it .
instead all i had to do was choose a race , sex and class and then cycle through the choices for how my character should look .
there was no endless weighing of ability scores to get the best balance or struggling with equipment rosters to choose a good selection of starting kit .
wow decides these for you and then leaves it up to you to make the most of what you get .
open outcry for my first foray i decided to play as a dwarf rogue -lrb- thief -rrb- that i called rutherford on the turalyon server -lrb- or realm as wow calls them -rrb- .
if you play on that realm feel free to say hi .
this done i was thrown into the warcraft world and got on with turning my weak character into a rogue to be reckoned with .
gryphons help people get around the warcraft world which is where paul younger came in .
getting started is not difficult in wow but the wealth of choices and possibilities can be overwhelming .
we agreed to play at the same time and , thanks to the globe-spanning chat system , arranged to meet up near the small town of kharanos in dun morogh - the region where dwarf characters start off .
he suggested heading for ironforge to find an expert that could help train rutherford and start turning him from a straight thief into a mining / engineering expert .
professions such as these are a way to round out the characters and give them something else to do , besides kill monsters , to gather experience and improve their abilities .
they also let you create all kinds of artefacts and items that can be used or sold .
but it was when we entered the commons in ironforge that the game 's allure was brought home to me .
not only was the setting impressive , a cavernous hallway riven by trenches of molten metal , but it was bustling like a souk .
players were everywhere , chatting , trading or preparing to go out questing .
some of the buildings in the warcraft world are huge people rode by on snow leopards , horses with flaming hooves or sabre-tooth tigers .
other ran past with devilish minions , voidwalkers and familiars in tow .
for a while i just stood around and gawped like a tourist .
duels were being fought and there was the constant scrolling chatter of all these people talking to each other or looking for help or buyers and sellers for their goods .
character names float over their head in blue text in wow and there were so many in the commons that it looked like a thin layer of smoke .
it is the chatting , social side of it that is encouraged .
learning which keys control in-game chat is a vital skill for players to learn .
this had been brought home to me while adventuring as i got out of my depth in a cave system infested with troll whelps .
luckily i bumped into a priest -lrb- healer -rrb- and we teamed up to fight our way free .
it was a small taste of the community and connections that the game fosters .
but i 'm sure it was nothing to what was going on in the commons and , undoubtedly , elsewhere in the game .
blizzard may have made the world of warcraft but the players are the ones bringing it to life .

having played fantasy-based computer games before i was expecting a lengthy character creation period once i 'd installed wow - all four gigabytes of it .
instead all i had to do was choose a race , sex and class and then cycle through the choices for how my character should look .
there was no endless weighing of ability scores to get the best balance or struggling with equipment rosters to choose a good selection of starting kit .
wow decides these for you and then leaves it up to you to make the most of what you get .
open outcry for my first foray i decided to play as a dwarf rogue -lrb- thief -rrb- that i called rutherford on the turalyon server -lrb- or realm as wow calls them -rrb- .
if you play on that realm feel free to say hi .
this done i was thrown into the warcraft world and got on with turning my weak character into a rogue to be reckoned with .
gryphons help people get around the warcraft world which is where paul younger came in .
getting started is not difficult in wow but the wealth of choices and possibilities can be overwhelming .
we agreed to play at the same time and , thanks to the globe-spanning chat system , arranged to meet up near the small town of kharanos in dun morogh - the region where dwarf characters start off .
he suggested heading for ironforge to find an expert that could help train rutherford and start turning him from a straight thief into a mining / engineering expert .
professions such as these are a way to round out the characters and give them something else to do , besides kill monsters , to gather experience and improve their abilities .
they also let you create all kinds of artefacts and items that can be used or sold .
but it was when we entered the commons in ironforge that the game 's allure was brought home to me .
not only was the setting impressive , a cavernous hallway riven by trenches of molten metal , but it was bustling like a souk .
players were everywhere , chatting , trading or preparing to go out questing .
some of the buildings in the warcraft world are huge people rode by on snow leopards , horses with flaming hooves or sabre-tooth tigers .
other ran past with devilish minions , voidwalkers and familiars in tow .
for a while i just stood around and gawped like a tourist .
duels were being fought and there was the constant scrolling chatter of all these people talking to each other or looking for help or buyers and sellers for their goods .
character names float over their head in blue text in wow and there were so many in the commons that it looked like a thin layer of smoke .
it is the chatting , social side of it that is encouraged .
learning which keys control in-game chat is a vital skill for players to learn .
this had been brought home to me while adventuring as i got out of my depth in a cave system infested with troll whelps .
luckily i bumped into a priest -lrb- healer -rrb- and we teamed up to fight our way free .
it was a small taste of the community and connections that the game fosters .
but i 'm sure it was nothing to what was going on in the commons and , undoubtedly , elsewhere in the game .
blizzard may have made the world of warcraft but the players are the ones bringing it to life .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- uk politics -pipe- conservative leadership watch bbc news / uk politics graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- uk contents : england -pipe- northern ireland -pipe- scotland -pipe- wales -pipe- uk politics -pipe- education -pipe- magazine friday , 30 september 2005 , 09:07 gmt 10:07 uk conservative leadership watch follow the latest twists and turns in the conservative leadership battle with our constantly updated guide .
30 september former party treasurer lord kalms says ken clarke would be " totally unacceptable " as leader because of his pro-european views .
the david davis supporter said it was " grossly misleading to pretend " that europe was no longer central to the political agenda .
" it will always remain one of the major issues of conservatism that we are eurosceptic , " he added .
mr clarke insists the european constitution is dead and there is no prospect of the uk adopting the euro in the next 10 years .
who 's in the running ?
paperwatch : the daily mail calls the launch of the david davis and david cameron campaigns the " battle of the tory blairalikes " .
meanwhile , the daily telegraph likens the contest to one between a " bash street kid " and " little lord fauntleroy " .
simon hoggart in the guardian writes : " both candidates were articulate and clear about what kind of people they are .
they were much less clear on policies . "
but the independent is impressed by cameron 's speech , calling him a " real-world tory , who despises the radicalism of easy answers " .
however , the times is not happy : " two davids running for leader is two too many .
it is confusing and indicates a lack of choice . " 29 september the front runner david davis finally formally enters the leadership contest under the slogan of modern conservatives , pledging " to show that we are not in politics for ourselves .
we are not here to defend privilege or accept the status quo .
we have a real purpose to change britain and improve lives " .
an hour later david cameron the 38-year-old shadow education secretary launched his campaign under the slogan change to win saying the problem is that people " do n't yet trust the conservative party ... what we have to do is make a change in the culture and identity of the conservative party and explain what this means today . "
paperwatch : the sun warns , in a leader column headlined ' danger man ' , that ken clarke would split the conservative party over europe if made leader and even if he did n't , and became pm he would end britain 's noble history as a sovereign state " .
the daily telegraph quotes the campaign slogans change to win , time to win and modern conservatism , before saying that " thankfully it is not a caption-writing competition " .
they then contrast that with liam fox 's pledge to take the conservatives out of the european people 's party group in the european parliament - saying it would be a big step towards the conservative party " recovering its electability " .
28 september the shadow boxing is finally over and campaigning is starting in earnest .
and it looks like ken clarke might be taking the healthy options as battle begins .
asked about including water and fruit juice instead of junk foods in school vending machines , mr clarke laughs : " i do drink a lot of fruit juice actually - man can not live on alcohol alone . "
as the former chancellor launches his campaign to woo grass roots members , bookmakers ' favourite david davis is meeting tory members in wales .
and sir malcolm rifkind 's visit to worcestershire is taking in morgan cars as the contenders vie to be in the two-seater ballot put before the whole party .
what are the rules ?
new leader due to be chosen after conservative conference in october more on the leadership rules paperwatch : the daily telegraph says the vote on the leadership rules means the party will be leaderless for another three months , but is pleased the " silliness " over the rule change is over .
" get on with it " , is the times ' plea to the tories .
it warns that allowing the contest to slip into the new year would make the party look indulgent and negligent .
its impatience is shared by the daily express , which says the tories need to elect somebody quickly to hold the prime minister to account .
the daily mail says supporters of rivals to david davis believe the prolonged race gives the frontrunner more time to make a mistake .
the guardian is among those who believe the rules vote boosts ken clarke 's chances .
the paper 's leader writers warn : " as a tea party this contest would be wilder than the mad hatter and as a way of doing politics it has become entirely self-destructive . " 27 september it is decision day on the rules which will be used to choose the next conservative party leader .
mps , euro mps and senior conservative party figures across the country have been voting on whether mps or the wider party membership should have the final say on choosing michael howard 's successor .
the result of the vote is a blow for mr howard as the change of rules is rejected .
26 september it 's a relatively quiet start to the week , with the labour party conference starting and only a day to go before the result of the vote on the conservative leadership election rules .
this vote will decide essentially whether tory mps , or the wider party membership , will choose the new leader .
out-going leader michael howard is making a speech in which he says immigrants should embrace the british way of life : " we need to instil into all british children , whatever their religion or skin colour , a sense of pride in our institutions and our way of life . " 25 september exchanges between the rival camps have become more direct and personal than previously during the campaign , with ken clarke backer john bercow saying david davis ' right-wing agenda would be a " lethal injection " into the party .
however , choosing mr clarke would be a form of " national suicide , " according to shadow education secretary david cameron .
but mr bercow described these remarks as " ludicrous hyperbole " .
mr cameron 's combination of " eton , hunting , shooting and lunch at whites " made him the wrong man for the job , he added .
meanwhile , shadow foreign secretary and fellow leadership rival liam fox has said the tax burden on hard-working people in britain must be reduced .
europe was the issue blamed for ken clarke 's defeat in the 2001 leadership election , now the debate is whether the issue still really matters .
mr clarke has argued there is no prospect of the uk adopting the euro in the next decade and declared the constitution dead .
but david davis hit back at that view in a speech to chatham house , saying it is plainly wrong to say europe is not a current issue .
yet another mp , foreign affairs spokesman keith simpson , has been enlisted to support mr davis .
meanwhile , conservative leader michael howard denied it would be farcical if a change to the election rules is rejected next week .
he says the summer has seen his party have a good debate about its future direction for the first time in 30 years .
22 september michael howard has scotched speculation he might quit next week if the party does not change its leadership election rules .
instead , the tory leader says he will resign immediately after the party 's conference - probably on 7 october .
his comments essentially mean he is sticking to the timetable envisaged when he first said he would stand down after may 's general election defeat .
mr howard will stay on as caretaker leader until his successor is chosen .
with voting on the leadership rules almost over , conservative chairman francis maude has suggested future elections could follow the style of us primaries .
that would give a say to tory supporters , as well as party members .
21 september we have waited months for a leadership campaign launch from david davis and david cameron - and now two could come along at once .
mr cameron plans to make his official pitch for the job next thursday .
it seems mr davis might want to launch on the same day and his allies have apparently been trying to persuade mr cameron to shift dates .
but a cameron aide says : " we have long planned to launch our campaign before conference and we are not sure why david davis has subsequently chosen to launch on the same day .
at least by going head to head , people will be able to weigh up the choice in this contest and we think that is a good thing . "
the financial times suggests mr davis could eventually choose to postpone his launch until next friday but his aide said no launch date had been confirmed .
" wait and see is our line , " said the aide .
mr davis has signed up another mp behind his campaign - richard ottaway , who backed ken clarke in previous leadership contests .
meanwhile , sir malcolm rifkind has dismissed suggestions he was preparing to stand down in favour of mr clarke .
the " one nation " former foreign secretary told bbc 2 's daily politics : " i am a candidate ...
i have got substantial support because i represent an important point of view within the conservative party . "
if the leadership field was not crowded enough already , brace yourself for the entry of yet another contender .
tory deputy leader michael ancram is rumoured to be considering entering the race .
newspaper reports suggest mr ancram could get backing from the cornerstone group of traditionalist tory mps , some of whom have asked edward leigh to stand .
20 september former foreign secretary sir malcolm rifkind says gordon brown needs to take over the keys from number 10 as soon as possible to rescue britain 's foreign policy .
sir malcolm tells tory meps in brussels : " britain 's foreign policy objectives can now only be served by a new prime minister not burdened by the crass failures of the last eight years . "
he says mr blair 's european policy has collapsed around him , with britain as " semi-detached " as ever in europe .
but former tory media chief nick wood tells bbc 2 's daily politics he has heard suggestions that sir malcolm is preparing to pull out of the contest and back ken clarke .
in westminster , david davis ' campaign was bolstered by party deputy chairman andrew mackay declaring him " the ideal candidate " to be the next prime minister .
paperwatch in the daily telegraph , columnist alice thomson says ken clarke is counting on mps being so desperate for power they will back him .
" but tory mps are n't obsessed by getting into downing street , " she warns .
" many have become quite comfortable with their life in opposition and their directorships . "
in the times martin samuel says tony blair views the tory ken in the same way he used to see ken livingstone : as someone he treats with disdain but really fears .
19 september the david davis leadership bid gets a start-the-week boost as six tory mps back him in a letter sent to the times .
the six include robert syms , who backed ken clarke in 2001 .
the other five are richard bacon , michael fallon , tim loughton , mark simmons and ian liddell-grainger .
18 september liam fox told the mail on sunday he would favour a cut in the legal limit for abortions to just 12 weeks .
the shadow foreign secretary said : " a society which aborts 180,000 unborn children every year is a society that needs to be asking a lot of questions about itself . "
rival ken clarke said the limit needs to be looked at again in light of medical advances but disagreed with dr fox 's limit .
on the bbc 's new sunday am show he warned : " if the conservative right brings in more of the sort of certain republican right american politics to the politics of the conservative party they will be making a serious mistake . " 16 september tory vice-chairman charles hendry names ken clarke as the best person to carry forward a modernising tory agenda and broaden the party 's appeal .
mr hendry previously backed david willetts , but disagreed with his decision to join david davis ' campaign .
15 september david " two brains " willetts looks poised to pull out of the leadership race and come out in favour of david davis .
but as one contender leaves the field , another one , edward leigh , says he is thinking about joining it to represent traditional moral values and radical ideas on issues like tax .
ken clarke meanwhile continues his series of speeches with a withering attack on tony blair 's " presidential " style of government .
and in another speech , his former cabinet colleague , sir malcolm rifkind , calls for a return to " one nation " conservatism to show the party does not just harbour sectional interests .
14 september david davis tries to appeal to both wings of the party by saying he wants to use right-wing methods to achieve the aims long-held by moderate conservatives .
ken clarke says the contest is now a two-horse race between him and mr davis . "
this is an idealism that brings together the various tory traditions , and gives us the route map to a healthy society . "
" david davis davis voices ' new tory idealism ' and he tells the times the conservatives would be in the wilderness for years to come if they rejected him simply because of his views on europe .
but in an interview for the daily telegraph , liam fox says the former chancellor is wrong to suggest europe is no longer an issue .
he insists he is in the running , saying he launched his campaign late to gather momentum in the run-up to october 's tory conference .
paperwatch mr clarke 's candidacy is a high-risk enterprise , according to peter riddell in the times .
he needs to bury the issue of europe and be more specific about public services , argues riddell , who says the ex-chancellor has at least shaken up the leadership race .
the independent sees mr davis ' latest speech as an attempt to shed his " right wing reputation " .
it is the rules for the contest which worry former tory chairman norman fowler .
in a letter to the daily telegraph , he warns that allowing only mps to choose the new leader will deprive many constituencies of a vote since they are not conservative-held seats .
11 september shadow foreign secretary liam fox says ken clarke 's stance against the iraq war undermines the morale of british troops .
and he says the tories would be an easy target if most of the front bench had supported the conflict and their leader opposed it .
9 september conservative chairman francis maude tells bbc radio west midlands the party will do its " damnedest " to get a new leader elected by christmas - even if party members reject plans to give up the final say in the contest and let mps decide .
paperwatch : the mirror says michael howard is set to resign as leader within weeks - probably at the party conference .
it would be a final blow for the tory leader if the proposed election rule change is voted down , an unnamed source tells the paper .
the sun says liam fox believes he has the " x-factor " needed to lead his party back into power - and it says the ex-gp as both youth and experience on his side as he tries to cure tory ailments .
but dr fox is branded a " long shot " in the guardian and a " no hoper " in the daily mail , although the paper 's diary column suggests he has more support than david cameron .
the daily telegraph suggests ken clarke has made gordon brown " jittery " by attacking the " myth " of the chancellor 's economic success .
the speech prompted a " savage attack " on mr clarke from ed balls , mr brown 's former right-hand-man at the treasury , it says .
the times says mr clarke took a gamble by suggesting he would be unlikely to make early cuts to income tax .
and the paper muses that it could be another 100 days before the leadership contest is decided .
8 september liam fox throws his hat into the ring on thursday launching his bid to succeed michael howard .
he says he has the support necessary to fight the campaign .
dr fox used an article in the daily telegraph to explain the themes of his campaign .
he wrote : " this is what my leadership would be about - sound defence ; keeping more of what you earn ; less government interference in people 's lives ; a sense of family , community and respect for the law ; britain controlling its own destiny .
ken clarke meanwhile will use a speech at city university in london to attack gordon brown 's economic record .
that 's a theme also explored by david davis in an article in the scotsman newspaper .
mr davis , who has yet to formally declare his candidature , attacked the chancellor 's economic " seven deadly sins " .
sir malcolm rifkind meanwhile continues his tour of britain during which he is hoping to woo the conservative rank and file .
6 september dismissive noises from the davis and cameron camps as a newsnight poll suggests ken clarke is by far the most popular potential leadership candidate with the public . "
of those questioned , 40 % said mr clarke would make the best leader " clarke is voter favourite - poll cameron supporter michael gove tells the bbc it is purely because clarke is the most recognisable contender - and a 70-year-old leader , clarke 's age at the next election , will not endear it to younger voters - sentiments echoed by friends of davis .
meanwhile , michael ancram , who long ago ruled out a leadership bid of his own , makes a more subtle swipe at mr clarke , a well known europhile despite his recent protestations , saying the conservatives must not ignore europe .
sir malcolm rifkind attempts to inject some momentum into his bid by embarking on a nationwide tour .
liam fox announces the appointment of two former central office spin doctors to work on his campaign .
paperwatch : michael brown writing in the independent urges a clarke-led tory party to embrace proportional representation .
" if ken clarke can dump the euro , could he not do the same over the electoral system ? " , he says .
the sun says major party donor michael ashcroft is among the tory grandees " lining up to wreck plans by michael howard and francis maude to deny party members a vote in the leadership contest " .
lord ashcroft reportedly criticised the scheme at a meeting on saturday .
5 september he may be the favourite at the bookies , but david davis continues to remain cryptic over whether he will actually stand .
on the today programme he refuses to declare his hand , but says : " you do n't meddle with the referee just before you go on the pitch . "
meanwhile , speculation continues to mount over whether grass roots members will reject plans to give mps the final say over who will succeed michael howard .
mr howard 's surprise appearance at a meeting of constituency chairmen at the weekend was seen by some as evidence of growing anxiety that a full ballot of members will be required - potentially dragging out the contest until late january .
meanwhile , ken clarke 's leadership rivals are sharpening their claws .
in a pointed reference to mr clarke 's age , liam fox who is expected to formally launch his leadership bid this week , tells the news of the world : " i am 43 ... i can provide a leadership that is relevant to all sections of the party and can reach out to our younger members and mps . "
sir malcolm rifkind criticises mr clarke 's past enthusiasm for the euro .
former conservative chairman , lord tebbit , not in the running for the leadership but still an influential figure in the party , calls mr clarke " lazy " - a charge refuted by former cabinet minister stephen dorrell , who said that far from being yesterday 's man , mr clarke was the man for tomorrow .
paperwatch : former chancellor norman lamont , writing in the times , backs mr clarke , saying he may have got some big issues wrong - " but he has got one issue completely right - iraq " .
latest betting : david davis 8/13 , ken clarke 5/2 , david cameron 11/2 , liam fox 20/1 , malcolm rifkind 33/1 -lrb- source : politicalbetting.com -rrb- 2 september party chairman francis maude warns the conservatives risk a repeat of the " disastrous " iain duncan smith years if they deny mps the final say on who should replace michael howard .
the daily telegraph , says the comments are a sign of mr maude 's " growing alarm " that his plans to remove the decisive vote from party members will be rejected in a ballot .
the paper attacks mr maude in an editorial , arguing ordinary party members rather than the " jostling careerists who represent so many of them " should " in some measure " be the final arbiters .
disgraced former tory mp jonathan aitken wades into the debate over the party 's future , telling michael howard in an interview with the e-politix website the delayed contest " has had a negative impact on the fortunes of the conservative party " .
paperwatch : ken clarke 's speech attacking tony blair 's iraq policy could shift the issue centre stage , says peter riddell in the the times .
opposition to the war needs to be more than a lib dem issue , he argues .
writing in the the daily telegraph veteran journalist and former tory mp bill deedes backs ken clarke , arguing it is high time there was an effective opposition and mr clarke is the best man to lead it .
" like a good surgeon , he knows where to put the knife , " argues mr deedes .
1 september known as a man ready to cross the street to join a fight , ken clarke shapes up for a " blistering attack " on tony blair over the iraq war - something he opposed .
but he does not have the limelight all to himself as david cameron breaks his holiday to make what aides insist is a long-planned speech calling for tax relief on childcare . "
a source close to mr clarke said his speech would be blistering " war ' catastrophic error ' the uk independence party backs the pro-europe mr clarke for the leadership " so the public know where the tories stand " .
paperwatch : spectator editor boris johnson says the magazine will be backing david cameron as next leader - notwithstanding political editor peter oborne 's praise for mr clarke while the editor enjoyed his summer holiday .
the times says ken 's clarke 's bid is a triumph of " ambition over evidence " .
he might leave rivals in his wake in a contest for tory " prime bloke " but to be prime minister he is too divisive and has given little indication he has imaginative ideas for the economy and public services , it says .
such criticisms are echoed in the sun , george pascoe-watson , who says mr clarke has infuriated many mps with his views on iraq and the euro and by standing may split " moderate " tories .
with mr clarke 's " blokeishness " a topic of debate in all the papers , the financial times says merely " being ken " will not be enough .
it says it will be listening this summer to see if he sets out a prospectus for government .
the daily mirror says britain is crying out for effective opposition and mr clarke can deliver it .
but the paper 's words come with a sting : " good he may be , but ken clarke is still a tory " , it says , recalling his battles with ambulancemen in the 1980s .

30 september former party treasurer lord kalms says ken clarke would be " totally unacceptable " as leader because of his pro-european views .
the david davis supporter said it was " grossly misleading to pretend " that europe was no longer central to the political agenda .
" it will always remain one of the major issues of conservatism that we are eurosceptic , " he added .
mr clarke insists the european constitution is dead and there is no prospect of the uk adopting the euro in the next 10 years .
who 's in the running ?
guide to the likely contenders paperwatch : the daily mail calls the launch of the david davis and david cameron campaigns the " battle of the tory blairalikes " .
meanwhile , the daily telegraph likens the contest to one between a " bash street kid " and " little lord fauntleroy " .
simon hoggart in the guardian writes : " both candidates were articulate and clear about what kind of people they are .
they were much less clear on policies . "
but the independent is impressed by cameron 's speech , calling him a " real-world tory , who despises the radicalism of easy answers " .
however , the times is not happy : " two davids running for leader is two too many .
it is confusing and indicates a lack of choice . " 29 september the front runner david davis finally formally enters the leadership contest under the slogan of modern conservatives , pledging " to show that we are not in politics for ourselves .
we are not here to defend privilege or accept the status quo .
we have a real purpose to change britain and improve lives " .
an hour later david cameron the 38-year-old shadow education secretary launched his campaign under the slogan change to win saying the problem is that people " do n't yet trust the conservative party ... what we have to do is make a change in the culture and identity of the conservative party and explain what this means today . "
paperwatch : the sun warns , in a leader column headlined ' danger man ' , that ken clarke would split the conservative party over europe if made leader and even if he did n't , and became pm he would end britain 's noble history as a sovereign state " .
the daily telegraph quotes the campaign slogans change to win , time to win and modern conservatism , before saying that " thankfully it is not a caption-writing competition " .
they then contrast that with liam fox 's pledge to take the conservatives out of the european people 's party group in the european parliament - saying it would be a big step towards the conservative party " recovering its electability " .
28 september the shadow boxing is finally over and campaigning is starting in earnest .
and it looks like ken clarke might be taking the healthy options as battle begins .
asked about including water and fruit juice instead of junk foods in school vending machines , mr clarke laughs : " i do drink a lot of fruit juice actually - man can not live on alcohol alone . "
as the former chancellor launches his campaign to woo grass roots members , bookmakers ' favourite david davis is meeting tory members in wales .
and sir malcolm rifkind 's visit to worcestershire is taking in morgan cars as the contenders vie to be in the two-seater ballot put before the whole party .
what are the rules ?
new leader due to be chosen after conservative conference in october more on the leadership rules paperwatch : the daily telegraph says the vote on the leadership rules means the party will be leaderless for another three months , but is pleased the " silliness " over the rule change is over .
" get on with it " , is the times ' plea to the tories .
it warns that allowing the contest to slip into the new year would make the party look indulgent and negligent .
its impatience is shared by the daily express , which says the tories need to elect somebody quickly to hold the prime minister to account .
the daily mail says supporters of rivals to david davis believe the prolonged race gives the frontrunner more time to make a mistake .
the guardian is among those who believe the rules vote boosts ken clarke 's chances .
the paper 's leader writers warn : " as a tea party this contest would be wilder than the mad hatter and as a way of doing politics it has become entirely self-destructive . " 27 september it is decision day on the rules which will be used to choose the next conservative party leader .
mps , euro mps and senior conservative party figures across the country have been voting on whether mps or the wider party membership should have the final say on choosing michael howard 's successor .
the result of the vote is a blow for mr howard as the change of rules is rejected .
26 september it 's a relatively quiet start to the week , with the labour party conference starting and only a day to go before the result of the vote on the conservative leadership election rules .
this vote will decide essentially whether tory mps , or the wider party membership , will choose the new leader .
out-going leader michael howard is making a speech in which he says immigrants should embrace the british way of life : " we need to instil into all british children , whatever their religion or skin colour , a sense of pride in our institutions and our way of life . " 25 september exchanges between the rival camps have become more direct and personal than previously during the campaign , with ken clarke backer john bercow saying david davis ' right-wing agenda would be a " lethal injection " into the party .
however , choosing mr clarke would be a form of " national suicide , " according to shadow education secretary david cameron .
but mr bercow described these remarks as " ludicrous hyperbole " .
mr cameron 's combination of " eton , hunting , shooting and lunch at whites " made him the wrong man for the job , he added .
meanwhile , shadow foreign secretary and fellow leadership rival liam fox has said the tax burden on hard-working people in britain must be reduced .
europe was the issue blamed for ken clarke 's defeat in the 2001 leadership election , now the debate is whether the issue still really matters .
mr clarke has argued there is no prospect of the uk adopting the euro in the next decade and declared the constitution dead .
but david davis hit back at that view in a speech to chatham house , saying it is plainly wrong to say europe is not a current issue .
yet another mp , foreign affairs spokesman keith simpson , has been enlisted to support mr davis .
meanwhile , conservative leader michael howard denied it would be farcical if a change to the election rules is rejected next week .
he says the summer has seen his party have a good debate about its future direction for the first time in 30 years .
22 september michael howard has scotched speculation he might quit next week if the party does not change its leadership election rules .
instead , the tory leader says he will resign immediately after the party 's conference - probably on 7 october .
his comments essentially mean he is sticking to the timetable envisaged when he first said he would stand down after may 's general election defeat .
mr howard will stay on as caretaker leader until his successor is chosen .
with voting on the leadership rules almost over , conservative chairman francis maude has suggested future elections could follow the style of us primaries .
that would give a say to tory supporters , as well as party members .
21 september we have waited months for a leadership campaign launch from david davis and david cameron - and now two could come along at once .
mr cameron plans to make his official pitch for the job next thursday .
it seems mr davis might want to launch on the same day and his allies have apparently been trying to persuade mr cameron to shift dates .
but a cameron aide says : " we have long planned to launch our campaign before conference and we are not sure why david davis has subsequently chosen to launch on the same day .
at least by going head to head , people will be able to weigh up the choice in this contest and we think that is a good thing . "
the financial times suggests mr davis could eventually choose to postpone his launch until next friday but his aide said no launch date had been confirmed .
" wait and see is our line , " said the aide .
mr davis has signed up another mp behind his campaign - richard ottaway , who backed ken clarke in previous leadership contests .
meanwhile , sir malcolm rifkind has dismissed suggestions he was preparing to stand down in favour of mr clarke .
the " one nation " former foreign secretary told bbc 2 's daily politics : " i am a candidate ...
i have got substantial support because i represent an important point of view within the conservative party . "
if the leadership field was not crowded enough already , brace yourself for the entry of yet another contender .
tory deputy leader michael ancram is rumoured to be considering entering the race .
newspaper reports suggest mr ancram could get backing from the cornerstone group of traditionalist tory mps , some of whom have asked edward leigh to stand .
20 september former foreign secretary sir malcolm rifkind says gordon brown needs to take over the keys from number 10 as soon as possible to rescue britain 's foreign policy .
sir malcolm tells tory meps in brussels : " britain 's foreign policy objectives can now only be served by a new prime minister not burdened by the crass failures of the last eight years . "
he says mr blair 's european policy has collapsed around him , with britain as " semi-detached " as ever in europe .
but former tory media chief nick wood tells bbc 2 's daily politics he has heard suggestions that sir malcolm is preparing to pull out of the contest and back ken clarke .
in westminster , david davis ' campaign was bolstered by party deputy chairman andrew mackay declaring him " the ideal candidate " to be the next prime minister .
paperwatch in the daily telegraph , columnist alice thomson says ken clarke is counting on mps being so desperate for power they will back him .
" but tory mps are n't obsessed by getting into downing street , " she warns .
" many have become quite comfortable with their life in opposition and their directorships . "
in the times martin samuel says tony blair views the tory ken in the same way he used to see ken livingstone : as someone he treats with disdain but really fears .
19 september the david davis leadership bid gets a start-the-week boost as six tory mps back him in a letter sent to the times .
the six include robert syms , who backed ken clarke in 2001 .
the other five are richard bacon , michael fallon , tim loughton , mark simmons and ian liddell-grainger .
18 september liam fox told the mail on sunday he would favour a cut in the legal limit for abortions to just 12 weeks .
the shadow foreign secretary said : " a society which aborts 180,000 unborn children every year is a society that needs to be asking a lot of questions about itself . "
rival ken clarke said the limit needs to be looked at again in light of medical advances but disagreed with dr fox 's limit .
on the bbc 's new sunday am show he warned : " if the conservative right brings in more of the sort of certain republican right american politics to the politics of the conservative party they will be making a serious mistake . " 16 september tory vice-chairman charles hendry names ken clarke as the best person to carry forward a modernising tory agenda and broaden the party 's appeal .
mr hendry previously backed david willetts , but disagreed with his decision to join david davis ' campaign .
15 september david " two brains " willetts looks poised to pull out of the leadership race and come out in favour of david davis .
but as one contender leaves the field , another one , edward leigh , says he is thinking about joining it to represent traditional moral values and radical ideas on issues like tax .
ken clarke meanwhile continues his series of speeches with a withering attack on tony blair 's " presidential " style of government .
and in another speech , his former cabinet colleague , sir malcolm rifkind , calls for a return to " one nation " conservatism to show the party does not just harbour sectional interests .
14 september david davis tries to appeal to both wings of the party by saying he wants to use right-wing methods to achieve the aims long-held by moderate conservatives .
ken clarke says the contest is now a two-horse race between him and mr davis .
this is an idealism that brings together the various tory traditions , and gives us the route map to a healthy society . "
david davis davis voices ' new tory idealism ' and he tells the times the conservatives would be in the wilderness for years to come if they rejected him simply because of his views on europe .
but in an interview for the daily telegraph , liam fox says the former chancellor is wrong to suggest europe is no longer an issue .
he insists he is in the running , saying he launched his campaign late to gather momentum in the run-up to october 's tory conference .
paperwatch mr clarke 's candidacy is a high-risk enterprise , according to peter riddell in the times .
he needs to bury the issue of europe and be more specific about public services , argues riddell , who says the ex-chancellor has at least shaken up the leadership race .
the independent sees mr davis ' latest speech as an attempt to shed his " right wing reputation " .
it is the rules for the contest which worry former tory chairman norman fowler .
in a letter to the daily telegraph , he warns that allowing only mps to choose the new leader will deprive many constituencies of a vote since they are not conservative-held seats .
11 september shadow foreign secretary liam fox says ken clarke 's stance against the iraq war undermines the morale of british troops .
and he says the tories would be an easy target if most of the front bench had supported the conflict and their leader opposed it .
9 september conservative chairman francis maude tells bbc radio west midlands the party will do its " damnedest " to get a new leader elected by christmas - even if party members reject plans to give up the final say in the contest and let mps decide .
paperwatch : the mirror says michael howard is set to resign as leader within weeks - probably at the party conference .
it would be a final blow for the tory leader if the proposed election rule change is voted down , an unnamed source tells the paper .
the sun says liam fox believes he has the " x-factor " needed to lead his party back into power - and it says the ex-gp as both youth and experience on his side as he tries to cure tory ailments .
but dr fox is branded a " long shot " in the guardian and a " no hoper " in the daily mail , although the paper 's diary column suggests he has more support than david cameron .
the daily telegraph suggests ken clarke has made gordon brown " jittery " by attacking the " myth " of the chancellor 's economic success .
the speech prompted a " savage attack " on mr clarke from ed balls , mr brown 's former right-hand-man at the treasury , it says .
the times says mr clarke took a gamble by suggesting he would be unlikely to make early cuts to income tax .
and the paper muses that it could be another 100 days before the leadership contest is decided .
8 september liam fox throws his hat into the ring on thursday launching his bid to succeed michael howard .
he says he has the support necessary to fight the campaign .
dr fox used an article in the daily telegraph to explain the themes of his campaign .
he wrote : " this is what my leadership would be about - sound defence ; keeping more of what you earn ; less government interference in people 's lives ; a sense of family , community and respect for the law ; britain controlling its own destiny .
ken clarke meanwhile will use a speech at city university in london to attack gordon brown 's economic record .
that 's a theme also explored by david davis in an article in the scotsman newspaper .
mr davis , who has yet to formally declare his candidature , attacked the chancellor 's economic " seven deadly sins " .
sir malcolm rifkind meanwhile continues his tour of britain during which he is hoping to woo the conservative rank and file .
6 september dismissive noises from the davis and cameron camps as a newsnight poll suggests ken clarke is by far the most popular potential leadership candidate with the public .
of those questioned , 40 % said mr clarke would make the best leader clarke is voter favourite - poll cameron supporter michael gove tells the bbc it is purely because clarke is the most recognisable contender - and a 70-year-old leader , clarke 's age at the next election , will not endear it to younger voters - sentiments echoed by friends of davis .
meanwhile , michael ancram , who long ago ruled out a leadership bid of his own , makes a more subtle swipe at mr clarke , a well known europhile despite his recent protestations , saying the conservatives must not ignore europe .
sir malcolm rifkind attempts to inject some momentum into his bid by embarking on a nationwide tour .
liam fox announces the appointment of two former central office spin doctors to work on his campaign .
paperwatch : michael brown writing in the independent urges a clarke-led tory party to embrace proportional representation .
" if ken clarke can dump the euro , could he not do the same over the electoral system ? " , he says .
the sun says major party donor michael ashcroft is among the tory grandees " lining up to wreck plans by michael howard and francis maude to deny party members a vote in the leadership contest " .
lord ashcroft reportedly criticised the scheme at a meeting on saturday .
5 september he may be the favourite at the bookies , but david davis continues to remain cryptic over whether he will actually stand .
on the today programme he refuses to declare his hand , but says : " you do n't meddle with the referee just before you go on the pitch . "
meanwhile , speculation continues to mount over whether grass roots members will reject plans to give mps the final say over who will succeed michael howard .
mr howard 's surprise appearance at a meeting of constituency chairmen at the weekend was seen by some as evidence of growing anxiety that a full ballot of members will be required - potentially dragging out the contest until late january .
meanwhile , ken clarke 's leadership rivals are sharpening their claws .
in a pointed reference to mr clarke 's age , liam fox who is expected to formally launch his leadership bid this week , tells the news of the world : " i am 43 ... i can provide a leadership that is relevant to all sections of the party and can reach out to our younger members and mps . "
sir malcolm rifkind criticises mr clarke 's past enthusiasm for the euro .
former conservative chairman , lord tebbit , not in the running for the leadership but still an influential figure in the party , calls mr clarke " lazy " - a charge refuted by former cabinet minister stephen dorrell , who said that far from being yesterday 's man , mr clarke was the man for tomorrow .
paperwatch : former chancellor norman lamont , writing in the times , backs mr clarke , saying he may have got some big issues wrong - " but he has got one issue completely right - iraq " .
latest betting : david davis 8/13 , ken clarke 5/2 , david cameron 11/2 , liam fox 20/1 , malcolm rifkind 33/1 -lrb- source : politicalbetting.com -rrb- 2 september party chairman francis maude warns the conservatives risk a repeat of the " disastrous " iain duncan smith years if they deny mps the final say on who should replace michael howard .
the daily telegraph , says the comments are a sign of mr maude 's " growing alarm " that his plans to remove the decisive vote from party members will be rejected in a ballot .
the paper attacks mr maude in an editorial , arguing ordinary party members rather than the " jostling careerists who represent so many of them " should " in some measure " be the final arbiters .
disgraced former tory mp jonathan aitken wades into the debate over the party 's future , telling michael howard in an interview with the e-politix website the delayed contest " has had a negative impact on the fortunes of the conservative party " .
paperwatch : ken clarke 's speech attacking tony blair 's iraq policy could shift the issue centre stage , says peter riddell in the the times .
opposition to the war needs to be more than a lib dem issue , he argues .
writing in the the daily telegraph veteran journalist and former tory mp bill deedes backs ken clarke , arguing it is high time there was an effective opposition and mr clarke is the best man to lead it .
" like a good surgeon , he knows where to put the knife , " argues mr deedes .
1 september known as a man ready to cross the street to join a fight , ken clarke shapes up for a " blistering attack " on tony blair over the iraq war - something he opposed .
but he does not have the limelight all to himself as david cameron breaks his holiday to make what aides insist is a long-planned speech calling for tax relief on childcare .
a source close to mr clarke said his speech would be blistering war ' catastrophic error ' the uk independence party backs the pro-europe mr clarke for the leadership " so the public know where the tories stand " .
paperwatch : spectator editor boris johnson says the magazine will be backing david cameron as next leader - notwithstanding political editor peter oborne 's praise for mr clarke while the editor enjoyed his summer holiday .
the times says ken 's clarke 's bid is a triumph of " ambition over evidence " .
he might leave rivals in his wake in a contest for tory " prime bloke " but to be prime minister he is too divisive and has given little indication he has imaginative ideas for the economy and public services , it says .
such criticisms are echoed in the sun , george pascoe-watson , who says mr clarke has infuriated many mps with his views on iraq and the euro and by standing may split " moderate " tories .
with mr clarke 's " blokeishness " a topic of debate in all the papers , the financial times says merely " being ken " will not be enough .
it says it will be listening this summer to see if he sets out a prospectus for government .
the daily mirror says britain is crying out for effective opposition and mr clarke can deliver it .
but the paper 's words come with a sting : " good he may be , but ken clarke is still a tory " , it says , recalling his battles with ambulancemen in the 1980s .
daily express political editor , patrick o 'flynn predicts other candidates will drop by the wayside to leave mr clarke to take david davis to the wire " .
but although the leadership contest may be just catching light , the paper says it seems to have been going on interminably already and the sooner it is over , the better .

he says mr blair 's european policy has collapsed around him , with britain as " semi-detached " as ever in europe .
but former tory media chief nick wood tells bbc 2 's daily politics he has heard suggestions that sir malcolm is preparing to pull out of the contest and back ken clarke .
in westminster , david davis ' campaign was bolstered by party deputy chairman andrew mackay declaring him " the ideal candidate " to be the next prime minister .
paperwatch in the daily telegraph , columnist alice thomson says ken clarke is counting on mps being so desperate for power they will back him .
" but tory mps are n't obsessed by getting into downing street , " she warns .
" many have become quite comfortable with their life in opposition and their directorships . "
in the times martin samuel says tony blair views the tory ken in the same way he used to see ken livingstone : as someone he treats with disdain but really fears .
19 september the david davis leadership bid gets a start-the-week boost as six tory mps back him in a letter sent to the times .
the six include robert syms , who backed ken clarke in 2001 .
the other five are richard bacon , michael fallon , tim loughton , mark simmons and ian liddell-grainger .
18 september liam fox told the mail on sunday he would favour a cut in the legal limit for abortions to just 12 weeks .
the shadow foreign secretary said : " a society which aborts 180,000 unborn children every year is a society that needs to be asking a lot of questions about itself . "
rival ken clarke said the limit needs to be looked at again in light of medical advances but disagreed with dr fox 's limit .
on the bbc 's new sunday am show he warned : " if the conservative right brings in more of the sort of certain republican right american politics to the politics of the conservative party they will be making a serious mistake . " 16 september tory vice-chairman charles hendry names ken clarke as the best person to carry forward a modernising tory agenda and broaden the party 's appeal .
mr hendry previously backed david willetts , but disagreed with his decision to join david davis ' campaign .
15 september david " two brains " willetts looks poised to pull out of the leadership race and come out in favour of david davis .
but as one contender leaves the field , another one , edward leigh , says he is thinking about joining it to represent traditional moral values and radical ideas on issues like tax .
ken clarke meanwhile continues his series of speeches with a withering attack on tony blair 's " presidential " style of government .
and in another speech , his former cabinet colleague , sir malcolm rifkind , calls for a return to " one nation " conservatism to show the party does not just harbour sectional interests .
14 september david davis tries to appeal to both wings of the party by saying he wants to use right-wing methods to achieve the aims long-held by moderate conservatives .
ken clarke says the contest is now a two-horse race between him and mr davis .
this is an idealism that brings together the various tory traditions , and gives us the route map to a healthy society . "
david davis davis voices ' new tory idealism ' and he tells the times the conservatives would be in the wilderness for years to come if they rejected him simply because of his views on europe .
but in an interview for the daily telegraph , liam fox says the former chancellor is wrong to suggest europe is no longer an issue .
he insists he is in the running , saying he launched his campaign late to gather momentum in the run-up to october 's tory conference .
paperwatch mr clarke 's candidacy is a high-risk enterprise , according to peter riddell in the times .
he needs to bury the issue of europe and be more specific about public services , argues riddell , who says the ex-chancellor has at least shaken up the leadership race .
the independent sees mr davis ' latest speech as an attempt to shed his " right wing reputation " .
it is the rules for the contest which worry former tory chairman norman fowler .
in a letter to the daily telegraph , he warns that allowing only mps to choose the new leader will deprive many constituencies of a vote since they are not conservative-held seats .
11 september shadow foreign secretary liam fox says ken clarke 's stance against the iraq war undermines the morale of british troops .
and he says the tories would be an easy target if most of the front bench had supported the conflict and their leader opposed it .
9 september conservative chairman francis maude tells bbc radio west midlands the party will do its " damnedest " to get a new leader elected by christmas - even if party members reject plans to give up the final say in the contest and let mps decide .
paperwatch : the mirror says michael howard is set to resign as leader within weeks - probably at the party conference .
it would be a final blow for the tory leader if the proposed election rule change is voted down , an unnamed source tells the paper .
the sun says liam fox believes he has the " x-factor " needed to lead his party back into power - and it says the ex-gp as both youth and experience on his side as he tries to cure tory ailments .
but dr fox is branded a " long shot " in the guardian and a " no hoper " in the daily mail , although the paper 's diary column suggests he has more support than david cameron .
the daily telegraph suggests ken clarke has made gordon brown " jittery " by attacking the " myth " of the chancellor 's economic success .
the speech prompted a " savage attack " on mr clarke from ed balls , mr brown 's former right-hand-man at the treasury , it says .
the times says mr clarke took a gamble by suggesting he would be unlikely to make early cuts to income tax .
and the paper muses that it could be another 100 days before the leadership contest is decided .
8 september liam fox throws his hat into the ring on thursday launching his bid to succeed michael howard .
he says he has the support necessary to fight the campaign .
dr fox used an article in the daily telegraph to explain the themes of his campaign .
he wrote : " this is what my leadership would be about - sound defence ; keeping more of what you earn ; less government interference in people 's lives ; a sense of family , community and respect for the law ; britain controlling its own destiny .
ken clarke meanwhile will use a speech at city university in london to attack gordon brown 's economic record .
that 's a theme also explored by david davis in an article in the scotsman newspaper .
mr davis , who has yet to formally declare his candidature , attacked the chancellor 's economic " seven deadly sins " .
sir malcolm rifkind meanwhile continues his tour of britain during which he is hoping to woo the conservative rank and file .
6 september dismissive noises from the davis and cameron camps as a newsnight poll suggests ken clarke is by far the most popular potential leadership candidate with the public .
of those questioned , 40 % said mr clarke would make the best leader clarke is voter favourite - poll cameron supporter michael gove tells the bbc it is purely because clarke is the most recognisable contender - and a 70-year-old leader , clarke 's age at the next election , will not endear it to younger voters - sentiments echoed by friends of davis .
meanwhile , michael ancram , who long ago ruled out a leadership bid of his own , makes a more subtle swipe at mr clarke , a well known europhile despite his recent protestations , saying the conservatives must not ignore europe .
sir malcolm rifkind attempts to inject some momentum into his bid by embarking on a nationwide tour .
liam fox announces the appointment of two former central office spin doctors to work on his campaign .
paperwatch : michael brown writing in the independent urges a clarke-led tory party to embrace proportional representation .
" if ken clarke can dump the euro , could he not do the same over the electoral system ? " , he says .
the sun says major party donor michael ashcroft is among the tory grandees " lining up to wreck plans by michael howard and francis maude to deny party members a vote in the leadership contest " .
lord ashcroft reportedly criticised the scheme at a meeting on saturday .
5 september he may be the favourite at the bookies , but david davis continues to remain cryptic over whether he will actually stand .
on the today programme he refuses to declare his hand , but says : " you do n't meddle with the referee just before you go on the pitch . "
meanwhile , speculation continues to mount over whether grass roots members will reject plans to give mps the final say over who will succeed michael howard .
mr howard 's surprise appearance at a meeting of constituency chairmen at the weekend was seen by some as evidence of growing anxiety that a full ballot of members will be required - potentially dragging out the contest until late january .
meanwhile , ken clarke 's leadership rivals are sharpening their claws .
in a pointed reference to mr clarke 's age , liam fox who is expected to formally launch his leadership bid this week , tells the news of the world : " i am 43 ... i can provide a leadership that is relevant to all sections of the party and can reach out to our younger members and mps . "
sir malcolm rifkind criticises mr clarke 's past enthusiasm for the euro .
former conservative chairman , lord tebbit , not in the running for the leadership but still an influential figure in the party , calls mr clarke " lazy " - a charge refuted by former cabinet minister stephen dorrell , who said that far from being yesterday 's man , mr clarke was the man for tomorrow .
paperwatch : former chancellor norman lamont , writing in the times , backs mr clarke , saying he may have got some big issues wrong - " but he has got one issue completely right - iraq " .
latest betting : david davis 8/13 , ken clarke 5/2 , david cameron 11/2 , liam fox 20/1 , malcolm rifkind 33/1 -lrb- source : politicalbetting.com -rrb- 2 september party chairman francis maude warns the conservatives risk a repeat of the " disastrous " iain duncan smith years if they deny mps the final say on who should replace michael howard .
the daily telegraph , says the comments are a sign of mr maude 's " growing alarm " that his plans to remove the decisive vote from party members will be rejected in a ballot .
the paper attacks mr maude in an editorial , arguing ordinary party members rather than the " jostling careerists who represent so many of them " should " in some measure " be the final arbiters .
disgraced former tory mp jonathan aitken wades into the debate over the party 's future , telling michael howard in an interview with the e-politix website the delayed contest " has had a negative impact on the fortunes of the conservative party " .
paperwatch : ken clarke 's speech attacking tony blair 's iraq policy could shift the issue centre stage , says peter riddell in the the times .
opposition to the war needs to be more than a lib dem issue , he argues .
writing in the the daily telegraph veteran journalist and former tory mp bill deedes backs ken clarke , arguing it is high time there was an effective opposition and mr clarke is the best man to lead it .
" like a good surgeon , he knows where to put the knife , " argues mr deedes .
1 september known as a man ready to cross the street to join a fight , ken clarke shapes up for a " blistering attack " on tony blair over the iraq war - something he opposed .
but he does not have the limelight all to himself as david cameron breaks his holiday to make what aides insist is a long-planned speech calling for tax relief on childcare .
a source close to mr clarke said his speech would be blistering war ' catastrophic error ' the uk independence party backs the pro-europe mr clarke for the leadership " so the public know where the tories stand " .
paperwatch : spectator editor boris johnson says the magazine will be backing david cameron as next leader - notwithstanding political editor peter oborne 's praise for mr clarke while the editor enjoyed his summer holiday .
the times says ken 's clarke 's bid is a triumph of " ambition over evidence " .
he might leave rivals in his wake in a contest for tory " prime bloke " but to be prime minister he is too divisive and has given little indication he has imaginative ideas for the economy and public services , it says .
such criticisms are echoed in the sun , george pascoe-watson , who says mr clarke has infuriated many mps with his views on iraq and the euro and by standing may split " moderate " tories .
with mr clarke 's " blokeishness " a topic of debate in all the papers , the financial times says merely " being ken " will not be enough .
it says it will be listening this summer to see if he sets out a prospectus for government .
the daily mirror says britain is crying out for effective opposition and mr clarke can deliver it .
but the paper 's words come with a sting : " good he may be , but ken clarke is still a tory " , it says , recalling his battles with ambulancemen in the 1980s .
daily express political editor , patrick o 'flynn predicts other candidates will drop by the wayside to leave mr clarke to take david davis to the wire " .
but although the leadership contest may be just catching light , the paper says it seems to have been going on interminably already and the sooner it is over , the better .

30 september former party treasurer lord kalms says ken clarke would be " totally unacceptable " as leader because of his pro-european views .
the david davis supporter said it was " grossly misleading to pretend " that europe was no longer central to the political agenda .
" it will always remain one of the major issues of conservatism that we are eurosceptic , " he added .
mr clarke insists the european constitution is dead and there is no prospect of the uk adopting the euro in the next 10 years .
who 's in the running ?
guide to the likely contenders paperwatch : the daily mail calls the launch of the david davis and david cameron campaigns the " battle of the tory blairalikes " .
meanwhile , the daily telegraph likens the contest to one between a " bash street kid " and " little lord fauntleroy " .
simon hoggart in the guardian writes : " both candidates were articulate and clear about what kind of people they are .
they were much less clear on policies . "
but the independent is impressed by cameron 's speech , calling him a " real-world tory , who despises the radicalism of easy answers " .
however , the times is not happy : " two davids running for leader is two too many .
it is confusing and indicates a lack of choice . " 29 september the front runner david davis finally formally enters the leadership contest under the slogan of modern conservatives , pledging " to show that we are not in politics for ourselves .
we are not here to defend privilege or accept the status quo .
we have a real purpose to change britain and improve lives " .
an hour later david cameron the 38-year-old shadow education secretary launched his campaign under the slogan change to win saying the problem is that people " do n't yet trust the conservative party ... what we have to do is make a change in the culture and identity of the conservative party and explain what this means today . "
paperwatch : the sun warns , in a leader column headlined ' danger man ' , that ken clarke would split the conservative party over europe if made leader and even if he did n't , and became pm he would end britain 's noble history as a sovereign state " .
the daily telegraph quotes the campaign slogans change to win , time to win and modern conservatism , before saying that " thankfully it is not a caption-writing competition " .
they then contrast that with liam fox 's pledge to take the conservatives out of the european people 's party group in the european parliament - saying it would be a big step towards the conservative party " recovering its electability " .
28 september the shadow boxing is finally over and campaigning is starting in earnest .
and it looks like ken clarke might be taking the healthy options as battle begins .
asked about including water and fruit juice instead of junk foods in school vending machines , mr clarke laughs : " i do drink a lot of fruit juice actually - man can not live on alcohol alone . "
as the former chancellor launches his campaign to woo grass roots members , bookmakers ' favourite david davis is meeting tory members in wales .
and sir malcolm rifkind 's visit to worcestershire is taking in morgan cars as the contenders vie to be in the two-seater ballot put before the whole party .
what are the rules ?
new leader due to be chosen after conservative conference in october more on the leadership rules paperwatch : the daily telegraph says the vote on the leadership rules means the party will be leaderless for another three months , but is pleased the " silliness " over the rule change is over .
" get on with it " , is the times ' plea to the tories .
it warns that allowing the contest to slip into the new year would make the party look indulgent and negligent .
its impatience is shared by the daily express , which says the tories need to elect somebody quickly to hold the prime minister to account .
the daily mail says supporters of rivals to david davis believe the prolonged race gives the frontrunner more time to make a mistake .
the guardian is among those who believe the rules vote boosts ken clarke 's chances .
the paper 's leader writers warn : " as a tea party this contest would be wilder than the mad hatter and as a way of doing politics it has become entirely self-destructive . " 27 september it is decision day on the rules which will be used to choose the next conservative party leader .
mps , euro mps and senior conservative party figures across the country have been voting on whether mps or the wider party membership should have the final say on choosing michael howard 's successor .
the result of the vote is a blow for mr howard as the change of rules is rejected .
26 september it 's a relatively quiet start to the week , with the labour party conference starting and only a day to go before the result of the vote on the conservative leadership election rules .
this vote will decide essentially whether tory mps , or the wider party membership , will choose the new leader .
out-going leader michael howard is making a speech in which he says immigrants should embrace the british way of life : " we need to instil into all british children , whatever their religion or skin colour , a sense of pride in our institutions and our way of life . " 25 september exchanges between the rival camps have become more direct and personal than previously during the campaign , with ken clarke backer john bercow saying david davis ' right-wing agenda would be a " lethal injection " into the party .
however , choosing mr clarke would be a form of " national suicide , " according to shadow education secretary david cameron .
but mr bercow described these remarks as " ludicrous hyperbole " .
mr cameron 's combination of " eton , hunting , shooting and lunch at whites " made him the wrong man for the job , he added .
meanwhile , shadow foreign secretary and fellow leadership rival liam fox has said the tax burden on hard-working people in britain must be reduced .
europe was the issue blamed for ken clarke 's defeat in the 2001 leadership election , now the debate is whether the issue still really matters .
mr clarke has argued there is no prospect of the uk adopting the euro in the next decade and declared the constitution dead .
but david davis hit back at that view in a speech to chatham house , saying it is plainly wrong to say europe is not a current issue .
yet another mp , foreign affairs spokesman keith simpson , has been enlisted to support mr davis .
meanwhile , conservative leader michael howard denied it would be farcical if a change to the election rules is rejected next week .
he says the summer has seen his party have a good debate about its future direction for the first time in 30 years .
22 september michael howard has scotched speculation he might quit next week if the party does not change its leadership election rules .
instead , the tory leader says he will resign immediately after the party 's conference - probably on 7 october .
his comments essentially mean he is sticking to the timetable envisaged when he first said he would stand down after may 's general election defeat .
mr howard will stay on as caretaker leader until his successor is chosen .
with voting on the leadership rules almost over , conservative chairman francis maude has suggested future elections could follow the style of us primaries .
that would give a say to tory supporters , as well as party members .
21 september we have waited months for a leadership campaign launch from david davis and david cameron - and now two could come along at once .
mr cameron plans to make his official pitch for the job next thursday .
it seems mr davis might want to launch on the same day and his allies have apparently been trying to persuade mr cameron to shift dates .
but a cameron aide says : " we have long planned to launch our campaign before conference and we are not sure why david davis has subsequently chosen to launch on the same day .
at least by going head to head , people will be able to weigh up the choice in this contest and we think that is a good thing . "
the financial times suggests mr davis could eventually choose to postpone his launch until next friday but his aide said no launch date had been confirmed .
" wait and see is our line , " said the aide .
mr davis has signed up another mp behind his campaign - richard ottaway , who backed ken clarke in previous leadership contests .
meanwhile , sir malcolm rifkind has dismissed suggestions he was preparing to stand down in favour of mr clarke .
the " one nation " former foreign secretary told bbc 2 's daily politics : " i am a candidate ...
i have got substantial support because i represent an important point of view within the conservative party . "
if the leadership field was not crowded enough already , brace yourself for the entry of yet another contender .
tory deputy leader michael ancram is rumoured to be considering entering the race .
newspaper reports suggest mr ancram could get backing from the cornerstone group of traditionalist tory mps , some of whom have asked edward leigh to stand .
20 september former foreign secretary sir malcolm rifkind says gordon brown needs to take over the keys from number 10 as soon as possible to rescue britain 's foreign policy .
sir malcolm tells tory meps in brussels : " britain 's foreign policy objectives can now only be served by a new prime minister not burdened by the crass failures of the last eight years . "
he says mr blair 's european policy has collapsed around him , with britain as " semi-detached " as ever in europe .

30 september former party treasurer lord kalms says ken clarke would be " totally unacceptable " as leader because of his pro-european views .
the david davis supporter said it was " grossly misleading to pretend " that europe was no longer central to the political agenda .
" it will always remain one of the major issues of conservatism that we are eurosceptic , " he added .
mr clarke insists the european constitution is dead and there is no prospect of the uk adopting the euro in the next 10 years .
who 's in the running ?
guide to the likely contenders paperwatch : the daily mail calls the launch of the david davis and david cameron campaigns the " battle of the tory blairalikes " .
meanwhile , the daily telegraph likens the contest to one between a " bash street kid " and " little lord fauntleroy " .
simon hoggart in the guardian writes : " both candidates were articulate and clear about what kind of people they are .
they were much less clear on policies . "
but the independent is impressed by cameron 's speech , calling him a " real-world tory , who despises the radicalism of easy answers " .
however , the times is not happy : " two davids running for leader is two too many .
it is confusing and indicates a lack of choice . " 29 september the front runner david davis finally formally enters the leadership contest under the slogan of modern conservatives , pledging " to show that we are not in politics for ourselves .
we are not here to defend privilege or accept the status quo .
we have a real purpose to change britain and improve lives " .
an hour later david cameron the 38-year-old shadow education secretary launched his campaign under the slogan change to win saying the problem is that people " do n't yet trust the conservative party ... what we have to do is make a change in the culture and identity of the conservative party and explain what this means today . "
paperwatch : the sun warns , in a leader column headlined ' danger man ' , that ken clarke would split the conservative party over europe if made leader and even if he did n't , and became pm he would end britain 's noble history as a sovereign state " .
the daily telegraph quotes the campaign slogans change to win , time to win and modern conservatism , before saying that " thankfully it is not a caption-writing competition " .
they then contrast that with liam fox 's pledge to take the conservatives out of the european people 's party group in the european parliament - saying it would be a big step towards the conservative party " recovering its electability " .
28 september the shadow boxing is finally over and campaigning is starting in earnest .
and it looks like ken clarke might be taking the healthy options as battle begins .
asked about including water and fruit juice instead of junk foods in school vending machines , mr clarke laughs : " i do drink a lot of fruit juice actually - man can not live on alcohol alone . "
as the former chancellor launches his campaign to woo grass roots members , bookmakers ' favourite david davis is meeting tory members in wales .
and sir malcolm rifkind 's visit to worcestershire is taking in morgan cars as the contenders vie to be in the two-seater ballot put before the whole party .
what are the rules ?
new leader due to be chosen after conservative conference in october more on the leadership rules paperwatch : the daily telegraph says the vote on the leadership rules means the party will be leaderless for another three months , but is pleased the " silliness " over the rule change is over .
" get on with it " , is the times ' plea to the tories .
it warns that allowing the contest to slip into the new year would make the party look indulgent and negligent .
its impatience is shared by the daily express , which says the tories need to elect somebody quickly to hold the prime minister to account .
the daily mail says supporters of rivals to david davis believe the prolonged race gives the frontrunner more time to make a mistake .
the guardian is among those who believe the rules vote boosts ken clarke 's chances .
the paper 's leader writers warn : " as a tea party this contest would be wilder than the mad hatter and as a way of doing politics it has become entirely self-destructive . " 27 september it is decision day on the rules which will be used to choose the next conservative party leader .
mps , euro mps and senior conservative party figures across the country have been voting on whether mps or the wider party membership should have the final say on choosing michael howard 's successor .
the result of the vote is a blow for mr howard as the change of rules is rejected .
26 september it 's a relatively quiet start to the week , with the labour party conference starting and only a day to go before the result of the vote on the conservative leadership election rules .
this vote will decide essentially whether tory mps , or the wider party membership , will choose the new leader .
out-going leader michael howard is making a speech in which he says immigrants should embrace the british way of life : " we need to instil into all british children , whatever their religion or skin colour , a sense of pride in our institutions and our way of life . " 25 september exchanges between the rival camps have become more direct and personal than previously during the campaign , with ken clarke backer john bercow saying david davis ' right-wing agenda would be a " lethal injection " into the party .
however , choosing mr clarke would be a form of " national suicide , " according to shadow education secretary david cameron .
but mr bercow described these remarks as " ludicrous hyperbole " .
mr cameron 's combination of " eton , hunting , shooting and lunch at whites " made him the wrong man for the job , he added .
meanwhile , shadow foreign secretary and fellow leadership rival liam fox has said the tax burden on hard-working people in britain must be reduced .
europe was the issue blamed for ken clarke 's defeat in the 2001 leadership election , now the debate is whether the issue still really matters .
mr clarke has argued there is no prospect of the uk adopting the euro in the next decade and declared the constitution dead .
but david davis hit back at that view in a speech to chatham house , saying it is plainly wrong to say europe is not a current issue .
yet another mp , foreign affairs spokesman keith simpson , has been enlisted to support mr davis .
meanwhile , conservative leader michael howard denied it would be farcical if a change to the election rules is rejected next week .
he says the summer has seen his party have a good debate about its future direction for the first time in 30 years .
22 september michael howard has scotched speculation he might quit next week if the party does not change its leadership election rules .
instead , the tory leader says he will resign immediately after the party 's conference - probably on 7 october .
his comments essentially mean he is sticking to the timetable envisaged when he first said he would stand down after may 's general election defeat .
mr howard will stay on as caretaker leader until his successor is chosen .
with voting on the leadership rules almost over , conservative chairman francis maude has suggested future elections could follow the style of us primaries .
that would give a say to tory supporters , as well as party members .
21 september we have waited months for a leadership campaign launch from david davis and david cameron - and now two could come along at once .
mr cameron plans to make his official pitch for the job next thursday .
it seems mr davis might want to launch on the same day and his allies have apparently been trying to persuade mr cameron to shift dates .
but a cameron aide says : " we have long planned to launch our campaign before conference and we are not sure why david davis has subsequently chosen to launch on the same day .
at least by going head to head , people will be able to weigh up the choice in this contest and we think that is a good thing . "
the financial times suggests mr davis could eventually choose to postpone his launch until next friday but his aide said no launch date had been confirmed .
" wait and see is our line , " said the aide .
mr davis has signed up another mp behind his campaign - richard ottaway , who backed ken clarke in previous leadership contests .
meanwhile , sir malcolm rifkind has dismissed suggestions he was preparing to stand down in favour of mr clarke .
the " one nation " former foreign secretary told bbc 2 's daily politics : " i am a candidate ...
i have got substantial support because i represent an important point of view within the conservative party . "
if the leadership field was not crowded enough already , brace yourself for the entry of yet another contender .
tory deputy leader michael ancram is rumoured to be considering entering the race .
newspaper reports suggest mr ancram could get backing from the cornerstone group of traditionalist tory mps , some of whom have asked edward leigh to stand .
20 september former foreign secretary sir malcolm rifkind says gordon brown needs to take over the keys from number 10 as soon as possible to rescue britain 's foreign policy .
sir malcolm tells tory meps in brussels : " britain 's foreign policy objectives can now only be served by a new prime minister not burdened by the crass failures of the last eight years . "
he says mr blair 's european policy has collapsed around him , with britain as " semi-detached " as ever in europe .
but former tory media chief nick wood tells bbc 2 's daily politics he has heard suggestions that sir malcolm is preparing to pull out of the contest and back ken clarke .
in westminster , david davis ' campaign was bolstered by party deputy chairman andrew mackay declaring him " the ideal candidate " to be the next prime minister .
paperwatch in the daily telegraph , columnist alice thomson says ken clarke is counting on mps being so desperate for power they will back him .
" but tory mps are n't obsessed by getting into downing street , " she warns .
" many have become quite comfortable with their life in opposition and their directorships . "
in the times martin samuel says tony blair views the tory ken in the same way he used to see ken livingstone : as someone he treats with disdain but really fears .
19 september the david davis leadership bid gets a start-the-week boost as six tory mps back him in a letter sent to the times .
the six include robert syms , who backed ken clarke in 2001 .
the other five are richard bacon , michael fallon , tim loughton , mark simmons and ian liddell-grainger .
18 september liam fox told the mail on sunday he would favour a cut in the legal limit for abortions to just 12 weeks .
the shadow foreign secretary said : " a society which aborts 180,000 unborn children every year is a society that needs to be asking a lot of questions about itself . "
rival ken clarke said the limit needs to be looked at again in light of medical advances but disagreed with dr fox 's limit .
on the bbc 's new sunday am show he warned : " if the conservative right brings in more of the sort of certain republican right american politics to the politics of the conservative party they will be making a serious mistake . " 16 september tory vice-chairman charles hendry names ken clarke as the best person to carry forward a modernising tory agenda and broaden the party 's appeal .
mr hendry previously backed david willetts , but disagreed with his decision to join david davis ' campaign .
15 september david " two brains " willetts looks poised to pull out of the leadership race and come out in favour of david davis .
but as one contender leaves the field , another one , edward leigh , says he is thinking about joining it to represent traditional moral values and radical ideas on issues like tax .
ken clarke meanwhile continues his series of speeches with a withering attack on tony blair 's " presidential " style of government .
and in another speech , his former cabinet colleague , sir malcolm rifkind , calls for a return to " one nation " conservatism to show the party does not just harbour sectional interests .
14 september david davis tries to appeal to both wings of the party by saying he wants to use right-wing methods to achieve the aims long-held by moderate conservatives .
ken clarke says the contest is now a two-horse race between him and mr davis .
this is an idealism that brings together the various tory traditions , and gives us the route map to a healthy society . "
david davis davis voices ' new tory idealism ' and he tells the times the conservatives would be in the wilderness for years to come if they rejected him simply because of his views on europe .
but in an interview for the daily telegraph , liam fox says the former chancellor is wrong to suggest europe is no longer an issue .
he insists he is in the running , saying he launched his campaign late to gather momentum in the run-up to october 's tory conference .
paperwatch mr clarke 's candidacy is a high-risk enterprise , according to peter riddell in the times .
he needs to bury the issue of europe and be more specific about public services , argues riddell , who says the ex-chancellor has at least shaken up the leadership race .
the independent sees mr davis ' latest speech as an attempt to shed his " right wing reputation " .
it is the rules for the contest which worry former tory chairman norman fowler .
in a letter to the daily telegraph , he warns that allowing only mps to choose the new leader will deprive many constituencies of a vote since they are not conservative-held seats .
11 september shadow foreign secretary liam fox says ken clarke 's stance against the iraq war undermines the morale of british troops .
and he says the tories would be an easy target if most of the front bench had supported the conflict and their leader opposed it .
9 september conservative chairman francis maude tells bbc radio west midlands the party will do its " damnedest " to get a new leader elected by christmas - even if party members reject plans to give up the final say in the contest and let mps decide .
paperwatch : the mirror says michael howard is set to resign as leader within weeks - probably at the party conference .
it would be a final blow for the tory leader if the proposed election rule change is voted down , an unnamed source tells the paper .
the sun says liam fox believes he has the " x-factor " needed to lead his party back into power - and it says the ex-gp as both youth and experience on his side as he tries to cure tory ailments .
but dr fox is branded a " long shot " in the guardian and a " no hoper " in the daily mail , although the paper 's diary column suggests he has more support than david cameron .
the daily telegraph suggests ken clarke has made gordon brown " jittery " by attacking the " myth " of the chancellor 's economic success .
the speech prompted a " savage attack " on mr clarke from ed balls , mr brown 's former right-hand-man at the treasury , it says .
the times says mr clarke took a gamble by suggesting he would be unlikely to make early cuts to income tax .
and the paper muses that it could be another 100 days before the leadership contest is decided .
8 september liam fox throws his hat into the ring on thursday launching his bid to succeed michael howard .
he says he has the support necessary to fight the campaign .
dr fox used an article in the daily telegraph to explain the themes of his campaign .
he wrote : " this is what my leadership would be about - sound defence ; keeping more of what you earn ; less government interference in people 's lives ; a sense of family , community and respect for the law ; britain controlling its own destiny .
ken clarke meanwhile will use a speech at city university in london to attack gordon brown 's economic record .
that 's a theme also explored by david davis in an article in the scotsman newspaper .
mr davis , who has yet to formally declare his candidature , attacked the chancellor 's economic " seven deadly sins " .
sir malcolm rifkind meanwhile continues his tour of britain during which he is hoping to woo the conservative rank and file .
6 september dismissive noises from the davis and cameron camps as a newsnight poll suggests ken clarke is by far the most popular potential leadership candidate with the public .
of those questioned , 40 % said mr clarke would make the best leader clarke is voter favourite - poll cameron supporter michael gove tells the bbc it is purely because clarke is the most recognisable contender - and a 70-year-old leader , clarke 's age at the next election , will not endear it to younger voters - sentiments echoed by friends of davis .
meanwhile , michael ancram , who long ago ruled out a leadership bid of his own , makes a more subtle swipe at mr clarke , a well known europhile despite his recent protestations , saying the conservatives must not ignore europe .
sir malcolm rifkind attempts to inject some momentum into his bid by embarking on a nationwide tour .
liam fox announces the appointment of two former central office spin doctors to work on his campaign .
paperwatch : michael brown writing in the independent urges a clarke-led tory party to embrace proportional representation .
" if ken clarke can dump the euro , could he not do the same over the electoral system ? " , he says .
the sun says major party donor michael ashcroft is among the tory grandees " lining up to wreck plans by michael howard and francis maude to deny party members a vote in the leadership contest " .
lord ashcroft reportedly criticised the scheme at a meeting on saturday .
5 september he may be the favourite at the bookies , but david davis continues to remain cryptic over whether he will actually stand .
on the today programme he refuses to declare his hand , but says : " you do n't meddle with the referee just before you go on the pitch . "
meanwhile , speculation continues to mount over whether grass roots members will reject plans to give mps the final say over who will succeed michael howard .
mr howard 's surprise appearance at a meeting of constituency chairmen at the weekend was seen by some as evidence of growing anxiety that a full ballot of members will be required - potentially dragging out the contest until late january .
meanwhile , ken clarke 's leadership rivals are sharpening their claws .
in a pointed reference to mr clarke 's age , liam fox who is expected to formally launch his leadership bid this week , tells the news of the world : " i am 43 ... i can provide a leadership that is relevant to all sections of the party and can reach out to our younger members and mps . "
sir malcolm rifkind criticises mr clarke 's past enthusiasm for the euro .
former conservative chairman , lord tebbit , not in the running for the leadership but still an influential figure in the party , calls mr clarke " lazy " - a charge refuted by former cabinet minister stephen dorrell , who said that far from being yesterday 's man , mr clarke was the man for tomorrow .
paperwatch : former chancellor norman lamont , writing in the times , backs mr clarke , saying he may have got some big issues wrong - " but he has got one issue completely right - iraq " .
latest betting : david davis 8/13 , ken clarke 5/2 , david cameron 11/2 , liam fox 20/1 , malcolm rifkind 33/1 -lrb- source : politicalbetting.com -rrb- 2 september party chairman francis maude warns the conservatives risk a repeat of the " disastrous " iain duncan smith years if they deny mps the final say on who should replace michael howard .
the daily telegraph , says the comments are a sign of mr maude 's " growing alarm " that his plans to remove the decisive vote from party members will be rejected in a ballot .
the paper attacks mr maude in an editorial , arguing ordinary party members rather than the " jostling careerists who represent so many of them " should " in some measure " be the final arbiters .
disgraced former tory mp jonathan aitken wades into the debate over the party 's future , telling michael howard in an interview with the e-politix website the delayed contest " has had a negative impact on the fortunes of the conservative party " .

but he does not have the limelight all to himself as david cameron breaks his holiday to make what aides insist is a long-planned speech calling for tax relief on childcare .

mr cameron 's combination of " eton , hunting , shooting and lunch at whites " made him the wrong man for the job , he added .
meanwhile , shadow foreign secretary and fellow leadership rival liam fox has said the tax burden on hard-working people in britain must be reduced .
europe was the issue blamed for ken clarke 's defeat in the 2001 leadership election , now the debate is whether the issue still really matters .
mr clarke has argued there is no prospect of the uk adopting the euro in the next decade and declared the constitution dead .
but david davis hit back at that view in a speech to chatham house , saying it is plainly wrong to say europe is not a current issue .
yet another mp , foreign affairs spokesman keith simpson , has been enlisted to support mr davis .
meanwhile , conservative leader michael howard denied it would be farcical if a change to the election rules is rejected next week .
he says the summer has seen his party have a good debate about its future direction for the first time in 30 years .
22 september michael howard has scotched speculation he might quit next week if the party does not change its leadership election rules .
instead , the tory leader says he will resign immediately after the party 's conference - probably on 7 october .
his comments essentially mean he is sticking to the timetable envisaged when he first said he would stand down after may 's general election defeat .
mr howard will stay on as caretaker leader until his successor is chosen .
with voting on the leadership rules almost over , conservative chairman francis maude has suggested future elections could follow the style of us primaries .
that would give a say to tory supporters , as well as party members .
21 september we have waited months for a leadership campaign launch from david davis and david cameron - and now two could come along at once .
mr cameron plans to make his official pitch for the job next thursday .
it seems mr davis might want to launch on the same day and his allies have apparently been trying to persuade mr cameron to shift dates .
but a cameron aide says : " we have long planned to launch our campaign before conference and we are not sure why david davis has subsequently chosen to launch on the same day .
at least by going head to head , people will be able to weigh up the choice in this contest and we think that is a good thing . "
the financial times suggests mr davis could eventually choose to postpone his launch until next friday but his aide said no launch date had been confirmed .
" wait and see is our line , " said the aide .
mr davis has signed up another mp behind his campaign - richard ottaway , who backed ken clarke in previous leadership contests .
meanwhile , sir malcolm rifkind has dismissed suggestions he was preparing to stand down in favour of mr clarke .
the " one nation " former foreign secretary told bbc 2 's daily politics : " i am a candidate ...
i have got substantial support because i represent an important point of view within the conservative party . "
if the leadership field was not crowded enough already , brace yourself for the entry of yet another contender .
tory deputy leader michael ancram is rumoured to be considering entering the race .
newspaper reports suggest mr ancram could get backing from the cornerstone group of traditionalist tory mps , some of whom have asked edward leigh to stand .
20 september former foreign secretary sir malcolm rifkind says gordon brown needs to take over the keys from number 10 as soon as possible to rescue britain 's foreign policy .
sir malcolm tells tory meps in brussels : " britain 's foreign policy objectives can now only be served by a new prime minister not burdened by the crass failures of the last eight years . "
he says mr blair 's european policy has collapsed around him , with britain as " semi-detached " as ever in europe .
but former tory media chief nick wood tells bbc 2 's daily politics he has heard suggestions that sir malcolm is preparing to pull out of the contest and back ken clarke .
in westminster , david davis ' campaign was bolstered by party deputy chairman andrew mackay declaring him " the ideal candidate " to be the next prime minister .
paperwatch in the daily telegraph , columnist alice thomson says ken clarke is counting on mps being so desperate for power they will back him .
" but tory mps are n't obsessed by getting into downing street , " she warns .
" many have become quite comfortable with their life in opposition and their directorships . "
in the times martin samuel says tony blair views the tory ken in the same way he used to see ken livingstone : as someone he treats with disdain but really fears .
19 september the david davis leadership bid gets a start-the-week boost as six tory mps back him in a letter sent to the times .
the six include robert syms , who backed ken clarke in 2001 .
the other five are richard bacon , michael fallon , tim loughton , mark simmons and ian liddell-grainger .
18 september liam fox told the mail on sunday he would favour a cut in the legal limit for abortions to just 12 weeks .
the shadow foreign secretary said : " a society which aborts 180,000 unborn children every year is a society that needs to be asking a lot of questions about itself . "
rival ken clarke said the limit needs to be looked at again in light of medical advances but disagreed with dr fox 's limit .
on the bbc 's new sunday am show he warned : " if the conservative right brings in more of the sort of certain republican right american politics to the politics of the conservative party they will be making a serious mistake . " 16 september tory vice-chairman charles hendry names ken clarke as the best person to carry forward a modernising tory agenda and broaden the party 's appeal .
mr hendry previously backed david willetts , but disagreed with his decision to join david davis ' campaign .
15 september david " two brains " willetts looks poised to pull out of the leadership race and come out in favour of david davis .
but as one contender leaves the field , another one , edward leigh , says he is thinking about joining it to represent traditional moral values and radical ideas on issues like tax .
ken clarke meanwhile continues his series of speeches with a withering attack on tony blair 's " presidential " style of government .
and in another speech , his former cabinet colleague , sir malcolm rifkind , calls for a return to " one nation " conservatism to show the party does not just harbour sectional interests .
14 september david davis tries to appeal to both wings of the party by saying he wants to use right-wing methods to achieve the aims long-held by moderate conservatives .
ken clarke says the contest is now a two-horse race between him and mr davis .
this is an idealism that brings together the various tory traditions , and gives us the route map to a healthy society . "
david davis davis voices ' new tory idealism ' and he tells the times the conservatives would be in the wilderness for years to come if they rejected him simply because of his views on europe .
but in an interview for the daily telegraph , liam fox says the former chancellor is wrong to suggest europe is no longer an issue .
he insists he is in the running , saying he launched his campaign late to gather momentum in the run-up to october 's tory conference .
paperwatch mr clarke 's candidacy is a high-risk enterprise , according to peter riddell in the times .
he needs to bury the issue of europe and be more specific about public services , argues riddell , who says the ex-chancellor has at least shaken up the leadership race .
the independent sees mr davis ' latest speech as an attempt to shed his " right wing reputation " .
it is the rules for the contest which worry former tory chairman norman fowler .
in a letter to the daily telegraph , he warns that allowing only mps to choose the new leader will deprive many constituencies of a vote since they are not conservative-held seats .
11 september shadow foreign secretary liam fox says ken clarke 's stance against the iraq war undermines the morale of british troops .
and he says the tories would be an easy target if most of the front bench had supported the conflict and their leader opposed it .
9 september conservative chairman francis maude tells bbc radio west midlands the party will do its " damnedest " to get a new leader elected by christmas - even if party members reject plans to give up the final say in the contest and let mps decide .
paperwatch : the mirror says michael howard is set to resign as leader within weeks - probably at the party conference .
it would be a final blow for the tory leader if the proposed election rule change is voted down , an unnamed source tells the paper .
the sun says liam fox believes he has the " x-factor " needed to lead his party back into power - and it says the ex-gp as both youth and experience on his side as he tries to cure tory ailments .
but dr fox is branded a " long shot " in the guardian and a " no hoper " in the daily mail , although the paper 's diary column suggests he has more support than david cameron .
the daily telegraph suggests ken clarke has made gordon brown " jittery " by attacking the " myth " of the chancellor 's economic success .
the speech prompted a " savage attack " on mr clarke from ed balls , mr brown 's former right-hand-man at the treasury , it says .
the times says mr clarke took a gamble by suggesting he would be unlikely to make early cuts to income tax .
and the paper muses that it could be another 100 days before the leadership contest is decided .
8 september liam fox throws his hat into the ring on thursday launching his bid to succeed michael howard .
he says he has the support necessary to fight the campaign .
dr fox used an article in the daily telegraph to explain the themes of his campaign .
he wrote : " this is what my leadership would be about - sound defence ; keeping more of what you earn ; less government interference in people 's lives ; a sense of family , community and respect for the law ; britain controlling its own destiny .
ken clarke meanwhile will use a speech at city university in london to attack gordon brown 's economic record .
that 's a theme also explored by david davis in an article in the scotsman newspaper .
mr davis , who has yet to formally declare his candidature , attacked the chancellor 's economic " seven deadly sins " .
sir malcolm rifkind meanwhile continues his tour of britain during which he is hoping to woo the conservative rank and file .
6 september dismissive noises from the davis and cameron camps as a newsnight poll suggests ken clarke is by far the most popular potential leadership candidate with the public .
of those questioned , 40 % said mr clarke would make the best leader clarke is voter favourite - poll cameron supporter michael gove tells the bbc it is purely because clarke is the most recognisable contender - and a 70-year-old leader , clarke 's age at the next election , will not endear it to younger voters - sentiments echoed by friends of davis .
meanwhile , michael ancram , who long ago ruled out a leadership bid of his own , makes a more subtle swipe at mr clarke , a well known europhile despite his recent protestations , saying the conservatives must not ignore europe .
sir malcolm rifkind attempts to inject some momentum into his bid by embarking on a nationwide tour .
liam fox announces the appointment of two former central office spin doctors to work on his campaign .
paperwatch : michael brown writing in the independent urges a clarke-led tory party to embrace proportional representation .
" if ken clarke can dump the euro , could he not do the same over the electoral system ? " , he says .
the sun says major party donor michael ashcroft is among the tory grandees " lining up to wreck plans by michael howard and francis maude to deny party members a vote in the leadership contest " .
lord ashcroft reportedly criticised the scheme at a meeting on saturday .
5 september he may be the favourite at the bookies , but david davis continues to remain cryptic over whether he will actually stand .
on the today programme he refuses to declare his hand , but says : " you do n't meddle with the referee just before you go on the pitch . "
meanwhile , speculation continues to mount over whether grass roots members will reject plans to give mps the final say over who will succeed michael howard .
mr howard 's surprise appearance at a meeting of constituency chairmen at the weekend was seen by some as evidence of growing anxiety that a full ballot of members will be required - potentially dragging out the contest until late january .
meanwhile , ken clarke 's leadership rivals are sharpening their claws .
in a pointed reference to mr clarke 's age , liam fox who is expected to formally launch his leadership bid this week , tells the news of the world : " i am 43 ... i can provide a leadership that is relevant to all sections of the party and can reach out to our younger members and mps . "
sir malcolm rifkind criticises mr clarke 's past enthusiasm for the euro .
former conservative chairman , lord tebbit , not in the running for the leadership but still an influential figure in the party , calls mr clarke " lazy " - a charge refuted by former cabinet minister stephen dorrell , who said that far from being yesterday 's man , mr clarke was the man for tomorrow .
paperwatch : former chancellor norman lamont , writing in the times , backs mr clarke , saying he may have got some big issues wrong - " but he has got one issue completely right - iraq " .
latest betting : david davis 8/13 , ken clarke 5/2 , david cameron 11/2 , liam fox 20/1 , malcolm rifkind 33/1 -lrb- source : politicalbetting.com -rrb- 2 september party chairman francis maude warns the conservatives risk a repeat of the " disastrous " iain duncan smith years if they deny mps the final say on who should replace michael howard .
the daily telegraph , says the comments are a sign of mr maude 's " growing alarm " that his plans to remove the decisive vote from party members will be rejected in a ballot .
the paper attacks mr maude in an editorial , arguing ordinary party members rather than the " jostling careerists who represent so many of them " should " in some measure " be the final arbiters .
disgraced former tory mp jonathan aitken wades into the debate over the party 's future , telling michael howard in an interview with the e-politix website the delayed contest " has had a negative impact on the fortunes of the conservative party " .
paperwatch : ken clarke 's speech attacking tony blair 's iraq policy could shift the issue centre stage , says peter riddell in the the times .
opposition to the war needs to be more than a lib dem issue , he argues .
writing in the the daily telegraph veteran journalist and former tory mp bill deedes backs ken clarke , arguing it is high time there was an effective opposition and mr clarke is the best man to lead it .
" like a good surgeon , he knows where to put the knife , " argues mr deedes .
1 september known as a man ready to cross the street to join a fight , ken clarke shapes up for a " blistering attack " on tony blair over the iraq war - something he opposed .
but he does not have the limelight all to himself as david cameron breaks his holiday to make what aides insist is a long-planned speech calling for tax relief on childcare .
a source close to mr clarke said his speech would be blistering war ' catastrophic error ' the uk independence party backs the pro-europe mr clarke for the leadership " so the public know where the tories stand " .
paperwatch : spectator editor boris johnson says the magazine will be backing david cameron as next leader - notwithstanding political editor peter oborne 's praise for mr clarke while the editor enjoyed his summer holiday .
the times says ken 's clarke 's bid is a triumph of " ambition over evidence " .
he might leave rivals in his wake in a contest for tory " prime bloke " but to be prime minister he is too divisive and has given little indication he has imaginative ideas for the economy and public services , it says .
such criticisms are echoed in the sun , george pascoe-watson , who says mr clarke has infuriated many mps with his views on iraq and the euro and by standing may split " moderate " tories .
with mr clarke 's " blokeishness " a topic of debate in all the papers , the financial times says merely " being ken " will not be enough .
it says it will be listening this summer to see if he sets out a prospectus for government .
the daily mirror says britain is crying out for effective opposition and mr clarke can deliver it .
but the paper 's words come with a sting : " good he may be , but ken clarke is still a tory " , it says , recalling his battles with ambulancemen in the 1980s .
daily express political editor , patrick o 'flynn predicts other candidates will drop by the wayside to leave mr clarke to take david davis to the wire " .
but although the leadership contest may be just catching light , the paper says it seems to have been going on interminably already and the sooner it is over , the better .

30 september former party treasurer lord kalms says ken clarke would be " totally unacceptable " as leader because of his pro-european views .
the david davis supporter said it was " grossly misleading to pretend " that europe was no longer central to the political agenda .
" it will always remain one of the major issues of conservatism that we are eurosceptic , " he added .
mr clarke insists the european constitution is dead and there is no prospect of the uk adopting the euro in the next 10 years .
who 's in the running ?
guide to the likely contenders paperwatch : the daily mail calls the launch of the david davis and david cameron campaigns the " battle of the tory blairalikes " .
meanwhile , the daily telegraph likens the contest to one between a " bash street kid " and " little lord fauntleroy " .
simon hoggart in the guardian writes : " both candidates were articulate and clear about what kind of people they are .
they were much less clear on policies . "
but the independent is impressed by cameron 's speech , calling him a " real-world tory , who despises the radicalism of easy answers " .
however , the times is not happy : " two davids running for leader is two too many .
it is confusing and indicates a lack of choice . " 29 september the front runner david davis finally formally enters the leadership contest under the slogan of modern conservatives , pledging " to show that we are not in politics for ourselves .
we are not here to defend privilege or accept the status quo .
we have a real purpose to change britain and improve lives " .
an hour later david cameron the 38-year-old shadow education secretary launched his campaign under the slogan change to win saying the problem is that people " do n't yet trust the conservative party ... what we have to do is make a change in the culture and identity of the conservative party and explain what this means today . "
paperwatch : the sun warns , in a leader column headlined ' danger man ' , that ken clarke would split the conservative party over europe if made leader and even if he did n't , and became pm he would end britain 's noble history as a sovereign state " .
the daily telegraph quotes the campaign slogans change to win , time to win and modern conservatism , before saying that " thankfully it is not a caption-writing competition " .
they then contrast that with liam fox 's pledge to take the conservatives out of the european people 's party group in the european parliament - saying it would be a big step towards the conservative party " recovering its electability " .
28 september the shadow boxing is finally over and campaigning is starting in earnest .
and it looks like ken clarke might be taking the healthy options as battle begins .
asked about including water and fruit juice instead of junk foods in school vending machines , mr clarke laughs : " i do drink a lot of fruit juice actually - man can not live on alcohol alone . "
as the former chancellor launches his campaign to woo grass roots members , bookmakers ' favourite david davis is meeting tory members in wales .
and sir malcolm rifkind 's visit to worcestershire is taking in morgan cars as the contenders vie to be in the two-seater ballot put before the whole party .
what are the rules ?
new leader due to be chosen after conservative conference in october more on the leadership rules paperwatch : the daily telegraph says the vote on the leadership rules means the party will be leaderless for another three months , but is pleased the " silliness " over the rule change is over .
" get on with it " , is the times ' plea to the tories .
it warns that allowing the contest to slip into the new year would make the party look indulgent and negligent .
its impatience is shared by the daily express , which says the tories need to elect somebody quickly to hold the prime minister to account .
the daily mail says supporters of rivals to david davis believe the prolonged race gives the frontrunner more time to make a mistake .
the guardian is among those who believe the rules vote boosts ken clarke 's chances .
the paper 's leader writers warn : " as a tea party this contest would be wilder than the mad hatter and as a way of doing politics it has become entirely self-destructive . " 27 september it is decision day on the rules which will be used to choose the next conservative party leader .
mps , euro mps and senior conservative party figures across the country have been voting on whether mps or the wider party membership should have the final say on choosing michael howard 's successor .
the result of the vote is a blow for mr howard as the change of rules is rejected .
26 september it 's a relatively quiet start to the week , with the labour party conference starting and only a day to go before the result of the vote on the conservative leadership election rules .
this vote will decide essentially whether tory mps , or the wider party membership , will choose the new leader .
out-going leader michael howard is making a speech in which he says immigrants should embrace the british way of life : " we need to instil into all british children , whatever their religion or skin colour , a sense of pride in our institutions and our way of life . " 25 september exchanges between the rival camps have become more direct and personal than previously during the campaign , with ken clarke backer john bercow saying david davis ' right-wing agenda would be a " lethal injection " into the party .
however , choosing mr clarke would be a form of " national suicide , " according to shadow education secretary david cameron .
but mr bercow described these remarks as " ludicrous hyperbole " .
mr cameron 's combination of " eton , hunting , shooting and lunch at whites " made him the wrong man for the job , he added .
meanwhile , shadow foreign secretary and fellow leadership rival liam fox has said the tax burden on hard-working people in britain must be reduced .

of those questioned , 40 % said mr clarke would make the best leader clarke is voter favourite - poll cameron supporter michael gove tells the bbc it is purely because clarke is the most recognisable contender - and a 70-year-old leader , clarke 's age at the next election , will not endear it to younger voters - sentiments echoed by friends of davis .
meanwhile , michael ancram , who long ago ruled out a leadership bid of his own , makes a more subtle swipe at mr clarke , a well known europhile despite his recent protestations , saying the conservatives must not ignore europe .
sir malcolm rifkind attempts to inject some momentum into his bid by embarking on a nationwide tour .

the sun says major party donor michael ashcroft is among the tory grandees " lining up to wreck plans by michael howard and francis maude to deny party members a vote in the leadership contest " .
lord ashcroft reportedly criticised the scheme at a meeting on saturday .
5 september he may be the favourite at the bookies , but david davis continues to remain cryptic over whether he will actually stand .
on the today programme he refuses to declare his hand , but says : " you do n't meddle with the referee just before you go on the pitch . "
meanwhile , speculation continues to mount over whether grass roots members will reject plans to give mps the final say over who will succeed michael howard .
mr howard 's surprise appearance at a meeting of constituency chairmen at the weekend was seen by some as evidence of growing anxiety that a full ballot of members will be required - potentially dragging out the contest until late january .
meanwhile , ken clarke 's leadership rivals are sharpening their claws .
in a pointed reference to mr clarke 's age , liam fox who is expected to formally launch his leadership bid this week , tells the news of the world : " i am 43 ... i can provide a leadership that is relevant to all sections of the party and can reach out to our younger members and mps . "
sir malcolm rifkind criticises mr clarke 's past enthusiasm for the euro .
former conservative chairman , lord tebbit , not in the running for the leadership but still an influential figure in the party , calls mr clarke " lazy " - a charge refuted by former cabinet minister stephen dorrell , who said that far from being yesterday 's man , mr clarke was the man for tomorrow .

" like a good surgeon , he knows where to put the knife , " argues mr deedes .
1 september known as a man ready to cross the street to join a fight , ken clarke shapes up for a " blistering attack " on tony blair over the iraq war - something he opposed .
but he does not have the limelight all to himself as david cameron breaks his holiday to make what aides insist is a long-planned speech calling for tax relief on childcare .

30 september former party treasurer lord kalms says ken clarke would be " totally unacceptable " as leader because of his pro-european views .
the david davis supporter said it was " grossly misleading to pretend " that europe was no longer central to the political agenda .
" it will always remain one of the major issues of conservatism that we are eurosceptic , " he added .
mr clarke insists the european constitution is dead and there is no prospect of the uk adopting the euro in the next 10 years .
who 's in the running ?
guide to the likely contenders paperwatch : the daily mail calls the launch of the david davis and david cameron campaigns the " battle of the tory blairalikes " .
meanwhile , the daily telegraph likens the contest to one between a " bash street kid " and " little lord fauntleroy " .
simon hoggart in the guardian writes : " both candidates were articulate and clear about what kind of people they are .
they were much less clear on policies . "
but the independent is impressed by cameron 's speech , calling him a " real-world tory , who despises the radicalism of easy answers " .
however , the times is not happy : " two davids running for leader is two too many .
it is confusing and indicates a lack of choice . " 29 september the front runner david davis finally formally enters the leadership contest under the slogan of modern conservatives , pledging " to show that we are not in politics for ourselves .
we are not here to defend privilege or accept the status quo .
we have a real purpose to change britain and improve lives " .
an hour later david cameron the 38-year-old shadow education secretary launched his campaign under the slogan change to win saying the problem is that people " do n't yet trust the conservative party ... what we have to do is make a change in the culture and identity of the conservative party and explain what this means today . "
paperwatch : the sun warns , in a leader column headlined ' danger man ' , that ken clarke would split the conservative party over europe if made leader and even if he did n't , and became pm he would end britain 's noble history as a sovereign state " .
the daily telegraph quotes the campaign slogans change to win , time to win and modern conservatism , before saying that " thankfully it is not a caption-writing competition " .
they then contrast that with liam fox 's pledge to take the conservatives out of the european people 's party group in the european parliament - saying it would be a big step towards the conservative party " recovering its electability " .
28 september the shadow boxing is finally over and campaigning is starting in earnest .
and it looks like ken clarke might be taking the healthy options as battle begins .
asked about including water and fruit juice instead of junk foods in school vending machines , mr clarke laughs : " i do drink a lot of fruit juice actually - man can not live on alcohol alone . "
as the former chancellor launches his campaign to woo grass roots members , bookmakers ' favourite david davis is meeting tory members in wales .
and sir malcolm rifkind 's visit to worcestershire is taking in morgan cars as the contenders vie to be in the two-seater ballot put before the whole party .
what are the rules ?
new leader due to be chosen after conservative conference in october more on the leadership rules paperwatch : the daily telegraph says the vote on the leadership rules means the party will be leaderless for another three months , but is pleased the " silliness " over the rule change is over .
" get on with it " , is the times ' plea to the tories .
it warns that allowing the contest to slip into the new year would make the party look indulgent and negligent .
its impatience is shared by the daily express , which says the tories need to elect somebody quickly to hold the prime minister to account .
the daily mail says supporters of rivals to david davis believe the prolonged race gives the frontrunner more time to make a mistake .
the guardian is among those who believe the rules vote boosts ken clarke 's chances .
the paper 's leader writers warn : " as a tea party this contest would be wilder than the mad hatter and as a way of doing politics it has become entirely self-destructive . " 27 september it is decision day on the rules which will be used to choose the next conservative party leader .
mps , euro mps and senior conservative party figures across the country have been voting on whether mps or the wider party membership should have the final say on choosing michael howard 's successor .
the result of the vote is a blow for mr howard as the change of rules is rejected .
26 september it 's a relatively quiet start to the week , with the labour party conference starting and only a day to go before the result of the vote on the conservative leadership election rules .
this vote will decide essentially whether tory mps , or the wider party membership , will choose the new leader .
out-going leader michael howard is making a speech in which he says immigrants should embrace the british way of life : " we need to instil into all british children , whatever their religion or skin colour , a sense of pride in our institutions and our way of life . " 25 september exchanges between the rival camps have become more direct and personal than previously during the campaign , with ken clarke backer john bercow saying david davis ' right-wing agenda would be a " lethal injection " into the party .
however , choosing mr clarke would be a form of " national suicide , " according to shadow education secretary david cameron .
but mr bercow described these remarks as " ludicrous hyperbole " .
mr cameron 's combination of " eton , hunting , shooting and lunch at whites " made him the wrong man for the job , he added .
meanwhile , shadow foreign secretary and fellow leadership rival liam fox has said the tax burden on hard-working people in britain must be reduced .
europe was the issue blamed for ken clarke 's defeat in the 2001 leadership election , now the debate is whether the issue still really matters .
mr clarke has argued there is no prospect of the uk adopting the euro in the next decade and declared the constitution dead .
but david davis hit back at that view in a speech to chatham house , saying it is plainly wrong to say europe is not a current issue .
yet another mp , foreign affairs spokesman keith simpson , has been enlisted to support mr davis .
meanwhile , conservative leader michael howard denied it would be farcical if a change to the election rules is rejected next week .
he says the summer has seen his party have a good debate about its future direction for the first time in 30 years .
22 september michael howard has scotched speculation he might quit next week if the party does not change its leadership election rules .
instead , the tory leader says he will resign immediately after the party 's conference - probably on 7 october .
his comments essentially mean he is sticking to the timetable envisaged when he first said he would stand down after may 's general election defeat .
mr howard will stay on as caretaker leader until his successor is chosen .
with voting on the leadership rules almost over , conservative chairman francis maude has suggested future elections could follow the style of us primaries .
that would give a say to tory supporters , as well as party members .
21 september we have waited months for a leadership campaign launch from david davis and david cameron - and now two could come along at once .
mr cameron plans to make his official pitch for the job next thursday .
it seems mr davis might want to launch on the same day and his allies have apparently been trying to persuade mr cameron to shift dates .
but a cameron aide says : " we have long planned to launch our campaign before conference and we are not sure why david davis has subsequently chosen to launch on the same day .
at least by going head to head , people will be able to weigh up the choice in this contest and we think that is a good thing . "
the financial times suggests mr davis could eventually choose to postpone his launch until next friday but his aide said no launch date had been confirmed .
" wait and see is our line , " said the aide .
mr davis has signed up another mp behind his campaign - richard ottaway , who backed ken clarke in previous leadership contests .
meanwhile , sir malcolm rifkind has dismissed suggestions he was preparing to stand down in favour of mr clarke .
the " one nation " former foreign secretary told bbc 2 's daily politics : " i am a candidate ...
i have got substantial support because i represent an important point of view within the conservative party . "
if the leadership field was not crowded enough already , brace yourself for the entry of yet another contender .
tory deputy leader michael ancram is rumoured to be considering entering the race .
newspaper reports suggest mr ancram could get backing from the cornerstone group of traditionalist tory mps , some of whom have asked edward leigh to stand .
20 september former foreign secretary sir malcolm rifkind says gordon brown needs to take over the keys from number 10 as soon as possible to rescue britain 's foreign policy .
sir malcolm tells tory meps in brussels : " britain 's foreign policy objectives can now only be served by a new prime minister not burdened by the crass failures of the last eight years . "
he says mr blair 's european policy has collapsed around him , with britain as " semi-detached " as ever in europe .
but former tory media chief nick wood tells bbc 2 's daily politics he has heard suggestions that sir malcolm is preparing to pull out of the contest and back ken clarke .
in westminster , david davis ' campaign was bolstered by party deputy chairman andrew mackay declaring him " the ideal candidate " to be the next prime minister .
paperwatch in the daily telegraph , columnist alice thomson says ken clarke is counting on mps being so desperate for power they will back him .
" but tory mps are n't obsessed by getting into downing street , " she warns .
" many have become quite comfortable with their life in opposition and their directorships . "
in the times martin samuel says tony blair views the tory ken in the same way he used to see ken livingstone : as someone he treats with disdain but really fears .
19 september the david davis leadership bid gets a start-the-week boost as six tory mps back him in a letter sent to the times .
the six include robert syms , who backed ken clarke in 2001 .
the other five are richard bacon , michael fallon , tim loughton , mark simmons and ian liddell-grainger .
18 september liam fox told the mail on sunday he would favour a cut in the legal limit for abortions to just 12 weeks .
the shadow foreign secretary said : " a society which aborts 180,000 unborn children every year is a society that needs to be asking a lot of questions about itself . "
rival ken clarke said the limit needs to be looked at again in light of medical advances but disagreed with dr fox 's limit .
on the bbc 's new sunday am show he warned : " if the conservative right brings in more of the sort of certain republican right american politics to the politics of the conservative party they will be making a serious mistake . " 16 september tory vice-chairman charles hendry names ken clarke as the best person to carry forward a modernising tory agenda and broaden the party 's appeal .
mr hendry previously backed david willetts , but disagreed with his decision to join david davis ' campaign .
15 september david " two brains " willetts looks poised to pull out of the leadership race and come out in favour of david davis .
but as one contender leaves the field , another one , edward leigh , says he is thinking about joining it to represent traditional moral values and radical ideas on issues like tax .
ken clarke meanwhile continues his series of speeches with a withering attack on tony blair 's " presidential " style of government .
and in another speech , his former cabinet colleague , sir malcolm rifkind , calls for a return to " one nation " conservatism to show the party does not just harbour sectional interests .
14 september david davis tries to appeal to both wings of the party by saying he wants to use right-wing methods to achieve the aims long-held by moderate conservatives .
ken clarke says the contest is now a two-horse race between him and mr davis .
this is an idealism that brings together the various tory traditions , and gives us the route map to a healthy society . "
david davis davis voices ' new tory idealism ' and he tells the times the conservatives would be in the wilderness for years to come if they rejected him simply because of his views on europe .
but in an interview for the daily telegraph , liam fox says the former chancellor is wrong to suggest europe is no longer an issue .
he insists he is in the running , saying he launched his campaign late to gather momentum in the run-up to october 's tory conference .
paperwatch mr clarke 's candidacy is a high-risk enterprise , according to peter riddell in the times .
he needs to bury the issue of europe and be more specific about public services , argues riddell , who says the ex-chancellor has at least shaken up the leadership race .
the independent sees mr davis ' latest speech as an attempt to shed his " right wing reputation " .
it is the rules for the contest which worry former tory chairman norman fowler .
in a letter to the daily telegraph , he warns that allowing only mps to choose the new leader will deprive many constituencies of a vote since they are not conservative-held seats .
11 september shadow foreign secretary liam fox says ken clarke 's stance against the iraq war undermines the morale of british troops .
and he says the tories would be an easy target if most of the front bench had supported the conflict and their leader opposed it .
9 september conservative chairman francis maude tells bbc radio west midlands the party will do its " damnedest " to get a new leader elected by christmas - even if party members reject plans to give up the final say in the contest and let mps decide .
paperwatch : the mirror says michael howard is set to resign as leader within weeks - probably at the party conference .
it would be a final blow for the tory leader if the proposed election rule change is voted down , an unnamed source tells the paper .
the sun says liam fox believes he has the " x-factor " needed to lead his party back into power - and it says the ex-gp as both youth and experience on his side as he tries to cure tory ailments .
but dr fox is branded a " long shot " in the guardian and a " no hoper " in the daily mail , although the paper 's diary column suggests he has more support than david cameron .
the daily telegraph suggests ken clarke has made gordon brown " jittery " by attacking the " myth " of the chancellor 's economic success .
the speech prompted a " savage attack " on mr clarke from ed balls , mr brown 's former right-hand-man at the treasury , it says .
the times says mr clarke took a gamble by suggesting he would be unlikely to make early cuts to income tax .
and the paper muses that it could be another 100 days before the leadership contest is decided .
8 september liam fox throws his hat into the ring on thursday launching his bid to succeed michael howard .
he says he has the support necessary to fight the campaign .
dr fox used an article in the daily telegraph to explain the themes of his campaign .
he wrote : " this is what my leadership would be about - sound defence ; keeping more of what you earn ; less government interference in people 's lives ; a sense of family , community and respect for the law ; britain controlling its own destiny .
ken clarke meanwhile will use a speech at city university in london to attack gordon brown 's economic record .
that 's a theme also explored by david davis in an article in the scotsman newspaper .
mr davis , who has yet to formally declare his candidature , attacked the chancellor 's economic " seven deadly sins " .
sir malcolm rifkind meanwhile continues his tour of britain during which he is hoping to woo the conservative rank and file .
6 september dismissive noises from the davis and cameron camps as a newsnight poll suggests ken clarke is by far the most popular potential leadership candidate with the public .

the daily telegraph quotes the campaign slogans change to win , time to win and modern conservatism , before saying that " thankfully it is not a caption-writing competition " .

28 september the shadow boxing is finally over and campaigning is starting in earnest .
and it looks like ken clarke might be taking the healthy options as battle begins .
asked about including water and fruit juice instead of junk foods in school vending machines , mr clarke laughs : " i do drink a lot of fruit juice actually - man can not live on alcohol alone . "
as the former chancellor launches his campaign to woo grass roots members , bookmakers ' favourite david davis is meeting tory members in wales .
and sir malcolm rifkind 's visit to worcestershire is taking in morgan cars as the contenders vie to be in the two-seater ballot put before the whole party .
what are the rules ?
new leader due to be chosen after conservative conference in october more on the leadership rules paperwatch : the daily telegraph says the vote on the leadership rules means the party will be leaderless for another three months , but is pleased the " silliness " over the rule change is over .
" get on with it " , is the times ' plea to the tories .
it warns that allowing the contest to slip into the new year would make the party look indulgent and negligent .
its impatience is shared by the daily express , which says the tories need to elect somebody quickly to hold the prime minister to account .
the daily mail says supporters of rivals to david davis believe the prolonged race gives the frontrunner more time to make a mistake .
the guardian is among those who believe the rules vote boosts ken clarke 's chances .
the paper 's leader writers warn : " as a tea party this contest would be wilder than the mad hatter and as a way of doing politics it has become entirely self-destructive . " 27 september it is decision day on the rules which will be used to choose the next conservative party leader .
mps , euro mps and senior conservative party figures across the country have been voting on whether mps or the wider party membership should have the final say on choosing michael howard 's successor .
the result of the vote is a blow for mr howard as the change of rules is rejected .
26 september it 's a relatively quiet start to the week , with the labour party conference starting and only a day to go before the result of the vote on the conservative leadership election rules .
this vote will decide essentially whether tory mps , or the wider party membership , will choose the new leader .
out-going leader michael howard is making a speech in which he says immigrants should embrace the british way of life : " we need to instil into all british children , whatever their religion or skin colour , a sense of pride in our institutions and our way of life . " 25 september exchanges between the rival camps have become more direct and personal than previously during the campaign , with ken clarke backer john bercow saying david davis ' right-wing agenda would be a " lethal injection " into the party .
however , choosing mr clarke would be a form of " national suicide , " according to shadow education secretary david cameron .
but mr bercow described these remarks as " ludicrous hyperbole " .
mr cameron 's combination of " eton , hunting , shooting and lunch at whites " made him the wrong man for the job , he added .
meanwhile , shadow foreign secretary and fellow leadership rival liam fox has said the tax burden on hard-working people in britain must be reduced .
europe was the issue blamed for ken clarke 's defeat in the 2001 leadership election , now the debate is whether the issue still really matters .
mr clarke has argued there is no prospect of the uk adopting the euro in the next decade and declared the constitution dead .
but david davis hit back at that view in a speech to chatham house , saying it is plainly wrong to say europe is not a current issue .
yet another mp , foreign affairs spokesman keith simpson , has been enlisted to support mr davis .
meanwhile , conservative leader michael howard denied it would be farcical if a change to the election rules is rejected next week .
he says the summer has seen his party have a good debate about its future direction for the first time in 30 years .
22 september michael howard has scotched speculation he might quit next week if the party does not change its leadership election rules .
instead , the tory leader says he will resign immediately after the party 's conference - probably on 7 october .
his comments essentially mean he is sticking to the timetable envisaged when he first said he would stand down after may 's general election defeat .
mr howard will stay on as caretaker leader until his successor is chosen .
with voting on the leadership rules almost over , conservative chairman francis maude has suggested future elections could follow the style of us primaries .
that would give a say to tory supporters , as well as party members .
21 september we have waited months for a leadership campaign launch from david davis and david cameron - and now two could come along at once .
mr cameron plans to make his official pitch for the job next thursday .
it seems mr davis might want to launch on the same day and his allies have apparently been trying to persuade mr cameron to shift dates .
but a cameron aide says : " we have long planned to launch our campaign before conference and we are not sure why david davis has subsequently chosen to launch on the same day .
at least by going head to head , people will be able to weigh up the choice in this contest and we think that is a good thing . "
the financial times suggests mr davis could eventually choose to postpone his launch until next friday but his aide said no launch date had been confirmed .
" wait and see is our line , " said the aide .
mr davis has signed up another mp behind his campaign - richard ottaway , who backed ken clarke in previous leadership contests .
meanwhile , sir malcolm rifkind has dismissed suggestions he was preparing to stand down in favour of mr clarke .
the " one nation " former foreign secretary told bbc 2 's daily politics : " i am a candidate ...
i have got substantial support because i represent an important point of view within the conservative party . "
if the leadership field was not crowded enough already , brace yourself for the entry of yet another contender .
tory deputy leader michael ancram is rumoured to be considering entering the race .
newspaper reports suggest mr ancram could get backing from the cornerstone group of traditionalist tory mps , some of whom have asked edward leigh to stand .
20 september former foreign secretary sir malcolm rifkind says gordon brown needs to take over the keys from number 10 as soon as possible to rescue britain 's foreign policy .
sir malcolm tells tory meps in brussels : " britain 's foreign policy objectives can now only be served by a new prime minister not burdened by the crass failures of the last eight years . "
he says mr blair 's european policy has collapsed around him , with britain as " semi-detached " as ever in europe .
but former tory media chief nick wood tells bbc 2 's daily politics he has heard suggestions that sir malcolm is preparing to pull out of the contest and back ken clarke .
in westminster , david davis ' campaign was bolstered by party deputy chairman andrew mackay declaring him " the ideal candidate " to be the next prime minister .
paperwatch in the daily telegraph , columnist alice thomson says ken clarke is counting on mps being so desperate for power they will back him .
" but tory mps are n't obsessed by getting into downing street , " she warns .
" many have become quite comfortable with their life in opposition and their directorships . "
in the times martin samuel says tony blair views the tory ken in the same way he used to see ken livingstone : as someone he treats with disdain but really fears .
19 september the david davis leadership bid gets a start-the-week boost as six tory mps back him in a letter sent to the times .
the six include robert syms , who backed ken clarke in 2001 .
the other five are richard bacon , michael fallon , tim loughton , mark simmons and ian liddell-grainger .
18 september liam fox told the mail on sunday he would favour a cut in the legal limit for abortions to just 12 weeks .
the shadow foreign secretary said : " a society which aborts 180,000 unborn children every year is a society that needs to be asking a lot of questions about itself . "
rival ken clarke said the limit needs to be looked at again in light of medical advances but disagreed with dr fox 's limit .
on the bbc 's new sunday am show he warned : " if the conservative right brings in more of the sort of certain republican right american politics to the politics of the conservative party they will be making a serious mistake . " 16 september tory vice-chairman charles hendry names ken clarke as the best person to carry forward a modernising tory agenda and broaden the party 's appeal .
mr hendry previously backed david willetts , but disagreed with his decision to join david davis ' campaign .
15 september david " two brains " willetts looks poised to pull out of the leadership race and come out in favour of david davis .
but as one contender leaves the field , another one , edward leigh , says he is thinking about joining it to represent traditional moral values and radical ideas on issues like tax .
ken clarke meanwhile continues his series of speeches with a withering attack on tony blair 's " presidential " style of government .
and in another speech , his former cabinet colleague , sir malcolm rifkind , calls for a return to " one nation " conservatism to show the party does not just harbour sectional interests .
14 september david davis tries to appeal to both wings of the party by saying he wants to use right-wing methods to achieve the aims long-held by moderate conservatives .
ken clarke says the contest is now a two-horse race between him and mr davis .
this is an idealism that brings together the various tory traditions , and gives us the route map to a healthy society . "
david davis davis voices ' new tory idealism ' and he tells the times the conservatives would be in the wilderness for years to come if they rejected him simply because of his views on europe .
but in an interview for the daily telegraph , liam fox says the former chancellor is wrong to suggest europe is no longer an issue .
he insists he is in the running , saying he launched his campaign late to gather momentum in the run-up to october 's tory conference .
paperwatch mr clarke 's candidacy is a high-risk enterprise , according to peter riddell in the times .
he needs to bury the issue of europe and be more specific about public services , argues riddell , who says the ex-chancellor has at least shaken up the leadership race .
the independent sees mr davis ' latest speech as an attempt to shed his " right wing reputation " .
it is the rules for the contest which worry former tory chairman norman fowler .
in a letter to the daily telegraph , he warns that allowing only mps to choose the new leader will deprive many constituencies of a vote since they are not conservative-held seats .
11 september shadow foreign secretary liam fox says ken clarke 's stance against the iraq war undermines the morale of british troops .
and he says the tories would be an easy target if most of the front bench had supported the conflict and their leader opposed it .
9 september conservative chairman francis maude tells bbc radio west midlands the party will do its " damnedest " to get a new leader elected by christmas - even if party members reject plans to give up the final say in the contest and let mps decide .
paperwatch : the mirror says michael howard is set to resign as leader within weeks - probably at the party conference .
it would be a final blow for the tory leader if the proposed election rule change is voted down , an unnamed source tells the paper .
the sun says liam fox believes he has the " x-factor " needed to lead his party back into power - and it says the ex-gp as both youth and experience on his side as he tries to cure tory ailments .
but dr fox is branded a " long shot " in the guardian and a " no hoper " in the daily mail , although the paper 's diary column suggests he has more support than david cameron .
the daily telegraph suggests ken clarke has made gordon brown " jittery " by attacking the " myth " of the chancellor 's economic success .
the speech prompted a " savage attack " on mr clarke from ed balls , mr brown 's former right-hand-man at the treasury , it says .
the times says mr clarke took a gamble by suggesting he would be unlikely to make early cuts to income tax .
and the paper muses that it could be another 100 days before the leadership contest is decided .
8 september liam fox throws his hat into the ring on thursday launching his bid to succeed michael howard .
he says he has the support necessary to fight the campaign .
dr fox used an article in the daily telegraph to explain the themes of his campaign .
he wrote : " this is what my leadership would be about - sound defence ; keeping more of what you earn ; less government interference in people 's lives ; a sense of family , community and respect for the law ; britain controlling its own destiny .
ken clarke meanwhile will use a speech at city university in london to attack gordon brown 's economic record .
that 's a theme also explored by david davis in an article in the scotsman newspaper .
mr davis , who has yet to formally declare his candidature , attacked the chancellor 's economic " seven deadly sins " .
sir malcolm rifkind meanwhile continues his tour of britain during which he is hoping to woo the conservative rank and file .
6 september dismissive noises from the davis and cameron camps as a newsnight poll suggests ken clarke is by far the most popular potential leadership candidate with the public .
of those questioned , 40 % said mr clarke would make the best leader clarke is voter favourite - poll cameron supporter michael gove tells the bbc it is purely because clarke is the most recognisable contender - and a 70-year-old leader , clarke 's age at the next election , will not endear it to younger voters - sentiments echoed by friends of davis .
meanwhile , michael ancram , who long ago ruled out a leadership bid of his own , makes a more subtle swipe at mr clarke , a well known europhile despite his recent protestations , saying the conservatives must not ignore europe .
sir malcolm rifkind attempts to inject some momentum into his bid by embarking on a nationwide tour .
liam fox announces the appointment of two former central office spin doctors to work on his campaign .
paperwatch : michael brown writing in the independent urges a clarke-led tory party to embrace proportional representation .
" if ken clarke can dump the euro , could he not do the same over the electoral system ? " , he says .
the sun says major party donor michael ashcroft is among the tory grandees " lining up to wreck plans by michael howard and francis maude to deny party members a vote in the leadership contest " .
lord ashcroft reportedly criticised the scheme at a meeting on saturday .
5 september he may be the favourite at the bookies , but david davis continues to remain cryptic over whether he will actually stand .
on the today programme he refuses to declare his hand , but says : " you do n't meddle with the referee just before you go on the pitch . "
meanwhile , speculation continues to mount over whether grass roots members will reject plans to give mps the final say over who will succeed michael howard .
mr howard 's surprise appearance at a meeting of constituency chairmen at the weekend was seen by some as evidence of growing anxiety that a full ballot of members will be required - potentially dragging out the contest until late january .
meanwhile , ken clarke 's leadership rivals are sharpening their claws .
in a pointed reference to mr clarke 's age , liam fox who is expected to formally launch his leadership bid this week , tells the news of the world : " i am 43 ... i can provide a leadership that is relevant to all sections of the party and can reach out to our younger members and mps . "
sir malcolm rifkind criticises mr clarke 's past enthusiasm for the euro .
former conservative chairman , lord tebbit , not in the running for the leadership but still an influential figure in the party , calls mr clarke " lazy " - a charge refuted by former cabinet minister stephen dorrell , who said that far from being yesterday 's man , mr clarke was the man for tomorrow .
paperwatch : former chancellor norman lamont , writing in the times , backs mr clarke , saying he may have got some big issues wrong - " but he has got one issue completely right - iraq " .
latest betting : david davis 8/13 , ken clarke 5/2 , david cameron 11/2 , liam fox 20/1 , malcolm rifkind 33/1 -lrb- source : politicalbetting.com -rrb- 2 september party chairman francis maude warns the conservatives risk a repeat of the " disastrous " iain duncan smith years if they deny mps the final say on who should replace michael howard .
the daily telegraph , says the comments are a sign of mr maude 's " growing alarm " that his plans to remove the decisive vote from party members will be rejected in a ballot .
the paper attacks mr maude in an editorial , arguing ordinary party members rather than the " jostling careerists who represent so many of them " should " in some measure " be the final arbiters .
disgraced former tory mp jonathan aitken wades into the debate over the party 's future , telling michael howard in an interview with the e-politix website the delayed contest " has had a negative impact on the fortunes of the conservative party " .
paperwatch : ken clarke 's speech attacking tony blair 's iraq policy could shift the issue centre stage , says peter riddell in the the times .
opposition to the war needs to be more than a lib dem issue , he argues .
writing in the the daily telegraph veteran journalist and former tory mp bill deedes backs ken clarke , arguing it is high time there was an effective opposition and mr clarke is the best man to lead it .
" like a good surgeon , he knows where to put the knife , " argues mr deedes .
1 september known as a man ready to cross the street to join a fight , ken clarke shapes up for a " blistering attack " on tony blair over the iraq war - something he opposed .
but he does not have the limelight all to himself as david cameron breaks his holiday to make what aides insist is a long-planned speech calling for tax relief on childcare .
a source close to mr clarke said his speech would be blistering war ' catastrophic error ' the uk independence party backs the pro-europe mr clarke for the leadership " so the public know where the tories stand " .
paperwatch : spectator editor boris johnson says the magazine will be backing david cameron as next leader - notwithstanding political editor peter oborne 's praise for mr clarke while the editor enjoyed his summer holiday .
the times says ken 's clarke 's bid is a triumph of " ambition over evidence " .
he might leave rivals in his wake in a contest for tory " prime bloke " but to be prime minister he is too divisive and has given little indication he has imaginative ideas for the economy and public services , it says .
such criticisms are echoed in the sun , george pascoe-watson , who says mr clarke has infuriated many mps with his views on iraq and the euro and by standing may split " moderate " tories .
with mr clarke 's " blokeishness " a topic of debate in all the papers , the financial times says merely " being ken " will not be enough .
it says it will be listening this summer to see if he sets out a prospectus for government .
the daily mirror says britain is crying out for effective opposition and mr clarke can deliver it .
but the paper 's words come with a sting : " good he may be , but ken clarke is still a tory " , it says , recalling his battles with ambulancemen in the 1980s .
daily express political editor , patrick o 'flynn predicts other candidates will drop by the wayside to leave mr clarke to take david davis to the wire " .
but although the leadership contest may be just catching light , the paper says it seems to have been going on interminably already and the sooner it is over , the better .

30 september former party treasurer lord kalms says ken clarke would be " totally unacceptable " as leader because of his pro-european views .
the david davis supporter said it was " grossly misleading to pretend " that europe was no longer central to the political agenda .
" it will always remain one of the major issues of conservatism that we are eurosceptic , " he added .
mr clarke insists the european constitution is dead and there is no prospect of the uk adopting the euro in the next 10 years .
who 's in the running ?
guide to the likely contenders paperwatch : the daily mail calls the launch of the david davis and david cameron campaigns the " battle of the tory blairalikes " .
meanwhile , the daily telegraph likens the contest to one between a " bash street kid " and " little lord fauntleroy " .
simon hoggart in the guardian writes : " both candidates were articulate and clear about what kind of people they are .
they were much less clear on policies . "
but the independent is impressed by cameron 's speech , calling him a " real-world tory , who despises the radicalism of easy answers " .
however , the times is not happy : " two davids running for leader is two too many .
it is confusing and indicates a lack of choice . " 29 september the front runner david davis finally formally enters the leadership contest under the slogan of modern conservatives , pledging " to show that we are not in politics for ourselves .
we are not here to defend privilege or accept the status quo .
we have a real purpose to change britain and improve lives " .
an hour later david cameron the 38-year-old shadow education secretary launched his campaign under the slogan change to win saying the problem is that people " do n't yet trust the conservative party ... what we have to do is make a change in the culture and identity of the conservative party and explain what this means today . "
paperwatch : the sun warns , in a leader column headlined ' danger man ' , that ken clarke would split the conservative party over europe if made leader and even if he did n't , and became pm he would end britain 's noble history as a sovereign state " .
the daily telegraph quotes the campaign slogans change to win , time to win and modern conservatism , before saying that " thankfully it is not a caption-writing competition " .
they then contrast that with liam fox 's pledge to take the conservatives out of the european people 's party group in the european parliament - saying it would be a big step towards the conservative party " recovering its electability " .
28 september the shadow boxing is finally over and campaigning is starting in earnest .
and it looks like ken clarke might be taking the healthy options as battle begins .
asked about including water and fruit juice instead of junk foods in school vending machines , mr clarke laughs : " i do drink a lot of fruit juice actually - man can not live on alcohol alone . "
as the former chancellor launches his campaign to woo grass roots members , bookmakers ' favourite david davis is meeting tory members in wales .

he needs to bury the issue of europe and be more specific about public services , argues riddell , who says the ex-chancellor has at least shaken up the leadership race .
the independent sees mr davis ' latest speech as an attempt to shed his " right wing reputation " .
it is the rules for the contest which worry former tory chairman norman fowler .
in a letter to the daily telegraph , he warns that allowing only mps to choose the new leader will deprive many constituencies of a vote since they are not conservative-held seats .
11 september shadow foreign secretary liam fox says ken clarke 's stance against the iraq war undermines the morale of british troops .
and he says the tories would be an easy target if most of the front bench had supported the conflict and their leader opposed it .
9 september conservative chairman francis maude tells bbc radio west midlands the party will do its " damnedest " to get a new leader elected by christmas - even if party members reject plans to give up the final say in the contest and let mps decide .
paperwatch : the mirror says michael howard is set to resign as leader within weeks - probably at the party conference .
it would be a final blow for the tory leader if the proposed election rule change is voted down , an unnamed source tells the paper .
the sun says liam fox believes he has the " x-factor " needed to lead his party back into power - and it says the ex-gp as both youth and experience on his side as he tries to cure tory ailments .
but dr fox is branded a " long shot " in the guardian and a " no hoper " in the daily mail , although the paper 's diary column suggests he has more support than david cameron .
the daily telegraph suggests ken clarke has made gordon brown " jittery " by attacking the " myth " of the chancellor 's economic success .
the speech prompted a " savage attack " on mr clarke from ed balls , mr brown 's former right-hand-man at the treasury , it says .
the times says mr clarke took a gamble by suggesting he would be unlikely to make early cuts to income tax .
and the paper muses that it could be another 100 days before the leadership contest is decided .
8 september liam fox throws his hat into the ring on thursday launching his bid to succeed michael howard .
he says he has the support necessary to fight the campaign .
dr fox used an article in the daily telegraph to explain the themes of his campaign .
he wrote : " this is what my leadership would be about - sound defence ; keeping more of what you earn ; less government interference in people 's lives ; a sense of family , community and respect for the law ; britain controlling its own destiny .
ken clarke meanwhile will use a speech at city university in london to attack gordon brown 's economic record .
that 's a theme also explored by david davis in an article in the scotsman newspaper .
mr davis , who has yet to formally declare his candidature , attacked the chancellor 's economic " seven deadly sins " .
sir malcolm rifkind meanwhile continues his tour of britain during which he is hoping to woo the conservative rank and file .
6 september dismissive noises from the davis and cameron camps as a newsnight poll suggests ken clarke is by far the most popular potential leadership candidate with the public .
of those questioned , 40 % said mr clarke would make the best leader clarke is voter favourite - poll cameron supporter michael gove tells the bbc it is purely because clarke is the most recognisable contender - and a 70-year-old leader , clarke 's age at the next election , will not endear it to younger voters - sentiments echoed by friends of davis .
meanwhile , michael ancram , who long ago ruled out a leadership bid of his own , makes a more subtle swipe at mr clarke , a well known europhile despite his recent protestations , saying the conservatives must not ignore europe .
sir malcolm rifkind attempts to inject some momentum into his bid by embarking on a nationwide tour .
liam fox announces the appointment of two former central office spin doctors to work on his campaign .
paperwatch : michael brown writing in the independent urges a clarke-led tory party to embrace proportional representation .
" if ken clarke can dump the euro , could he not do the same over the electoral system ? " , he says .
the sun says major party donor michael ashcroft is among the tory grandees " lining up to wreck plans by michael howard and francis maude to deny party members a vote in the leadership contest " .
lord ashcroft reportedly criticised the scheme at a meeting on saturday .
5 september he may be the favourite at the bookies , but david davis continues to remain cryptic over whether he will actually stand .
on the today programme he refuses to declare his hand , but says : " you do n't meddle with the referee just before you go on the pitch . "
meanwhile , speculation continues to mount over whether grass roots members will reject plans to give mps the final say over who will succeed michael howard .
mr howard 's surprise appearance at a meeting of constituency chairmen at the weekend was seen by some as evidence of growing anxiety that a full ballot of members will be required - potentially dragging out the contest until late january .
meanwhile , ken clarke 's leadership rivals are sharpening their claws .
in a pointed reference to mr clarke 's age , liam fox who is expected to formally launch his leadership bid this week , tells the news of the world : " i am 43 ... i can provide a leadership that is relevant to all sections of the party and can reach out to our younger members and mps . "
sir malcolm rifkind criticises mr clarke 's past enthusiasm for the euro .
former conservative chairman , lord tebbit , not in the running for the leadership but still an influential figure in the party , calls mr clarke " lazy " - a charge refuted by former cabinet minister stephen dorrell , who said that far from being yesterday 's man , mr clarke was the man for tomorrow .
paperwatch : former chancellor norman lamont , writing in the times , backs mr clarke , saying he may have got some big issues wrong - " but he has got one issue completely right - iraq " .
latest betting : david davis 8/13 , ken clarke 5/2 , david cameron 11/2 , liam fox 20/1 , malcolm rifkind 33/1 -lrb- source : politicalbetting.com -rrb- 2 september party chairman francis maude warns the conservatives risk a repeat of the " disastrous " iain duncan smith years if they deny mps the final say on who should replace michael howard .
the daily telegraph , says the comments are a sign of mr maude 's " growing alarm " that his plans to remove the decisive vote from party members will be rejected in a ballot .
the paper attacks mr maude in an editorial , arguing ordinary party members rather than the " jostling careerists who represent so many of them " should " in some measure " be the final arbiters .
disgraced former tory mp jonathan aitken wades into the debate over the party 's future , telling michael howard in an interview with the e-politix website the delayed contest " has had a negative impact on the fortunes of the conservative party " .
paperwatch : ken clarke 's speech attacking tony blair 's iraq policy could shift the issue centre stage , says peter riddell in the the times .
opposition to the war needs to be more than a lib dem issue , he argues .
writing in the the daily telegraph veteran journalist and former tory mp bill deedes backs ken clarke , arguing it is high time there was an effective opposition and mr clarke is the best man to lead it .
" like a good surgeon , he knows where to put the knife , " argues mr deedes .
1 september known as a man ready to cross the street to join a fight , ken clarke shapes up for a " blistering attack " on tony blair over the iraq war - something he opposed .
but he does not have the limelight all to himself as david cameron breaks his holiday to make what aides insist is a long-planned speech calling for tax relief on childcare .
a source close to mr clarke said his speech would be blistering war ' catastrophic error ' the uk independence party backs the pro-europe mr clarke for the leadership " so the public know where the tories stand " .
paperwatch : spectator editor boris johnson says the magazine will be backing david cameron as next leader - notwithstanding political editor peter oborne 's praise for mr clarke while the editor enjoyed his summer holiday .
the times says ken 's clarke 's bid is a triumph of " ambition over evidence " .
he might leave rivals in his wake in a contest for tory " prime bloke " but to be prime minister he is too divisive and has given little indication he has imaginative ideas for the economy and public services , it says .
such criticisms are echoed in the sun , george pascoe-watson , who says mr clarke has infuriated many mps with his views on iraq and the euro and by standing may split " moderate " tories .
with mr clarke 's " blokeishness " a topic of debate in all the papers , the financial times says merely " being ken " will not be enough .
it says it will be listening this summer to see if he sets out a prospectus for government .
the daily mirror says britain is crying out for effective opposition and mr clarke can deliver it .
but the paper 's words come with a sting : " good he may be , but ken clarke is still a tory " , it says , recalling his battles with ambulancemen in the 1980s .
daily express political editor , patrick o 'flynn predicts other candidates will drop by the wayside to leave mr clarke to take david davis to the wire " .
but although the leadership contest may be just catching light , the paper says it seems to have been going on interminably already and the sooner it is over , the better .

send us your questions for three of the world 's influential traditional leaders : ghana 's asantehene , south africa 's bafokeng king , and canada 's nisga 'a president .
as part of the bbc 's who runs your world series africa live will be broadcasting from the heart of ashanti power in ghana , the royal city of kumasi .
we will be joined by the asantehene , nisga 'a president nelson leeson and bafokeng king kgosi leruo molotlegi to discuss customary rule and power relating to traditional positions of authority in our lives today .
what would you like to know about traditional power ?
maybe you 'd like to find out what it 's like to rule a kingdom ?
or how these rulers exercise their power ?
this debate is now closed .
thank you for your comments .
your questions and comments : " our chiefs are more respected than our politicians " nana oteng amoako , united kingdom i do n't see the difference between our chieftancy institution and the monarchy establishment of other parts of the world .
our chiefs are more respected than our politicians so lets maintain the heritage .
long live the system .
nana oteng amoako , united kingdom kings and traditional leaders are ultimately the custodians of their tribes ' languages , customs and traditions -lrb- bearing in mind that these are continually evolving -rrb- .
i believe that they should immerse themselves in this role in order to serve their people better .
lesedi , new zealand what is the power of the king in a country where there is an elected democratic government run by the president ?
jackson s.g. parwon jr , liberia does the king believe in god or the ancestors or a blend of the two ?
sally alexander , kumasi / ghana does a first son of a traditional leader have to succeed his father ?
do traditional leaders have to marry more than one wife ?
why ?
king anderson emmy snr , ivory coast " true democracy can be advanced by kings who have their people at heart " hankie uluko , lilongwe true democracy in africa can be further advanced by kings who always have their people at heart , unlike presidents who also serve party positions .
hankie uluko , lilongwe i would like to know about the things these leaders have done for their people , of which they are most proud .
lance , uk i happened to come from ile-ife , the cradle of yoruba people , nigeria .
for centuries , we 've always had our respected kings -lrb- onis -rrb- , who are champions in the art of ruling , from before the colonial system .
i know this because i personally come from historical ancestors .
my father was a chief - lerekun of iraye , ile-ife and these stories were passed from generation to generation .
allen aramide , poland i would want to find out from the asantehene , why other some traditional leaders involve themselves in politics .
under the laws of ghana they are not supposed to do that .
some go to the extent of declaring their support for some presidential candidate .
when that happens their subjects do not give them the needed respect because they do not belong to just one party .
i want to find out from the south african king and canada 's nisga 'a , about their level of involvement in party politics in their country .
kwaku sakyi-danso , accra ghana it is very simple .
royals are parasites .
their only " work " is to protect their own position , by using terms such as " tradition " .
ad van aken , costa rica i think the king has a part to play , but since democracy has taken over in ghana , the monarch should rather sit on an advisory board for consultation .
ampofo gideon lartey , ghana " one tribe should not be promoted above others " kwaku owusu , ghana the asantehene is not the only chief in ghana .
one tribe should not be promoted above others .
kwaku owusu , ghana i 'd be grateful for some information concerning the first born sons of traditional leaders .
what are their roles ?
is it a must that they succeed their fathers ?
i 'd also like to know whether traditional leaders must have more than one wife .
if so , why ?
king anderson emmy , ivory coast i am amazed so much time and treasure is wasted on traditional leaders .
look at most of them - they have enriched themselves at their society 's expense .
w sargeant , usa in the colonial days , kings and queens were held in high esteem by the people , because it was through them that the white governors sent messages to the people .
but they no longer have the respect and authority they once had .
kofi boateng , usa many traditional rulers in ghana also hold political office .
this is alienating them from the people and eroding the authority of the chief .
do you think traditional rulers should continue to accept political office ?
ben owusu-sekyere , usa i used to live in nigeria , and do cherish dearly africa 's traditional rulers ; but i would like to know how decisions are made in order to protect the rights of the have-nots , since the king is surrounded mostly by aristocrats ?
magnus , canada " what should be the duties and responsibilities of a traditional ruler during elections ? "
chinedu ibeabuchi , lagos , nigeria do you think it is proper for traditional rulers to be partisan in politics -lrb- openly support a candidate or party -rrb- or coerce their subjects into supporting or voting for a particular party or candidate in an election ?
what should be the duties and responsibilities of a traditional ruler during elections ?
chinedu ibeabuchi , lagos , nigeria what makes a good leader ?
kwaku ofori addo , ghana what kinds of laws do you run your kingdom on ?
do you have a written constitution ?
edwin clarke , liberia i truly think traditional rulers will vanish during this century .
people will be more and more tempted to challenge them as more democracies develop in the world .
placide matsiaba , mikouma / gabon as most governments in africa will surely fail , the only true voice we have are the kings .
stanley , italy " has any king presented a balance sheet ? "
richmond , uk has any african king presented their community balance sheet since they were installed ?
lack of proper accountability in our chieftaincy system has meant that the chiefs have used our meagre resources to enrich themselves and their families .
there are numerous disputes and tribal wars as a result .
come forward any chief that has a balance sheet to present .
richmond , uk in the 1920s , colonel rattray the english anthropologist , after studying the asante matrilineal system , concluded it accounted for the high rate of divorces and broken homes in asanteman -lrb- 70-80 % -rrb- .
this is a problem which still remains today .
the matrilineal system was designed to absorb a women back into the community when she did n't remain married .
what is the asanteman council doing to enhance the cohesion and sustenance of the basic family unit in the interest of national development ?
papa kc , ghana the supposedly largest and oldest kingdom on earth is the united kingdom .
how much does this kingdom cost to its subjects ?
is it engaged in profit-oriented activities anywhere ?
what has it done to make the world a better place ?
david karani , helsinki / finland let me recommend to you the gadaa system of the oromo people in ethiopia .
it was a very democratic traditional system , before it was robbed by the ethiopian regional administrations .
aguma bera , atlanta / usa i would very much like to know how royalties paid to particular kingdoms are handled and accounted for ?
as far as i know , development projects in ghana are financed by the central government .
lastly , leading people is the most difficult task on earth - how has the otumfuo managed thus far , since he succeeded his late uncle .
jake amero , ghana / uk " the intricate systems of choosing a leader were destroyed as kingdoms were sucked into colonial power struggles " tshepo , england i have royal ties with both shangaan and pedi royalty and feel bitter about the diminution of african tribal royalty .
i firmly believe that western values imposed on traditional systems of rule have destroyed the quality and charisma of our leaders .
in pedi culture , as in most sotho cultures , the king and his chiefs ruled with the consent of his or her people and with the kgotla -lrb- elders -rrb- overseeing them .
with the arrival of the boers , and their conflict with the british , the intricate systems of choosing a leader was destroyed as kingdoms were sucked into their power struggles .
an example is my great grandfather who should have become paramount chief , but his half brother , with the help of several boer families , took power .
he owed a debt to the boers and proceeded to give away huge tracts of land which today are being contested in south africa .
my great-great grandfather ruled over a tribe of nearly one quarter of a million people , but the tribe that my cousin lesethebe inherited numbers a few thousand .
this story repeats itself with my paternal family with their interaction with the portuguese and arab traders along the borders of mozambique , zimbabwe and sa .
i have many cherished memories of stories told about our leaders , both reflecting their humility , courage and weaknesses .
tshepo , england is it possible for a king who is held accountable by his people , to contract a loan from the world bank or imf for the development of his community ?
daniel nana baffour awuah , canada . "
what are traditional leaders doing to regain their lost glory ? "
lizzie kwaghbo , nigeria traditional rulers are the custodians of culture and traditions .
they are like demi-gods .
the problem is that that was in the olden days .
some traditional rulers do n't command respect any longer .
traditional rulers are now ruled by politicians , rather than the other way round .
my question is , what are traditional rulers doing in order to regain their lost glory ?
lizzie kwaghbo , nigeria being a member of a traditional ruling family in malaysia , there are two questions i would like to pose .
how effective are traditional rulers without constitutional support ?
do you function as an independent voice for the grassroots level or do you see yourselves as part of the political / government administrative machinery in place ?
raja shafinaz raja hussien abdul wahab , malaysia during colonial times , traditional leaders were often bought , co-opted , or simply created by british colonisers especially to establish control through divide-and-rule policies and policies of fragmentation .
how have you dealt with that legacy , especially in trying to retain the respect and allegiance of your subjects ?
nick , usa for the asantehene , what development and investments has the citizenry of the asante kingdom received so far from the royalties of the obuasi goldfields ?
what about accounting to his subjects annually on the resources of the kingdom ?
kwabena brobbey , ghana the traditional institution is unique in africa , and our people enjoy it and we respect our kings a lot .
the bafokeng king in south africa is well respected by the government and he is a small god to some people .
ugochukwu , south africa do you think that the growing apathy and scepticism towards mainstream politics -lrb- and political parties -rrb- will strengthen the influence you have in your country ?
and what is your vision for traditional rulers and kingdoms in the 21st century ?
darren frimpong , united kingdom " are you strong enough to direct the government to areas where social , economic and spiritual development is badly needed ? "
shuttie fn libuta , kitwe when you lobby the government for aid of any sort , do you put the interest of your subjects ahead of your own ?
do you monitor the government of the day to see that traditional forest reserves , game and fish reserves are not leased out to foreigners to the detriment of your subjects ?
are you strong enough to direct the government to areas where social , economic and spiritual development is badly needed ?
whatever woes we have in our various societies or communities , the traditional rulers are 50 % to blame .
we , the common folk have had to pay heavily for our book knowledge while we still had to maintain the royals with our meagre resources .
there is so much misuse of power in our traditional leaders and they are just as corrupt as our politicians .
so , let them answer some of my questions .
shuttie fn libuta , kitwe , zambia my father is an ashanti , i was born in the uk but come to kumasi often .
should i feel ashanti ?
how should i express my allegiance to the tribe ?
kofi poku , uk how do kingdoms ensure a voice for the masses and provide accountability for their stewardship ?
kwadwo poku , usa my question is , how functional are kings in modern day society ?
and how will these cherished kings reclaim the influence they have lost ?
apierreos , washington dc , usa would you subscribe to the proposal that traditional leaders should be given a ten year term limit in office ?
some critics say that your extended stay in office may be responsible for the slow economic development of the provincial and rural districts of the continent .
what would you say to that ?
moses s wilson , usa present day traditional rulers have been taking the development of their subjects as seriously as our central governments .
i therefore suggest that there should be upper house of parliament for the rulers to contribute to the national development .
richard asamoah , ghana why is the king very important to any society in the world ?
peter tuach , minnesota , usa i have always had a place for traditional rule in my heart .
these rulers solve problems in communities across the land .
my only concern is , with corruption running rampant in africa how do you tackle such issues of common interest in a transparent manner ?
josephat m mua , kenyan in usa how many children are you allowed to have ?
is there a specific age that you have to get married by ?
heather , united states " i ca n't help wondering what their roles are in any modern society " ue , uk / nigeria i have nothing against traditional rulers , but i ca n't help wondering what their roles are in any modern society .
history of course has it that they used to be responsible for law and order in ancient times .
but with the emergence of the modern state , this has clearly become the responsibility of governments -lrb- even though i readily concede that in much of africa , this is only so in a theoretical sense -rrb- .
in my view , their roles should not extend beyond the preservation of our cultural heritage , except if they can demonstrate their democratic credentials - in which case they might as well become the government .
ue , uk / nigeria given the appalling history that is associated with traditional rulers in africa from colonial times to date , do these rulers not think they are just trying to be relevant in a world that would be a better place without them ?
anthony o bobori , uk it is tradition that causes our downfall in africa .
the world is improving everyday and africa is still at the back because of tradition .
maddieu kabbah , freetown , sierra leone interesting comments on this page .
looking at the comments it 's very easy to tell where people stand on inherited power , traditions and the modern society .
i think its very important for people to realise that the few traditional kingdoms that remain are still in existence because they do in fact serve a purpose that their subjects value .
some of you may frown on inheritance , but really is there any difference between career politicians in any developed country ?
knowing that you might one day inherit a thrown forces you to go through a very specific training / education throughout your life in preparation for that role .
otiwaa , ghana / usa capable political leaders who people believe in , are hard to come by in africa .
however , you all have gone against great odds to keep your traditional leadership alive .
what advice can you give the african youth aspiring to be the strong leaders they dream of being ?
mwiwa , canada does ultimate power lie within the individual or within the leader of the people ?
what is the basis for the authority of a leader over his people ?
elizabeth prentice , usa a nation can exist without a leader but a leader can not exist without a nation .
yacoubou moutakilou , togo / usa traditions that do not keep up with time must be left to die as we move on .
eric bottah , ghanaian in usa land litigation is a big issue around most peripheral urban areas in africa , especially where customary tenure is operational .
what can traditional leaders do to help curb this problem ?
offei akrofi , ghana " how far would you go to avoid conflict of interest ? "
noray , keren , eritrea how far would you go to avoid conflict of interest ?
could you really , honestly not favour your immediate family members when it comes to making decisions or appointing a position within your government ?
noray , keren , eritrea as an african , i do respect the traditional institution .
our own traditional king , the oba of benin in nigeria still exerts a great influence on his subjects .
my question is how does traditional institution compete with modern day democracy ?
do these traditional rulers still command a lot of respect like before ?
what kind of contribution does the traditional institution contributes to modern day society ?
omorodion osula , boston , usa the first kings probably assumed traditional authority following some significant historical events ; thereafter a lineage system of inheritance to the throne is established , if this is so , what makes these modern times chiefs or rulers feel they are not impositions on their subjects ?
in fact would they accept that selection of a new chief should be opened to the members of the whole community using an established criterion rather perpetuating inheritance to the throne by birth rights ?
s kplorlali , ghana " chieftaincy has evolved and is to a very large extent abreast with regional economic developments " rex asare , nl chieftaincy is not what it used to be a decade ago .
i was privileged to witness the second -lrb- ? -rrb- most influential chief in ghana , the okyehene , a couple of weeks ago , spewing economic theories in perfect english .
he was in the netherlands to seek accreditation , build recognition as well to solicit funding in aid of an effort to convert a dying cocoa research institute in his area into an environmental studies university .
he was good and i think his mission was successful ...
chieftaincy has evolved .
let 's support the chiefs who realise the importance of bringing work and development back into their kingdom .
rex asare , nl please tell me how you arrive at decisions , and how do you know they are the correct ones .
the uk is dependant upon an adversarial system , where everyone argues for their own viewpoint .
how do you stop the clash of personalities from overshadowing the truth ?
gareth jones , england since most africans are more loyal to their tribes than to their central government do you think traditional rulers should be given more role in governance ?
frimpong , switzerland as traditional rulers , to what extent do you embrace modern ideologies in reference to dressing code , food , laws and even the number of wives you marry ?
if you have say two kids is that traditional or modern considering that it is seen as family planning ?
what is there that one should consider traditional in this modern high tech world ?
do n't you think you should cease to exist ?
job egalaha , kenya are you able to justify your inherited power in this modern world ?
tan chung kiat , singapore i would very much like to know how much the will and opinions of the people that you rule influence any decisions you might make .
we see demonstrations of varying sizes in most countries all around the world nowadays , but how much power do these protests carry ?
as a leader do you really allow your opinion to be influenced by the people , or is your own opinion , political stance and experience the greatest influence on your decision ?
shaun evans , uk i do n't know about the situation in which any of these men rule - but are they subject to laws and political systems created outside their sphere of rule - e.g. are the indians in canada subject to canadian law which , presumably , they have not , or not solely , made ?
if so , how do they , personally , feel about being subject to law created by or in conjunction with settlers or others over whom they have no ruling power - especially if this is a relatively new situation to them after centuries of rule ?
are n't there any women traditional leaders to participate ?
jill , england i used to live in zimbabwe and travelled a lot to south africa and other parts of africa .
i have always wanted to live in a village , with traditions and experiences .
so i have some questions - if you could make one difference in the world what would it be ?
if you could help any one person in the world who would it be ?
if a natural or man-made disaster happened near you or in your area would you help ?

send us your questions for three of the world 's influential traditional leaders : ghana 's asantehene , south africa 's bafokeng king , and canada 's nisga 'a president .
as part of the bbc 's who runs your world series africa live will be broadcasting from the heart of ashanti power in ghana , the royal city of kumasi .
we will be joined by the asantehene , nisga 'a president nelson leeson and bafokeng king kgosi leruo molotlegi to discuss customary rule and power relating to traditional positions of authority in our lives today .
what would you like to know about traditional power ?
maybe you 'd like to find out what it 's like to rule a kingdom ?
or how these rulers exercise their power ?
this debate is now closed .
thank you for your comments .
your questions and comments : our chiefs are more respected than our politicians nana oteng amoako , united kingdom i do n't see the difference between our chieftancy institution and the monarchy establishment of other parts of the world .
our chiefs are more respected than our politicians so lets maintain the heritage .
long live the system .
nana oteng amoako , united kingdom kings and traditional leaders are ultimately the custodians of their tribes ' languages , customs and traditions -lrb- bearing in mind that these are continually evolving -rrb- .
i believe that they should immerse themselves in this role in order to serve their people better .
lesedi , new zealand what is the power of the king in a country where there is an elected democratic government run by the president ?
jackson s.g. parwon jr , liberia does the king believe in god or the ancestors or a blend of the two ?
sally alexander , kumasi / ghana does a first son of a traditional leader have to succeed his father ?
do traditional leaders have to marry more than one wife ?
why ?
king anderson emmy snr , ivory coast true democracy can be advanced by kings who have their people at heart hankie uluko , lilongwe true democracy in africa can be further advanced by kings who always have their people at heart , unlike presidents who also serve party positions .
hankie uluko , lilongwe i would like to know about the things these leaders have done for their people , of which they are most proud .
lance , uk i happened to come from ile-ife , the cradle of yoruba people , nigeria .
for centuries , we 've always had our respected kings -lrb- onis -rrb- , who are champions in the art of ruling , from before the colonial system .
i know this because i personally come from historical ancestors .
my father was a chief - lerekun of iraye , ile-ife and these stories were passed from generation to generation .
allen aramide , poland i would want to find out from the asantehene , why other some traditional leaders involve themselves in politics .
under the laws of ghana they are not supposed to do that .
some go to the extent of declaring their support for some presidential candidate .
when that happens their subjects do not give them the needed respect because they do not belong to just one party .
i want to find out from the south african king and canada 's nisga 'a , about their level of involvement in party politics in their country .
kwaku sakyi-danso , accra ghana it is very simple .
royals are parasites .
their only " work " is to protect their own position , by using terms such as " tradition " .
ad van aken , costa rica i think the king has a part to play , but since democracy has taken over in ghana , the monarch should rather sit on an advisory board for consultation .
ampofo gideon lartey , ghana one tribe should not be promoted above others kwaku owusu , ghana the asantehene is not the only chief in ghana .
one tribe should not be promoted above others .
kwaku owusu , ghana i 'd be grateful for some information concerning the first born sons of traditional leaders .
what are their roles ?
is it a must that they succeed their fathers ?
i 'd also like to know whether traditional leaders must have more than one wife .
if so , why ?
king anderson emmy , ivory coast i am amazed so much time and treasure is wasted on traditional leaders .
look at most of them - they have enriched themselves at their society 's expense .
w sargeant , usa in the colonial days , kings and queens were held in high esteem by the people , because it was through them that the white governors sent messages to the people .
but they no longer have the respect and authority they once had .
kofi boateng , usa many traditional rulers in ghana also hold political office .
this is alienating them from the people and eroding the authority of the chief .
do you think traditional rulers should continue to accept political office ?
ben owusu-sekyere , usa i used to live in nigeria , and do cherish dearly africa 's traditional rulers ; but i would like to know how decisions are made in order to protect the rights of the have-nots , since the king is surrounded mostly by aristocrats ?
magnus , canada what should be the duties and responsibilities of a traditional ruler during elections ?
chinedu ibeabuchi , lagos , nigeria do you think it is proper for traditional rulers to be partisan in politics -lrb- openly support a candidate or party -rrb- or coerce their subjects into supporting or voting for a particular party or candidate in an election ?
what should be the duties and responsibilities of a traditional ruler during elections ?
chinedu ibeabuchi , lagos , nigeria what makes a good leader ?
kwaku ofori addo , ghana what kinds of laws do you run your kingdom on ?
do you have a written constitution ?
edwin clarke , liberia i truly think traditional rulers will vanish during this century .
people will be more and more tempted to challenge them as more democracies develop in the world .
placide matsiaba , mikouma / gabon as most governments in africa will surely fail , the only true voice we have are the kings .
stanley , italy has any king presented a balance sheet ?
richmond , uk has any african king presented their community balance sheet since they were installed ?
lack of proper accountability in our chieftaincy system has meant that the chiefs have used our meagre resources to enrich themselves and their families .
there are numerous disputes and tribal wars as a result .
come forward any chief that has a balance sheet to present .
richmond , uk in the 1920s , colonel rattray the english anthropologist , after studying the asante matrilineal system , concluded it accounted for the high rate of divorces and broken homes in asanteman -lrb- 70-80 % -rrb- .
this is a problem which still remains today .
the matrilineal system was designed to absorb a women back into the community when she did n't remain married .
what is the asanteman council doing to enhance the cohesion and sustenance of the basic family unit in the interest of national development ?
papa kc , ghana the supposedly largest and oldest kingdom on earth is the united kingdom .
how much does this kingdom cost to its subjects ?
is it engaged in profit-oriented activities anywhere ?
what has it done to make the world a better place ?
david karani , helsinki / finland let me recommend to you the gadaa system of the oromo people in ethiopia .
it was a very democratic traditional system , before it was robbed by the ethiopian regional administrations .
aguma bera , atlanta / usa i would very much like to know how royalties paid to particular kingdoms are handled and accounted for ?
as far as i know , development projects in ghana are financed by the central government .
lastly , leading people is the most difficult task on earth - how has the otumfuo managed thus far , since he succeeded his late uncle .
jake amero , ghana / uk the intricate systems of choosing a leader were destroyed as kingdoms were sucked into colonial power struggles tshepo , england i have royal ties with both shangaan and pedi royalty and feel bitter about the diminution of african tribal royalty .
i firmly believe that western values imposed on traditional systems of rule have destroyed the quality and charisma of our leaders .
in pedi culture , as in most sotho cultures , the king and his chiefs ruled with the consent of his or her people and with the kgotla -lrb- elders -rrb- overseeing them .
with the arrival of the boers , and their conflict with the british , the intricate systems of choosing a leader was destroyed as kingdoms were sucked into their power struggles .
an example is my great grandfather who should have become paramount chief , but his half brother , with the help of several boer families , took power .
he owed a debt to the boers and proceeded to give away huge tracts of land which today are being contested in south africa .
my great-great grandfather ruled over a tribe of nearly one quarter of a million people , but the tribe that my cousin lesethebe inherited numbers a few thousand .
this story repeats itself with my paternal family with their interaction with the portuguese and arab traders along the borders of mozambique , zimbabwe and sa .
i have many cherished memories of stories told about our leaders , both reflecting their humility , courage and weaknesses .
tshepo , england is it possible for a king who is held accountable by his people , to contract a loan from the world bank or imf for the development of his community ?
daniel nana baffour awuah , canada .
what are traditional leaders doing to regain their lost glory ?
lizzie kwaghbo , nigeria traditional rulers are the custodians of culture and traditions .
they are like demi-gods .
the problem is that that was in the olden days .
some traditional rulers do n't command respect any longer .
traditional rulers are now ruled by politicians , rather than the other way round .
my question is , what are traditional rulers doing in order to regain their lost glory ?
lizzie kwaghbo , nigeria being a member of a traditional ruling family in malaysia , there are two questions i would like to pose .
how effective are traditional rulers without constitutional support ?
do you function as an independent voice for the grassroots level or do you see yourselves as part of the political / government administrative machinery in place ?
raja shafinaz raja hussien abdul wahab , malaysia during colonial times , traditional leaders were often bought , co-opted , or simply created by british colonisers especially to establish control through divide-and-rule policies and policies of fragmentation .
how have you dealt with that legacy , especially in trying to retain the respect and allegiance of your subjects ?
nick , usa for the asantehene , what development and investments has the citizenry of the asante kingdom received so far from the royalties of the obuasi goldfields ?
what about accounting to his subjects annually on the resources of the kingdom ?
kwabena brobbey , ghana the traditional institution is unique in africa , and our people enjoy it and we respect our kings a lot .
the bafokeng king in south africa is well respected by the government and he is a small god to some people .
ugochukwu , south africa do you think that the growing apathy and scepticism towards mainstream politics -lrb- and political parties -rrb- will strengthen the influence you have in your country ?

my father was a chief - lerekun of iraye , ile-ife and these stories were passed from generation to generation .
allen aramide , poland i would want to find out from the asantehene , why other some traditional leaders involve themselves in politics .
under the laws of ghana they are not supposed to do that .
some go to the extent of declaring their support for some presidential candidate .
when that happens their subjects do not give them the needed respect because they do not belong to just one party .
i want to find out from the south african king and canada 's nisga 'a , about their level of involvement in party politics in their country .
kwaku sakyi-danso , accra ghana it is very simple .
royals are parasites .
their only " work " is to protect their own position , by using terms such as " tradition " .
ad van aken , costa rica i think the king has a part to play , but since democracy has taken over in ghana , the monarch should rather sit on an advisory board for consultation .
ampofo gideon lartey , ghana one tribe should not be promoted above others kwaku owusu , ghana the asantehene is not the only chief in ghana .
one tribe should not be promoted above others .
kwaku owusu , ghana i 'd be grateful for some information concerning the first born sons of traditional leaders .
what are their roles ?
is it a must that they succeed their fathers ?
i 'd also like to know whether traditional leaders must have more than one wife .
if so , why ?
king anderson emmy , ivory coast i am amazed so much time and treasure is wasted on traditional leaders .
look at most of them - they have enriched themselves at their society 's expense .
w sargeant , usa in the colonial days , kings and queens were held in high esteem by the people , because it was through them that the white governors sent messages to the people .
but they no longer have the respect and authority they once had .
kofi boateng , usa many traditional rulers in ghana also hold political office .
this is alienating them from the people and eroding the authority of the chief .
do you think traditional rulers should continue to accept political office ?
ben owusu-sekyere , usa i used to live in nigeria , and do cherish dearly africa 's traditional rulers ; but i would like to know how decisions are made in order to protect the rights of the have-nots , since the king is surrounded mostly by aristocrats ?
magnus , canada what should be the duties and responsibilities of a traditional ruler during elections ?
chinedu ibeabuchi , lagos , nigeria do you think it is proper for traditional rulers to be partisan in politics -lrb- openly support a candidate or party -rrb- or coerce their subjects into supporting or voting for a particular party or candidate in an election ?
what should be the duties and responsibilities of a traditional ruler during elections ?
chinedu ibeabuchi , lagos , nigeria what makes a good leader ?
kwaku ofori addo , ghana what kinds of laws do you run your kingdom on ?
do you have a written constitution ?
edwin clarke , liberia i truly think traditional rulers will vanish during this century .
people will be more and more tempted to challenge them as more democracies develop in the world .
placide matsiaba , mikouma / gabon as most governments in africa will surely fail , the only true voice we have are the kings .
stanley , italy has any king presented a balance sheet ?
richmond , uk has any african king presented their community balance sheet since they were installed ?
lack of proper accountability in our chieftaincy system has meant that the chiefs have used our meagre resources to enrich themselves and their families .
there are numerous disputes and tribal wars as a result .
come forward any chief that has a balance sheet to present .
richmond , uk in the 1920s , colonel rattray the english anthropologist , after studying the asante matrilineal system , concluded it accounted for the high rate of divorces and broken homes in asanteman -lrb- 70-80 % -rrb- .
this is a problem which still remains today .
the matrilineal system was designed to absorb a women back into the community when she did n't remain married .
what is the asanteman council doing to enhance the cohesion and sustenance of the basic family unit in the interest of national development ?
papa kc , ghana the supposedly largest and oldest kingdom on earth is the united kingdom .
how much does this kingdom cost to its subjects ?
is it engaged in profit-oriented activities anywhere ?
what has it done to make the world a better place ?
david karani , helsinki / finland let me recommend to you the gadaa system of the oromo people in ethiopia .
it was a very democratic traditional system , before it was robbed by the ethiopian regional administrations .
aguma bera , atlanta / usa i would very much like to know how royalties paid to particular kingdoms are handled and accounted for ?
as far as i know , development projects in ghana are financed by the central government .
lastly , leading people is the most difficult task on earth - how has the otumfuo managed thus far , since he succeeded his late uncle .
jake amero , ghana / uk the intricate systems of choosing a leader were destroyed as kingdoms were sucked into colonial power struggles tshepo , england i have royal ties with both shangaan and pedi royalty and feel bitter about the diminution of african tribal royalty .
i firmly believe that western values imposed on traditional systems of rule have destroyed the quality and charisma of our leaders .
in pedi culture , as in most sotho cultures , the king and his chiefs ruled with the consent of his or her people and with the kgotla -lrb- elders -rrb- overseeing them .
with the arrival of the boers , and their conflict with the british , the intricate systems of choosing a leader was destroyed as kingdoms were sucked into their power struggles .
an example is my great grandfather who should have become paramount chief , but his half brother , with the help of several boer families , took power .
he owed a debt to the boers and proceeded to give away huge tracts of land which today are being contested in south africa .
my great-great grandfather ruled over a tribe of nearly one quarter of a million people , but the tribe that my cousin lesethebe inherited numbers a few thousand .
this story repeats itself with my paternal family with their interaction with the portuguese and arab traders along the borders of mozambique , zimbabwe and sa .
i have many cherished memories of stories told about our leaders , both reflecting their humility , courage and weaknesses .
tshepo , england is it possible for a king who is held accountable by his people , to contract a loan from the world bank or imf for the development of his community ?
daniel nana baffour awuah , canada .
what are traditional leaders doing to regain their lost glory ?
lizzie kwaghbo , nigeria traditional rulers are the custodians of culture and traditions .
they are like demi-gods .
the problem is that that was in the olden days .
some traditional rulers do n't command respect any longer .
traditional rulers are now ruled by politicians , rather than the other way round .
my question is , what are traditional rulers doing in order to regain their lost glory ?
lizzie kwaghbo , nigeria being a member of a traditional ruling family in malaysia , there are two questions i would like to pose .
how effective are traditional rulers without constitutional support ?
do you function as an independent voice for the grassroots level or do you see yourselves as part of the political / government administrative machinery in place ?
raja shafinaz raja hussien abdul wahab , malaysia during colonial times , traditional leaders were often bought , co-opted , or simply created by british colonisers especially to establish control through divide-and-rule policies and policies of fragmentation .
how have you dealt with that legacy , especially in trying to retain the respect and allegiance of your subjects ?
nick , usa for the asantehene , what development and investments has the citizenry of the asante kingdom received so far from the royalties of the obuasi goldfields ?
what about accounting to his subjects annually on the resources of the kingdom ?
kwabena brobbey , ghana the traditional institution is unique in africa , and our people enjoy it and we respect our kings a lot .
the bafokeng king in south africa is well respected by the government and he is a small god to some people .
ugochukwu , south africa do you think that the growing apathy and scepticism towards mainstream politics -lrb- and political parties -rrb- will strengthen the influence you have in your country ?
and what is your vision for traditional rulers and kingdoms in the 21st century ?
darren frimpong , united kingdom are you strong enough to direct the government to areas where social , economic and spiritual development is badly needed ?
shuttie fn libuta , kitwe when you lobby the government for aid of any sort , do you put the interest of your subjects ahead of your own ?
do you monitor the government of the day to see that traditional forest reserves , game and fish reserves are not leased out to foreigners to the detriment of your subjects ?
are you strong enough to direct the government to areas where social , economic and spiritual development is badly needed ?
whatever woes we have in our various societies or communities , the traditional rulers are 50 % to blame .
we , the common folk have had to pay heavily for our book knowledge while we still had to maintain the royals with our meagre resources .
there is so much misuse of power in our traditional leaders and they are just as corrupt as our politicians .
so , let them answer some of my questions .
shuttie fn libuta , kitwe , zambia my father is an ashanti , i was born in the uk but come to kumasi often .
should i feel ashanti ?
how should i express my allegiance to the tribe ?
kofi poku , uk how do kingdoms ensure a voice for the masses and provide accountability for their stewardship ?
kwadwo poku , usa my question is , how functional are kings in modern day society ?
and how will these cherished kings reclaim the influence they have lost ?
apierreos , washington dc , usa would you subscribe to the proposal that traditional leaders should be given a ten year term limit in office ?
some critics say that your extended stay in office may be responsible for the slow economic development of the provincial and rural districts of the continent .
what would you say to that ?
moses s wilson , usa present day traditional rulers have been taking the development of their subjects as seriously as our central governments .
i therefore suggest that there should be upper house of parliament for the rulers to contribute to the national development .
richard asamoah , ghana why is the king very important to any society in the world ?
peter tuach , minnesota , usa i have always had a place for traditional rule in my heart .
these rulers solve problems in communities across the land .
my only concern is , with corruption running rampant in africa how do you tackle such issues of common interest in a transparent manner ?
josephat m mua , kenyan in usa how many children are you allowed to have ?
is there a specific age that you have to get married by ?
heather , united states i ca n't help wondering what their roles are in any modern society ue , uk / nigeria i have nothing against traditional rulers , but i ca n't help wondering what their roles are in any modern society .
history of course has it that they used to be responsible for law and order in ancient times .
but with the emergence of the modern state , this has clearly become the responsibility of governments -lrb- even though i readily concede that in much of africa , this is only so in a theoretical sense -rrb- .
in my view , their roles should not extend beyond the preservation of our cultural heritage , except if they can demonstrate their democratic credentials - in which case they might as well become the government .
ue , uk / nigeria given the appalling history that is associated with traditional rulers in africa from colonial times to date , do these rulers not think they are just trying to be relevant in a world that would be a better place without them ?
anthony o bobori , uk it is tradition that causes our downfall in africa .
the world is improving everyday and africa is still at the back because of tradition .
maddieu kabbah , freetown , sierra leone interesting comments on this page .
looking at the comments it 's very easy to tell where people stand on inherited power , traditions and the modern society .
i think its very important for people to realise that the few traditional kingdoms that remain are still in existence because they do in fact serve a purpose that their subjects value .
some of you may frown on inheritance , but really is there any difference between career politicians in any developed country ?
knowing that you might one day inherit a thrown forces you to go through a very specific training / education throughout your life in preparation for that role .
otiwaa , ghana / usa capable political leaders who people believe in , are hard to come by in africa .
however , you all have gone against great odds to keep your traditional leadership alive .
what advice can you give the african youth aspiring to be the strong leaders they dream of being ?
mwiwa , canada does ultimate power lie within the individual or within the leader of the people ?
what is the basis for the authority of a leader over his people ?
elizabeth prentice , usa a nation can exist without a leader but a leader can not exist without a nation .
yacoubou moutakilou , togo / usa traditions that do not keep up with time must be left to die as we move on .
eric bottah , ghanaian in usa land litigation is a big issue around most peripheral urban areas in africa , especially where customary tenure is operational .
what can traditional leaders do to help curb this problem ?
offei akrofi , ghana how far would you go to avoid conflict of interest ?
noray , keren , eritrea how far would you go to avoid conflict of interest ?
could you really , honestly not favour your immediate family members when it comes to making decisions or appointing a position within your government ?
noray , keren , eritrea as an african , i do respect the traditional institution .
our own traditional king , the oba of benin in nigeria still exerts a great influence on his subjects .
my question is how does traditional institution compete with modern day democracy ?
do these traditional rulers still command a lot of respect like before ?
what kind of contribution does the traditional institution contributes to modern day society ?
omorodion osula , boston , usa the first kings probably assumed traditional authority following some significant historical events ; thereafter a lineage system of inheritance to the throne is established , if this is so , what makes these modern times chiefs or rulers feel they are not impositions on their subjects ?
in fact would they accept that selection of a new chief should be opened to the members of the whole community using an established criterion rather perpetuating inheritance to the throne by birth rights ?
s kplorlali , ghana chieftaincy has evolved and is to a very large extent abreast with regional economic developments rex asare , nl chieftaincy is not what it used to be a decade ago .
i was privileged to witness the second -lrb- ? -rrb- most influential chief in ghana , the okyehene , a couple of weeks ago , spewing economic theories in perfect english .
he was in the netherlands to seek accreditation , build recognition as well to solicit funding in aid of an effort to convert a dying cocoa research institute in his area into an environmental studies university .
he was good and i think his mission was successful ...
chieftaincy has evolved .
let 's support the chiefs who realise the importance of bringing work and development back into their kingdom .
rex asare , nl please tell me how you arrive at decisions , and how do you know they are the correct ones .
the uk is dependant upon an adversarial system , where everyone argues for their own viewpoint .
how do you stop the clash of personalities from overshadowing the truth ?
gareth jones , england since most africans are more loyal to their tribes than to their central government do you think traditional rulers should be given more role in governance ?
frimpong , switzerland as traditional rulers , to what extent do you embrace modern ideologies in reference to dressing code , food , laws and even the number of wives you marry ?
if you have say two kids is that traditional or modern considering that it is seen as family planning ?
what is there that one should consider traditional in this modern high tech world ?
do n't you think you should cease to exist ?
job egalaha , kenya are you able to justify your inherited power in this modern world ?
tan chung kiat , singapore i would very much like to know how much the will and opinions of the people that you rule influence any decisions you might make .
we see demonstrations of varying sizes in most countries all around the world nowadays , but how much power do these protests carry ?
as a leader do you really allow your opinion to be influenced by the people , or is your own opinion , political stance and experience the greatest influence on your decision ?
shaun evans , uk i do n't know about the situation in which any of these men rule - but are they subject to laws and political systems created outside their sphere of rule - e.g. are the indians in canada subject to canadian law which , presumably , they have not , or not solely , made ?
if so , how do they , personally , feel about being subject to law created by or in conjunction with settlers or others over whom they have no ruling power - especially if this is a relatively new situation to them after centuries of rule ?
are n't there any women traditional leaders to participate ?
jill , england i used to live in zimbabwe and travelled a lot to south africa and other parts of africa .
i have always wanted to live in a village , with traditions and experiences .
so i have some questions - if you could make one difference in the world what would it be ?
if you could help any one person in the world who would it be ?
if a natural or man-made disaster happened near you or in your area would you help ?

we will be joined by the asantehene , nisga 'a president nelson leeson and bafokeng king kgosi leruo molotlegi to discuss customary rule and power relating to traditional positions of authority in our lives today .
what would you like to know about traditional power ?
maybe you 'd like to find out what it 's like to rule a kingdom ?
or how these rulers exercise their power ?
this debate is now closed .
thank you for your comments .
your questions and comments : our chiefs are more respected than our politicians nana oteng amoako , united kingdom i do n't see the difference between our chieftancy institution and the monarchy establishment of other parts of the world .
our chiefs are more respected than our politicians so lets maintain the heritage .
long live the system .
nana oteng amoako , united kingdom kings and traditional leaders are ultimately the custodians of their tribes ' languages , customs and traditions -lrb- bearing in mind that these are continually evolving -rrb- .
i believe that they should immerse themselves in this role in order to serve their people better .

eric bottah , ghanaian in usa land litigation is a big issue around most peripheral urban areas in africa , especially where customary tenure is operational .
what can traditional leaders do to help curb this problem ?
offei akrofi , ghana how far would you go to avoid conflict of interest ?
noray , keren , eritrea how far would you go to avoid conflict of interest ?
could you really , honestly not favour your immediate family members when it comes to making decisions or appointing a position within your government ?
noray , keren , eritrea as an african , i do respect the traditional institution .
our own traditional king , the oba of benin in nigeria still exerts a great influence on his subjects .
my question is how does traditional institution compete with modern day democracy ?
do these traditional rulers still command a lot of respect like before ?
what kind of contribution does the traditional institution contributes to modern day society ?
omorodion osula , boston , usa the first kings probably assumed traditional authority following some significant historical events ; thereafter a lineage system of inheritance to the throne is established , if this is so , what makes these modern times chiefs or rulers feel they are not impositions on their subjects ?
in fact would they accept that selection of a new chief should be opened to the members of the whole community using an established criterion rather perpetuating inheritance to the throne by birth rights ?
s kplorlali , ghana chieftaincy has evolved and is to a very large extent abreast with regional economic developments rex asare , nl chieftaincy is not what it used to be a decade ago .
i was privileged to witness the second -lrb- ? -rrb- most influential chief in ghana , the okyehene , a couple of weeks ago , spewing economic theories in perfect english .
he was in the netherlands to seek accreditation , build recognition as well to solicit funding in aid of an effort to convert a dying cocoa research institute in his area into an environmental studies university .
he was good and i think his mission was successful ...
chieftaincy has evolved .
let 's support the chiefs who realise the importance of bringing work and development back into their kingdom .
rex asare , nl please tell me how you arrive at decisions , and how do you know they are the correct ones .
the uk is dependant upon an adversarial system , where everyone argues for their own viewpoint .
how do you stop the clash of personalities from overshadowing the truth ?
gareth jones , england since most africans are more loyal to their tribes than to their central government do you think traditional rulers should be given more role in governance ?
frimpong , switzerland as traditional rulers , to what extent do you embrace modern ideologies in reference to dressing code , food , laws and even the number of wives you marry ?
if you have say two kids is that traditional or modern considering that it is seen as family planning ?
what is there that one should consider traditional in this modern high tech world ?
do n't you think you should cease to exist ?
job egalaha , kenya are you able to justify your inherited power in this modern world ?
tan chung kiat , singapore i would very much like to know how much the will and opinions of the people that you rule influence any decisions you might make .
we see demonstrations of varying sizes in most countries all around the world nowadays , but how much power do these protests carry ?
as a leader do you really allow your opinion to be influenced by the people , or is your own opinion , political stance and experience the greatest influence on your decision ?
shaun evans , uk i do n't know about the situation in which any of these men rule - but are they subject to laws and political systems created outside their sphere of rule - e.g. are the indians in canada subject to canadian law which , presumably , they have not , or not solely , made ?
if so , how do they , personally , feel about being subject to law created by or in conjunction with settlers or others over whom they have no ruling power - especially if this is a relatively new situation to them after centuries of rule ?
are n't there any women traditional leaders to participate ?
jill , england i used to live in zimbabwe and travelled a lot to south africa and other parts of africa .
i have always wanted to live in a village , with traditions and experiences .
so i have some questions - if you could make one difference in the world what would it be ?
if you could help any one person in the world who would it be ?
if a natural or man-made disaster happened near you or in your area would you help ?

as part of the bbc 's who runs your world series africa live will be broadcasting from the heart of ashanti power in ghana , the royal city of kumasi .
we will be joined by the asantehene , nisga 'a president nelson leeson and bafokeng king kgosi leruo molotlegi to discuss customary rule and power relating to traditional positions of authority in our lives today .
what would you like to know about traditional power ?
maybe you 'd like to find out what it 's like to rule a kingdom ?
or how these rulers exercise their power ?
this debate is now closed .
thank you for your comments .
your questions and comments : our chiefs are more respected than our politicians nana oteng amoako , united kingdom i do n't see the difference between our chieftancy institution and the monarchy establishment of other parts of the world .
our chiefs are more respected than our politicians so lets maintain the heritage .
long live the system .
nana oteng amoako , united kingdom kings and traditional leaders are ultimately the custodians of their tribes ' languages , customs and traditions -lrb- bearing in mind that these are continually evolving -rrb- .
i believe that they should immerse themselves in this role in order to serve their people better .
lesedi , new zealand what is the power of the king in a country where there is an elected democratic government run by the president ?
jackson s.g. parwon jr , liberia does the king believe in god or the ancestors or a blend of the two ?
sally alexander , kumasi / ghana does a first son of a traditional leader have to succeed his father ?
do traditional leaders have to marry more than one wife ?
why ?
king anderson emmy snr , ivory coast true democracy can be advanced by kings who have their people at heart hankie uluko , lilongwe true democracy in africa can be further advanced by kings who always have their people at heart , unlike presidents who also serve party positions .
hankie uluko , lilongwe i would like to know about the things these leaders have done for their people , of which they are most proud .
lance , uk i happened to come from ile-ife , the cradle of yoruba people , nigeria .
for centuries , we 've always had our respected kings -lrb- onis -rrb- , who are champions in the art of ruling , from before the colonial system .
i know this because i personally come from historical ancestors .
my father was a chief - lerekun of iraye , ile-ife and these stories were passed from generation to generation .
allen aramide , poland i would want to find out from the asantehene , why other some traditional leaders involve themselves in politics .
under the laws of ghana they are not supposed to do that .
some go to the extent of declaring their support for some presidential candidate .
when that happens their subjects do not give them the needed respect because they do not belong to just one party .
i want to find out from the south african king and canada 's nisga 'a , about their level of involvement in party politics in their country .
kwaku sakyi-danso , accra ghana it is very simple .
royals are parasites .
their only " work " is to protect their own position , by using terms such as " tradition " .
ad van aken , costa rica i think the king has a part to play , but since democracy has taken over in ghana , the monarch should rather sit on an advisory board for consultation .
ampofo gideon lartey , ghana one tribe should not be promoted above others kwaku owusu , ghana the asantehene is not the only chief in ghana .
one tribe should not be promoted above others .
kwaku owusu , ghana i 'd be grateful for some information concerning the first born sons of traditional leaders .
what are their roles ?
is it a must that they succeed their fathers ?
i 'd also like to know whether traditional leaders must have more than one wife .
if so , why ?
king anderson emmy , ivory coast i am amazed so much time and treasure is wasted on traditional leaders .
look at most of them - they have enriched themselves at their society 's expense .
w sargeant , usa in the colonial days , kings and queens were held in high esteem by the people , because it was through them that the white governors sent messages to the people .
but they no longer have the respect and authority they once had .
kofi boateng , usa many traditional rulers in ghana also hold political office .
this is alienating them from the people and eroding the authority of the chief .
do you think traditional rulers should continue to accept political office ?
ben owusu-sekyere , usa i used to live in nigeria , and do cherish dearly africa 's traditional rulers ; but i would like to know how decisions are made in order to protect the rights of the have-nots , since the king is surrounded mostly by aristocrats ?
magnus , canada what should be the duties and responsibilities of a traditional ruler during elections ?
chinedu ibeabuchi , lagos , nigeria do you think it is proper for traditional rulers to be partisan in politics -lrb- openly support a candidate or party -rrb- or coerce their subjects into supporting or voting for a particular party or candidate in an election ?
what should be the duties and responsibilities of a traditional ruler during elections ?
chinedu ibeabuchi , lagos , nigeria what makes a good leader ?
kwaku ofori addo , ghana what kinds of laws do you run your kingdom on ?
do you have a written constitution ?
edwin clarke , liberia i truly think traditional rulers will vanish during this century .
people will be more and more tempted to challenge them as more democracies develop in the world .
placide matsiaba , mikouma / gabon as most governments in africa will surely fail , the only true voice we have are the kings .
stanley , italy has any king presented a balance sheet ?
richmond , uk has any african king presented their community balance sheet since they were installed ?
lack of proper accountability in our chieftaincy system has meant that the chiefs have used our meagre resources to enrich themselves and their families .
there are numerous disputes and tribal wars as a result .
come forward any chief that has a balance sheet to present .
richmond , uk in the 1920s , colonel rattray the english anthropologist , after studying the asante matrilineal system , concluded it accounted for the high rate of divorces and broken homes in asanteman -lrb- 70-80 % -rrb- .
this is a problem which still remains today .
the matrilineal system was designed to absorb a women back into the community when she did n't remain married .
what is the asanteman council doing to enhance the cohesion and sustenance of the basic family unit in the interest of national development ?
papa kc , ghana the supposedly largest and oldest kingdom on earth is the united kingdom .
how much does this kingdom cost to its subjects ?
is it engaged in profit-oriented activities anywhere ?
what has it done to make the world a better place ?
david karani , helsinki / finland let me recommend to you the gadaa system of the oromo people in ethiopia .
it was a very democratic traditional system , before it was robbed by the ethiopian regional administrations .
aguma bera , atlanta / usa i would very much like to know how royalties paid to particular kingdoms are handled and accounted for ?
as far as i know , development projects in ghana are financed by the central government .
lastly , leading people is the most difficult task on earth - how has the otumfuo managed thus far , since he succeeded his late uncle .
jake amero , ghana / uk the intricate systems of choosing a leader were destroyed as kingdoms were sucked into colonial power struggles tshepo , england i have royal ties with both shangaan and pedi royalty and feel bitter about the diminution of african tribal royalty .
i firmly believe that western values imposed on traditional systems of rule have destroyed the quality and charisma of our leaders .
in pedi culture , as in most sotho cultures , the king and his chiefs ruled with the consent of his or her people and with the kgotla -lrb- elders -rrb- overseeing them .
with the arrival of the boers , and their conflict with the british , the intricate systems of choosing a leader was destroyed as kingdoms were sucked into their power struggles .
an example is my great grandfather who should have become paramount chief , but his half brother , with the help of several boer families , took power .
he owed a debt to the boers and proceeded to give away huge tracts of land which today are being contested in south africa .
my great-great grandfather ruled over a tribe of nearly one quarter of a million people , but the tribe that my cousin lesethebe inherited numbers a few thousand .
this story repeats itself with my paternal family with their interaction with the portuguese and arab traders along the borders of mozambique , zimbabwe and sa .
i have many cherished memories of stories told about our leaders , both reflecting their humility , courage and weaknesses .
tshepo , england is it possible for a king who is held accountable by his people , to contract a loan from the world bank or imf for the development of his community ?
daniel nana baffour awuah , canada .
what are traditional leaders doing to regain their lost glory ?
lizzie kwaghbo , nigeria traditional rulers are the custodians of culture and traditions .
they are like demi-gods .
the problem is that that was in the olden days .
some traditional rulers do n't command respect any longer .
traditional rulers are now ruled by politicians , rather than the other way round .
my question is , what are traditional rulers doing in order to regain their lost glory ?
lizzie kwaghbo , nigeria being a member of a traditional ruling family in malaysia , there are two questions i would like to pose .
how effective are traditional rulers without constitutional support ?
do you function as an independent voice for the grassroots level or do you see yourselves as part of the political / government administrative machinery in place ?
raja shafinaz raja hussien abdul wahab , malaysia during colonial times , traditional leaders were often bought , co-opted , or simply created by british colonisers especially to establish control through divide-and-rule policies and policies of fragmentation .
how have you dealt with that legacy , especially in trying to retain the respect and allegiance of your subjects ?
nick , usa for the asantehene , what development and investments has the citizenry of the asante kingdom received so far from the royalties of the obuasi goldfields ?
what about accounting to his subjects annually on the resources of the kingdom ?
kwabena brobbey , ghana the traditional institution is unique in africa , and our people enjoy it and we respect our kings a lot .
the bafokeng king in south africa is well respected by the government and he is a small god to some people .
ugochukwu , south africa do you think that the growing apathy and scepticism towards mainstream politics -lrb- and political parties -rrb- will strengthen the influence you have in your country ?
and what is your vision for traditional rulers and kingdoms in the 21st century ?
darren frimpong , united kingdom are you strong enough to direct the government to areas where social , economic and spiritual development is badly needed ?
shuttie fn libuta , kitwe when you lobby the government for aid of any sort , do you put the interest of your subjects ahead of your own ?
do you monitor the government of the day to see that traditional forest reserves , game and fish reserves are not leased out to foreigners to the detriment of your subjects ?
are you strong enough to direct the government to areas where social , economic and spiritual development is badly needed ?
whatever woes we have in our various societies or communities , the traditional rulers are 50 % to blame .
we , the common folk have had to pay heavily for our book knowledge while we still had to maintain the royals with our meagre resources .
there is so much misuse of power in our traditional leaders and they are just as corrupt as our politicians .
so , let them answer some of my questions .
shuttie fn libuta , kitwe , zambia my father is an ashanti , i was born in the uk but come to kumasi often .
should i feel ashanti ?
how should i express my allegiance to the tribe ?
kofi poku , uk how do kingdoms ensure a voice for the masses and provide accountability for their stewardship ?
kwadwo poku , usa my question is , how functional are kings in modern day society ?
and how will these cherished kings reclaim the influence they have lost ?
apierreos , washington dc , usa would you subscribe to the proposal that traditional leaders should be given a ten year term limit in office ?
some critics say that your extended stay in office may be responsible for the slow economic development of the provincial and rural districts of the continent .
what would you say to that ?
moses s wilson , usa present day traditional rulers have been taking the development of their subjects as seriously as our central governments .
i therefore suggest that there should be upper house of parliament for the rulers to contribute to the national development .
richard asamoah , ghana why is the king very important to any society in the world ?
peter tuach , minnesota , usa i have always had a place for traditional rule in my heart .
these rulers solve problems in communities across the land .
my only concern is , with corruption running rampant in africa how do you tackle such issues of common interest in a transparent manner ?
josephat m mua , kenyan in usa how many children are you allowed to have ?
is there a specific age that you have to get married by ?
heather , united states i ca n't help wondering what their roles are in any modern society ue , uk / nigeria i have nothing against traditional rulers , but i ca n't help wondering what their roles are in any modern society .
history of course has it that they used to be responsible for law and order in ancient times .
but with the emergence of the modern state , this has clearly become the responsibility of governments -lrb- even though i readily concede that in much of africa , this is only so in a theoretical sense -rrb- .
in my view , their roles should not extend beyond the preservation of our cultural heritage , except if they can demonstrate their democratic credentials - in which case they might as well become the government .
ue , uk / nigeria given the appalling history that is associated with traditional rulers in africa from colonial times to date , do these rulers not think they are just trying to be relevant in a world that would be a better place without them ?
anthony o bobori , uk it is tradition that causes our downfall in africa .
the world is improving everyday and africa is still at the back because of tradition .
maddieu kabbah , freetown , sierra leone interesting comments on this page .
looking at the comments it 's very easy to tell where people stand on inherited power , traditions and the modern society .
i think its very important for people to realise that the few traditional kingdoms that remain are still in existence because they do in fact serve a purpose that their subjects value .
some of you may frown on inheritance , but really is there any difference between career politicians in any developed country ?
knowing that you might one day inherit a thrown forces you to go through a very specific training / education throughout your life in preparation for that role .
otiwaa , ghana / usa capable political leaders who people believe in , are hard to come by in africa .
however , you all have gone against great odds to keep your traditional leadership alive .
what advice can you give the african youth aspiring to be the strong leaders they dream of being ?
mwiwa , canada does ultimate power lie within the individual or within the leader of the people ?
what is the basis for the authority of a leader over his people ?
elizabeth prentice , usa a nation can exist without a leader but a leader can not exist without a nation .
yacoubou moutakilou , togo / usa traditions that do not keep up with time must be left to die as we move on .
eric bottah , ghanaian in usa land litigation is a big issue around most peripheral urban areas in africa , especially where customary tenure is operational .
what can traditional leaders do to help curb this problem ?
offei akrofi , ghana how far would you go to avoid conflict of interest ?
noray , keren , eritrea how far would you go to avoid conflict of interest ?
could you really , honestly not favour your immediate family members when it comes to making decisions or appointing a position within your government ?
noray , keren , eritrea as an african , i do respect the traditional institution .
our own traditional king , the oba of benin in nigeria still exerts a great influence on his subjects .
my question is how does traditional institution compete with modern day democracy ?
do these traditional rulers still command a lot of respect like before ?
what kind of contribution does the traditional institution contributes to modern day society ?
omorodion osula , boston , usa the first kings probably assumed traditional authority following some significant historical events ; thereafter a lineage system of inheritance to the throne is established , if this is so , what makes these modern times chiefs or rulers feel they are not impositions on their subjects ?
in fact would they accept that selection of a new chief should be opened to the members of the whole community using an established criterion rather perpetuating inheritance to the throne by birth rights ?
s kplorlali , ghana chieftaincy has evolved and is to a very large extent abreast with regional economic developments rex asare , nl chieftaincy is not what it used to be a decade ago .
i was privileged to witness the second -lrb- ? -rrb- most influential chief in ghana , the okyehene , a couple of weeks ago , spewing economic theories in perfect english .
he was in the netherlands to seek accreditation , build recognition as well to solicit funding in aid of an effort to convert a dying cocoa research institute in his area into an environmental studies university .
he was good and i think his mission was successful ...
chieftaincy has evolved .
let 's support the chiefs who realise the importance of bringing work and development back into their kingdom .
rex asare , nl please tell me how you arrive at decisions , and how do you know they are the correct ones .
the uk is dependant upon an adversarial system , where everyone argues for their own viewpoint .
how do you stop the clash of personalities from overshadowing the truth ?
gareth jones , england since most africans are more loyal to their tribes than to their central government do you think traditional rulers should be given more role in governance ?
frimpong , switzerland as traditional rulers , to what extent do you embrace modern ideologies in reference to dressing code , food , laws and even the number of wives you marry ?
if you have say two kids is that traditional or modern considering that it is seen as family planning ?
what is there that one should consider traditional in this modern high tech world ?
do n't you think you should cease to exist ?
job egalaha , kenya are you able to justify your inherited power in this modern world ?
tan chung kiat , singapore i would very much like to know how much the will and opinions of the people that you rule influence any decisions you might make .
we see demonstrations of varying sizes in most countries all around the world nowadays , but how much power do these protests carry ?
as a leader do you really allow your opinion to be influenced by the people , or is your own opinion , political stance and experience the greatest influence on your decision ?

lastly , leading people is the most difficult task on earth - how has the otumfuo managed thus far , since he succeeded his late uncle .
jake amero , ghana / uk the intricate systems of choosing a leader were destroyed as kingdoms were sucked into colonial power struggles tshepo , england i have royal ties with both shangaan and pedi royalty and feel bitter about the diminution of african tribal royalty .
i firmly believe that western values imposed on traditional systems of rule have destroyed the quality and charisma of our leaders .
in pedi culture , as in most sotho cultures , the king and his chiefs ruled with the consent of his or her people and with the kgotla -lrb- elders -rrb- overseeing them .
with the arrival of the boers , and their conflict with the british , the intricate systems of choosing a leader was destroyed as kingdoms were sucked into their power struggles .
an example is my great grandfather who should have become paramount chief , but his half brother , with the help of several boer families , took power .
he owed a debt to the boers and proceeded to give away huge tracts of land which today are being contested in south africa .
my great-great grandfather ruled over a tribe of nearly one quarter of a million people , but the tribe that my cousin lesethebe inherited numbers a few thousand .
this story repeats itself with my paternal family with their interaction with the portuguese and arab traders along the borders of mozambique , zimbabwe and sa .
i have many cherished memories of stories told about our leaders , both reflecting their humility , courage and weaknesses .
tshepo , england is it possible for a king who is held accountable by his people , to contract a loan from the world bank or imf for the development of his community ?
daniel nana baffour awuah , canada .
what are traditional leaders doing to regain their lost glory ?
lizzie kwaghbo , nigeria traditional rulers are the custodians of culture and traditions .
they are like demi-gods .
the problem is that that was in the olden days .
some traditional rulers do n't command respect any longer .
traditional rulers are now ruled by politicians , rather than the other way round .
my question is , what are traditional rulers doing in order to regain their lost glory ?
lizzie kwaghbo , nigeria being a member of a traditional ruling family in malaysia , there are two questions i would like to pose .
how effective are traditional rulers without constitutional support ?
do you function as an independent voice for the grassroots level or do you see yourselves as part of the political / government administrative machinery in place ?
raja shafinaz raja hussien abdul wahab , malaysia during colonial times , traditional leaders were often bought , co-opted , or simply created by british colonisers especially to establish control through divide-and-rule policies and policies of fragmentation .
how have you dealt with that legacy , especially in trying to retain the respect and allegiance of your subjects ?
nick , usa for the asantehene , what development and investments has the citizenry of the asante kingdom received so far from the royalties of the obuasi goldfields ?
what about accounting to his subjects annually on the resources of the kingdom ?
kwabena brobbey , ghana the traditional institution is unique in africa , and our people enjoy it and we respect our kings a lot .
the bafokeng king in south africa is well respected by the government and he is a small god to some people .
ugochukwu , south africa do you think that the growing apathy and scepticism towards mainstream politics -lrb- and political parties -rrb- will strengthen the influence you have in your country ?
and what is your vision for traditional rulers and kingdoms in the 21st century ?
darren frimpong , united kingdom are you strong enough to direct the government to areas where social , economic and spiritual development is badly needed ?
shuttie fn libuta , kitwe when you lobby the government for aid of any sort , do you put the interest of your subjects ahead of your own ?
do you monitor the government of the day to see that traditional forest reserves , game and fish reserves are not leased out to foreigners to the detriment of your subjects ?
are you strong enough to direct the government to areas where social , economic and spiritual development is badly needed ?
whatever woes we have in our various societies or communities , the traditional rulers are 50 % to blame .
we , the common folk have had to pay heavily for our book knowledge while we still had to maintain the royals with our meagre resources .
there is so much misuse of power in our traditional leaders and they are just as corrupt as our politicians .
so , let them answer some of my questions .
shuttie fn libuta , kitwe , zambia my father is an ashanti , i was born in the uk but come to kumasi often .
should i feel ashanti ?
how should i express my allegiance to the tribe ?
kofi poku , uk how do kingdoms ensure a voice for the masses and provide accountability for their stewardship ?
kwadwo poku , usa my question is , how functional are kings in modern day society ?
and how will these cherished kings reclaim the influence they have lost ?
apierreos , washington dc , usa would you subscribe to the proposal that traditional leaders should be given a ten year term limit in office ?
some critics say that your extended stay in office may be responsible for the slow economic development of the provincial and rural districts of the continent .
what would you say to that ?
moses s wilson , usa present day traditional rulers have been taking the development of their subjects as seriously as our central governments .
i therefore suggest that there should be upper house of parliament for the rulers to contribute to the national development .
richard asamoah , ghana why is the king very important to any society in the world ?
peter tuach , minnesota , usa i have always had a place for traditional rule in my heart .
these rulers solve problems in communities across the land .
my only concern is , with corruption running rampant in africa how do you tackle such issues of common interest in a transparent manner ?
josephat m mua , kenyan in usa how many children are you allowed to have ?
is there a specific age that you have to get married by ?
heather , united states i ca n't help wondering what their roles are in any modern society ue , uk / nigeria i have nothing against traditional rulers , but i ca n't help wondering what their roles are in any modern society .
history of course has it that they used to be responsible for law and order in ancient times .
but with the emergence of the modern state , this has clearly become the responsibility of governments -lrb- even though i readily concede that in much of africa , this is only so in a theoretical sense -rrb- .
in my view , their roles should not extend beyond the preservation of our cultural heritage , except if they can demonstrate their democratic credentials - in which case they might as well become the government .
ue , uk / nigeria given the appalling history that is associated with traditional rulers in africa from colonial times to date , do these rulers not think they are just trying to be relevant in a world that would be a better place without them ?
anthony o bobori , uk it is tradition that causes our downfall in africa .
the world is improving everyday and africa is still at the back because of tradition .
maddieu kabbah , freetown , sierra leone interesting comments on this page .
looking at the comments it 's very easy to tell where people stand on inherited power , traditions and the modern society .
i think its very important for people to realise that the few traditional kingdoms that remain are still in existence because they do in fact serve a purpose that their subjects value .
some of you may frown on inheritance , but really is there any difference between career politicians in any developed country ?
knowing that you might one day inherit a thrown forces you to go through a very specific training / education throughout your life in preparation for that role .
otiwaa , ghana / usa capable political leaders who people believe in , are hard to come by in africa .
however , you all have gone against great odds to keep your traditional leadership alive .
what advice can you give the african youth aspiring to be the strong leaders they dream of being ?
mwiwa , canada does ultimate power lie within the individual or within the leader of the people ?
what is the basis for the authority of a leader over his people ?
elizabeth prentice , usa a nation can exist without a leader but a leader can not exist without a nation .
yacoubou moutakilou , togo / usa traditions that do not keep up with time must be left to die as we move on .
eric bottah , ghanaian in usa land litigation is a big issue around most peripheral urban areas in africa , especially where customary tenure is operational .
what can traditional leaders do to help curb this problem ?
offei akrofi , ghana how far would you go to avoid conflict of interest ?
noray , keren , eritrea how far would you go to avoid conflict of interest ?
could you really , honestly not favour your immediate family members when it comes to making decisions or appointing a position within your government ?
noray , keren , eritrea as an african , i do respect the traditional institution .
our own traditional king , the oba of benin in nigeria still exerts a great influence on his subjects .
my question is how does traditional institution compete with modern day democracy ?
do these traditional rulers still command a lot of respect like before ?
what kind of contribution does the traditional institution contributes to modern day society ?
omorodion osula , boston , usa the first kings probably assumed traditional authority following some significant historical events ; thereafter a lineage system of inheritance to the throne is established , if this is so , what makes these modern times chiefs or rulers feel they are not impositions on their subjects ?
in fact would they accept that selection of a new chief should be opened to the members of the whole community using an established criterion rather perpetuating inheritance to the throne by birth rights ?
s kplorlali , ghana chieftaincy has evolved and is to a very large extent abreast with regional economic developments rex asare , nl chieftaincy is not what it used to be a decade ago .
i was privileged to witness the second -lrb- ? -rrb- most influential chief in ghana , the okyehene , a couple of weeks ago , spewing economic theories in perfect english .
he was in the netherlands to seek accreditation , build recognition as well to solicit funding in aid of an effort to convert a dying cocoa research institute in his area into an environmental studies university .
he was good and i think his mission was successful ...
chieftaincy has evolved .
let 's support the chiefs who realise the importance of bringing work and development back into their kingdom .
rex asare , nl please tell me how you arrive at decisions , and how do you know they are the correct ones .
the uk is dependant upon an adversarial system , where everyone argues for their own viewpoint .
how do you stop the clash of personalities from overshadowing the truth ?
gareth jones , england since most africans are more loyal to their tribes than to their central government do you think traditional rulers should be given more role in governance ?
frimpong , switzerland as traditional rulers , to what extent do you embrace modern ideologies in reference to dressing code , food , laws and even the number of wives you marry ?
if you have say two kids is that traditional or modern considering that it is seen as family planning ?
what is there that one should consider traditional in this modern high tech world ?
do n't you think you should cease to exist ?
job egalaha , kenya are you able to justify your inherited power in this modern world ?
tan chung kiat , singapore i would very much like to know how much the will and opinions of the people that you rule influence any decisions you might make .
we see demonstrations of varying sizes in most countries all around the world nowadays , but how much power do these protests carry ?
as a leader do you really allow your opinion to be influenced by the people , or is your own opinion , political stance and experience the greatest influence on your decision ?
shaun evans , uk i do n't know about the situation in which any of these men rule - but are they subject to laws and political systems created outside their sphere of rule - e.g. are the indians in canada subject to canadian law which , presumably , they have not , or not solely , made ?
if so , how do they , personally , feel about being subject to law created by or in conjunction with settlers or others over whom they have no ruling power - especially if this is a relatively new situation to them after centuries of rule ?
are n't there any women traditional leaders to participate ?
jill , england i used to live in zimbabwe and travelled a lot to south africa and other parts of africa .
i have always wanted to live in a village , with traditions and experiences .
so i have some questions - if you could make one difference in the world what would it be ?
if you could help any one person in the world who would it be ?
if a natural or man-made disaster happened near you or in your area would you help ?

send us your questions for three of the world 's influential traditional leaders : ghana 's asantehene , south africa 's bafokeng king , and canada 's nisga 'a president .
as part of the bbc 's who runs your world series africa live will be broadcasting from the heart of ashanti power in ghana , the royal city of kumasi .
we will be joined by the asantehene , nisga 'a president nelson leeson and bafokeng king kgosi leruo molotlegi to discuss customary rule and power relating to traditional positions of authority in our lives today .
what would you like to know about traditional power ?
maybe you 'd like to find out what it 's like to rule a kingdom ?
or how these rulers exercise their power ?
this debate is now closed .
thank you for your comments .
your questions and comments : our chiefs are more respected than our politicians nana oteng amoako , united kingdom i do n't see the difference between our chieftancy institution and the monarchy establishment of other parts of the world .
our chiefs are more respected than our politicians so lets maintain the heritage .
long live the system .
nana oteng amoako , united kingdom kings and traditional leaders are ultimately the custodians of their tribes ' languages , customs and traditions -lrb- bearing in mind that these are continually evolving -rrb- .
i believe that they should immerse themselves in this role in order to serve their people better .
lesedi , new zealand what is the power of the king in a country where there is an elected democratic government run by the president ?
jackson s.g. parwon jr , liberia does the king believe in god or the ancestors or a blend of the two ?
sally alexander , kumasi / ghana does a first son of a traditional leader have to succeed his father ?
do traditional leaders have to marry more than one wife ?
why ?
king anderson emmy snr , ivory coast true democracy can be advanced by kings who have their people at heart hankie uluko , lilongwe true democracy in africa can be further advanced by kings who always have their people at heart , unlike presidents who also serve party positions .
hankie uluko , lilongwe i would like to know about the things these leaders have done for their people , of which they are most proud .
lance , uk i happened to come from ile-ife , the cradle of yoruba people , nigeria .
for centuries , we 've always had our respected kings -lrb- onis -rrb- , who are champions in the art of ruling , from before the colonial system .
i know this because i personally come from historical ancestors .
my father was a chief - lerekun of iraye , ile-ife and these stories were passed from generation to generation .
allen aramide , poland i would want to find out from the asantehene , why other some traditional leaders involve themselves in politics .
under the laws of ghana they are not supposed to do that .
some go to the extent of declaring their support for some presidential candidate .
when that happens their subjects do not give them the needed respect because they do not belong to just one party .
i want to find out from the south african king and canada 's nisga 'a , about their level of involvement in party politics in their country .
kwaku sakyi-danso , accra ghana it is very simple .
royals are parasites .
their only " work " is to protect their own position , by using terms such as " tradition " .
ad van aken , costa rica i think the king has a part to play , but since democracy has taken over in ghana , the monarch should rather sit on an advisory board for consultation .
ampofo gideon lartey , ghana one tribe should not be promoted above others kwaku owusu , ghana the asantehene is not the only chief in ghana .
one tribe should not be promoted above others .
kwaku owusu , ghana i 'd be grateful for some information concerning the first born sons of traditional leaders .
what are their roles ?
is it a must that they succeed their fathers ?
i 'd also like to know whether traditional leaders must have more than one wife .
if so , why ?
king anderson emmy , ivory coast i am amazed so much time and treasure is wasted on traditional leaders .
look at most of them - they have enriched themselves at their society 's expense .
w sargeant , usa in the colonial days , kings and queens were held in high esteem by the people , because it was through them that the white governors sent messages to the people .
but they no longer have the respect and authority they once had .
kofi boateng , usa many traditional rulers in ghana also hold political office .
this is alienating them from the people and eroding the authority of the chief .
do you think traditional rulers should continue to accept political office ?
ben owusu-sekyere , usa i used to live in nigeria , and do cherish dearly africa 's traditional rulers ; but i would like to know how decisions are made in order to protect the rights of the have-nots , since the king is surrounded mostly by aristocrats ?
magnus , canada what should be the duties and responsibilities of a traditional ruler during elections ?
chinedu ibeabuchi , lagos , nigeria do you think it is proper for traditional rulers to be partisan in politics -lrb- openly support a candidate or party -rrb- or coerce their subjects into supporting or voting for a particular party or candidate in an election ?
what should be the duties and responsibilities of a traditional ruler during elections ?
chinedu ibeabuchi , lagos , nigeria what makes a good leader ?
kwaku ofori addo , ghana what kinds of laws do you run your kingdom on ?
do you have a written constitution ?
edwin clarke , liberia i truly think traditional rulers will vanish during this century .
people will be more and more tempted to challenge them as more democracies develop in the world .
placide matsiaba , mikouma / gabon as most governments in africa will surely fail , the only true voice we have are the kings .
stanley , italy has any king presented a balance sheet ?
richmond , uk has any african king presented their community balance sheet since they were installed ?
lack of proper accountability in our chieftaincy system has meant that the chiefs have used our meagre resources to enrich themselves and their families .
there are numerous disputes and tribal wars as a result .
come forward any chief that has a balance sheet to present .
richmond , uk in the 1920s , colonel rattray the english anthropologist , after studying the asante matrilineal system , concluded it accounted for the high rate of divorces and broken homes in asanteman -lrb- 70-80 % -rrb- .
this is a problem which still remains today .
the matrilineal system was designed to absorb a women back into the community when she did n't remain married .
what is the asanteman council doing to enhance the cohesion and sustenance of the basic family unit in the interest of national development ?
papa kc , ghana the supposedly largest and oldest kingdom on earth is the united kingdom .
how much does this kingdom cost to its subjects ?
is it engaged in profit-oriented activities anywhere ?
what has it done to make the world a better place ?
david karani , helsinki / finland let me recommend to you the gadaa system of the oromo people in ethiopia .
it was a very democratic traditional system , before it was robbed by the ethiopian regional administrations .
aguma bera , atlanta / usa i would very much like to know how royalties paid to particular kingdoms are handled and accounted for ?

as an exhibition of edvard munch paintings opens in london , can art ever be safe from thieves ?
the royal academy is confident the exhibition of munch pictures is well protected .
enlarge image one of the most recent , and certainly the most high-profile , art thefts took place at the munch museum in oslo last year .
two paintings , one of them the iconic munch work the scream , were stolen by two armed men in august .
they walked into the museum and simply tore the paintings from the walls before running to a getaway car .
the museum - which has more than 1,000 munch paintings - has loaned a large number of works to the royal academy for an exhibition of the artist 's self-portraits , which opens on saturday .
ton cremers , founder of the museum security network , says art theft remains a major threat around the world .
" according to interpol and the fbi and interpol it is the third largest illegal trade after drugs and weapons , " says mr cremers , who offers a consultancy to individuals and institutions on issues of theft and forgery .
victims he says museums are the victims of theft in 15 % of all art robberies .
" they are the ones in the headlines , private collectors are not . "
he adds : " the awareness of theft and security has increased in the last 20 years .
but too many museums rely only on electronic equipment , not realising that you also need a good security organisation as well . "
british museums have a ' good level of security ' however , he says that british museums generally have better security than museums on continental europe .
since the 2004 theft in oslo , the munch museum has spent almost £ 3.5m on improving its security .
" the munch museum have gone very far with their security but it is still a good visitor experience , " says mr cremers .
" they have shown plenty of courage in taking this step . "
electronic ticketing , a security entrance similar to airport passport control , bullet-proof glass for the most prized works and a long hall which can be closed at both ends to trap thieves are among the measures installed .
' main problem ' " everyone has to go through a metal detector and every bag has to go on a conveyor belt and is scanned , " says jorunn christoffersen , head of information at the museum .
" our main problem was the distance between the entrance and the halls , where very valuable paintings were shown , was too short .
that is why we have made the entrance longer . "
she adds : " very few museums have sufficient protection if armed robbers enter .
robbers in oslo were seen carrying the pictures to a getaway car " it is much more difficult in buildings like tate modern which are so big .
you have to walk and walk and walk even before you see a painting . "
ms christoffersen says the museum still has some concerns , including fears of a potential hostage situation if a robbery was attempted in the future .
' hostage situation ' " there is the danger of a hostage situation with so many obstacles now in the museum .
even if we have done everything to prevent this from happening . "
with so many of its paintings on loan in london the museum has taken every step to ensure they are safe .
should this familiar airport scene be repeated in all museums ?
" our head of security has been in close contact with the royal academy and is in london now .
he is also meeting with security heads at other museums , including tate modern and tate britain .
" he has made sure the paintings are safe at the royal academy . "
mr cremers says : " if you were a private collector i would say - do n't tell people about your artwork , do n't show them and keep it in the heart of the house .
" museums have to do the exact opposite . "
tore hoifodt , head of communications at dnv , the firm which carried out the security assessment at the munch museum after the theft , says no museum would ever be robbery proof .
" if you turned a museum into a fortress , perhaps it would be , but you want as many visitors in there as possible . "
he says changes to the entrance at the museum , making it less open and less accessible , are measures which could be applied to all museums and galleries .
" some people feel the museum is less accessible , but it is a difficult balance . "
mr cremers says improvements in security techniques would further protect art .
" access control will change .
there have been a lot of improvements to showcases and new techniques in tracking the movement of objects around museums . "

magistrates are planning to question mr fazio next month about his handling of a controversial takeover bid , reuters and the financial times said .
senior italian politicians have called on mr fazio to quit , but the bank of italy has given him renewed backing .
mr fazio has denied wrongdoing and said he intends to remain in office .
questioning ?
under italian law , being placed under criminal investigation does not imply guilt or mean that charges will necessarily be brought .
according to judicial sources quoted by reuters , mr fazio has been under investigation since august , soon after the scandal first broke . "
for us at this point , the fazio case is closed " paolo emilio ferreri , bank of italy councillor reuters reported that magistrates were investigating mr fazio for suspected abuse of office and would interview him on 5 october .
however , mr fazio 's lawyer said his client had not received a summons to appear before magistrates .
magistrates are investigating a range of suspected criminal activity in relation to the takeover of italy 's banca antonveneta .
mr fazio has come under pressure to resign following allegations that he tried to stop dutch bank abn amro acquiring control of antonveneta by favouring a bid from italy 's banca popolare italiana .
leaked transcripts of telephone conversations seemed to indicate that mr fazio had tipped off popolare italiana 's boss about the bank of italy 's decision to clear the bid .

wrangling over who should essentially be the net police , managing domain names and net traffic routing fairly , has been going on for some time .
the matter is supposed to be discussed at november 's world summit on the information society in tunisia .
but at a pre-summit meeting this week , the us said it would resist the plans .
in the meeting , the european union -lrb- eu -rrb- backed proposals that control of the net should be under a more representative body .
" we will not agree to the un taking over the management of the internet , " said ambassador david gross , the us coordinator for international communications and information policy at the state department .
" some countries want that .
we think that 's unacceptable . "
fairer sharing currently , the us commerce department approves any changes to the internet 's core addressing systems , the root zone files , managed by icann -lrb- internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -rrb- .
last month the un 's working group on internet governance -lrb- wgig -rrb- published its proposals for reform of the way the net is run , which are to be debated at the summit .
governance over the net - the management of its addressing systems and traffic routing - has historically been the role of the us because it largely funded and pushed its early development .
developing nations want the net and its domains shared equally the us argues that un proposals would shift the regulatory approach from private sector leadership to government , top-down control .
icann administers domain name and addressing systems , such as country domain suffixes .
it manages how net browsers and e-mail programs direct traffic .
but many countries , particuarly developing nations , have been calling for the us to relinquish control , or at least to come up with a compromise , to ensure the net is managed more equitably .
many outside the us argue that no one country should have authority over something that plays such a key role in the global economy .
as many developing countries seek to exploit the net for economic and social development , the issue has become more pressing .
the un 's wgig has suggested four alternatives : option one - create a un body known as the global internet council that draws its members from governments and " other stakeholders " and takes over the us oversight role of icann .
option two - no changes apart from strengthening icann 's governmental advisory committee to become a forum for official debate on net issues .
option three - relegate icann to a narrow technical role and set up an international internet council that sits outside the un .
us loses oversight of icann option four - create three new bodies .
one to take over from icann and look after the net 's addressing system .
one to be a debating chamber for governments , businesses and the public ; and one to co-ordinate work on " internet-related public policy issues " .

the us firm has ended its 12-year partnership with the weinsteins , whose miramax studios produced oscar-winning films such as the hours and chicago .
the move came after disney refused to distribute michael moore 's documentary fahrenheit 9/11 , funded by miramax .
disney head mr eisner will be replaced by bob iger , after 21 years .
independent films brothers harvey and bob weinstein reinvigorated the independent film industry by distributing and producing low-budget movies that had been overlooked by hollywood .
their firm miramax has supported movies that became critical and box office successes , including sex , lies and videotape , the crying game , the piano , pulp fiction and the english patient and cold mountain .
such movies were previously considered a risk because they often dealt with " fringe " topics - subjects that were thought to be too controversial for mainstream american audiences .
miramax backed oscar-winning films such as chicago the success of miramax encouraged major studios to set up their own low-budget film divisions , and disney gained a controlling interest in miramax in a $ 60m -lrb- £ 34m -rrb- deal in 1994 .
the pair are stepping down as co-chief executives of miramax after years of reported tension with disney head mr eisner .
last year he clashed with harvey weinstein over fahrenheit 9/11 , after disney refused to release michael moore 's documentary , which was critical of us president bush .
the weinsteins will continue to make films for disney through their new firm the weinstein co , however , including forthcoming thriller derailed - starring clive owen - and the matador starring pierce brosnan .
television hits in the 21 years since mr eisner joined disney , the company has gone from $ 1.5bn -lrb- £ 852m -rrb- in annual revenues to nearly $ 31bn -lrb- £ 17bn -rrb- today .
michael eisner has presided over a boost in disney 's revenue he helped reinvigorate disney 's film animation group , creating hit movies such as the lion king .
but in 1996 disney was sued for bonus money by ex-disney president michael ovitz , settling for a reported $ 250m -lrb- £ 142m -rrb- .
disney 's theme parks suffered from a tourism slump after the 11 september attacks on the world trade center and pentagon in 2001 , although they have since rebounded .
