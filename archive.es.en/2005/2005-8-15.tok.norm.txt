the mideast , iran , iraq , saudi arabia - germany 's ties with these nations may be influenced by current conflicts .
but the pursuit of peace and stability there has been a central plank of schröder 's foreign policy . since taking office in 1998 , german foreign minister joschka fischer has visited the middle east - and particularly israel and the autonomous palestinian areas - more often than any other european or western politician . the success of his visits , however , did n't correspond to their frequency : it only made it clear that european countries , as opposed to the us , are - even with the best of intentions - helpless and powerless when it comes to the question of solving the mideast conflict . it 's a fact that applies more to germany than to any other european nation .
that 's because germany has been able to adopt a less " neutral " role than other countries in the region because of its history and crime against the jews - at least unto the point when the conflict was inexorable , as was the case before the oslo treaty in 1993 : the palestinians demanded the scrapping of the jewish state and israel refused to recognize the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- and the right of the palestinians to their own state - next to israel 's . during those years , germany was only active in the region within a european framework . germa n diplomacy post-oslo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then president bill clinton presides over ceremonies marking the signing of the 1993 peace accord between israel and the palestinians , with israeli prime minister yitzhak rabin -lrb- left -rrb- and plo chairman yasser arafat -lrb- right -rrb- on sept .
13 , 1993 oslo however changed all that fundamentally : both sides silently acknowledged each other and foreswore violence , creating ideal conditions for germany to serve both sides as a reliable friend and aide - particularly when the implementation of the oslo agreements seemed to increasingly run into hitches . chancellor schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens that found themselves in this delicate situation was however aware that german help could only be an addition to washington 's political engagement - and even that could be useless and ineffective as long as the two warring sides did n't themselves demonstrate goodwill and take the first steps towards reconciliation . thus the main goal of fischer 's visits to the region was to encourage both sides to take the initiative and to urge them to take larger strides . but the promising success of those efforts came to an abrupt halt in september 2000 when the " al aqsa intifada " broke out and relations between israel and the palestinians plumbed to depths not seen since the six-day war in 1967 . joschka fischer continued to try to mediate and negotiate - but other than friendly words he did n't really achieve much on both sides .
thus germany once again reverted to an international diplomatic line : in 2003 the eu , un , us and russia agreed on the so-called " road map " for the mideast and this plan has been the declared fundament for german peace efforts in the mideast conflict ever since . continue to read about germany 's stand on iraq , iran and the arab peninsula . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new face of germany abroad ?

" bush should know that our capabilities are much greater than those of the united states , " foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told reporters .
" we do n't think that the united states will make such a mistake . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president bush , joined at right by secretary of state condoleezza rice , talks to reporters after meeting with his defense and foreign policy teams at his ranch in crawford , texas bush , whose country is derided in iran as the " great satan , " refused to rule out the use of force against iran over its resumption of nuclear work , which the united states charges is a cover for efforts to build the bomb . he said " all options are on the table , " in an interview with israeli television , a line he has used before with regard a potential us response to iran 's nuclear work . " the use of force is the last option for any president .
you know we have used force in the recent past to secure our country , " he said in a clear reference to iraq , which the united states invaded in march 2003 . " i have been willing to do so as a last resort in order to secure the country and provide the opportunity for people to live in free societies , " he added . europe 's " attitude " important asefi also warned europe - which had been trying to obtain guarantees that tehran 's nuclear programme was peaceful in exchange for expanded trade benefits - that its attitude would be a key factor in any decision to start up enrichment activities . " the attitude and the actions of the europeans in the next few days will be the determining factor , " said asefi . iran 's decision last week to resume uranium conversion work , which is a precursor to enrichment , was " not negotiable , " he added . asefi said the iranian regime had not yet reached a consensus on uranium enrichment , a process which makes fuel for nuclear reactors but can also be the core of an atomic bomb . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyrus nasseri head of iran 's delegation at international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- speaks during a pressconference prior the emergency meeting of iaea 's 35-nation board of governors on iran at an emergency meeting thursday , the international atomic energy agency called on iran to halt the nuclear fuel cycle work and ordered the un watchdog to report on september 3 on tehran 's compliance with international safeguards . germany says no to military option german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday pushed aside the option of using force to contain iran and its uranium enrichment activities , saying that military options were worthless . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundeskanzler gerhard schroeder hebt am samstag , 13 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.08.2005 berlin schools on a learning curve großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " zuckertüte " was first introduced in 1817 as a new school year fraught with controversial reforms gets underway in berlin , monday saw a record 41,000 children start school for the first time - but not before they 'd taken part in a time-honored ritual . " i want to go home , " wailed one pint-sized school starter , as hundreds of misty-eyed mothers , beaming grandmas , and fathers armed with video cameras jostled into the school assembly hall .
the occasion was what 's known across germany as " einschulung " - a symbolic ceremony marking the start of formal education . clutching a garishly-decorated giant cone filled with candy and gifts - the " zuckertüte , " designed to cushion the blow of starting school - the boy was hurried into place at the front of the hall next to rows of other infants looking dazed and confused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as tradition dictates , they all carried empty but spanking new school satchels and sported fluorescent caps sponsored by the road safety association .
thus attired , they settled down for a welcome show put together by the older grades - their eyes widening in a combination of fear and fascination as a gaggle of eight-year-olds with accordions filled the stage to perform a song about the alphabet .
once the entertainment was over , they were invited up one by one to shake hands personally with the school principal before being whisked off to classrooms for a short chat with their new teacher . a year to remember it was the second saturday in august , and similar scenes were taking place all over the capital . if it seemed a little more hectic than usual , it was probably due to a slate of radical reforms ushered in by the city ’ s social democrat education senator klaus böger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thanks to his changes , this is set to be a memorable year for berlin 's 350,000 berlin pupils and 32,000 teachers .
in a staunch rejection of what former president roman herzog once described as the city government ’ s ideological " touchy-feely " educational policy , the capital 's children are now the first in the country to go to school 6 months earlier than they used to , reducing the average age of school starters from 6.7 to 6.2 and resulting in 13,000 more school registrations for 2005 than ever before . " my son did n't get a place in the same school as his brother , because so many children were vying for places this year , " complained one mother . 200 new teachers had to be hired to handle the increased numbers of new pupils in elementary schools , one third of whom are now under 6 , while another 250 were drafted in from high schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pre-school class has been thrown out , and the average 10 percent of children who fail to keep up will no longer be allowed to repeat the grade .
moreover , over the next few years , the first and second grades are to be gradually merged .
while this theoretically allows individual children to develop at their own speed - and possibly prove such quick learners they can skip a year - critics of the reforms have voiced concern that teachers will be inhibited by the difficulties of reconciling the needs of such a broad age range . but the opportunity to fast-track through the first two years of school has a number of long-term advantages .

teams fight to keep pace with bayern sports -pipe- 15.08.2005 bayern top as flying dutchman takes off 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay conducted a master class in finishing on saturday dutch striker roy makaay took his goals total to five in two games on saturday as bayern munich put bayer leverkusen to the sword in a 5-2 rout .
the rest of the bundesliga should be quivering . bayern munich this week had to wire deportivo la coruna 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 622,000 -rrb- for breaking a clause in the contract of roy makaay , but the dutch international striker more than repaid that outlay , scoring a hat-trick as bayern crushed leverkusen 5-2 on saturday to march to the top of the table . leverkusen mauled german champions bayern 4-1 in the corresponding fixture last season but makaay ensured bayern had their revenge with a sensational treble at the bayarena . " this is the first time i have had a good pre-season at bayern and it is showing , " said makaay . dutchman sends out a warning with hat-trick makaay scored twice in the opening 3-0 win over borussia mönchengladbach and took his tally to five in two matches thanks to some generous bayer defending .
he twisted brazilian international roque junior inside out with a clever feint to score his first goal in the 11th minute and then scored twice in three minutes -lrb- 57 , 60 -rrb- to take the match ball . " the 5-2 result was a fair reflection , " declared bayern coach felix magath .
" roy makaay showed his class - he is in good shape after a great pre-season . " after former bayer star michael ballack opened the scoring , powering home a perfectly-placed shot into the corner of the net in the third minute , it was over to the flying dutchman to take center stage .
makaay even had time to set up iranian international midfielder ali karimi for his first bundesliga goal after 35 minutes . karimi gets his first bundesliga goal an intelligent header from the netherlands star left karimi , dubbed ' the asian maradona ' , with the simple task of volleying into an empty net to score on his full debut for the club just three minutes after bayer briefly looked to be getting into the match with dimitar berbatov scoring a penalty .
bayer 's marko babic got a late consolation eight minutes from time . schalke 04 are considered bayern 's main challengers for the 2006 bundesliga title and they kept within striking distance with a 2-1 win over derby rivals borussia dortmund . kuranyi at the double as schalke sink bvb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a capacity 81,264 crowd at the westfalen stadium produced an atmosphere befitting the occasion but the majority went home disappointed as german international kevin kuranyi scored twice to cancel out ebi smolarek 's controversial opener . " you can see that he -lrb- kuranyi -rrb- has been getting better with every week , " lauded schalke manager ralf rangnick . schalke were indebted to brazilian-born kuranyi after going behind on 17 minutes when smolarek put dortmund in front although the goal was controversial to say the least . cupping his arms like a volleyball player smolarek controlled a cross with his forearm but , with everyone expecting a foul to be awarded , referee herbert fandel waved play on and he scrambled the ball in . schalke were livid but responded the best possible way with kuranyi equalizing five minutes later with his first goal for the club .
the second was not long in coming and kuranyi 's 58th minute effort downed dortmund . the 2002 german champions have failed to beat their old foes at home since november 1998 and the long wait goes on . click here for more match reports 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ruhr pressure cooker ready to boil over the bundesliga 's second match day offers fans two classic encounters .

the rest of the bundesliga should be quivering . bayern munich this week had to wire deportivo la coruna 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 622,000 -rrb- for breaking a clause in the contract of roy makaay , but the dutch international striker more than repaid that outlay , scoring a hat-trick as bayern crushed leverkusen 5-2 on saturday to march to the top of the table . leverkusen mauled german champions bayern 4-1 in the corresponding fixture last season but makaay ensured bayern had their revenge with a sensational treble at the bayarena . " this is the first time i have had a good pre-season at bayern and it is showing , " said makaay . dutchman sends out a warning with hat-trick makaay scored twice in the opening 3-0 win over borussia mönchengladbach and took his tally to five in two matches thanks to some generous bayer defending .

but china still has n't forgiven or forgotten . sixty years after emperor hirohito spoke in public for the first time to announce japan 's surrender , his son emperor akihito and prime minister junichiro koizumi both called for a future japan that would live in peace . " in the past , japan , through its colonial rule and aggression , caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries , particularly to those of asian nations , " koizumi told some 7,000 war bereaved and officials at a tokyo ceremony .
" japan squarely faces these facts of history in a spirit of humility .
i express here once again my feelings of deep remorse and heartfelt apology , and my feelings of profound mourning for all victims , both at home and abroad , of that war , " he said . but tens of thousands of people also paid their respects at the revered but controversial yasukuni shrine , where top war criminals are honored among the war dead and which many other asians see as a symbol of japan 's militarism . failing to face up to the past many in china and south korea feel japan has not faced up to its past .
" actions speak louder than words ...
his words appeared faint and his sincerity is also in doubt , " said an editorial in the china daily , referring to koizumi 's past apologies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dynamite blast showers debris high into the air as the u.s. marines demolition crew eliminates japanese resistance in a cave on okinawa on the ryukyu islands on may 21 , 1945 during world war ii .
but some japanese also think the time to apologize is over and believe tokyo should not cave in to chinese criticism . the public is divided in its views of yasukuni as well as on how to assess the war .
43 percent of respondents to a weekend survey by mainichi newspaper said japan 's war against china and the united states was wrong , while 29 percent said it was unavoidable . fighting fascism in its resistance to japan , china became one of the four leading powers fighting fascism .

this battle , in which chinese soldiers for the first time resisted with military force the japanese who had been long advancing through china , marks the beginning of world war ii to the chinese .
they see world war ii in the pacific - which the west defines as having been fought between japan and the united states - as a logical extension of the war between japan and china .
in the west , too , historians occasionally cite the war as having started and ended in china , after eight - instead of six - years .
but their opponents contend that this view risks minimizing germany 's guilt for having unleashed world war ii .
china 's pay-off china , as mao zedong once said , was one of the largest countries among the anti-fascist alliance fighting the war through to its very end .
its involvement significantly strengthened china 's position within the international community as indicated by its status as a founding member of the united nations and a member of the un security council with veto powers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.08.2005 opposition blasts schröder on iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives say schröder is using a tested electoral tactic germany 's conservatives have criticized schröder 's warnings against using military force against iran , saying the chancellor 's exploiting the issue for electoral gain - much like the iraq war during the last campaign . german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday vehemently rejected the use of military coercion to contain iran and its alleged uranium enrichment activities . " let 's leave military options aside , we have already seen that they do n't amount to anything , " schröder said during an electoral meeting in the northern city of hanover .
" i consider the military option to be extremely dangerous .
so i can definitely rule out that a government under my leadership would take part , " schröder added in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper on sunday . heightened circumstances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and conservative challenger merkel the statements may probably have passed by without a murmur in normal circumstances .
but given that germany is in the grip of an election campaign - with early federal polls likely to take place next month - the utterance has raised the hackles of the conservative opposition . they accuse the chancellor of milking the issue to gain votes at a time when his ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens is heading for near certain defeat . " schröder is acting completely irresponsibly for electoral purposes .
he 's acting as though the problem were in washington , rather than tehran even through he knows that is n't so , " wolfgang schäuble , senior foreign policy expert of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the daily die welt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iranian security official , dressed in protective clothing , walks inside the uranium conversion facility , just outside the city of isfahan .
though tehran has insisted that its nuclear program is meant for civilian purposes , suspicions linger , especially in washington , that the country is seeking a nuclear bomb .
over the weekend , us president bush said military force remained a last resort to press tehran to abandon its nuclear program . familiar tactic ? what 's also riled the conservatives is the fact that schröder 's categorical statements on iran contain echoes of a similar tactic deployed by the chancellor during the last election campaign in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers in iraq schröder 's opposition to military action against iraq and his refusal to support the us-led iraq war was largely credited for his unexpected victory at the time .
schröder 's anti-war stance and his blatant electioneering when he accused the conservatives of toeing washington 's line led to a serious rift between berlin and washington , taking the transatlantic relationship to an all-time low . the conservatives fear that the chancellor 's exploitation of the iran issue to tap into germany 's deep-seated opposition to us military action in iraq ahead of the election could once again open up old wounds in the transatlantic relationship which have since been smoothed over . " schröder has to stop turning the serious conflict with iran into an election issue , " friedbert pflüger , foreign policy expert of the cdu told daily berliner zeitung on monday .
" the -lrb- chancellor 's -rrb- statement is a blatant effort to instrumentalize the nuclear row in iran for domestic purposes , " said wolfgang bosbach , deputy cdu parliamentary leader . the view is shared by the opposition liberal free democrats , a likely junior partner in a future coalition with the cdu .
" i expect the german chancellor to personally talk with president bush and not about him at poll campaign meetings , " said guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp on monday . undermining international solidarity ? the opposition also believes that the chancellor 's warnings against using military force in iran also risks undermining international solidarity for electoral gain . " the chancellor is creating the fatal impression in tehran that the world community is not united anymore , " schäuble said .
" in doing so , he is accepting the consequence that the danger of an iranian bomb will grow , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder with müntefering schröder 's camp however has rejected the conservatives ' allegations . " the chancellor did n't direct the statements at any one , rather he has generally made it clear that we want to be a peace-loving power , " said franz müntefering , spd chairman in a radio interview monday . he added that the accusation that schröder was using the iran conflict for election purposes was a twisted interpretation . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder against military option in iran german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday pushed aside the option of using force to contain iran and its uranium enrichment activities , saying that military options were worthless .

" let 's leave military options aside , we have already seen that they do n't amount to anything , " schröder said during an electoral meeting in the northern city of hanover .
" i consider the military option to be extremely dangerous .
so i can definitely rule out that a government under my leadership would take part , " schröder added in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper on sunday . heightened circumstances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and conservative challenger merkel the statements may probably have passed by without a murmur in normal circumstances .
but given that germany is in the grip of an election campaign - with early federal polls likely to take place next month - the utterance has raised the hackles of the conservative opposition . they accuse the chancellor of milking the issue to gain votes at a time when his ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens is heading for near certain defeat . " schröder is acting completely irresponsibly for electoral purposes .
he 's acting as though the problem were in washington , rather than tehran even through he knows that is n't so , " wolfgang schäuble , senior foreign policy expert of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the daily die welt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iranian security official , dressed in protective clothing , walks inside the uranium conversion facility , just outside the city of isfahan .
though tehran has insisted that its nuclear program is meant for civilian purposes , suspicions linger , especially in washington , that the country is seeking a nuclear bomb .
over the weekend , us president bush said military force remained a last resort to press tehran to abandon its nuclear program . familiar tactic ? what 's also riled the conservatives is the fact that schröder 's categorical statements on iran contain echoes of a similar tactic deployed by the chancellor during the last election campaign in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers in iraq schröder 's opposition to military action against iraq and his refusal to support the us-led iraq war was largely credited for his unexpected victory at the time .
schröder 's anti-war stance and his blatant electioneering when he accused the conservatives of toeing washington 's line led to a serious rift between berlin and washington , taking the transatlantic relationship to an all-time low . the conservatives fear that the chancellor 's exploitation of the iran issue to tap into germany 's deep-seated opposition to us military action in iraq ahead of the election could once again open up old wounds in the transatlantic relationship which have since been smoothed over . " schröder has to stop turning the serious conflict with iran into an election issue , " friedbert pflüger , foreign policy expert of the cdu told daily berliner zeitung on monday .
" the -lrb- chancellor 's -rrb- statement is a blatant effort to instrumentalize the nuclear row in iran for domestic purposes , " said wolfgang bosbach , deputy cdu parliamentary leader . the view is shared by the opposition liberal free democrats , a likely junior partner in a future coalition with the cdu .
" i expect the german chancellor to personally talk with president bush and not about him at poll campaign meetings , " said guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp on monday . undermining international solidarity ? the opposition also believes that the chancellor 's warnings against using military force in iran also risks undermining international solidarity for electoral gain . " the chancellor is creating the fatal impression in tehran that the world community is not united anymore , " schäuble said .
" in doing so , he is accepting the consequence that the danger of an iranian bomb will grow , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder with müntefering schröder 's camp however has rejected the conservatives ' allegations . " the chancellor did n't direct the statements at any one , rather he has generally made it clear that we want to be a peace-loving power , " said franz müntefering , spd chairman in a radio interview monday . he added that the accusation that schröder was using the iran conflict for election purposes was a twisted interpretation . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder against military option in iran german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday pushed aside the option of using force to contain iran and its uranium enrichment activities , saying that military options were worthless .

" let 's leave military options aside , we have already seen that they do n't amount to anything , " schröder said during an electoral meeting in the northern city of hanover .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.08.2005 opposition blasts schröder on iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives say schröder is using a tested electoral tactic germany 's conservatives have criticized schröder 's warnings against using military force against iran , saying the chancellor 's exploiting the issue for electoral gain - much like the iraq war during the last campaign . german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday vehemently rejected the use of military coercion to contain iran and its alleged uranium enrichment activities . " let 's leave military options aside , we have already seen that they do n't amount to anything , " schröder said during an electoral meeting in the northern city of hanover .
" i consider the military option to be extremely dangerous .
so i can definitely rule out that a government under my leadership would take part , " schröder added in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper on sunday . heightened circumstances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and conservative challenger merkel the statements may probably have passed by without a murmur in normal circumstances .
but given that germany is in the grip of an election campaign - with early federal polls likely to take place next month - the utterance has raised the hackles of the conservative opposition . they accuse the chancellor of milking the issue to gain votes at a time when his ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens is heading for near certain defeat . " schröder is acting completely irresponsibly for electoral purposes .
he 's acting as though the problem were in washington , rather than tehran even through he knows that is n't so , " wolfgang schäuble , senior foreign policy expert of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the daily die welt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iranian security official , dressed in protective clothing , walks inside the uranium conversion facility , just outside the city of isfahan .
though tehran has insisted that its nuclear program is meant for civilian purposes , suspicions linger , especially in washington , that the country is seeking a nuclear bomb .
over the weekend , us president bush said military force remained a last resort to press tehran to abandon its nuclear program . familiar tactic ? what 's also riled the conservatives is the fact that schröder 's categorical statements on iran contain echoes of a similar tactic deployed by the chancellor during the last election campaign in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers in iraq schröder 's opposition to military action against iraq and his refusal to support the us-led iraq war was largely credited for his unexpected victory at the time .
schröder 's anti-war stance and his blatant electioneering when he accused the conservatives of toeing washington 's line led to a serious rift between berlin and washington , taking the transatlantic relationship to an all-time low . the conservatives fear that the chancellor 's exploitation of the iran issue to tap into germany 's deep-seated opposition to us military action in iraq ahead of the election could once again open up old wounds in the transatlantic relationship which have since been smoothed over . " schröder has to stop turning the serious conflict with iran into an election issue , " friedbert pflüger , foreign policy expert of the cdu told daily berliner zeitung on monday .
" the -lrb- chancellor 's -rrb- statement is a blatant effort to instrumentalize the nuclear row in iran for domestic purposes , " said wolfgang bosbach , deputy cdu parliamentary leader . the view is shared by the opposition liberal free democrats , a likely junior partner in a future coalition with the cdu .
" i expect the german chancellor to personally talk with president bush and not about him at poll campaign meetings , " said guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp on monday . undermining international solidarity ? the opposition also believes that the chancellor 's warnings against using military force in iran also risks undermining international solidarity for electoral gain . " the chancellor is creating the fatal impression in tehran that the world community is not united anymore , " schäuble said .
" in doing so , he is accepting the consequence that the danger of an iranian bomb will grow , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder with müntefering schröder 's camp however has rejected the conservatives ' allegations .

the mideast , iran , iraq , saudi arabia - germany 's ties with these nations may be influenced by current conflicts .
but the pursuit of peace and stability there has been a central plank of schröder 's foreign policy . since taking office in 1998 , german foreign minister joschka fischer has visited the middle east - and particularly israel and the autonomous palestinian areas - more often than any other european or western politician . the success of his visits , however , did n't correspond to their frequency : it only made it clear that european countries , as opposed to the us , are - even with the best of intentions - helpless and powerless when it comes to the question of solving the mideast conflict . it 's a fact that applies more to germany than to any other european nation .
that 's because germany has been able to adopt a less " neutral " role than other countries in the region because of its history and crime against the jews - at least unto the point when the conflict was inexorable , as was the case before the oslo treaty in 1993 : the palestinians demanded the scrapping of the jewish state and israel refused to recognize the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- and the right of the palestinians to their own state - next to israel 's . during those years , germany was only active in the region within a european framework . germa n diplomacy post-oslo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then president bill clinton presides over ceremonies marking the signing of the 1993 peace accord between israel and the palestinians , with israeli prime minister yitzhak rabin -lrb- left -rrb- and plo chairman yasser arafat -lrb- right -rrb- on sept .
13 , 1993 oslo however changed all that fundamentally : both sides silently acknowledged each other and foreswore violence , creating ideal conditions for germany to serve both sides as a reliable friend and aide - particularly when the implementation of the oslo agreements seemed to increasingly run into hitches . chancellor schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens that found themselves in this delicate situation was however aware that german help could only be an addition to washington 's political engagement - and even that could be useless and ineffective as long as the two warring sides did n't themselves demonstrate goodwill and take the first steps towards reconciliation . thus the main goal of fischer 's visits to the region was to encourage both sides to take the initiative and to urge them to take larger strides . but the promising success of those efforts came to an abrupt halt in september 2000 when the " al aqsa intifada " broke out and relations between israel and the palestinians plumbed to depths not seen since the six-day war in 1967 . joschka fischer continued to try to mediate and negotiate - but other than friendly words he did n't really achieve much on both sides .
thus germany once again reverted to an international diplomatic line : in 2003 the eu , un , us and russia agreed on the so-called " road map " for the mideast and this plan has been the declared fundament for german peace efforts in the mideast conflict ever since . continue to read about germany 's stand on iraq , iran and the arab peninsula . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new face of germany abroad ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.08.2005 berlin schools on a learning curve großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " zuckertüte " was first introduced in 1817 as a new school year fraught with controversial reforms gets underway in berlin , monday saw a record 41,000 children start school for the first time - but not before they 'd taken part in a time-honored ritual . " i want to go home , " wailed one pint-sized school starter , as hundreds of misty-eyed mothers , beaming grandmas , and fathers armed with video cameras jostled into the school assembly hall .
the occasion was what 's known across germany as " einschulung " - a symbolic ceremony marking the start of formal education . clutching a garishly-decorated giant cone filled with candy and gifts - the " zuckertüte , " designed to cushion the blow of starting school - the boy was hurried into place at the front of the hall next to rows of other infants looking dazed and confused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as tradition dictates , they all carried empty but spanking new school satchels and sported fluorescent caps sponsored by the road safety association .
thus attired , they settled down for a welcome show put together by the older grades - their eyes widening in a combination of fear and fascination as a gaggle of eight-year-olds with accordions filled the stage to perform a song about the alphabet .
once the entertainment was over , they were invited up one by one to shake hands personally with the school principal before being whisked off to classrooms for a short chat with their new teacher . a year to remember it was the second saturday in august , and similar scenes were taking place all over the capital . if it seemed a little more hectic than usual , it was probably due to a slate of radical reforms ushered in by the city ’ s social democrat education senator klaus böger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thanks to his changes , this is set to be a memorable year for berlin 's 350,000 berlin pupils and 32,000 teachers .
in a staunch rejection of what former president roman herzog once described as the city government ’ s ideological " touchy-feely " educational policy , the capital 's children are now the first in the country to go to school 6 months earlier than they used to , reducing the average age of school starters from 6.7 to 6.2 and resulting in 13,000 more school registrations for 2005 than ever before . " my son did n't get a place in the same school as his brother , because so many children were vying for places this year , " complained one mother . 200 new teachers had to be hired to handle the increased numbers of new pupils in elementary schools , one third of whom are now under 6 , while another 250 were drafted in from high schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pre-school class has been thrown out , and the average 10 percent of children who fail to keep up will no longer be allowed to repeat the grade .
moreover , over the next few years , the first and second grades are to be gradually merged .
while this theoretically allows individual children to develop at their own speed - and possibly prove such quick learners they can skip a year - critics of the reforms have voiced concern that teachers will be inhibited by the difficulties of reconciling the needs of such a broad age range . but the opportunity to fast-track through the first two years of school has a number of long-term advantages .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.08.2005 berlin schools on a learning curve großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " zuckertüte " was first introduced in 1817 as a new school year fraught with controversial reforms gets underway in berlin , monday saw a record 41,000 children start school for the first time - but not before they 'd taken part in a time-honored ritual . " i want to go home , " wailed one pint-sized school starter , as hundreds of misty-eyed mothers , beaming grandmas , and fathers armed with video cameras jostled into the school assembly hall .
the occasion was what 's known across germany as " einschulung " - a symbolic ceremony marking the start of formal education . clutching a garishly-decorated giant cone filled with candy and gifts - the " zuckertüte , " designed to cushion the blow of starting school - the boy was hurried into place at the front of the hall next to rows of other infants looking dazed and confused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as tradition dictates , they all carried empty but spanking new school satchels and sported fluorescent caps sponsored by the road safety association .
thus attired , they settled down for a welcome show put together by the older grades - their eyes widening in a combination of fear and fascination as a gaggle of eight-year-olds with accordions filled the stage to perform a song about the alphabet .
once the entertainment was over , they were invited up one by one to shake hands personally with the school principal before being whisked off to classrooms for a short chat with their new teacher . a year to remember it was the second saturday in august , and similar scenes were taking place all over the capital . if it seemed a little more hectic than usual , it was probably due to a slate of radical reforms ushered in by the city ’ s social democrat education senator klaus böger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thanks to his changes , this is set to be a memorable year for berlin 's 350,000 berlin pupils and 32,000 teachers .
in a staunch rejection of what former president roman herzog once described as the city government ’ s ideological " touchy-feely " educational policy , the capital 's children are now the first in the country to go to school 6 months earlier than they used to , reducing the average age of school starters from 6.7 to 6.2 and resulting in 13,000 more school registrations for 2005 than ever before . " my son did n't get a place in the same school as his brother , because so many children were vying for places this year , " complained one mother . 200 new teachers had to be hired to handle the increased numbers of new pupils in elementary schools , one third of whom are now under 6 , while another 250 were drafted in from high schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pre-school class has been thrown out , and the average 10 percent of children who fail to keep up will no longer be allowed to repeat the grade .
moreover , over the next few years , the first and second grades are to be gradually merged .
while this theoretically allows individual children to develop at their own speed - and possibly prove such quick learners they can skip a year - critics of the reforms have voiced concern that teachers will be inhibited by the difficulties of reconciling the needs of such a broad age range . but the opportunity to fast-track through the first two years of school has a number of long-term advantages .
" pupils who do this , especially those who start school at the age of 5 , will be considerably younger when they leave high-school , " explained inge hirschmann from the berlin elementary schools association .
" that means they can join the job market earlier , start vocational training earlier or begin studying earlier - and that makes germany more competitive with other european countries . " demographic difficulties rainer lehmann is an education expert at berlin 's humboldt university and a member of the pisa consortium -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- , which rates student performance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he admits the reforms might be happening at a somewhat alarming rate , but he believes they were long overdue .

" let 's leave military options aside , we have already seen that they do n't amount to anything , " schröder said during an electoral meeting in the northern city of hanover .
" i consider the military option to be extremely dangerous .
so i can definitely rule out that a government under my leadership would take part , " schröder added in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper on sunday . heightened circumstances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and conservative challenger merkel the statements may probably have passed by without a murmur in normal circumstances .
but given that germany is in the grip of an election campaign - with early federal polls likely to take place next month - the utterance has raised the hackles of the conservative opposition . they accuse the chancellor of milking the issue to gain votes at a time when his ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens is heading for near certain defeat . " schröder is acting completely irresponsibly for electoral purposes .
he 's acting as though the problem were in washington , rather than tehran even through he knows that is n't so , " wolfgang schäuble , senior foreign policy expert of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the daily die welt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iranian security official , dressed in protective clothing , walks inside the uranium conversion facility , just outside the city of isfahan .
though tehran has insisted that its nuclear program is meant for civilian purposes , suspicions linger , especially in washington , that the country is seeking a nuclear bomb .
over the weekend , us president bush said military force remained a last resort to press tehran to abandon its nuclear program . familiar tactic ? what 's also riled the conservatives is the fact that schröder 's categorical statements on iran contain echoes of a similar tactic deployed by the chancellor during the last election campaign in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers in iraq schröder 's opposition to military action against iraq and his refusal to support the us-led iraq war was largely credited for his unexpected victory at the time .
schröder 's anti-war stance and his blatant electioneering when he accused the conservatives of toeing washington 's line led to a serious rift between berlin and washington , taking the transatlantic relationship to an all-time low . the conservatives fear that the chancellor 's exploitation of the iran issue to tap into germany 's deep-seated opposition to us military action in iraq ahead of the election could once again open up old wounds in the transatlantic relationship which have since been smoothed over .

" i expect the german chancellor to personally talk with president bush and not about him at poll campaign meetings , " said guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp on monday . undermining international solidarity ? the opposition also believes that the chancellor 's warnings against using military force in iran also risks undermining international solidarity for electoral gain .

but it also led to the worst-ever souring of the transatlantic relationship .
it was only with great effort that berlin 's ties to washington could be improved and normalized again . it remains questionable whether the german refusal to send troops to iraq could in the mid- and long-term bring any advantages for berlin in iraq or in the mideast . germany is participating in the training of iraqi police as well as some measures for the iraqi military but as long as the germans are n't present themselves in iraq , decisions will be taken and the future course set without any consideration for the germans . that 's especially apparent on the economic level where german companies can sniff billion-strong contracts but ca n't realize them due to the overall security situation and the overwhelming american competition . not much headway o n ira n ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irani president mahmoud ahmadinejad on the other hand germany has particularly good economic relations with neighboring country iran , but this is threatened by the failure so far of the europeans in nuclear negotiations with tehran . fischer , together with his counterparts from paris and london , initiated talks to dissuade tehran from its plans of uranium enrichment and from taking an important step towards developing nuclear weapons .
the europeans were also concerned about demonstrating to washington that one could achieve more with diplomacy rather than saber-rattling . however the europeans have emerged empty-handed and upsetting iran could instead lead to a further strain in relations even in other fields , particularly since the election of an arch-conservative government in tehran under the new president , mahmoud ahmadinejad . eco n omic issues top priority relations with the oil-rich nations of the gulf , particularly lucrative economic issues , became top priority for the spd-green coalition .
chancellor schröder even visited the gulf states and saudi arabia twice within a short period . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder in abu dhabi in 2003 and as is often the case with such visits , a lot was said about possible projects but very few were realized .
one example was the rumor that the united arab emirates could be interested in building the high-tech transrapid train . but after the chancellor returned home , the project soon faded into memory . peter philipp -lrb- sp -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new face of germany abroad ?

but china still has n't forgiven or forgotten . sixty years after emperor hirohito spoke in public for the first time to announce japan 's surrender , his son emperor akihito and prime minister junichiro koizumi both called for a future japan that would live in peace . " in the past , japan , through its colonial rule and aggression , caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries , particularly to those of asian nations , " koizumi told some 7,000 war bereaved and officials at a tokyo ceremony .
" japan squarely faces these facts of history in a spirit of humility .
i express here once again my feelings of deep remorse and heartfelt apology , and my feelings of profound mourning for all victims , both at home and abroad , of that war , " he said . but tens of thousands of people also paid their respects at the revered but controversial yasukuni shrine , where top war criminals are honored among the war dead and which many other asians see as a symbol of japan 's militarism . failing to face up to the past many in china and south korea feel japan has not faced up to its past .
" actions speak louder than words ...
his words appeared faint and his sincerity is also in doubt , " said an editorial in the china daily , referring to koizumi 's past apologies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dynamite blast showers debris high into the air as the u.s. marines demolition crew eliminates japanese resistance in a cave on okinawa on the ryukyu islands on may 21 , 1945 during world war ii .
but some japanese also think the time to apologize is over and believe tokyo should not cave in to chinese criticism . the public is divided in its views of yasukuni as well as on how to assess the war .
43 percent of respondents to a weekend survey by mainichi newspaper said japan 's war against china and the united states was wrong , while 29 percent said it was unavoidable . fighting fascism in its resistance to japan , china became one of the four leading powers fighting fascism .
although its role in world war ii is often underestimated in the west , the war in the pacific broke out first and lasted the longest in china , according to several historians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese infantrymen dash through a smoke-filled street of yichang , in eastern china , july 22 , 1941 , during the japanese occupation of the chinese city and port .
for the chinese , world war ii started on july 7 , 1937 , when japanese troops seized control of the marco polo bridge near beijing after a heavy exchange of fire with the chinese .
this battle , in which chinese soldiers for the first time resisted with military force the japanese who had been long advancing through china , marks the beginning of world war ii to the chinese .
they see world war ii in the pacific - which the west defines as having been fought between japan and the united states - as a logical extension of the war between japan and china .
in the west , too , historians occasionally cite the war as having started and ended in china , after eight - instead of six - years .
but their opponents contend that this view risks minimizing germany 's guilt for having unleashed world war ii .
china 's pay-off china , as mao zedong once said , was one of the largest countries among the anti-fascist alliance fighting the war through to its very end .
its involvement significantly strengthened china 's position within the international community as indicated by its status as a founding member of the united nations and a member of the un security council with veto powers .

the head of china 's world war ii research institute , hu dekun , reiterated this view on one of the biggest chinese internet portals , " sohu , " in july 2004 .

but china still has n't forgiven or forgotten . sixty years after emperor hirohito spoke in public for the first time to announce japan 's surrender , his son emperor akihito and prime minister junichiro koizumi both called for a future japan that would live in peace . " in the past , japan , through its colonial rule and aggression , caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries , particularly to those of asian nations , " koizumi told some 7,000 war bereaved and officials at a tokyo ceremony .

but china still has n't forgiven or forgotten . sixty years after emperor hirohito spoke in public for the first time to announce japan 's surrender , his son emperor akihito and prime minister junichiro koizumi both called for a future japan that would live in peace . " in the past , japan , through its colonial rule and aggression , caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries , particularly to those of asian nations , " koizumi told some 7,000 war bereaved and officials at a tokyo ceremony .
" japan squarely faces these facts of history in a spirit of humility .
i express here once again my feelings of deep remorse and heartfelt apology , and my feelings of profound mourning for all victims , both at home and abroad , of that war , " he said . but tens of thousands of people also paid their respects at the revered but controversial yasukuni shrine , where top war criminals are honored among the war dead and which many other asians see as a symbol of japan 's militarism . failing to face up to the past many in china and south korea feel japan has not faced up to its past .
" actions speak louder than words ...
his words appeared faint and his sincerity is also in doubt , " said an editorial in the china daily , referring to koizumi 's past apologies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dynamite blast showers debris high into the air as the u.s. marines demolition crew eliminates japanese resistance in a cave on okinawa on the ryukyu islands on may 21 , 1945 during world war ii .
but some japanese also think the time to apologize is over and believe tokyo should not cave in to chinese criticism . the public is divided in its views of yasukuni as well as on how to assess the war .
43 percent of respondents to a weekend survey by mainichi newspaper said japan 's war against china and the united states was wrong , while 29 percent said it was unavoidable . fighting fascism in its resistance to japan , china became one of the four leading powers fighting fascism .
although its role in world war ii is often underestimated in the west , the war in the pacific broke out first and lasted the longest in china , according to several historians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese infantrymen dash through a smoke-filled street of yichang , in eastern china , july 22 , 1941 , during the japanese occupation of the chinese city and port .
for the chinese , world war ii started on july 7 , 1937 , when japanese troops seized control of the marco polo bridge near beijing after a heavy exchange of fire with the chinese .
this battle , in which chinese soldiers for the first time resisted with military force the japanese who had been long advancing through china , marks the beginning of world war ii to the chinese .
they see world war ii in the pacific - which the west defines as having been fought between japan and the united states - as a logical extension of the war between japan and china .
in the west , too , historians occasionally cite the war as having started and ended in china , after eight - instead of six - years .
but their opponents contend that this view risks minimizing germany 's guilt for having unleashed world war ii .
china 's pay-off china , as mao zedong once said , was one of the largest countries among the anti-fascist alliance fighting the war through to its very end .
its involvement significantly strengthened china 's position within the international community as indicated by its status as a founding member of the united nations and a member of the un security council with veto powers .

for some time , chinese experts have complained that western history books underestimate or even fail to mention the important role that china played in world war ii .
the head of china 's world war ii research institute , hu dekun , reiterated this view on one of the biggest chinese internet portals , " sohu , " in july 2004 .

teams fight to keep pace with bayern sports -pipe- 15.08.2005 bayern top as flying dutchman takes off 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay conducted a master class in finishing on saturday dutch striker roy makaay took his goals total to five in two games on saturday as bayern munich put bayer leverkusen to the sword in a 5-2 rout .
the rest of the bundesliga should be quivering . bayern munich this week had to wire deportivo la coruna 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 622,000 -rrb- for breaking a clause in the contract of roy makaay , but the dutch international striker more than repaid that outlay , scoring a hat-trick as bayern crushed leverkusen 5-2 on saturday to march to the top of the table . leverkusen mauled german champions bayern 4-1 in the corresponding fixture last season but makaay ensured bayern had their revenge with a sensational treble at the bayarena . " this is the first time i have had a good pre-season at bayern and it is showing , " said makaay . dutchman sends out a warning with hat-trick makaay scored twice in the opening 3-0 win over borussia mönchengladbach and took his tally to five in two matches thanks to some generous bayer defending .
he twisted brazilian international roque junior inside out with a clever feint to score his first goal in the 11th minute and then scored twice in three minutes -lrb- 57 , 60 -rrb- to take the match ball . " the 5-2 result was a fair reflection , " declared bayern coach felix magath .
" roy makaay showed his class - he is in good shape after a great pre-season . " after former bayer star michael ballack opened the scoring , powering home a perfectly-placed shot into the corner of the net in the third minute , it was over to the flying dutchman to take center stage .
makaay even had time to set up iranian international midfielder ali karimi for his first bundesliga goal after 35 minutes . karimi gets his first bundesliga goal an intelligent header from the netherlands star left karimi , dubbed ' the asian maradona ' , with the simple task of volleying into an empty net to score on his full debut for the club just three minutes after bayer briefly looked to be getting into the match with dimitar berbatov scoring a penalty .
bayer 's marko babic got a late consolation eight minutes from time . schalke 04 are considered bayern 's main challengers for the 2006 bundesliga title and they kept within striking distance with a 2-1 win over derby rivals borussia dortmund . kuranyi at the double as schalke sink bvb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a capacity 81,264 crowd at the westfalen stadium produced an atmosphere befitting the occasion but the majority went home disappointed as german international kevin kuranyi scored twice to cancel out ebi smolarek 's controversial opener . " you can see that he -lrb- kuranyi -rrb- has been getting better with every week , " lauded schalke manager ralf rangnick . schalke were indebted to brazilian-born kuranyi after going behind on 17 minutes when smolarek put dortmund in front although the goal was controversial to say the least . cupping his arms like a volleyball player smolarek controlled a cross with his forearm but , with everyone expecting a foul to be awarded , referee herbert fandel waved play on and he scrambled the ball in . schalke were livid but responded the best possible way with kuranyi equalizing five minutes later with his first goal for the club .
the second was not long in coming and kuranyi 's 58th minute effort downed dortmund . the 2002 german champions have failed to beat their old foes at home since november 1998 and the long wait goes on . click here for more match reports 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ruhr pressure cooker ready to boil over the bundesliga 's second match day offers fans two classic encounters .

" let 's leave military options aside , we have already seen that they do n't amount to anything , " schröder said during an electoral meeting in the northern city of hanover .
" i consider the military option to be extremely dangerous .
so i can definitely rule out that a government under my leadership would take part , " schröder added in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper on sunday . heightened circumstances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and conservative challenger merkel the statements may probably have passed by without a murmur in normal circumstances .
but given that germany is in the grip of an election campaign - with early federal polls likely to take place next month - the utterance has raised the hackles of the conservative opposition . they accuse the chancellor of milking the issue to gain votes at a time when his ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens is heading for near certain defeat . " schröder is acting completely irresponsibly for electoral purposes .
he 's acting as though the problem were in washington , rather than tehran even through he knows that is n't so , " wolfgang schäuble , senior foreign policy expert of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the daily die welt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iranian security official , dressed in protective clothing , walks inside the uranium conversion facility , just outside the city of isfahan .
though tehran has insisted that its nuclear program is meant for civilian purposes , suspicions linger , especially in washington , that the country is seeking a nuclear bomb .
over the weekend , us president bush said military force remained a last resort to press tehran to abandon its nuclear program . familiar tactic ? what 's also riled the conservatives is the fact that schröder 's categorical statements on iran contain echoes of a similar tactic deployed by the chancellor during the last election campaign in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers in iraq schröder 's opposition to military action against iraq and his refusal to support the us-led iraq war was largely credited for his unexpected victory at the time .
schröder 's anti-war stance and his blatant electioneering when he accused the conservatives of toeing washington 's line led to a serious rift between berlin and washington , taking the transatlantic relationship to an all-time low . the conservatives fear that the chancellor 's exploitation of the iran issue to tap into germany 's deep-seated opposition to us military action in iraq ahead of the election could once again open up old wounds in the transatlantic relationship which have since been smoothed over . " schröder has to stop turning the serious conflict with iran into an election issue , " friedbert pflüger , foreign policy expert of the cdu told daily berliner zeitung on monday .
" the -lrb- chancellor 's -rrb- statement is a blatant effort to instrumentalize the nuclear row in iran for domestic purposes , " said wolfgang bosbach , deputy cdu parliamentary leader . the view is shared by the opposition liberal free democrats , a likely junior partner in a future coalition with the cdu .
" i expect the german chancellor to personally talk with president bush and not about him at poll campaign meetings , " said guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp on monday . undermining international solidarity ? the opposition also believes that the chancellor 's warnings against using military force in iran also risks undermining international solidarity for electoral gain . " the chancellor is creating the fatal impression in tehran that the world community is not united anymore , " schäuble said .
" in doing so , he is accepting the consequence that the danger of an iranian bomb will grow , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder with müntefering schröder 's camp however has rejected the conservatives ' allegations . " the chancellor did n't direct the statements at any one , rather he has generally made it clear that we want to be a peace-loving power , " said franz müntefering , spd chairman in a radio interview monday . he added that the accusation that schröder was using the iran conflict for election purposes was a twisted interpretation . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder against military option in iran german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday pushed aside the option of using force to contain iran and its uranium enrichment activities , saying that military options were worthless .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.08.2005 opposition blasts schröder on iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives say schröder is using a tested electoral tactic germany 's conservatives have criticized schröder 's warnings against using military force against iran , saying the chancellor 's exploiting the issue for electoral gain - much like the iraq war during the last campaign . german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday vehemently rejected the use of military coercion to contain iran and its alleged uranium enrichment activities . " let 's leave military options aside , we have already seen that they do n't amount to anything , " schröder said during an electoral meeting in the northern city of hanover .
" i consider the military option to be extremely dangerous .
so i can definitely rule out that a government under my leadership would take part , " schröder added in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper on sunday . heightened circumstances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and conservative challenger merkel the statements may probably have passed by without a murmur in normal circumstances .
but given that germany is in the grip of an election campaign - with early federal polls likely to take place next month - the utterance has raised the hackles of the conservative opposition . they accuse the chancellor of milking the issue to gain votes at a time when his ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens is heading for near certain defeat . " schröder is acting completely irresponsibly for electoral purposes .
he 's acting as though the problem were in washington , rather than tehran even through he knows that is n't so , " wolfgang schäuble , senior foreign policy expert of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the daily die welt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iranian security official , dressed in protective clothing , walks inside the uranium conversion facility , just outside the city of isfahan .
though tehran has insisted that its nuclear program is meant for civilian purposes , suspicions linger , especially in washington , that the country is seeking a nuclear bomb .
over the weekend , us president bush said military force remained a last resort to press tehran to abandon its nuclear program . familiar tactic ? what 's also riled the conservatives is the fact that schröder 's categorical statements on iran contain echoes of a similar tactic deployed by the chancellor during the last election campaign in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers in iraq schröder 's opposition to military action against iraq and his refusal to support the us-led iraq war was largely credited for his unexpected victory at the time .
schröder 's anti-war stance and his blatant electioneering when he accused the conservatives of toeing washington 's line led to a serious rift between berlin and washington , taking the transatlantic relationship to an all-time low . the conservatives fear that the chancellor 's exploitation of the iran issue to tap into germany 's deep-seated opposition to us military action in iraq ahead of the election could once again open up old wounds in the transatlantic relationship which have since been smoothed over . " schröder has to stop turning the serious conflict with iran into an election issue , " friedbert pflüger , foreign policy expert of the cdu told daily berliner zeitung on monday .
" the -lrb- chancellor 's -rrb- statement is a blatant effort to instrumentalize the nuclear row in iran for domestic purposes , " said wolfgang bosbach , deputy cdu parliamentary leader . the view is shared by the opposition liberal free democrats , a likely junior partner in a future coalition with the cdu .
" i expect the german chancellor to personally talk with president bush and not about him at poll campaign meetings , " said guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp on monday . undermining international solidarity ? the opposition also believes that the chancellor 's warnings against using military force in iran also risks undermining international solidarity for electoral gain . " the chancellor is creating the fatal impression in tehran that the world community is not united anymore , " schäuble said .
" in doing so , he is accepting the consequence that the danger of an iranian bomb will grow , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder with müntefering schröder 's camp however has rejected the conservatives ' allegations . " the chancellor did n't direct the statements at any one , rather he has generally made it clear that we want to be a peace-loving power , " said franz müntefering , spd chairman in a radio interview monday . he added that the accusation that schröder was using the iran conflict for election purposes was a twisted interpretation . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder against military option in iran german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday pushed aside the option of using force to contain iran and its uranium enrichment activities , saying that military options were worthless .

" let 's leave military options aside , we have already seen that they do n't amount to anything , " schröder said during an electoral meeting in the northern city of hanover .
" i consider the military option to be extremely dangerous .
so i can definitely rule out that a government under my leadership would take part , " schröder added in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper on sunday . heightened circumstances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and conservative challenger merkel the statements may probably have passed by without a murmur in normal circumstances .
but given that germany is in the grip of an election campaign - with early federal polls likely to take place next month - the utterance has raised the hackles of the conservative opposition . they accuse the chancellor of milking the issue to gain votes at a time when his ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens is heading for near certain defeat . " schröder is acting completely irresponsibly for electoral purposes .
he 's acting as though the problem were in washington , rather than tehran even through he knows that is n't so , " wolfgang schäuble , senior foreign policy expert of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the daily die welt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iranian security official , dressed in protective clothing , walks inside the uranium conversion facility , just outside the city of isfahan .
though tehran has insisted that its nuclear program is meant for civilian purposes , suspicions linger , especially in washington , that the country is seeking a nuclear bomb .
over the weekend , us president bush said military force remained a last resort to press tehran to abandon its nuclear program . familiar tactic ? what 's also riled the conservatives is the fact that schröder 's categorical statements on iran contain echoes of a similar tactic deployed by the chancellor during the last election campaign in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers in iraq schröder 's opposition to military action against iraq and his refusal to support the us-led iraq war was largely credited for his unexpected victory at the time .
schröder 's anti-war stance and his blatant electioneering when he accused the conservatives of toeing washington 's line led to a serious rift between berlin and washington , taking the transatlantic relationship to an all-time low . the conservatives fear that the chancellor 's exploitation of the iran issue to tap into germany 's deep-seated opposition to us military action in iraq ahead of the election could once again open up old wounds in the transatlantic relationship which have since been smoothed over . " schröder has to stop turning the serious conflict with iran into an election issue , " friedbert pflüger , foreign policy expert of the cdu told daily berliner zeitung on monday .
" the -lrb- chancellor 's -rrb- statement is a blatant effort to instrumentalize the nuclear row in iran for domestic purposes , " said wolfgang bosbach , deputy cdu parliamentary leader . the view is shared by the opposition liberal free democrats , a likely junior partner in a future coalition with the cdu .
" i expect the german chancellor to personally talk with president bush and not about him at poll campaign meetings , " said guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp on monday . undermining international solidarity ? the opposition also believes that the chancellor 's warnings against using military force in iran also risks undermining international solidarity for electoral gain . " the chancellor is creating the fatal impression in tehran that the world community is not united anymore , " schäuble said .
" in doing so , he is accepting the consequence that the danger of an iranian bomb will grow , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder with müntefering schröder 's camp however has rejected the conservatives ' allegations . " the chancellor did n't direct the statements at any one , rather he has generally made it clear that we want to be a peace-loving power , " said franz müntefering , spd chairman in a radio interview monday . he added that the accusation that schröder was using the iran conflict for election purposes was a twisted interpretation . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder against military option in iran german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday pushed aside the option of using force to contain iran and its uranium enrichment activities , saying that military options were worthless .

the mideast , iran , iraq , saudi arabia - germany 's ties with these nations may be influenced by current conflicts .
but the pursuit of peace and stability there has been a central plank of schröder 's foreign policy . since taking office in 1998 , german foreign minister joschka fischer has visited the middle east - and particularly israel and the autonomous palestinian areas - more often than any other european or western politician . the success of his visits , however , did n't correspond to their frequency : it only made it clear that european countries , as opposed to the us , are - even with the best of intentions - helpless and powerless when it comes to the question of solving the mideast conflict . it 's a fact that applies more to germany than to any other european nation .
that 's because germany has been able to adopt a less " neutral " role than other countries in the region because of its history and crime against the jews - at least unto the point when the conflict was inexorable , as was the case before the oslo treaty in 1993 : the palestinians demanded the scrapping of the jewish state and israel refused to recognize the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- and the right of the palestinians to their own state - next to israel 's . during those years , germany was only active in the region within a european framework . germa n diplomacy post-oslo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then president bill clinton presides over ceremonies marking the signing of the 1993 peace accord between israel and the palestinians , with israeli prime minister yitzhak rabin -lrb- left -rrb- and plo chairman yasser arafat -lrb- right -rrb- on sept .
13 , 1993 oslo however changed all that fundamentally : both sides silently acknowledged each other and foreswore violence , creating ideal conditions for germany to serve both sides as a reliable friend and aide - particularly when the implementation of the oslo agreements seemed to increasingly run into hitches . chancellor schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens that found themselves in this delicate situation was however aware that german help could only be an addition to washington 's political engagement - and even that could be useless and ineffective as long as the two warring sides did n't themselves demonstrate goodwill and take the first steps towards reconciliation . thus the main goal of fischer 's visits to the region was to encourage both sides to take the initiative and to urge them to take larger strides . but the promising success of those efforts came to an abrupt halt in september 2000 when the " al aqsa intifada " broke out and relations between israel and the palestinians plumbed to depths not seen since the six-day war in 1967 . joschka fischer continued to try to mediate and negotiate - but other than friendly words he did n't really achieve much on both sides .
thus germany once again reverted to an international diplomatic line : in 2003 the eu , un , us and russia agreed on the so-called " road map " for the mideast and this plan has been the declared fundament for german peace efforts in the mideast conflict ever since . continue to read about germany 's stand on iraq , iran and the arab peninsula . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new face of germany abroad ?

but the pursuit of peace and stability there has been a central plank of schröder 's foreign policy . since taking office in 1998 , german foreign minister joschka fischer has visited the middle east - and particularly israel and the autonomous palestinian areas - more often than any other european or western politician . the success of his visits , however , did n't correspond to their frequency : it only made it clear that european countries , as opposed to the us , are - even with the best of intentions - helpless and powerless when it comes to the question of solving the mideast conflict . it 's a fact that applies more to germany than to any other european nation .
that 's because germany has been able to adopt a less " neutral " role than other countries in the region because of its history and crime against the jews - at least unto the point when the conflict was inexorable , as was the case before the oslo treaty in 1993 : the palestinians demanded the scrapping of the jewish state and israel refused to recognize the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- and the right of the palestinians to their own state - next to israel 's . during those years , germany was only active in the region within a european framework . germa n diplomacy post-oslo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then president bill clinton presides over ceremonies marking the signing of the 1993 peace accord between israel and the palestinians , with israeli prime minister yitzhak rabin -lrb- left -rrb- and plo chairman yasser arafat -lrb- right -rrb- on sept .
13 , 1993 oslo however changed all that fundamentally : both sides silently acknowledged each other and foreswore violence , creating ideal conditions for germany to serve both sides as a reliable friend and aide - particularly when the implementation of the oslo agreements seemed to increasingly run into hitches . chancellor schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens that found themselves in this delicate situation was however aware that german help could only be an addition to washington 's political engagement - and even that could be useless and ineffective as long as the two warring sides did n't themselves demonstrate goodwill and take the first steps towards reconciliation . thus the main goal of fischer 's visits to the region was to encourage both sides to take the initiative and to urge them to take larger strides . but the promising success of those efforts came to an abrupt halt in september 2000 when the " al aqsa intifada " broke out and relations between israel and the palestinians plumbed to depths not seen since the six-day war in 1967 . joschka fischer continued to try to mediate and negotiate - but other than friendly words he did n't really achieve much on both sides .
thus germany once again reverted to an international diplomatic line : in 2003 the eu , un , us and russia agreed on the so-called " road map " for the mideast and this plan has been the declared fundament for german peace efforts in the mideast conflict ever since . continue to read about germany 's stand on iraq , iran and the arab peninsula . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new face of germany abroad ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.08.2005 berlin schools on a learning curve großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " zuckertüte " was first introduced in 1817 as a new school year fraught with controversial reforms gets underway in berlin , monday saw a record 41,000 children start school for the first time - but not before they 'd taken part in a time-honored ritual . " i want to go home , " wailed one pint-sized school starter , as hundreds of misty-eyed mothers , beaming grandmas , and fathers armed with video cameras jostled into the school assembly hall .
the occasion was what 's known across germany as " einschulung " - a symbolic ceremony marking the start of formal education . clutching a garishly-decorated giant cone filled with candy and gifts - the " zuckertüte , " designed to cushion the blow of starting school - the boy was hurried into place at the front of the hall next to rows of other infants looking dazed and confused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as tradition dictates , they all carried empty but spanking new school satchels and sported fluorescent caps sponsored by the road safety association .
thus attired , they settled down for a welcome show put together by the older grades - their eyes widening in a combination of fear and fascination as a gaggle of eight-year-olds with accordions filled the stage to perform a song about the alphabet .
once the entertainment was over , they were invited up one by one to shake hands personally with the school principal before being whisked off to classrooms for a short chat with their new teacher . a year to remember it was the second saturday in august , and similar scenes were taking place all over the capital . if it seemed a little more hectic than usual , it was probably due to a slate of radical reforms ushered in by the city ’ s social democrat education senator klaus böger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thanks to his changes , this is set to be a memorable year for berlin 's 350,000 berlin pupils and 32,000 teachers .
in a staunch rejection of what former president roman herzog once described as the city government ’ s ideological " touchy-feely " educational policy , the capital 's children are now the first in the country to go to school 6 months earlier than they used to , reducing the average age of school starters from 6.7 to 6.2 and resulting in 13,000 more school registrations for 2005 than ever before . " my son did n't get a place in the same school as his brother , because so many children were vying for places this year , " complained one mother . 200 new teachers had to be hired to handle the increased numbers of new pupils in elementary schools , one third of whom are now under 6 , while another 250 were drafted in from high schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pre-school class has been thrown out , and the average 10 percent of children who fail to keep up will no longer be allowed to repeat the grade .
moreover , over the next few years , the first and second grades are to be gradually merged .
while this theoretically allows individual children to develop at their own speed - and possibly prove such quick learners they can skip a year - critics of the reforms have voiced concern that teachers will be inhibited by the difficulties of reconciling the needs of such a broad age range . but the opportunity to fast-track through the first two years of school has a number of long-term advantages .
" pupils who do this , especially those who start school at the age of 5 , will be considerably younger when they leave high-school , " explained inge hirschmann from the berlin elementary schools association .
" that means they can join the job market earlier , start vocational training earlier or begin studying earlier - and that makes germany more competitive with other european countries . " demographic difficulties rainer lehmann is an education expert at berlin 's humboldt university and a member of the pisa consortium -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- , which rates student performance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he admits the reforms might be happening at a somewhat alarming rate , but he believes they were long overdue .
berlin is currently witnessing an unmistakable flurry of middle-class interest in private schooling , and lehmann was quick to stress what he described as " a growing awareness that state schools in berlin are failing to serve as sufficiently stimulating learning environments . " " bettering conditions in elementary schools is the most promising way to effect improvement to the pisa ratings of high schools , " he said , " one of the main reasons for bringing forward the age children begin school is to encourage improved long-term performance . " hirschmann agrees .

the mideast , iran , iraq , saudi arabia - germany 's ties with these nations may be influenced by current conflicts .
but the pursuit of peace and stability there has been a central plank of schröder 's foreign policy . since taking office in 1998 , german foreign minister joschka fischer has visited the middle east - and particularly israel and the autonomous palestinian areas - more often than any other european or western politician . the success of his visits , however , did n't correspond to their frequency : it only made it clear that european countries , as opposed to the us , are - even with the best of intentions - helpless and powerless when it comes to the question of solving the mideast conflict . it 's a fact that applies more to germany than to any other european nation .
that 's because germany has been able to adopt a less " neutral " role than other countries in the region because of its history and crime against the jews - at least unto the point when the conflict was inexorable , as was the case before the oslo treaty in 1993 : the palestinians demanded the scrapping of the jewish state and israel refused to recognize the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- and the right of the palestinians to their own state - next to israel 's . during those years , germany was only active in the region within a european framework . germa n diplomacy post-oslo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then president bill clinton presides over ceremonies marking the signing of the 1993 peace accord between israel and the palestinians , with israeli prime minister yitzhak rabin -lrb- left -rrb- and plo chairman yasser arafat -lrb- right -rrb- on sept .
13 , 1993 oslo however changed all that fundamentally : both sides silently acknowledged each other and foreswore violence , creating ideal conditions for germany to serve both sides as a reliable friend and aide - particularly when the implementation of the oslo agreements seemed to increasingly run into hitches . chancellor schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens that found themselves in this delicate situation was however aware that german help could only be an addition to washington 's political engagement - and even that could be useless and ineffective as long as the two warring sides did n't themselves demonstrate goodwill and take the first steps towards reconciliation . thus the main goal of fischer 's visits to the region was to encourage both sides to take the initiative and to urge them to take larger strides . but the promising success of those efforts came to an abrupt halt in september 2000 when the " al aqsa intifada " broke out and relations between israel and the palestinians plumbed to depths not seen since the six-day war in 1967 . joschka fischer continued to try to mediate and negotiate - but other than friendly words he did n't really achieve much on both sides .
thus germany once again reverted to an international diplomatic line : in 2003 the eu , un , us and russia agreed on the so-called " road map " for the mideast and this plan has been the declared fundament for german peace efforts in the mideast conflict ever since . continue to read about germany 's stand on iraq , iran and the arab peninsula . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new face of germany abroad ?

the mideast , iran , iraq , saudi arabia - germany 's ties with these nations may be influenced by current conflicts .
but the pursuit of peace and stability there has been a central plank of schröder 's foreign policy . since taking office in 1998 , german foreign minister joschka fischer has visited the middle east - and particularly israel and the autonomous palestinian areas - more often than any other european or western politician . the success of his visits , however , did n't correspond to their frequency : it only made it clear that european countries , as opposed to the us , are - even with the best of intentions - helpless and powerless when it comes to the question of solving the mideast conflict . it 's a fact that applies more to germany than to any other european nation .
that 's because germany has been able to adopt a less " neutral " role than other countries in the region because of its history and crime against the jews - at least unto the point when the conflict was inexorable , as was the case before the oslo treaty in 1993 : the palestinians demanded the scrapping of the jewish state and israel refused to recognize the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- and the right of the palestinians to their own state - next to israel 's . during those years , germany was only active in the region within a european framework . germa n diplomacy post-oslo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then president bill clinton presides over ceremonies marking the signing of the 1993 peace accord between israel and the palestinians , with israeli prime minister yitzhak rabin -lrb- left -rrb- and plo chairman yasser arafat -lrb- right -rrb- on sept .
13 , 1993 oslo however changed all that fundamentally : both sides silently acknowledged each other and foreswore violence , creating ideal conditions for germany to serve both sides as a reliable friend and aide - particularly when the implementation of the oslo agreements seemed to increasingly run into hitches . chancellor schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens that found themselves in this delicate situation was however aware that german help could only be an addition to washington 's political engagement - and even that could be useless and ineffective as long as the two warring sides did n't themselves demonstrate goodwill and take the first steps towards reconciliation . thus the main goal of fischer 's visits to the region was to encourage both sides to take the initiative and to urge them to take larger strides . but the promising success of those efforts came to an abrupt halt in september 2000 when the " al aqsa intifada " broke out and relations between israel and the palestinians plumbed to depths not seen since the six-day war in 1967 . joschka fischer continued to try to mediate and negotiate - but other than friendly words he did n't really achieve much on both sides .
thus germany once again reverted to an international diplomatic line : in 2003 the eu , un , us and russia agreed on the so-called " road map " for the mideast and this plan has been the declared fundament for german peace efforts in the mideast conflict ever since . continue to read about germany 's stand on iraq , iran and the arab peninsula . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new face of germany abroad ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.08.2005 berlin schools on a learning curve großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " zuckertüte " was first introduced in 1817 as a new school year fraught with controversial reforms gets underway in berlin , monday saw a record 41,000 children start school for the first time - but not before they 'd taken part in a time-honored ritual . " i want to go home , " wailed one pint-sized school starter , as hundreds of misty-eyed mothers , beaming grandmas , and fathers armed with video cameras jostled into the school assembly hall .
the occasion was what 's known across germany as " einschulung " - a symbolic ceremony marking the start of formal education . clutching a garishly-decorated giant cone filled with candy and gifts - the " zuckertüte , " designed to cushion the blow of starting school - the boy was hurried into place at the front of the hall next to rows of other infants looking dazed and confused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as tradition dictates , they all carried empty but spanking new school satchels and sported fluorescent caps sponsored by the road safety association .
thus attired , they settled down for a welcome show put together by the older grades - their eyes widening in a combination of fear and fascination as a gaggle of eight-year-olds with accordions filled the stage to perform a song about the alphabet .
once the entertainment was over , they were invited up one by one to shake hands personally with the school principal before being whisked off to classrooms for a short chat with their new teacher . a year to remember it was the second saturday in august , and similar scenes were taking place all over the capital . if it seemed a little more hectic than usual , it was probably due to a slate of radical reforms ushered in by the city ’ s social democrat education senator klaus böger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thanks to his changes , this is set to be a memorable year for berlin 's 350,000 berlin pupils and 32,000 teachers .
in a staunch rejection of what former president roman herzog once described as the city government ’ s ideological " touchy-feely " educational policy , the capital 's children are now the first in the country to go to school 6 months earlier than they used to , reducing the average age of school starters from 6.7 to 6.2 and resulting in 13,000 more school registrations for 2005 than ever before .

teams fight to keep pace with bayern sports -pipe- 15.08.2005 bayern top as flying dutchman takes off 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roy makaay conducted a master class in finishing on saturday dutch striker roy makaay took his goals total to five in two games on saturday as bayern munich put bayer leverkusen to the sword in a 5-2 rout .
the rest of the bundesliga should be quivering . bayern munich this week had to wire deportivo la coruna 500,000 euros -lrb- $ 622,000 -rrb- for breaking a clause in the contract of roy makaay , but the dutch international striker more than repaid that outlay , scoring a hat-trick as bayern crushed leverkusen 5-2 on saturday to march to the top of the table . leverkusen mauled german champions bayern 4-1 in the corresponding fixture last season but makaay ensured bayern had their revenge with a sensational treble at the bayarena . " this is the first time i have had a good pre-season at bayern and it is showing , " said makaay . dutchman sends out a warning with hat-trick makaay scored twice in the opening 3-0 win over borussia mönchengladbach and took his tally to five in two matches thanks to some generous bayer defending .
he twisted brazilian international roque junior inside out with a clever feint to score his first goal in the 11th minute and then scored twice in three minutes -lrb- 57 , 60 -rrb- to take the match ball . " the 5-2 result was a fair reflection , " declared bayern coach felix magath .
" roy makaay showed his class - he is in good shape after a great pre-season . " after former bayer star michael ballack opened the scoring , powering home a perfectly-placed shot into the corner of the net in the third minute , it was over to the flying dutchman to take center stage .
makaay even had time to set up iranian international midfielder ali karimi for his first bundesliga goal after 35 minutes . karimi gets his first bundesliga goal an intelligent header from the netherlands star left karimi , dubbed ' the asian maradona ' , with the simple task of volleying into an empty net to score on his full debut for the club just three minutes after bayer briefly looked to be getting into the match with dimitar berbatov scoring a penalty .
bayer 's marko babic got a late consolation eight minutes from time . schalke 04 are considered bayern 's main challengers for the 2006 bundesliga title and they kept within striking distance with a 2-1 win over derby rivals borussia dortmund . kuranyi at the double as schalke sink bvb bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a capacity 81,264 crowd at the westfalen stadium produced an atmosphere befitting the occasion but the majority went home disappointed as german international kevin kuranyi scored twice to cancel out ebi smolarek 's controversial opener . " you can see that he -lrb- kuranyi -rrb- has been getting better with every week , " lauded schalke manager ralf rangnick . schalke were indebted to brazilian-born kuranyi after going behind on 17 minutes when smolarek put dortmund in front although the goal was controversial to say the least . cupping his arms like a volleyball player smolarek controlled a cross with his forearm but , with everyone expecting a foul to be awarded , referee herbert fandel waved play on and he scrambled the ball in . schalke were livid but responded the best possible way with kuranyi equalizing five minutes later with his first goal for the club .
the second was not long in coming and kuranyi 's 58th minute effort downed dortmund . the 2002 german champions have failed to beat their old foes at home since november 1998 and the long wait goes on . click here for more match reports 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ruhr pressure cooker ready to boil over the bundesliga 's second match day offers fans two classic encounters .

revolution - in the hearts and minds !
germany needs freedom , optimism and confidence .
i think it was arnulf baring who spoke of " ddr light . "
the sickly , lacklustre atmosphere is unmistakable - and contagious .
angela merkel should speak less about " arbeitsplätze " -lrb- jobs -rrb- and more about the spiritual renewal germany so desperately needs .

most are staying in schools and people 's homes , but a mosque , a farm and ikea have all welcomed pilgrims . the world youth day 's requirements were none too stringent - only a toilet , a place to wash and enough space to spread out a ground mat - but putting up 375,000 young visitors from more than 120 different countries could be an managerial nightmare , even for an organization the size of the catholic church .
pilgrims staying in mosques a world youth day spokeswoman told the süddeutsche zeitung this week that organizers had reached a " comforting buffer " of places for the pilgrims to sleep , but the situation did n't look so rosy when the campaign got under way in july 2004 .
organizers lacked beds and there was only a thin stream of people volunteering to house the influx of pilgrims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world youth day organizers did demand more space than paraguayan youths had at the virgin day celebration in 2003 " it was relatively difficult to find places for people to stay at the beginning , " said stefan kirschbaum , who was responsible for finding accommodation for 160 pilgrims in solingen .
" but the closer we got to the actual event , the easier it became and in the end we have what we hoped for . "

most are staying in schools and people 's homes , but a mosque , a farm and ikea have all welcomed pilgrims . the world youth day 's requirements were none too stringent - only a toilet , a place to wash and enough space to spread out a ground mat - but putting up 375,000 young visitors from more than 120 different countries could be an managerial nightmare , even for an organization the size of the catholic church .
pilgrims staying in mosques a world youth day spokeswoman told the süddeutsche zeitung this week that organizers had reached a " comforting buffer " of places for the pilgrims to sleep , but the situation did n't look so rosy when the campaign got under way in july 2004 .
organizers lacked beds and there was only a thin stream of people volunteering to house the influx of pilgrims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world youth day organizers did demand more space than paraguayan youths had at the virgin day celebration in 2003 " it was relatively difficult to find places for people to stay at the beginning , " said stefan kirschbaum , who was responsible for finding accommodation for 160 pilgrims in solingen .
" but the closer we got to the actual event , the easier it became and in the end we have what we hoped for . "

but china still has n't forgiven or forgotten . sixty years after emperor hirohito spoke in public for the first time to announce japan 's surrender , his son emperor akihito and prime minister junichiro koizumi both called for a future japan that would live in peace . " in the past , japan , through its colonial rule and aggression , caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries , particularly to those of asian nations , " koizumi told some 7,000 war bereaved and officials at a tokyo ceremony .
" japan squarely faces these facts of history in a spirit of humility .
i express here once again my feelings of deep remorse and heartfelt apology , and my feelings of profound mourning for all victims , both at home and abroad , of that war , " he said . but tens of thousands of people also paid their respects at the revered but controversial yasukuni shrine , where top war criminals are honored among the war dead and which many other asians see as a symbol of japan 's militarism . failing to face up to the past many in china and south korea feel japan has not faced up to its past .

this battle , in which chinese soldiers for the first time resisted with military force the japanese who had been long advancing through china , marks the beginning of world war ii to the chinese .
they see world war ii in the pacific - which the west defines as having been fought between japan and the united states - as a logical extension of the war between japan and china .
in the west , too , historians occasionally cite the war as having started and ended in china , after eight - instead of six - years .
but their opponents contend that this view risks minimizing germany 's guilt for having unleashed world war ii .

most are staying in schools and people 's homes , but a mosque , a farm and ikea have all welcomed pilgrims . the world youth day 's requirements were none too stringent - only a toilet , a place to wash and enough space to spread out a ground mat - but putting up 375,000 young visitors from more than 120 different countries could be an managerial nightmare , even for an organization the size of the catholic church .
pilgrims staying in mosques a world youth day spokeswoman told the süddeutsche zeitung this week that organizers had reached a " comforting buffer " of places for the pilgrims to sleep , but the situation did n't look so rosy when the campaign got under way in july 2004 .
organizers lacked beds and there was only a thin stream of people volunteering to house the influx of pilgrims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world youth day organizers did demand more space than paraguayan youths had at the virgin day celebration in 2003 " it was relatively difficult to find places for people to stay at the beginning , " said stefan kirschbaum , who was responsible for finding accommodation for 160 pilgrims in solingen .
" but the closer we got to the actual event , the easier it became and in the end we have what we hoped for . "
though most of the visiting pilgrims are being housed in 1,034 schools and 604 gymnasiums with another 90,000 being welcomed into people 's homes wyd organizers also accepted offers of accommodation from a mosque , which was willing to house 59 male pilgrims and organize a barbecue for the group 's men and women , who are sleeping in a nearby gym .
ikea joins in housing visitors the swedish furniture giant ikea also offered its beds to the 350 youths from france , italy england and germany for the extent of the world youth day 's events .
the visitors , however , will have to assemble the beds themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikea craftsman hope all the parts were included though they wo n't have to struggle with ikea 's instructions and tiny allen wrenches , 55 pilgrims from lithuania may wish for a soft mattress when they take to the stable that normally protect farmer hagen 's cows from the elements .
but no one at ikea will be able to enjoy mrs. hagen 's homemade marmalade or a welcoming camp fire , mr. hagen told the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
most of the pilgrims will be arriving aug .
15 , and while they were informed that they would have to leave their hosts after the world youth day , how individual hosts choose to deal with people guests who would like to turn their pilgrimage into a vacation is up to them , kirschbaum said .

most are staying in schools and people 's homes , but a mosque , a farm and ikea have all welcomed pilgrims . the world youth day 's requirements were none too stringent - only a toilet , a place to wash and enough space to spread out a ground mat - but putting up 375,000 young visitors from more than 120 different countries could be an managerial nightmare , even for an organization the size of the catholic church .
pilgrims staying in mosques a world youth day spokeswoman told the süddeutsche zeitung this week that organizers had reached a " comforting buffer " of places for the pilgrims to sleep , but the situation did n't look so rosy when the campaign got under way in july 2004 .
organizers lacked beds and there was only a thin stream of people volunteering to house the influx of pilgrims .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : world youth day organizers did demand more space than paraguayan youths had at the virgin day celebration in 2003 " it was relatively difficult to find places for people to stay at the beginning , " said stefan kirschbaum , who was responsible for finding accommodation for 160 pilgrims in solingen .
" but the closer we got to the actual event , the easier it became and in the end we have what we hoped for . "
though most of the visiting pilgrims are being housed in 1,034 schools and 604 gymnasiums with another 90,000 being welcomed into people 's homes wyd organizers also accepted offers of accommodation from a mosque , which was willing to house 59 male pilgrims and organize a barbecue for the group 's men and women , who are sleeping in a nearby gym .
ikea joins in housing visitors the swedish furniture giant ikea also offered its beds to the 350 youths from france , italy england and germany for the extent of the world youth day 's events .
the visitors , however , will have to assemble the beds themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ikea craftsman hope all the parts were included though they wo n't have to struggle with ikea 's instructions and tiny allen wrenches , 55 pilgrims from lithuania may wish for a soft mattress when they take to the stable that normally protect farmer hagen 's cows from the elements .
but no one at ikea will be able to enjoy mrs. hagen 's homemade marmalade or a welcoming camp fire , mr. hagen told the german weekly newspaper die zeit .
most of the pilgrims will be arriving aug .
15 , and while they were informed that they would have to leave their hosts after the world youth day , how individual hosts choose to deal with people guests who would like to turn their pilgrimage into a vacation is up to them , kirschbaum said .

most are staying in schools and people 's homes , but a mosque , a farm and ikea have all welcomed pilgrims . the world youth day 's requirements were none too stringent - only a toilet , a place to wash and enough space to spread out a ground mat - but putting up 375,000 young visitors from more than 120 different countries could be an managerial nightmare , even for an organization the size of the catholic church .
pilgrims staying in mosques a world youth day spokeswoman told the süddeutsche zeitung this week that organizers had reached a " comforting buffer " of places for the pilgrims to sleep , but the situation did n't look so rosy when the campaign got under way in july 2004 .

" but the closer we got to the actual event , the easier it became and in the end we have what we hoped for . "
though most of the visiting pilgrims are being housed in 1,034 schools and 604 gymnasiums with another 90,000 being welcomed into people 's homes wyd organizers also accepted offers of accommodation from a mosque , which was willing to house 59 male pilgrims and organize a barbecue for the group 's men and women , who are sleeping in a nearby gym .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.08.2005 opposition blasts schröder on iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conservatives say schröder is using a tested electoral tactic germany 's conservatives have criticized schröder 's warnings against using military force against iran , saying the chancellor 's exploiting the issue for electoral gain - much like the iraq war during the last campaign . german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday vehemently rejected the use of military coercion to contain iran and its alleged uranium enrichment activities . " let 's leave military options aside , we have already seen that they do n't amount to anything , " schröder said during an electoral meeting in the northern city of hanover .
" i consider the military option to be extremely dangerous .
so i can definitely rule out that a government under my leadership would take part , " schröder added in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper on sunday . heightened circumstances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and conservative challenger merkel the statements may probably have passed by without a murmur in normal circumstances .
but given that germany is in the grip of an election campaign - with early federal polls likely to take place next month - the utterance has raised the hackles of the conservative opposition . they accuse the chancellor of milking the issue to gain votes at a time when his ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens is heading for near certain defeat . " schröder is acting completely irresponsibly for electoral purposes .
he 's acting as though the problem were in washington , rather than tehran even through he knows that is n't so , " wolfgang schäuble , senior foreign policy expert of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the daily die welt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iranian security official , dressed in protective clothing , walks inside the uranium conversion facility , just outside the city of isfahan .
though tehran has insisted that its nuclear program is meant for civilian purposes , suspicions linger , especially in washington , that the country is seeking a nuclear bomb .
over the weekend , us president bush said military force remained a last resort to press tehran to abandon its nuclear program . familiar tactic ? what 's also riled the conservatives is the fact that schröder 's categorical statements on iran contain echoes of a similar tactic deployed by the chancellor during the last election campaign in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers in iraq schröder 's opposition to military action against iraq and his refusal to support the us-led iraq war was largely credited for his unexpected victory at the time .
schröder 's anti-war stance and his blatant electioneering when he accused the conservatives of toeing washington 's line led to a serious rift between berlin and washington , taking the transatlantic relationship to an all-time low . the conservatives fear that the chancellor 's exploitation of the iran issue to tap into germany 's deep-seated opposition to us military action in iraq ahead of the election could once again open up old wounds in the transatlantic relationship which have since been smoothed over . " schröder has to stop turning the serious conflict with iran into an election issue , " friedbert pflüger , foreign policy expert of the cdu told daily berliner zeitung on monday .
" the -lrb- chancellor 's -rrb- statement is a blatant effort to instrumentalize the nuclear row in iran for domestic purposes , " said wolfgang bosbach , deputy cdu parliamentary leader . the view is shared by the opposition liberal free democrats , a likely junior partner in a future coalition with the cdu .
" i expect the german chancellor to personally talk with president bush and not about him at poll campaign meetings , " said guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp on monday . undermining international solidarity ? the opposition also believes that the chancellor 's warnings against using military force in iran also risks undermining international solidarity for electoral gain . " the chancellor is creating the fatal impression in tehran that the world community is not united anymore , " schäuble said .
" in doing so , he is accepting the consequence that the danger of an iranian bomb will grow , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder with müntefering schröder 's camp however has rejected the conservatives ' allegations . " the chancellor did n't direct the statements at any one , rather he has generally made it clear that we want to be a peace-loving power , " said franz müntefering , spd chairman in a radio interview monday . he added that the accusation that schröder was using the iran conflict for election purposes was a twisted interpretation . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder against military option in iran german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday pushed aside the option of using force to contain iran and its uranium enrichment activities , saying that military options were worthless .

" the -lrb- chancellor 's -rrb- statement is a blatant effort to instrumentalize the nuclear row in iran for domestic purposes , " said wolfgang bosbach , deputy cdu parliamentary leader . the view is shared by the opposition liberal free democrats , a likely junior partner in a future coalition with the cdu .
" i expect the german chancellor to personally talk with president bush and not about him at poll campaign meetings , " said guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp on monday . undermining international solidarity ? the opposition also believes that the chancellor 's warnings against using military force in iran also risks undermining international solidarity for electoral gain . " the chancellor is creating the fatal impression in tehran that the world community is not united anymore , " schäuble said .
" in doing so , he is accepting the consequence that the danger of an iranian bomb will grow , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder with müntefering schröder 's camp however has rejected the conservatives ' allegations . " the chancellor did n't direct the statements at any one , rather he has generally made it clear that we want to be a peace-loving power , " said franz müntefering , spd chairman in a radio interview monday . he added that the accusation that schröder was using the iran conflict for election purposes was a twisted interpretation . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder against military option in iran german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday pushed aside the option of using force to contain iran and its uranium enrichment activities , saying that military options were worthless .

the mideast , iran , iraq , saudi arabia - germany 's ties with these nations may be influenced by current conflicts .
but the pursuit of peace and stability there has been a central plank of schröder 's foreign policy . since taking office in 1998 , german foreign minister joschka fischer has visited the middle east - and particularly israel and the autonomous palestinian areas - more often than any other european or western politician . the success of his visits , however , did n't correspond to their frequency : it only made it clear that european countries , as opposed to the us , are - even with the best of intentions - helpless and powerless when it comes to the question of solving the mideast conflict . it 's a fact that applies more to germany than to any other european nation .
that 's because germany has been able to adopt a less " neutral " role than other countries in the region because of its history and crime against the jews - at least unto the point when the conflict was inexorable , as was the case before the oslo treaty in 1993 : the palestinians demanded the scrapping of the jewish state and israel refused to recognize the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- and the right of the palestinians to their own state - next to israel 's . during those years , germany was only active in the region within a european framework . germa n diplomacy post-oslo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then president bill clinton presides over ceremonies marking the signing of the 1993 peace accord between israel and the palestinians , with israeli prime minister yitzhak rabin -lrb- left -rrb- and plo chairman yasser arafat -lrb- right -rrb- on sept .
13 , 1993 oslo however changed all that fundamentally : both sides silently acknowledged each other and foreswore violence , creating ideal conditions for germany to serve both sides as a reliable friend and aide - particularly when the implementation of the oslo agreements seemed to increasingly run into hitches . chancellor schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens that found themselves in this delicate situation was however aware that german help could only be an addition to washington 's political engagement - and even that could be useless and ineffective as long as the two warring sides did n't themselves demonstrate goodwill and take the first steps towards reconciliation . thus the main goal of fischer 's visits to the region was to encourage both sides to take the initiative and to urge them to take larger strides . but the promising success of those efforts came to an abrupt halt in september 2000 when the " al aqsa intifada " broke out and relations between israel and the palestinians plumbed to depths not seen since the six-day war in 1967 . joschka fischer continued to try to mediate and negotiate - but other than friendly words he did n't really achieve much on both sides .
thus germany once again reverted to an international diplomatic line : in 2003 the eu , un , us and russia agreed on the so-called " road map " for the mideast and this plan has been the declared fundament for german peace efforts in the mideast conflict ever since . continue to read about germany 's stand on iraq , iran and the arab peninsula . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new face of germany abroad ?

" there are still large christian institutions in germany " -lrb- ... -rrb- but there is also a great fatigue and we are so concerned with structural questions that the zest and the joy of faith are missing , " he said .

i would not have dared to arrange that .
but when the dear lord makes it happen , one can be happy about it . " benedict added that he was also glad his first trip abroad was to attend a gathering of young christians . " i want to show them it 's beautiful to be a christian , " he said .
" many people think christianity is a bunch of rules , prohibitions and dogmas you have to follow and therefore it 's a heavy load .
the wisdom of faith is not concerned with knowing lots of details ... but knowing above and beyond the details what life is all about , how to live it and how to shape the future ... -lrb- faith -rrb- is not stale food we 've had for 2,000 years and warm up again and again . " no grou n d-breaki n g n ews asked whether he would also try and move on bringing catholics and protestants closer together during the event , benedict said that no one should expect ground-breaking decisions to be made in the coming days . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal walter kasper -lrb- center -rrb- , protestant bishop martin heim and greek-orthodox metropolit augustinos celebrate an ecumenical mass in 2003 " we wo n't have much time because the daily schedule is very full , " he said .

" roy makaay showed his class - he is in good shape after a great pre-season . " after former bayer star michael ballack opened the scoring , powering home a perfectly-placed shot into the corner of the net in the third minute , it was over to the flying dutchman to take center stage .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.08.2005 berlin schools on a learning curve großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " zuckertüte " was first introduced in 1817 as a new school year fraught with controversial reforms gets underway in berlin , monday saw a record 41,000 children start school for the first time - but not before they 'd taken part in a time-honored ritual . " i want to go home , " wailed one pint-sized school starter , as hundreds of misty-eyed mothers , beaming grandmas , and fathers armed with video cameras jostled into the school assembly hall .
the occasion was what 's known across germany as " einschulung " - a symbolic ceremony marking the start of formal education . clutching a garishly-decorated giant cone filled with candy and gifts - the " zuckertüte , " designed to cushion the blow of starting school - the boy was hurried into place at the front of the hall next to rows of other infants looking dazed and confused . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as tradition dictates , they all carried empty but spanking new school satchels and sported fluorescent caps sponsored by the road safety association .
thus attired , they settled down for a welcome show put together by the older grades - their eyes widening in a combination of fear and fascination as a gaggle of eight-year-olds with accordions filled the stage to perform a song about the alphabet .
once the entertainment was over , they were invited up one by one to shake hands personally with the school principal before being whisked off to classrooms for a short chat with their new teacher . a year to remember it was the second saturday in august , and similar scenes were taking place all over the capital . if it seemed a little more hectic than usual , it was probably due to a slate of radical reforms ushered in by the city ’ s social democrat education senator klaus böger . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thanks to his changes , this is set to be a memorable year for berlin 's 350,000 berlin pupils and 32,000 teachers .
in a staunch rejection of what former president roman herzog once described as the city government ’ s ideological " touchy-feely " educational policy , the capital 's children are now the first in the country to go to school 6 months earlier than they used to , reducing the average age of school starters from 6.7 to 6.2 and resulting in 13,000 more school registrations for 2005 than ever before . " my son did n't get a place in the same school as his brother , because so many children were vying for places this year , " complained one mother . 200 new teachers had to be hired to handle the increased numbers of new pupils in elementary schools , one third of whom are now under 6 , while another 250 were drafted in from high schools . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pre-school class has been thrown out , and the average 10 percent of children who fail to keep up will no longer be allowed to repeat the grade .
moreover , over the next few years , the first and second grades are to be gradually merged .
while this theoretically allows individual children to develop at their own speed - and possibly prove such quick learners they can skip a year - critics of the reforms have voiced concern that teachers will be inhibited by the difficulties of reconciling the needs of such a broad age range . but the opportunity to fast-track through the first two years of school has a number of long-term advantages .
" pupils who do this , especially those who start school at the age of 5 , will be considerably younger when they leave high-school , " explained inge hirschmann from the berlin elementary schools association .
" that means they can join the job market earlier , start vocational training earlier or begin studying earlier - and that makes germany more competitive with other european countries . " demographic difficulties rainer lehmann is an education expert at berlin 's humboldt university and a member of the pisa consortium -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- , which rates student performance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he admits the reforms might be happening at a somewhat alarming rate , but he believes they were long overdue .
berlin is currently witnessing an unmistakable flurry of middle-class interest in private schooling , and lehmann was quick to stress what he described as " a growing awareness that state schools in berlin are failing to serve as sufficiently stimulating learning environments . " " bettering conditions in elementary schools is the most promising way to effect improvement to the pisa ratings of high schools , " he said , " one of the main reasons for bringing forward the age children begin school is to encourage improved long-term performance . " hirschmann agrees .
" the innovations are about making better use of children 's thirst for knowledge and motivation at an age when it can be maximized , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even more importantly , " berlin has a very specific demographic situation , " he pointed out .

" let 's leave military options aside , we have already seen that they do n't amount to anything , " schröder said during an electoral meeting in the northern city of hanover .
" i consider the military option to be extremely dangerous .
so i can definitely rule out that a government under my leadership would take part , " schröder added in an interview with the bild am sonntag newspaper on sunday . heightened circumstances bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and conservative challenger merkel the statements may probably have passed by without a murmur in normal circumstances .
but given that germany is in the grip of an election campaign - with early federal polls likely to take place next month - the utterance has raised the hackles of the conservative opposition . they accuse the chancellor of milking the issue to gain votes at a time when his ruling coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens is heading for near certain defeat . " schröder is acting completely irresponsibly for electoral purposes .
he 's acting as though the problem were in washington , rather than tehran even through he knows that is n't so , " wolfgang schäuble , senior foreign policy expert of the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- told the daily die welt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an iranian security official , dressed in protective clothing , walks inside the uranium conversion facility , just outside the city of isfahan .
though tehran has insisted that its nuclear program is meant for civilian purposes , suspicions linger , especially in washington , that the country is seeking a nuclear bomb .
over the weekend , us president bush said military force remained a last resort to press tehran to abandon its nuclear program . familiar tactic ? what 's also riled the conservatives is the fact that schröder 's categorical statements on iran contain echoes of a similar tactic deployed by the chancellor during the last election campaign in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers in iraq schröder 's opposition to military action against iraq and his refusal to support the us-led iraq war was largely credited for his unexpected victory at the time .
schröder 's anti-war stance and his blatant electioneering when he accused the conservatives of toeing washington 's line led to a serious rift between berlin and washington , taking the transatlantic relationship to an all-time low . the conservatives fear that the chancellor 's exploitation of the iran issue to tap into germany 's deep-seated opposition to us military action in iraq ahead of the election could once again open up old wounds in the transatlantic relationship which have since been smoothed over . " schröder has to stop turning the serious conflict with iran into an election issue , " friedbert pflüger , foreign policy expert of the cdu told daily berliner zeitung on monday .
" the -lrb- chancellor 's -rrb- statement is a blatant effort to instrumentalize the nuclear row in iran for domestic purposes , " said wolfgang bosbach , deputy cdu parliamentary leader . the view is shared by the opposition liberal free democrats , a likely junior partner in a future coalition with the cdu .
" i expect the german chancellor to personally talk with president bush and not about him at poll campaign meetings , " said guido westerwelle , leader of the fdp on monday . undermining international solidarity ? the opposition also believes that the chancellor 's warnings against using military force in iran also risks undermining international solidarity for electoral gain . " the chancellor is creating the fatal impression in tehran that the world community is not united anymore , " schäuble said .
" in doing so , he is accepting the consequence that the danger of an iranian bomb will grow , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor schröder with müntefering schröder 's camp however has rejected the conservatives ' allegations . " the chancellor did n't direct the statements at any one , rather he has generally made it clear that we want to be a peace-loving power , " said franz müntefering , spd chairman in a radio interview monday . he added that the accusation that schröder was using the iran conflict for election purposes was a twisted interpretation . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder against military option in iran german chancellor gerhard schröder on saturday pushed aside the option of using force to contain iran and its uranium enrichment activities , saying that military options were worthless .

but china still has n't forgiven or forgotten . sixty years after emperor hirohito spoke in public for the first time to announce japan 's surrender , his son emperor akihito and prime minister junichiro koizumi both called for a future japan that would live in peace . " in the past , japan , through its colonial rule and aggression , caused tremendous damage and suffering to the people of many countries , particularly to those of asian nations , " koizumi told some 7,000 war bereaved and officials at a tokyo ceremony .
" japan squarely faces these facts of history in a spirit of humility .
i express here once again my feelings of deep remorse and heartfelt apology , and my feelings of profound mourning for all victims , both at home and abroad , of that war , " he said . but tens of thousands of people also paid their respects at the revered but controversial yasukuni shrine , where top war criminals are honored among the war dead and which many other asians see as a symbol of japan 's militarism . failing to face up to the past many in china and south korea feel japan has not faced up to its past .
" actions speak louder than words ...
his words appeared faint and his sincerity is also in doubt , " said an editorial in the china daily , referring to koizumi 's past apologies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dynamite blast showers debris high into the air as the u.s. marines demolition crew eliminates japanese resistance in a cave on okinawa on the ryukyu islands on may 21 , 1945 during world war ii .
but some japanese also think the time to apologize is over and believe tokyo should not cave in to chinese criticism . the public is divided in its views of yasukuni as well as on how to assess the war .
43 percent of respondents to a weekend survey by mainichi newspaper said japan 's war against china and the united states was wrong , while 29 percent said it was unavoidable . fighting fascism in its resistance to japan , china became one of the four leading powers fighting fascism .
although its role in world war ii is often underestimated in the west , the war in the pacific broke out first and lasted the longest in china , according to several historians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japanese infantrymen dash through a smoke-filled street of yichang , in eastern china , july 22 , 1941 , during the japanese occupation of the chinese city and port .
for the chinese , world war ii started on july 7 , 1937 , when japanese troops seized control of the marco polo bridge near beijing after a heavy exchange of fire with the chinese .
this battle , in which chinese soldiers for the first time resisted with military force the japanese who had been long advancing through china , marks the beginning of world war ii to the chinese .
they see world war ii in the pacific - which the west defines as having been fought between japan and the united states - as a logical extension of the war between japan and china .
in the west , too , historians occasionally cite the war as having started and ended in china , after eight - instead of six - years .
but their opponents contend that this view risks minimizing germany 's guilt for having unleashed world war ii .
china 's pay-off china , as mao zedong once said , was one of the largest countries among the anti-fascist alliance fighting the war through to its very end .
its involvement significantly strengthened china 's position within the international community as indicated by its status as a founding member of the united nations and a member of the un security council with veto powers .
had hitler 's germany not surrendered on may 8 , 1945 , the war in the pacific would have continued for months , according to a thesis posited in the west .
it allowed the us to concentrate its energies on fighting japan .
had berlin not fallen to the soviets , they might have been unable to declare war on the japanese in august .

1937 .
for some time , chinese experts have complained that western history books underestimate or even fail to mention the important role that china played in world war ii .
the head of china 's world war ii research institute , hu dekun , reiterated this view on one of the biggest chinese internet portals , " sohu , " in july 2004 .
professor hu reiterated that that the war broke out first and lasted the longest in china .
he said it was " unfair " that western historians did n't recognize china as one of the main battlefields of the war . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : japan can learn from germany german chancellor gerhard schröder waded into an asian row wednesday over japan 's approach to its world war ii atrocities , saying postwar berlin had won the respect of its neighbors in how it contended with its nazi past .

the mideast , iran , iraq , saudi arabia - germany 's ties with these nations may be influenced by current conflicts .
but the pursuit of peace and stability there has been a central plank of schröder 's foreign policy . since taking office in 1998 , german foreign minister joschka fischer has visited the middle east - and particularly israel and the autonomous palestinian areas - more often than any other european or western politician . the success of his visits , however , did n't correspond to their frequency : it only made it clear that european countries , as opposed to the us , are - even with the best of intentions - helpless and powerless when it comes to the question of solving the mideast conflict . it 's a fact that applies more to germany than to any other european nation .
that 's because germany has been able to adopt a less " neutral " role than other countries in the region because of its history and crime against the jews - at least unto the point when the conflict was inexorable , as was the case before the oslo treaty in 1993 : the palestinians demanded the scrapping of the jewish state and israel refused to recognize the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- and the right of the palestinians to their own state - next to israel 's . during those years , germany was only active in the region within a european framework . germa n diplomacy post-oslo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then president bill clinton presides over ceremonies marking the signing of the 1993 peace accord between israel and the palestinians , with israeli prime minister yitzhak rabin -lrb- left -rrb- and plo chairman yasser arafat -lrb- right -rrb- on sept .
13 , 1993 oslo however changed all that fundamentally : both sides silently acknowledged each other and foreswore violence , creating ideal conditions for germany to serve both sides as a reliable friend and aide - particularly when the implementation of the oslo agreements seemed to increasingly run into hitches . chancellor schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens that found themselves in this delicate situation was however aware that german help could only be an addition to washington 's political engagement - and even that could be useless and ineffective as long as the two warring sides did n't themselves demonstrate goodwill and take the first steps towards reconciliation . thus the main goal of fischer 's visits to the region was to encourage both sides to take the initiative and to urge them to take larger strides . but the promising success of those efforts came to an abrupt halt in september 2000 when the " al aqsa intifada " broke out and relations between israel and the palestinians plumbed to depths not seen since the six-day war in 1967 . joschka fischer continued to try to mediate and negotiate - but other than friendly words he did n't really achieve much on both sides .
thus germany once again reverted to an international diplomatic line : in 2003 the eu , un , us and russia agreed on the so-called " road map " for the mideast and this plan has been the declared fundament for german peace efforts in the mideast conflict ever since . continue to read about germany 's stand on iraq , iran and the arab peninsula . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new face of germany abroad ?

the mideast , iran , iraq , saudi arabia - germany 's ties with these nations may be influenced by current conflicts .
but the pursuit of peace and stability there has been a central plank of schröder 's foreign policy . since taking office in 1998 , german foreign minister joschka fischer has visited the middle east - and particularly israel and the autonomous palestinian areas - more often than any other european or western politician . the success of his visits , however , did n't correspond to their frequency : it only made it clear that european countries , as opposed to the us , are - even with the best of intentions - helpless and powerless when it comes to the question of solving the mideast conflict . it 's a fact that applies more to germany than to any other european nation .
that 's because germany has been able to adopt a less " neutral " role than other countries in the region because of its history and crime against the jews - at least unto the point when the conflict was inexorable , as was the case before the oslo treaty in 1993 : the palestinians demanded the scrapping of the jewish state and israel refused to recognize the palestinian liberation organization -lrb- plo -rrb- and the right of the palestinians to their own state - next to israel 's . during those years , germany was only active in the region within a european framework . germa n diplomacy post-oslo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : then president bill clinton presides over ceremonies marking the signing of the 1993 peace accord between israel and the palestinians , with israeli prime minister yitzhak rabin -lrb- left -rrb- and plo chairman yasser arafat -lrb- right -rrb- on sept .
13 , 1993 oslo however changed all that fundamentally : both sides silently acknowledged each other and foreswore violence , creating ideal conditions for germany to serve both sides as a reliable friend and aide - particularly when the implementation of the oslo agreements seemed to increasingly run into hitches . chancellor schröder 's coalition of social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the greens that found themselves in this delicate situation was however aware that german help could only be an addition to washington 's political engagement - and even that could be useless and ineffective as long as the two warring sides did n't themselves demonstrate goodwill and take the first steps towards reconciliation . thus the main goal of fischer 's visits to the region was to encourage both sides to take the initiative and to urge them to take larger strides . but the promising success of those efforts came to an abrupt halt in september 2000 when the " al aqsa intifada " broke out and relations between israel and the palestinians plumbed to depths not seen since the six-day war in 1967 . joschka fischer continued to try to mediate and negotiate - but other than friendly words he did n't really achieve much on both sides .
thus germany once again reverted to an international diplomatic line : in 2003 the eu , un , us and russia agreed on the so-called " road map " for the mideast and this plan has been the declared fundament for german peace efforts in the mideast conflict ever since . continue to read about germany 's stand on iraq , iran and the arab peninsula . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the new face of germany abroad ?

the online company rightmove said prices rose while the rest of the uk saw a decline of 0.2 % .
but the firm said the rise is probably a correction after a previous slump of more than 6 % in wales .
the study found almost 120,000 sellers in england and wales cut their asking price in the four weeks to 6 august .
the next biggest regional increase was in the north west of england , where prices rose by 0.7 % .
in london and the south east they fell by 1.6 % and 2.2 % respectively .
the company said the cut in asking price by many people was a reflection that it remains very much a buyers ' market .
the average property in england and wales now costs £ 196,282 , just 2.1 % more than 12 months ago .
average prices have fallen by more than £ 2,000 during the past two months .
miles shipside , commercial director of rightmove , said : " more estate agents are declining to market properties if the seller wants to try for too high a price .
" it 's a tough message to sellers , but if an estate agent has already got similar or cheaper properties that they are not selling , they are thinking ' why have more ? ' .
" there is too much unsold property still available to expect anything other than a continuation of static asking prices this year . "

a group of 12 volunteers will spend almost two weeks constructing the dwelling on land owned by the primrose earth awareness trust near brecon .
the trust , an environmental education charity , works to raise awareness of sustainable living practices .
the house will have a wooden frame and will be covered in the customary hand-mixed wattle and daub .
project manager carol levick said the wood would come from off-cuts of oak from a local sawmill and willow , cut on site , would then be woven around it .
" the volunteers will be mixing mud , straw , lime , and cow manure by trampling it together , and daubing the willow with the mixture by hand .

the trust also runs courses on sustainable gardening and food production for enthusiastic gardeners and smallholders .
the two weeks of work on the roundhouse - which begins on monday - will see the site transformed from just an empty field to a building ready for thatching .

" out of sight , out of mind , " the mayor hopes hussein mohamud jiir , mayor of the capital hargeisa , has set aside tracts of land where he hopes to install the khat merchants .
dealers , however , say there is no point trying to restrict their activities .
khat is a natural amphetamine derived from the leaves of the catha edulis plant .
the problem of addiction in somaliland - which has broken away from somalia - is huge .
addicts - mostly men - will spend all their money on the drug , while their children have nothing to eat .
and khat is also blamed for the small plastic bags which litter the city .
pink , blue and red bags , used to hold khat , block drains , hang on trees and fences , stick to telegraph and electricity poles , or are even eaten by goats .
the mayor 's plan would give each of the city 's five districts its own khat " areas " .
bursts into life he was confident that the plan would work .
" the same thing that happens here today , used to happen in mogadishu .
sinai market was a similar initiative .
people will go to wherever there is khat , " he said .
it has become so cumbersome to declare every thursday as a general clean- up exercise abdiwahab nakruma hargeisa health officer the drug is grown in ethiopia 's highlands .
every day , dozens of trucks loaded with tonnes of it arrive in hargeisa , flooding the streets by mid-morning .
the city bursts into life with their arrival .
people run after the trucks , some pushing carts and wheelbarrows .
there are the khat sellers , bystanders , the jobless , pilferers and pickpockets , all wanting to make something out of the excitement .
khat dealer ali omar says there is no point trying to control the trade .
" it is a silly question asking why i sell khat .
can you just walk over to the opposite store and ask why he sells foodstuffs ?
what a laughing matter , " he said before resuming his shouts to attract customers .
single mother-of-three amina derie has been selling khat for three years and is unrepentant .
she says the trade allows her to buy food for her children .
" i even pay their school fees through it .
thanks to god , i am comfortable , " she said with a knowing smile .
environmental problems the drug has a huge impact on the economy of somaliland - whose independence from the rest of somalia has not been internationally recognised .
hargeisa 's former mayor mohamed hashi was once quoted as saying that $ 60m was spent annually importing the drug from ethiopia .
somaliland is one of the poorest places on earth .
the thousands of small polythene bags scattered all over the city 's streets are a clear sign of the scale of the problem .
it appears that this huge mess is one reason why local leaders have taken action .
hargeisa regional public health officer abdiwahab nakruma says khat has led to a fall in hygiene and sanitation standards .
" it has become so cumbersome to declare every thursday as a general clean- up exercise . "
rangeland development director in pastoral and environmental ministry abdikarim adan omar says khat is also contributing to the degradation of the natural environment .
he says that unemployed young people in rural areas have resorted to burning charcoal in order to buy khat .
" the common saying in the rural areas amongst the charcoal burners is : ' cut a tree to chew a twig ' , " he said .
hargeisa residents are hoping that some of these problems can be solved by moving the khat markets out of the city centre .

" it has become so cumbersome to declare every thursday as a general clean- up exercise . "
rangeland development director in pastoral and environmental ministry abdikarim adan omar says khat is also contributing to the degradation of the natural environment .
he says that unemployed young people in rural areas have resorted to burning charcoal in order to buy khat .
" the common saying in the rural areas amongst the charcoal burners is : ' cut a tree to chew a twig ' , " he said .
hargeisa residents are hoping that some of these problems can be solved by moving the khat markets out of the city centre .

in the first of a series of features , we look at how britpop was born .
early britpop bands were reacting against nirvana 's success in early 1992 , one band dominated the global alternative rock scene .
nirvana had suddenly become the voice of a restless generation thanks to their seminal , seething album nevermind and single smells like teen spirit , which were released the previous year .
grunge was cool , seattle was the rock capital and other us bands like pearl jam , metallica and guns n ' roses were also enjoying mammoth success .
in the uk , the " madchester " scene of the stone roses and happy mondays had burned brightly for a while but soon fizzled out .
in its wake came little more than the underwhelming , unambitious " shoegazing " phase .
' kill grunge ' with this backdrop , blur - who had their first hit in 1991 amid the madchester-inspired " baggy " craze - set off on their second us tour .
the 44-city trek was a depressing experience .
bands who were not grunge were all but dismissed and blur came to despise the disinterest and uniformity they encountered .
select 's april 1993 issue is seen by many as the start of britpop but the trip provoked a strong reaction .
it inspired the band , they said , to begin a mission to " get rid of grunge " , " declare war on america " and make music that was identifiably english .
other new british bands had similar , if less fervent , ideas .
suede , whose debut single the drowners came out while blur were on that tour , also celebrated their origins while railing against us influence .
justine frischmann had been in suede and in a relationship with singer brett anderson - but left both to form her own group , elastica , and get together with blur frontman damon albarn .
and pulp , who were getting noticed for wry songs about everyday life , had moved into the same london orbit as blur , suede and elastica .
reared on acts like david bowie , the jam , the specials and the smiths , these bands now set about reasserting their roots .
the troubles and influences of us bands seemed very distant , according to john harris , author of the last party and presenter of bbc four 's the britpop story .
it reminded people both of their own lives and also of the music that had soundtracked those lives john harris writer and broadcaster " when someone came round the corner singing about dingy suburban england , losing your money on fruit machines and greasy spoon cafes , i thought ' aha , yes , i understand ' , " he says .
" it reminded people both of their own lives and also of the music that had soundtracked those lives 10 or 12 years before . "
in 1993 , suede 's debut album went to number one , blur signalled their new start with modern life is rubbish and now-defunct magazine select published a famous issue celebrating the new british bands .
i was always a blur girl , still convinced i 'll marry alex james one day !
vickie cherington , cambridge send us your memories " they seemed to start talking about people 's lives in this country as they were lived and the things people were familiar with , " andrew harrison , editor at the time , remembers .
" it just seemed to be a lot more powerful and potent .
" and it also went with a much more interesting look .
who wants to shamble round in a third-hand lumberjack shirt when you can be wearing the great fred perry ? "
it all plugged into british heritage and culture at a very creative time for the country , he adds - with britart , films and designers also on a high .
also in 1993 , a clear-out of djs began at bbc radio 1 , then the nation 's most popular radio station , replacing ageing , middle-of-the-road hosts and playlists with younger blood .
" it 's no coincidence that britpop happened a year later , " john harris says .
" i do n't think britpop could have happened without that . "
blur and pulp were among britpop 's most distinctive voices and there was an atmosphere of change in wider society as it became clear that the era of conservative rule was coming to an end .
when a young , vibrant rock fan called tony blair took over as labour leader in 1994 , the sense of possibility and expectation grew .
kurt cobain 's suicide in april 1994 finally finished off grunge as another british band was rapidly emerging - but not from the same southern art school origins as the likes of blur and suede .
oasis merely wanted to pick up where the stone roses left off and be as big as the beatles .
" oasis were a no-nonsense rock ' n ' roll band who wanted to roll around on a bed of £ 50 notes , " mr harris says .
confidence political and musical developments went together for a time as oasis enjoyed hits with rousing anthems live forever and cigarettes and alcohol , blur hit new heights with girls and boys and parklife , social commentary dressed as pop hits .
that set the scene for their chart showdown the following summer - and for a new crop of acts like supergrass , menswear , sleeper and dodgy to take the stage .
some of those bands were inspired by the confidence and success of the britpop pioneers , while others merely happened to come along at the same time .
but they all became part of britpop and helped the uk 's alternative rock regain its voice - for a while .
bbc four 's britpop night , including the britpop story with john harris , is on tuesday from 2030 bst .

the yasukuni is where japan honours its war dead .
it is controversial because the country 's war-time leaders , convicted as war criminals by an allied tribunal in 1948 , are also honoured there .
annual visits by japan 's prime minister junichiro koizumi have angered japan 's neighbours .
so far he has not visited this year , but there has been much speculation about whether or not he would mark the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii with a visit .
for many , though , this is the place they wanted to be on this 15 august .
the doors creaked loudly as they were slowly pulled open on the dot of six o 'clock .

one man was wearing a white head-band displaying japan 's war-time flag .
he carried a huge standard with the country 's modern day colours .
smartly dressed in a black suit with a black tie , he stopped in front of the shrine and shouted : " to the souls of the departed of the motherland , i would like to express my deepest condolence in prayer " .
afterwards he told me his mother and elder sister had died in the war .
by mid-morning the yasukuni shrine was packed as more and more people , some of them tourists , some of them veterans , streamed through the gates .
someone described it as like a crowded train .
silent prayer the official commemoration , at lunchtime , was led by emperor akihito .
i do n't care if they are war criminals or not .
i just prayed for peace shigeo kobayashi he sat on a white stage with his wife the empress at a hall near the imperial palace , watched by more than 7,500 relatives of japan 's war dead .
in a meticulously timed and executed ceremony , the emperor and empress got up and slowly made their way to the war memorial on the stroke of noon .
they both bowed deeply and then lowered their heads in silent prayer .
elsewhere in tokyo , not everyone was aware of the significance of 15 august .
" i did n't know today was the anniversary , " said eri miyamoto , 24 .
" but my grandmother tells me a lot about world war ii .
it always makes me think ' why could human beings do such a hard thing ? '
i feel sad about what 's happening in iraq as well , " she said .
ryohei obuchi is a salaryman in his fifties .
" of course i know today is memorial day , " he said .
" in japan we celebrate if someone reaches 60 years old .
we call them ' kanreki ' .
it means you are old enough to be re-born .
" the 60th is a big turning point for people , and also for the country .
it is amazing japan has become kanreki already , " he said .
" we should never have war again , " he added as he walked away .
coming out of shinbasi station i met shigeo kobayashi , who said he had just returned from the yasukuni shrine where he had prayed for peace .
" it was my first visit there , " he said .
" i wanted to see it since prime minister koizumi is so anxious to go there .
so i went to see it for myself , but i also prayed for the people honoured there .
i do n't care if they are war criminals or not .
i just prayed for peace . '

but survivors of war are often left with mental scars as well , whether they are soldiers or civilians , victors or vanquished .
in this five-part series , bbc news explores what happens when the fighting stops - but the trauma continues .
world war i veterans called it shell shock .
the world war ii generation talked about soldiers " going psycho " .
many iraq vets have suffered from the loss of their comrades iraq war trauma : your views today it is called post-traumatic stress disorder -lrb- ptsd -rrb- - psychological trauma caused by bad experiences .
victims often find themselves having nightmares or being unable to sleep .
in many cases , they have intrusive flashbacks to the events that caused the trauma .
since the us-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , tens of thousands of us soldiers - and hundreds from the uk - have been diagnosed with ptsd and related problems such as depression .
it is much harder to get a picture of the situation in iraq because of cultural differences and the relative lack of psychological services there .
but experts and eyewitnesses agree that the invasion and insurgency are certain to have caused serious mental health problems for many .
emotional turmoil dr jonathan shay , a us psychiatrist who has worked with vietnam veterans for many years , says combat stress is an age-old problem - certainly one known to the ancient greeks .
in his book odysseus in america , he argues that the homeric hero was a severe combat stress case - a loner and deceiver who had murderous rages .
" combat stress is as old as the human species , " he says - and , in a way , a very normal phenomenon .
" it is an absolutely valid adaptation to survive in a horrific situation .
in war , people really are trying to kill you .
you are surrounded by enemies and have to be prepared to kill instantly to survive . "
soldiers - and civilians caught up in war - become hyper-vigilant , unnaturally alert and focused .
and combat can have a devastating effect on a person 's emotional health .
" we shut down all emotions that do not serve survival - grief , sweetness , fear , " dr shay says .
but one emotion may remain switched on , he adds : anger .

' limiting life ' some cope with it by withdrawing from society in one way or another .
" there are numerous examples where a veteran will severely limit his life , isolating himself to protect us , " dr shay says .
" they will tell you : ' if i go out in public , i know i 'm going to meet some jerk who 's going to cross me and i 'll do something and spend the rest of my life in jail . '
many truly do n't want to hurt other people . "
iraqi children have seen their parents killed before their eyes those are the extreme cases , of course .
only a minority of soldiers - even those who see combat - experience ptsd .
one recent uk study of iraq veterans even suggested that a successful military deployment could be beneficial for a soldier 's mental health .
but jamie hacker-hughes , the author of that study , emphasised that his subjects were " professional soldiers who went as a unit , did exactly what they were trained to do , had a successful outcome , and were there for a relatively short time " .
and the sample was fairly small - 254 soldiers .
a much larger us study of veterans of the wars in iraq and afghanistan found up to 17 % suffering ptsd , depression , or general anxiety .
and while some research has been done on the british and us soldiers who served in iraq , there is much less data on the mental health of iraqi soldiers or civilians on the receiving end of the war .
there 's no way a normal person can deal with ptsd john henry parker , veterans and families leslie carrick-smith , a leading british expert on ptsd , says the " propensity for trauma would be the same if not greater " among iraqis caught up in combat zones .
baghdad has a psychiatric hospital , but it is understaffed , under-resourced and overwhelmed .
khalid , a surgeon in baghdad , says mental health is a low priority in post-war iraq .
" being operated on physically is the most important , " he says .
" no-one had , or has , the time to ask : ' are you afraid ?
are you stressed ? " '
widespread effects john henry parker runs veterans and families , a california-based organisation dedicated to supporting soldiers and their loved ones when they return from combat .
he warns that soldiers suffering from psychological trauma pose a risk to themselves , their families and society if they are not treated .
" they burn through their family and the goodwill of everyone they know , because there 's no way a normal person can deal with ptsd .
" we 're not trained for it .
people have to part ways and it 's ugly , " he says .
and in the united states , tens of millions of people are affected , he says .
" there are about 25 million veterans in america .
" multiply 25 million veterans by their spouses , their surviving parents , their aunts , uncles , cousins , sisters , brothers - that 's 100 million people . "

councils in the north east of england have already paid £ 75m after claims involving 8,000 women workers .
in 1999 most councils in that region signed equal pay agreements but they failed to implement them .
the action 4 equality campaign , which has also won settlements at employment tribunals , is now heading to scotland .
legal action many north east councils offered compensation to all women employees who had been affected by unequal pay over the years .
last month newcastle city council reached a settlement with trade unions which will benefit 2,800 workers , such as cleaners and care-at-home staff .
gateshead , durham city , sunderland , south tyneside and north tyneside have also made multi-million pound payouts . "
the people who will get rich with this will not be the workers , but the lawyers negotiating the claims " pat watters cosla however , action 4 equality , an organisation linked to a firm of solicitors , said that workers could launch legal action against the councils .
it has already secured payouts of up to £ 34,000 for staff in redcar and cleveland .
the scottish organiser of action 4 equality , mark irvine , estimated that 50,000 women workers in scotland could claim .
he claims that if they got the same sort of settlements already paid in england , the bill could be more than £ 700m .
he told bbc radio 's good morning scotland programme that talks with employers so far had proved unhelpful .
mr irvine said : " negotiations between employers and the trade unions have been ongoing for several years and the best brains among them have failed to come up with a solution so far .
" if people want to settle equal pay claims , the best way to achieve that is to take direct action through the employment courts with the support of action 4 equality . "
equal value council employers said england had suffered from fast buck legal claims which could damage local government in scotland .
local authority body cosla admitted there was a problem but said talks with unions was the best way to reach a solution .
president pat watters said : " the people who will get rich with this will not be the workers , but the lawyers negotiating the claims .
" action 4 equality is a not a charity organisation but is there to make money , 20 % will be creamed off right away for the lawyers .
what it is making right now off the backs of workers is millions of pounds . "
mr watters estimated that the bill for local authorities in relation to pay claims would reach £ 500m .
he added that money to pay claims would have to come from council taxpayers unless the government stepped in to help out .
a claim under the equal pay act 1970 may be made by either a woman or a man claiming equal pay with one or more comparators of the other sex .
he or she needs to show a difference in pay for doing " like work " , " work rated as equivalent " or " work of equal value " .

councils in the north east of england have already paid £ 75m after claims involving 8,000 women workers .
in 1999 most councils in that region signed equal pay agreements but they failed to implement them .
the action 4 equality campaign , which has also won settlements at employment tribunals , is now heading to scotland .
legal action many north east councils offered compensation to all women employees who had been affected by unequal pay over the years .
last month newcastle city council reached a settlement with trade unions which will benefit 2,800 workers , such as cleaners and care-at-home staff .
gateshead , durham city , sunderland , south tyneside and north tyneside have also made multi-million pound payouts .
the people who will get rich with this will not be the workers , but the lawyers negotiating the claims pat watters cosla however , action 4 equality , an organisation linked to a firm of solicitors , said that workers could launch legal action against the councils .
it has already secured payouts of up to £ 34,000 for staff in redcar and cleveland .
the scottish organiser of action 4 equality , mark irvine , estimated that 50,000 women workers in scotland could claim .
he claims that if they got the same sort of settlements already paid in england , the bill could be more than £ 700m .
he told bbc radio 's good morning scotland programme that talks with employers so far had proved unhelpful .
mr irvine said : " negotiations between employers and the trade unions have been ongoing for several years and the best brains among them have failed to come up with a solution so far .
" if people want to settle equal pay claims , the best way to achieve that is to take direct action through the employment courts with the support of action 4 equality . "
equal value council employers said england had suffered from fast buck legal claims which could damage local government in scotland .
local authority body cosla admitted there was a problem but said talks with unions was the best way to reach a solution .
president pat watters said : " the people who will get rich with this will not be the workers , but the lawyers negotiating the claims .
" action 4 equality is a not a charity organisation but is there to make money , 20 % will be creamed off right away for the lawyers .
what it is making right now off the backs of workers is millions of pounds . "
mr watters estimated that the bill for local authorities in relation to pay claims would reach £ 500m .
he added that money to pay claims would have to come from council taxpayers unless the government stepped in to help out .
a claim under the equal pay act 1970 may be made by either a woman or a man claiming equal pay with one or more comparators of the other sex .

in japan , prime minister junichiro koizumi said his nation felt " deep remorse " for the aggression shown towards its neighbours during the war .
commemorative services are also taking place in other asian nations .
but across the region , many still feel that japan has yet to fully face up to , and atone for , its wartime actions .
the war in the pacific , which finally ended on 15 august 1945 , killed millions of people from the jungles of burma and the beaches of singapore and the philippines , to the cities of china and japan and the seas of the pacific .
japan has been heavily criticised for the brutality of its soldiers in the countries it annexed during the war - and especially for its treatment of civilians in china .
we will not forget the terrible lessons of the war japan 's pm junichiro koizumi statement in full ' terrible lessons ' in a written statement , mr koizumi admitted that japan had " caused great damages and pain to people in many countries , especially our asian neighbours , through colonisation and invasion .
" we will not forget the terrible lessons of the war , and will contribute to world peace and prosperity , " he said .
shortly afterwards , mr koizumi joined emperor akihito and empress michiko for a nationally televised service .
they bowed deeply before a memorial to the country 's war dead that had been set up on a white stage .
exactly 60 years after emperor hirohito formally surrendered , asking his people to " bear the unbearable " and accept defeat , his son emperor akihito expressed the hope that japan would never again wage war .
" in view of history , i sincerely wish that the ravages of war will never be repeated , " emperor akihito said .
despite mr koizumi 's apology and the repeated calls for peace , many asian nations continue to feel that japan has not done enough to face up to its past .
japan 's relations with some of its neighbours are at their lowest in years , partly because of continued disputes over the war .
doves of peace were released at the controversial yasukuni shrine mr koizumi 's apology on monday was similar to one he made in april , in response to anti-japanese violence in china sparked by a series of new japanese school textbooks which played down wartime atrocities .
an editorial in monday 's edition of china 's state controlled china daily newspaper made it clear that beijing still believes japan has still not adequately faced up to the past .
" only with an honest attitude towards history can a nation win reconciliation and then integrate into the global community , " the china daily said .
" actions speak louder than words ...
-lsb- mr koizumi 's -rsb- words appeared faint and his sincerity is also in doubt , " the newspaper said , referring to his past apologies .
in other parts of asia , people voiced their anger against japan to mark the anniversary .
on sunday , a group of women in the philippines demanded compensation for being forced into sex slavery for japanese troops .
similar protests also take place regularly in south korea .
protesters in hong kong marched to the japanese consulate on monday , chanting that " japan 's hands are full of fresh blood " .
a similar march took place in taiwan .
have your say it will take more time for our heartfelt apologies to be accepted by those who suffered in the war kotaro watanabe , singapore send us your comments in tokyo , there was a heavy media presence at the controversial yasukuni shrine , where japanese war dead - including 14 class a war criminals - are honoured .
mr koizumi 's visits to the shrine have triggered anger among japan 's neighbours , but he did not visit the shrine on monday .
other senior politicians did visit - including tokyo governor shintaro ishihara and ruling party executive shinzo abe , who is often cited as a candidate to succeed mr koizumi .
other nations are also marking the anniversary of the end of the war with services and memorial events .
in a rare move , a north korean delegation is in south korea for the occasion , with senior members of the north 's ruling party among the visitors .
in australia , prime minister john howard paid tribute to his nation 's war veterans , who had given the country " the priceless gift of security and freedom " .
" freedom 's torch was preserved not just here in australia , but in the pacific and in europe .
this was a war of liberation which in a real sense liberated the people of our once bitter enemies , " mr howard said .
