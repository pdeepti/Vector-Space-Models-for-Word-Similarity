today , he can take much of the credit for the popularity of the new leipzig school , which has put germany in the international vanguard of fashionable painting . it might be a key date in german history , but oct .
3 , 1990 was a day like any other to gerd harry lybke .
born in 1961 , he 'd been running the leipzig gallery " eigen + art " since 1983 , and did n't necessarily see the west as a land of opportunities . " unification was something i experienced very much from a distance , " he said .
" it was n't obvious what one was supposed to do with it .
and i was n't the sort of person who expected to be welcomed with open arms in the west . " east german repression his checkered career in the gdr had taught lybke not to take anything for granted .
his original career ambition was to be an astronaut , but when he refused an opportunity to study in the soviet union , the communist regime barred him from public service . lybke 's first foray into the art world was as a model for students at the leipzig art school , work not officially recognized by the state .
after getting to know a number of artists , he began organizing private exhibitions in 1983 in his own apartment - an illegal practice which soon brought him to the attention of the east german authorities . " it was bad news , " he said .
" i was n't allowed to study , and my plan to become an actor was nipped in the bud .
there was n't much i was allowed to do . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lybke , right , and his assistant by the time lybke had been " rehabilitated " in 1990 , the berlin wall had fallen and the " eigen + art " gallery in leipzig , which had begun in his front room , had become an integral part of east germany 's subculture .
it had a reputation that had long reached the attention of the west german art scene . international impresario after opening a second branch of the gallery in berlin 's rapidly gentrifying mitte district in 1992 , lybke , the first private gallery owner from the former east to set up shop in the reunited city , went on to foster dozens of fledgling artists , propelling berlin to a secure place on the international art map . berlin might have been an unparalleled business opportunity after unification , but lybke kept his eye on the ball and realized that the real creative potential was back in leipzig . while the new german capital basked in its post-unification glory as a hotbed of burgeoning talent , by the mid 1990s the most exciting art action was unfolding several hundred kilometers east in leipzig , and lybke was playing the role of impresario . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : painting by neo rauch these days , the artists spawned by leipzig 's art school - including neo rauch -lrb- photo -rrb- , martin eder and carsten nicolai - can command prices up to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 60,000 -rrb- , and the man doing the selling is usually lybke . " leipzig has become one of the main hubs for contemporary art , " he said .
" in the 1970s and 80s it was cologne , then it was new york , then it was berlin , and now it 's leipzig .

a mass demonstration was organized for oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.10.2005 germans faced with rising power costs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans may soon be paying more for electricity all around the world , energy prices have soared in recent months .
following the steep ascent of gasoline and natural gas , it looks as if germans will now also be hit by climbing electricity costs . just as motorists are facing record prices at the pump and homeowners are receiving inflated gas bills , the next bit of bad news for german consumers rolls in . on tuesday , germany 's two largest energy companies , rwe and e.on , said they wanted to hike electricity prices by a reported 5 or 6 percent starting next year .
the utilities justified the higher costs with increasing wholesale prices , expenses from renewable sources and greater demand . the move was instantly criticized by consumer watchdog groups . " i have the impression that the energy companies are using the current political vacuum , " german consumer protection association spokesman carel mohn told the dpa news agency , referring to political stalemate in berlin following last month 's election .
" there is no other sector that constantly makes such above-average profits .
that shows that competition still is n't working . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe spokesman wolfgang schley said in dortmund on tuesday that prices on the leipzig eex electricity market jumped around 30 percent in the first six months of the year and that politicial scrutiny politicians , aware that germans are fed-up with rising energy costs have also rushed to condemn the utilities .
economics minister wolfgang clement on tuesday called on state officials to check carefully whether higher electricity prices are warranted . " these price hikes are politically impossible to communicate , " hesse state economics minister alois rhiel told the süddeutsche zeitung .
" therefore i will be especially critical when looking at the petitions . " the decision to push for a rate hike could be undercut by the fact that germany 's third and fourth largest electricity utilities - vattenfall and enbw respectively - were not planning to raise prices in january . renewables not to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an official for a renewable energy association said such energy sources , wind power , for example , could not be held accountable for increasing prices .
" it 's wrong and brazen from rwe and e.on to associate the hikes in electricity costs with renewables , " said milan nitzschke from the federal association for renewable energy . the electricity news is sure to encourage even more germans to seek alternative energy sources .
following the recent surge in the cost of natural gas and oil , some are hoping a cozy fire could meet their energy needs .
but even that is costing more than it used to . " a lot of people want to heat with wood again , " schmallenberg forestry official adalbert koch told dpa , explaining that firewood had become as much as 40 percent more expensive this year . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's " electricity rebels " germany 's reputation for environmental friendliness may have found its expression in the black forest citizens ' initiative that won a david and goliath battle against the local electricity provider .

but democratic and economic reforms have made slow progress since then . yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic wasn ’ t going to go without a fight , even when it was clear that vojislav kostunica , the candidate from the 18-party alliance , the serbian democratic opposition , had surprisingly won the 2000 presidential election . opposition leader zoran djindjic and the optor student movement then organized nationwide strikes .
a mass demonstration was organized for oct .
5 in belgrade .
tens of thousands flooded into the capital .
by the afternoon , hundreds of thousands of opposition supporters had gathered outside parliament , chanting death to milosevic and calling for kostunica to take power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic things came to a head when it emerged that milosevic -lrb- photo -rrb- had ordered the police to shoot into the crowd and the army to attack from the air - an order refused by generals and police officers .
only in front of parliament and the state television building was there shooting and tear gas used . milosevic exit a watershed serbian journalist dragan bujosevic , who was there , remembers the events vividly . " it was then i realized , woah , they really believe they could get killed today , " bujosevic said .
" part of the opposition certainly thought so . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the events of that momentous day spiraled out of control .
without informing the liberal-left majority of the opposition alliance , the nationalist-conservative kostunica -lrb- photo -rrb- met with milosevic .
a few hours later milosevic conceded live on state television . " i congratulate mr kostunica on his election victory and wish the citizens of yugoslavia much success during the new presidents mandate , " milosevic said . yet president kostunica soon fell out with the now reformist prime minister zoran djinjic .
he steadfastly refused djindjic ’ s wish to arrest milosevic and hand him over the war crimes tribunal in the hague . djinjic got his way in the end but lost the support of kostunica ’ s followers in parliament .
he accused them of lacking the will to make a clean break with the milosevic-era . " on oct .

it ’ s no secret that i didn ’ t have a majority .

a year later kostunica was elected prime minister . more needs to be done since then kostunica has steered his country on the path to reform .
his greatest success came on monday this week , when the eu gave the green light to negotiations over a partnership with serbia-montenegro .
kostunica vowed to push through more reforms . " our laws must come into line with eu laws , the justice system needs to be strengthened and modernized , the constitution of serbia-montenegro needs to be adhered to and we need to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal in the hague , " he said . yet observers remain skeptical that , five years on , serbia is anywhere near having a stable democracy or a functional market economy .
many former colleagues accuse kostunica of corruption , failing to deal with the past and suppressing political opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic serbia also needs to hand in all fugitives suspected of committing war crimes , most importantly bosnian serb commander ratko mladic and his then political boss radovan karadzic -lrb- photo -rrb- to the hague tribunal before the country will earn the international community 's trust . " a balkan mindset " former justice minister vladan batic , one of kostunica ’ s loudest critics , blames the prime minister for blocking reforms . " only a few have been arrested , and it was kostunica who put the brakes on .
there ’ s no transparency to the state .
people were prepared to wait for a better standard of living , but they wanted justice , " batic said . last week batic himself was arrested for allegedly releasing a criminal involved in djindjic ’ s murder .
the case was dropped due to lack of evidence . serbia-montenegro human rights minister rasim ljajic told reuters in an interview recently that his country still had a long way to go . " we have an image problem , " ljajic said .
" the way to fix it is to show we can honor our commitments to the international community .

today , he can take much of the credit for the popularity of the new leipzig school , which has put germany in the international vanguard of fashionable painting . it might be a key date in german history , but oct .
3 , 1990 was a day like any other to gerd harry lybke .
born in 1961 , he 'd been running the leipzig gallery " eigen + art " since 1983 , and did n't necessarily see the west as a land of opportunities . " unification was something i experienced very much from a distance , " he said .
" it was n't obvious what one was supposed to do with it .
and i was n't the sort of person who expected to be welcomed with open arms in the west . " east german repression his checkered career in the gdr had taught lybke not to take anything for granted .
his original career ambition was to be an astronaut , but when he refused an opportunity to study in the soviet union , the communist regime barred him from public service . lybke 's first foray into the art world was as a model for students at the leipzig art school , work not officially recognized by the state .
after getting to know a number of artists , he began organizing private exhibitions in 1983 in his own apartment - an illegal practice which soon brought him to the attention of the east german authorities . " it was bad news , " he said .
" i was n't allowed to study , and my plan to become an actor was nipped in the bud .
there was n't much i was allowed to do . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lybke , right , and his assistant by the time lybke had been " rehabilitated " in 1990 , the berlin wall had fallen and the " eigen + art " gallery in leipzig , which had begun in his front room , had become an integral part of east germany 's subculture .
it had a reputation that had long reached the attention of the west german art scene . international impresario after opening a second branch of the gallery in berlin 's rapidly gentrifying mitte district in 1992 , lybke , the first private gallery owner from the former east to set up shop in the reunited city , went on to foster dozens of fledgling artists , propelling berlin to a secure place on the international art map . berlin might have been an unparalleled business opportunity after unification , but lybke kept his eye on the ball and realized that the real creative potential was back in leipzig . while the new german capital basked in its post-unification glory as a hotbed of burgeoning talent , by the mid 1990s the most exciting art action was unfolding several hundred kilometers east in leipzig , and lybke was playing the role of impresario . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : painting by neo rauch these days , the artists spawned by leipzig 's art school - including neo rauch -lrb- photo -rrb- , martin eder and carsten nicolai - can command prices up to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 60,000 -rrb- , and the man doing the selling is usually lybke . " leipzig has become one of the main hubs for contemporary art , " he said .

" we have a hiccup right now , " elbaradei , director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , said at a forum on nuclear safety issues in moscow .
" i am optimistic that in the coming months we will see a resumption of these negotiations .
we need to find a face-saving solution . " eu talks with tehran - spearheaded by the so-called eu-3 of britain , france and germany , as well as eu foreign policy chief javier solana - broke down in august after tehran resumed uranium conversion activities .
the united states claims these activities are a cover for developing nuclear weapons . last month the iaea threatened to refer tehran to the un security council over its nuclear program , but not before a november iaea meeting .
the european union has so far resisted calls for iran to be referred to the un , hoping to win pledges from tehran on its nuclear plans , in exchange for trade and other benefits . at wednesday 's forum in moscow , organized by the nuclear threat initiative , a us pressure group , elbaradei said that russia shared the same broad goals as other leading members of the international community as regards iran 's nuclear program .
washington has voiced worries about moscow 's building of the bushehr nuclear power plant in iran , suspecting that this could help tehran develop an offensive nuclear capacity . " i think everybody , russia included , agrees that nobody wants to see iran develop nuclear weapons .
on the strategic goal there is consensus , " elbaradei said .
" russia , like all other members , has been trying to see what is the best tactic to achieve that objective .
you have differences on the best tactics to be pursued , but that is democracy . " diplomat resigns meanwhile , one of iran 's most prominent diplomats , mohammad javad zarif , has resigned as a member of the country 's nuclear negotiating team , the official news agency irna reported wednesday . zarif , who is ambassador to the united nations , is widely considered a moderating influence over foreign policy and in favor of improving ties with the west .
the report , quoting an unidentified source , did not say why zarif quit the nuclear negotiating team , which has been almost totally changed following the june presidential election victory of hardliner mahmoud ahmadinejad . bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad leading negotiator hassan rowhani , also a moderate , was replaced by ultra-conservative ali larijani , who is seen as being at the opposite end of the regime 's political spectrum to diplomats like zarif . tensions with the west have also escalated after iran slammed the door on proposals from britain , france and germany that it abandon fuel-cycle technology in return for incentives , and decided to resume uranium conversion work in defiance of an agreement with the eu-3 . during the tenure of former president mohammad khatami , zarif played an active role in efforts to improve iran 's foreign relations .
he was notably involved in closed-door talks with the united states in 2001 on the formation of a post-taliban government for afghanistan , followed by secret contacts prior to the us invasion of iraq . moderates worried the uncompromising stance of iran 's new hardline authorities in a stand-off over the country 's nuclear program is worrying some iranian officials and leading to overt criticism .
the issue is not whether or not the country should hang on to its nuclear program , but more on how the regime should go about it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani the first to speak out was defeated presidential contender akbar hashemi rafsanjani , who on friday appealed to hardliners to exercise restraint - notably when it came to their increasingly violent rhetoric . " it is about diplomacy rather than slogans , " the still-powerful cleric said in a sermon last week .
" it is about being reasonable , negotiating and being diplomatically active . "
he reminded his fellow iranians that the stakes are " very serious . " on tuesday moderate deputies in the iranian parliament also warned of the economic consequences of international isolation and sanctions , complaining the new nuclear team is " failing to respect national interests in their statements . " in an open letter , the minority group said iran was at a " sensitive stage " and noted the " freefall of the tehran stock exchange " where nuclear jitters are hitting investor confidence .
" sadly , the first action of the government was to change the nuclear negotiators and deprive itself of their experience and the trust they built up , " hassan afarideh , a moderate mp , said in parliament . " certain officials and negotiators keep using threatening and intimidating language .
it is clear we can not reach a result through diplomacy with this kind of language , " he said , taking a clear shot at larijani , who threatened to respond to last month 's tough resolution passed by the iaea by limiting inspections and resuming enrichment . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran wants nuclear talks beyond europe iran does not consider britain , france and germany to be the sole negotiating partners on its nuclear program and believes the process should be opened out beyond europe , the foreign ministry said sunday .

" we have a hiccup right now , " elbaradei , director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , said at a forum on nuclear safety issues in moscow .
" i am optimistic that in the coming months we will see a resumption of these negotiations .
we need to find a face-saving solution . " eu talks with tehran - spearheaded by the so-called eu-3 of britain , france and germany , as well as eu foreign policy chief javier solana - broke down in august after tehran resumed uranium conversion activities .
the united states claims these activities are a cover for developing nuclear weapons . last month the iaea threatened to refer tehran to the un security council over its nuclear program , but not before a november iaea meeting .
the european union has so far resisted calls for iran to be referred to the un , hoping to win pledges from tehran on its nuclear plans , in exchange for trade and other benefits . at wednesday 's forum in moscow , organized by the nuclear threat initiative , a us pressure group , elbaradei said that russia shared the same broad goals as other leading members of the international community as regards iran 's nuclear program .
washington has voiced worries about moscow 's building of the bushehr nuclear power plant in iran , suspecting that this could help tehran develop an offensive nuclear capacity . " i think everybody , russia included , agrees that nobody wants to see iran develop nuclear weapons .
on the strategic goal there is consensus , " elbaradei said .
" russia , like all other members , has been trying to see what is the best tactic to achieve that objective .
you have differences on the best tactics to be pursued , but that is democracy . " diplomat resigns meanwhile , one of iran 's most prominent diplomats , mohammad javad zarif , has resigned as a member of the country 's nuclear negotiating team , the official news agency irna reported wednesday . zarif , who is ambassador to the united nations , is widely considered a moderating influence over foreign policy and in favor of improving ties with the west .
the report , quoting an unidentified source , did not say why zarif quit the nuclear negotiating team , which has been almost totally changed following the june presidential election victory of hardliner mahmoud ahmadinejad . bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad leading negotiator hassan rowhani , also a moderate , was replaced by ultra-conservative ali larijani , who is seen as being at the opposite end of the regime 's political spectrum to diplomats like zarif . tensions with the west have also escalated after iran slammed the door on proposals from britain , france and germany that it abandon fuel-cycle technology in return for incentives , and decided to resume uranium conversion work in defiance of an agreement with the eu-3 . during the tenure of former president mohammad khatami , zarif played an active role in efforts to improve iran 's foreign relations .
he was notably involved in closed-door talks with the united states in 2001 on the formation of a post-taliban government for afghanistan , followed by secret contacts prior to the us invasion of iraq . moderates worried the uncompromising stance of iran 's new hardline authorities in a stand-off over the country 's nuclear program is worrying some iranian officials and leading to overt criticism .
the issue is not whether or not the country should hang on to its nuclear program , but more on how the regime should go about it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani the first to speak out was defeated presidential contender akbar hashemi rafsanjani , who on friday appealed to hardliners to exercise restraint - notably when it came to their increasingly violent rhetoric . " it is about diplomacy rather than slogans , " the still-powerful cleric said in a sermon last week .
" it is about being reasonable , negotiating and being diplomatically active . "
he reminded his fellow iranians that the stakes are " very serious . " on tuesday moderate deputies in the iranian parliament also warned of the economic consequences of international isolation and sanctions , complaining the new nuclear team is " failing to respect national interests in their statements . " in an open letter , the minority group said iran was at a " sensitive stage " and noted the " freefall of the tehran stock exchange " where nuclear jitters are hitting investor confidence .
" sadly , the first action of the government was to change the nuclear negotiators and deprive itself of their experience and the trust they built up , " hassan afarideh , a moderate mp , said in parliament . " certain officials and negotiators keep using threatening and intimidating language .
it is clear we can not reach a result through diplomacy with this kind of language , " he said , taking a clear shot at larijani , who threatened to respond to last month 's tough resolution passed by the iaea by limiting inspections and resuming enrichment . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran wants nuclear talks beyond europe iran does not consider britain , france and germany to be the sole negotiating partners on its nuclear program and believes the process should be opened out beyond europe , the foreign ministry said sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.10.2005 campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the campaign compares average citizens to famous germans after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .
but now leading german media organizations have launched a new initiative to help lift their spirits . in the largest public-service campaign in german history , 25 top media organizations last week started a 30-million-euro -lrb- $ 35.7-million -rrb- advertising barrage called " you are germany " to help raise the spirits of the country 's 82 million citizens . amounting to a five-month nationwide pep talk , the initiative 's organizers will blanket the airwaves and fill newspapers , magazines and billboards with the message that germans need to be more optimistic about their country 's prospects despite high unemployment , weak growth and a muddled political situation . " germany makes itself out to be worse than it is , " bernd kundrun , board member of german media giant bertelsmann , said while announcing the new campaign in september .
" we want to do something about that with this unique joint effort by encouraging a change in consciousness towards more self-confidence and motivation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " du bist deutschland " albert einstein ad .
the broad media alliance - which is donating airtime and page space - has recruited an impressive cross-section of german society for the campaign .
besides including currently well-known personalities such as national soccer team goalkeeper oliver kahn and literary critic marcel reich-ranicki , it will also feature historical figures like beethoven and albert einstein .
whether on tv , in print or on the internet , all of the advertisements try to inspire germans to take a personal stake in getting germany back on track . doom and gloom but lifting the doom and gloom that have dominated the german public mood for years could be a tall order .
a record 5 million people are jobless in europe 's largest economy and recent surveys have shown that many germans remain fearful of the future . the sept .
18 general election has n't helped either .
the vote produced an inconclusive hung result that has both chancellor gerhard schröder and the leader of the conservative opposition , angela merkel , claiming the right to lead the country for the next four years . jo groebel , a psychologist and director of düsseldorf-based european institute for the media , praised the new initiative for attempting to shake the country out of its current self-pitying torpor , but said the roots of the german crisis of confidence went deep . " germans have been lurching from one identity crisis to another for the past 150 years , " groebel said , pointing out that oct .
3 marked 15 years since german reunification .
" it 's true germans tend to yearn for stability , but that 's because they have n't had it .
the economic problems like large unemployment have only added to the fears that everything could collapse . " to some extent , german worries are overblown .
germany is still the world 's leading exporter and the country continues to offer its citizens an extremely comfortable standard of living .
but as globalization has threatened high-paying german jobs and the government has been forced to trim extremely generous welfare benefits , complaining has become something of a national pastime . change of mentality though the organizers have no illusions that the television and print ads alone can end germany 's malaise , they hope their efforts will foster the kind of can-do mentality that helped the country tackle the far greater challenge of rebuilding after world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ard tv newscaster ulrich wickert .

but now leading german media organizations have launched a new initiative to help lift their spirits . in the largest public-service campaign in german history , 25 top media organizations last week started a 30-million-euro -lrb- $ 35.7-million -rrb- advertising barrage called " you are germany " to help raise the spirits of the country 's 82 million citizens . amounting to a five-month nationwide pep talk , the initiative 's organizers will blanket the airwaves and fill newspapers , magazines and billboards with the message that germans need to be more optimistic about their country 's prospects despite high unemployment , weak growth and a muddled political situation . " germany makes itself out to be worse than it is , " bernd kundrun , board member of german media giant bertelsmann , said while announcing the new campaign in september .
" we want to do something about that with this unique joint effort by encouraging a change in consciousness towards more self-confidence and motivation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " du bist deutschland " albert einstein ad .
the broad media alliance - which is donating airtime and page space - has recruited an impressive cross-section of german society for the campaign .
besides including currently well-known personalities such as national soccer team goalkeeper oliver kahn and literary critic marcel reich-ranicki , it will also feature historical figures like beethoven and albert einstein .
whether on tv , in print or on the internet , all of the advertisements try to inspire germans to take a personal stake in getting germany back on track . doom and gloom but lifting the doom and gloom that have dominated the german public mood for years could be a tall order .
a record 5 million people are jobless in europe 's largest economy and recent surveys have shown that many germans remain fearful of the future . the sept .
18 general election has n't helped either .
the vote produced an inconclusive hung result that has both chancellor gerhard schröder and the leader of the conservative opposition , angela merkel , claiming the right to lead the country for the next four years . jo groebel , a psychologist and director of düsseldorf-based european institute for the media , praised the new initiative for attempting to shake the country out of its current self-pitying torpor , but said the roots of the german crisis of confidence went deep . " germans have been lurching from one identity crisis to another for the past 150 years , " groebel said , pointing out that oct .
3 marked 15 years since german reunification .
" it 's true germans tend to yearn for stability , but that 's because they have n't had it .
the economic problems like large unemployment have only added to the fears that everything could collapse . " to some extent , german worries are overblown .
germany is still the world 's leading exporter and the country continues to offer its citizens an extremely comfortable standard of living .
but as globalization has threatened high-paying german jobs and the government has been forced to trim extremely generous welfare benefits , complaining has become something of a national pastime . change of mentality though the organizers have no illusions that the television and print ads alone can end germany 's malaise , they hope their efforts will foster the kind of can-do mentality that helped the country tackle the far greater challenge of rebuilding after world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ard tv newscaster ulrich wickert .
in one tv spot , ulrich wickert , one of germany 's leading newscasters , even borrows a famous line from former us president john f. kennedy : " ask not what your country can do for you , but what you can do for your country . " all major public and private broadcasters simultaneously televised that first public service announcement on sept .
26 , reaching an estimated audience of 17 million .
but some german observers remain skeptical about whether it all will soothe the nation 's soul .
" it 's hard to say whether this initiative will mobilize people , " wrote dresden 's sächsische zeitung newspaper in an editorial .
" of course something has to change .
but the country 's economic situation has something to do with the miserable mood - whoever thinks the world will end tomorrow is n't about to spend a lot of money at a hardware store today . " marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berliners get the blues a new report shows that not only is depression on the rise in germany , but berliners are the most miserable of all .
is it something in the water , or are they simply more open about their feelings ?
-lrb- april 14 , 2005 -rrb- nothing ventured , nothing gained as germany tries to find its way out of the stubborn quagmire of high unemployment , many of those affected are more concerned with slinging the mud of blame than they are with changing the course of their own fates .
-lrb- march 16 , 2005 -rrb- the german fear of reform germany might be in the middle of a deep economic crisis , but the country 's high unemployment and weak growth are probably the best things ever to happen to angela merkel 's career .

we need to find a face-saving solution . " eu talks with tehran - spearheaded by the so-called eu-3 of britain , france and germany , as well as eu foreign policy chief javier solana - broke down in august after tehran resumed uranium conversion activities .
the united states claims these activities are a cover for developing nuclear weapons . last month the iaea threatened to refer tehran to the un security council over its nuclear program , but not before a november iaea meeting .
the european union has so far resisted calls for iran to be referred to the un , hoping to win pledges from tehran on its nuclear plans , in exchange for trade and other benefits . at wednesday 's forum in moscow , organized by the nuclear threat initiative , a us pressure group , elbaradei said that russia shared the same broad goals as other leading members of the international community as regards iran 's nuclear program .
washington has voiced worries about moscow 's building of the bushehr nuclear power plant in iran , suspecting that this could help tehran develop an offensive nuclear capacity . " i think everybody , russia included , agrees that nobody wants to see iran develop nuclear weapons .
on the strategic goal there is consensus , " elbaradei said .
" russia , like all other members , has been trying to see what is the best tactic to achieve that objective .
you have differences on the best tactics to be pursued , but that is democracy . " diplomat resigns meanwhile , one of iran 's most prominent diplomats , mohammad javad zarif , has resigned as a member of the country 's nuclear negotiating team , the official news agency irna reported wednesday . zarif , who is ambassador to the united nations , is widely considered a moderating influence over foreign policy and in favor of improving ties with the west .
the report , quoting an unidentified source , did not say why zarif quit the nuclear negotiating team , which has been almost totally changed following the june presidential election victory of hardliner mahmoud ahmadinejad . bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad leading negotiator hassan rowhani , also a moderate , was replaced by ultra-conservative ali larijani , who is seen as being at the opposite end of the regime 's political spectrum to diplomats like zarif . tensions with the west have also escalated after iran slammed the door on proposals from britain , france and germany that it abandon fuel-cycle technology in return for incentives , and decided to resume uranium conversion work in defiance of an agreement with the eu-3 . during the tenure of former president mohammad khatami , zarif played an active role in efforts to improve iran 's foreign relations .
he was notably involved in closed-door talks with the united states in 2001 on the formation of a post-taliban government for afghanistan , followed by secret contacts prior to the us invasion of iraq . moderates worried the uncompromising stance of iran 's new hardline authorities in a stand-off over the country 's nuclear program is worrying some iranian officials and leading to overt criticism .
the issue is not whether or not the country should hang on to its nuclear program , but more on how the regime should go about it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani the first to speak out was defeated presidential contender akbar hashemi rafsanjani , who on friday appealed to hardliners to exercise restraint - notably when it came to their increasingly violent rhetoric . " it is about diplomacy rather than slogans , " the still-powerful cleric said in a sermon last week .
" it is about being reasonable , negotiating and being diplomatically active . "
he reminded his fellow iranians that the stakes are " very serious . " on tuesday moderate deputies in the iranian parliament also warned of the economic consequences of international isolation and sanctions , complaining the new nuclear team is " failing to respect national interests in their statements . " in an open letter , the minority group said iran was at a " sensitive stage " and noted the " freefall of the tehran stock exchange " where nuclear jitters are hitting investor confidence .
" sadly , the first action of the government was to change the nuclear negotiators and deprive itself of their experience and the trust they built up , " hassan afarideh , a moderate mp , said in parliament . " certain officials and negotiators keep using threatening and intimidating language .
it is clear we can not reach a result through diplomacy with this kind of language , " he said , taking a clear shot at larijani , who threatened to respond to last month 's tough resolution passed by the iaea by limiting inspections and resuming enrichment . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran wants nuclear talks beyond europe iran does not consider britain , france and germany to be the sole negotiating partners on its nuclear program and believes the process should be opened out beyond europe , the foreign ministry said sunday .

" but they said " personnel issues " must be decided before formal coalition negotiations could begin - officials from merkel 's christian democrats then revealed that the parties would sit down on thursday to begin talking through the high-stakes issue . a smiling merkel , who is bidding to become germany 's first woman chancellor , said after two and a half hours of talks with the social democrats : " i would say this was a rather good day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- chairwoman angela merkel , right , and bavarian governor edmund stoiber brief the media in berlin wednesday , oct .

" i feel more optimistic than pessimistic .
we had great success in agreeing on the content -lrb- of a program -rrb- ...
i see a possibility to form a coalition . " schröder agreed , telling reporters : " we have a strong basis for a grand coalition . " way forward the remarks soothed fears that the talks , a third round of exploratory negotiations after the parties finished just four seats apart in legislative elections , would flounder because of the row over who should lead a new government . merkel said the parties would try to cut a deal at a summit of party leaders . " we need to see if we have a basis of trust for coalition talks .
we must see if we can put together our respective households and part of this will be the issue of personnel , " merkel said . however schröder said that more government posts than just the chancellor 's job would have to be discussed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , and social democratic party chairman franz müntefering " i think it has become clear to the union -lrb- christian democrats -rrb- that one can not just settle one issue first , " he said . schröder and merkel have both staked a claim to the chancellery to lead the european union 's biggest country after the september 18 election failed to give either of their parties a governing majority . their only option now appears to join together in a " grand coalition " last seen in germany in the late 1960s . the conservatives have heaped pressure on schröder to back down because as the leader of the biggest parliamentary group , albeit by a hair 's breadth , merkel holds the mandate to form a government . high-stakes poker ? but many observers believe the charismatic chancellor , who has held the post for the past seven years , is playing a political poker game intended to secure the best possible coalition deal for his party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " how much is schröder worth ? " the daily bild asked on wednesday , adding that the social democrats wanted to " sell the chancellery for as much gain as possible . " a poll by the forsa research institute released on wednesday showed that public support for merkel as chancellor has grown , with 34 percent of people canvassed favoring her for the job , compared to 26 percent for schröder . merkel has however faced criticism within her own party by its poor showing at the polls in an election that had seemed hers to win on the back of popular discontent with rising unemployment and schröder 's reform program . on wednesday one of her main rivals within the christian democrats , her former economics strategist friedrich merz , said the fact that only 35.2 percent of voters cast their ballots for the conservatives showed that there was a " problem with the campaign and with the people at the top .

" but they said " personnel issues " must be decided before formal coalition negotiations could begin - officials from merkel 's christian democrats then revealed that the parties would sit down on thursday to begin talking through the high-stakes issue . a smiling merkel , who is bidding to become germany 's first woman chancellor , said after two and a half hours of talks with the social democrats : " i would say this was a rather good day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- chairwoman angela merkel , right , and bavarian governor edmund stoiber brief the media in berlin wednesday , oct .

" i feel more optimistic than pessimistic .
we had great success in agreeing on the content -lrb- of a program -rrb- ...
i see a possibility to form a coalition . " schröder agreed , telling reporters : " we have a strong basis for a grand coalition . " way forward the remarks soothed fears that the talks , a third round of exploratory negotiations after the parties finished just four seats apart in legislative elections , would flounder because of the row over who should lead a new government . merkel said the parties would try to cut a deal at a summit of party leaders . " we need to see if we have a basis of trust for coalition talks .
we must see if we can put together our respective households and part of this will be the issue of personnel , " merkel said . however schröder said that more government posts than just the chancellor 's job would have to be discussed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , and social democratic party chairman franz müntefering " i think it has become clear to the union -lrb- christian democrats -rrb- that one can not just settle one issue first , " he said . schröder and merkel have both staked a claim to the chancellery to lead the european union 's biggest country after the september 18 election failed to give either of their parties a governing majority . their only option now appears to join together in a " grand coalition " last seen in germany in the late 1960s . the conservatives have heaped pressure on schröder to back down because as the leader of the biggest parliamentary group , albeit by a hair 's breadth , merkel holds the mandate to form a government . high-stakes poker ? but many observers believe the charismatic chancellor , who has held the post for the past seven years , is playing a political poker game intended to secure the best possible coalition deal for his party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " how much is schröder worth ? " the daily bild asked on wednesday , adding that the social democrats wanted to " sell the chancellery for as much gain as possible . " a poll by the forsa research institute released on wednesday showed that public support for merkel as chancellor has grown , with 34 percent of people canvassed favoring her for the job , compared to 26 percent for schröder . merkel has however faced criticism within her own party by its poor showing at the polls in an election that had seemed hers to win on the back of popular discontent with rising unemployment and schröder 's reform program . on wednesday one of her main rivals within the christian democrats , her former economics strategist friedrich merz , said the fact that only 35.2 percent of voters cast their ballots for the conservatives showed that there was a " problem with the campaign and with the people at the top .

" we have a hiccup right now , " elbaradei , director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , said at a forum on nuclear safety issues in moscow .
" i am optimistic that in the coming months we will see a resumption of these negotiations .
we need to find a face-saving solution . " eu talks with tehran - spearheaded by the so-called eu-3 of britain , france and germany , as well as eu foreign policy chief javier solana - broke down in august after tehran resumed uranium conversion activities .
the united states claims these activities are a cover for developing nuclear weapons . last month the iaea threatened to refer tehran to the un security council over its nuclear program , but not before a november iaea meeting .
the european union has so far resisted calls for iran to be referred to the un , hoping to win pledges from tehran on its nuclear plans , in exchange for trade and other benefits . at wednesday 's forum in moscow , organized by the nuclear threat initiative , a us pressure group , elbaradei said that russia shared the same broad goals as other leading members of the international community as regards iran 's nuclear program .
washington has voiced worries about moscow 's building of the bushehr nuclear power plant in iran , suspecting that this could help tehran develop an offensive nuclear capacity . " i think everybody , russia included , agrees that nobody wants to see iran develop nuclear weapons .
on the strategic goal there is consensus , " elbaradei said .
" russia , like all other members , has been trying to see what is the best tactic to achieve that objective .
you have differences on the best tactics to be pursued , but that is democracy . " diplomat resigns meanwhile , one of iran 's most prominent diplomats , mohammad javad zarif , has resigned as a member of the country 's nuclear negotiating team , the official news agency irna reported wednesday . zarif , who is ambassador to the united nations , is widely considered a moderating influence over foreign policy and in favor of improving ties with the west .
the report , quoting an unidentified source , did not say why zarif quit the nuclear negotiating team , which has been almost totally changed following the june presidential election victory of hardliner mahmoud ahmadinejad . bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad leading negotiator hassan rowhani , also a moderate , was replaced by ultra-conservative ali larijani , who is seen as being at the opposite end of the regime 's political spectrum to diplomats like zarif . tensions with the west have also escalated after iran slammed the door on proposals from britain , france and germany that it abandon fuel-cycle technology in return for incentives , and decided to resume uranium conversion work in defiance of an agreement with the eu-3 . during the tenure of former president mohammad khatami , zarif played an active role in efforts to improve iran 's foreign relations .
he was notably involved in closed-door talks with the united states in 2001 on the formation of a post-taliban government for afghanistan , followed by secret contacts prior to the us invasion of iraq . moderates worried the uncompromising stance of iran 's new hardline authorities in a stand-off over the country 's nuclear program is worrying some iranian officials and leading to overt criticism .
the issue is not whether or not the country should hang on to its nuclear program , but more on how the regime should go about it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani the first to speak out was defeated presidential contender akbar hashemi rafsanjani , who on friday appealed to hardliners to exercise restraint - notably when it came to their increasingly violent rhetoric . " it is about diplomacy rather than slogans , " the still-powerful cleric said in a sermon last week .
" it is about being reasonable , negotiating and being diplomatically active . "
he reminded his fellow iranians that the stakes are " very serious . " on tuesday moderate deputies in the iranian parliament also warned of the economic consequences of international isolation and sanctions , complaining the new nuclear team is " failing to respect national interests in their statements .

" we have a hiccup right now , " elbaradei , director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , said at a forum on nuclear safety issues in moscow .
" i am optimistic that in the coming months we will see a resumption of these negotiations .
we need to find a face-saving solution . " eu talks with tehran - spearheaded by the so-called eu-3 of britain , france and germany , as well as eu foreign policy chief javier solana - broke down in august after tehran resumed uranium conversion activities .
the united states claims these activities are a cover for developing nuclear weapons . last month the iaea threatened to refer tehran to the un security council over its nuclear program , but not before a november iaea meeting .
the european union has so far resisted calls for iran to be referred to the un , hoping to win pledges from tehran on its nuclear plans , in exchange for trade and other benefits . at wednesday 's forum in moscow , organized by the nuclear threat initiative , a us pressure group , elbaradei said that russia shared the same broad goals as other leading members of the international community as regards iran 's nuclear program .
washington has voiced worries about moscow 's building of the bushehr nuclear power plant in iran , suspecting that this could help tehran develop an offensive nuclear capacity . " i think everybody , russia included , agrees that nobody wants to see iran develop nuclear weapons .
on the strategic goal there is consensus , " elbaradei said .
" russia , like all other members , has been trying to see what is the best tactic to achieve that objective .
you have differences on the best tactics to be pursued , but that is democracy . " diplomat resigns meanwhile , one of iran 's most prominent diplomats , mohammad javad zarif , has resigned as a member of the country 's nuclear negotiating team , the official news agency irna reported wednesday . zarif , who is ambassador to the united nations , is widely considered a moderating influence over foreign policy and in favor of improving ties with the west .
the report , quoting an unidentified source , did not say why zarif quit the nuclear negotiating team , which has been almost totally changed following the june presidential election victory of hardliner mahmoud ahmadinejad . bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad leading negotiator hassan rowhani , also a moderate , was replaced by ultra-conservative ali larijani , who is seen as being at the opposite end of the regime 's political spectrum to diplomats like zarif . tensions with the west have also escalated after iran slammed the door on proposals from britain , france and germany that it abandon fuel-cycle technology in return for incentives , and decided to resume uranium conversion work in defiance of an agreement with the eu-3 . during the tenure of former president mohammad khatami , zarif played an active role in efforts to improve iran 's foreign relations .
he was notably involved in closed-door talks with the united states in 2001 on the formation of a post-taliban government for afghanistan , followed by secret contacts prior to the us invasion of iraq . moderates worried the uncompromising stance of iran 's new hardline authorities in a stand-off over the country 's nuclear program is worrying some iranian officials and leading to overt criticism .
the issue is not whether or not the country should hang on to its nuclear program , but more on how the regime should go about it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani the first to speak out was defeated presidential contender akbar hashemi rafsanjani , who on friday appealed to hardliners to exercise restraint - notably when it came to their increasingly violent rhetoric .

" it is about being reasonable , negotiating and being diplomatically active . "
he reminded his fellow iranians that the stakes are " very serious . " on tuesday moderate deputies in the iranian parliament also warned of the economic consequences of international isolation and sanctions , complaining the new nuclear team is " failing to respect national interests in their statements .

tens of thousands flooded into the capital .
by the afternoon , hundreds of thousands of opposition supporters had gathered outside parliament , chanting death to milosevic and calling for kostunica to take power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic things came to a head when it emerged that milosevic -lrb- photo -rrb- had ordered the police to shoot into the crowd and the army to attack from the air - an order refused by generals and police officers .
only in front of parliament and the state television building was there shooting and tear gas used . milosevic exit a watershed serbian journalist dragan bujosevic , who was there , remembers the events vividly . " it was then i realized , woah , they really believe they could get killed today , " bujosevic said .
" part of the opposition certainly thought so . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the events of that momentous day spiraled out of control .
without informing the liberal-left majority of the opposition alliance , the nationalist-conservative kostunica -lrb- photo -rrb- met with milosevic .
a few hours later milosevic conceded live on state television . " i congratulate mr kostunica on his election victory and wish the citizens of yugoslavia much success during the new presidents mandate , " milosevic said . yet president kostunica soon fell out with the now reformist prime minister zoran djinjic .
he steadfastly refused djindjic ’ s wish to arrest milosevic and hand him over the war crimes tribunal in the hague . djinjic got his way in the end but lost the support of kostunica ’ s followers in parliament .
he accused them of lacking the will to make a clean break with the milosevic-era . " on oct .
6 , 2000 , i wanted to let every judge , policeman and state journalist go .
it ’ s no secret that i didn ’ t have a majority .
i ’ ve only rarely had a majority in this country , " djinjic said at the time . the power struggle hindered reforms that the country urgently needed after a decade of human rights violations , impoverishment and distrust . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic yugoslavia then became the federation of serbia-montenegro and kostunica lost his post .
and the governing coalition imploded in march 2003 when alleged war criminals assassinated djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- .
a year later kostunica was elected prime minister . more needs to be done since then kostunica has steered his country on the path to reform .
his greatest success came on monday this week , when the eu gave the green light to negotiations over a partnership with serbia-montenegro .
kostunica vowed to push through more reforms . " our laws must come into line with eu laws , the justice system needs to be strengthened and modernized , the constitution of serbia-montenegro needs to be adhered to and we need to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal in the hague , " he said . yet observers remain skeptical that , five years on , serbia is anywhere near having a stable democracy or a functional market economy .
many former colleagues accuse kostunica of corruption , failing to deal with the past and suppressing political opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic serbia also needs to hand in all fugitives suspected of committing war crimes , most importantly bosnian serb commander ratko mladic and his then political boss radovan karadzic -lrb- photo -rrb- to the hague tribunal before the country will earn the international community 's trust . " a balkan mindset " former justice minister vladan batic , one of kostunica ’ s loudest critics , blames the prime minister for blocking reforms . " only a few have been arrested , and it was kostunica who put the brakes on .
there ’ s no transparency to the state .
people were prepared to wait for a better standard of living , but they wanted justice , " batic said . last week batic himself was arrested for allegedly releasing a criminal involved in djindjic ’ s murder .
the case was dropped due to lack of evidence . serbia-montenegro human rights minister rasim ljajic told reuters in an interview recently that his country still had a long way to go . " we have an image problem , " ljajic said .
" the way to fix it is to show we can honor our commitments to the international community .

" but they said " personnel issues " must be decided before formal coalition negotiations could begin - officials from merkel 's christian democrats then revealed that the parties would sit down on thursday to begin talking through the high-stakes issue . a smiling merkel , who is bidding to become germany 's first woman chancellor , said after two and a half hours of talks with the social democrats : " i would say this was a rather good day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- chairwoman angela merkel , right , and bavarian governor edmund stoiber brief the media in berlin wednesday , oct .

" i feel more optimistic than pessimistic .
we had great success in agreeing on the content -lrb- of a program -rrb- ...
i see a possibility to form a coalition . " schröder agreed , telling reporters : " we have a strong basis for a grand coalition . " way forward the remarks soothed fears that the talks , a third round of exploratory negotiations after the parties finished just four seats apart in legislative elections , would flounder because of the row over who should lead a new government . merkel said the parties would try to cut a deal at a summit of party leaders . " we need to see if we have a basis of trust for coalition talks .
we must see if we can put together our respective households and part of this will be the issue of personnel , " merkel said . however schröder said that more government posts than just the chancellor 's job would have to be discussed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , and social democratic party chairman franz müntefering " i think it has become clear to the union -lrb- christian democrats -rrb- that one can not just settle one issue first , " he said . schröder and merkel have both staked a claim to the chancellery to lead the european union 's biggest country after the september 18 election failed to give either of their parties a governing majority . their only option now appears to join together in a " grand coalition " last seen in germany in the late 1960s . the conservatives have heaped pressure on schröder to back down because as the leader of the biggest parliamentary group , albeit by a hair 's breadth , merkel holds the mandate to form a government . high-stakes poker ? but many observers believe the charismatic chancellor , who has held the post for the past seven years , is playing a political poker game intended to secure the best possible coalition deal for his party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " how much is schröder worth ? " the daily bild asked on wednesday , adding that the social democrats wanted to " sell the chancellery for as much gain as possible . " a poll by the forsa research institute released on wednesday showed that public support for merkel as chancellor has grown , with 34 percent of people canvassed favoring her for the job , compared to 26 percent for schröder . merkel has however faced criticism within her own party by its poor showing at the polls in an election that had seemed hers to win on the back of popular discontent with rising unemployment and schröder 's reform program . on wednesday one of her main rivals within the christian democrats , her former economics strategist friedrich merz , said the fact that only 35.2 percent of voters cast their ballots for the conservatives showed that there was a " problem with the campaign and with the people at the top .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.10.2005 campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the campaign compares average citizens to famous germans after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .
but now leading german media organizations have launched a new initiative to help lift their spirits . in the largest public-service campaign in german history , 25 top media organizations last week started a 30-million-euro -lrb- $ 35.7-million -rrb- advertising barrage called " you are germany " to help raise the spirits of the country 's 82 million citizens . amounting to a five-month nationwide pep talk , the initiative 's organizers will blanket the airwaves and fill newspapers , magazines and billboards with the message that germans need to be more optimistic about their country 's prospects despite high unemployment , weak growth and a muddled political situation . " germany makes itself out to be worse than it is , " bernd kundrun , board member of german media giant bertelsmann , said while announcing the new campaign in september .
" we want to do something about that with this unique joint effort by encouraging a change in consciousness towards more self-confidence and motivation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " du bist deutschland " albert einstein ad .
the broad media alliance - which is donating airtime and page space - has recruited an impressive cross-section of german society for the campaign .
besides including currently well-known personalities such as national soccer team goalkeeper oliver kahn and literary critic marcel reich-ranicki , it will also feature historical figures like beethoven and albert einstein .
whether on tv , in print or on the internet , all of the advertisements try to inspire germans to take a personal stake in getting germany back on track . doom and gloom but lifting the doom and gloom that have dominated the german public mood for years could be a tall order .
a record 5 million people are jobless in europe 's largest economy and recent surveys have shown that many germans remain fearful of the future . the sept .
18 general election has n't helped either .
the vote produced an inconclusive hung result that has both chancellor gerhard schröder and the leader of the conservative opposition , angela merkel , claiming the right to lead the country for the next four years . jo groebel , a psychologist and director of düsseldorf-based european institute for the media , praised the new initiative for attempting to shake the country out of its current self-pitying torpor , but said the roots of the german crisis of confidence went deep . " germans have been lurching from one identity crisis to another for the past 150 years , " groebel said , pointing out that oct .
3 marked 15 years since german reunification .
" it 's true germans tend to yearn for stability , but that 's because they have n't had it .
the economic problems like large unemployment have only added to the fears that everything could collapse . " to some extent , german worries are overblown .
germany is still the world 's leading exporter and the country continues to offer its citizens an extremely comfortable standard of living .
but as globalization has threatened high-paying german jobs and the government has been forced to trim extremely generous welfare benefits , complaining has become something of a national pastime . change of mentality though the organizers have no illusions that the television and print ads alone can end germany 's malaise , they hope their efforts will foster the kind of can-do mentality that helped the country tackle the far greater challenge of rebuilding after world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ard tv newscaster ulrich wickert .
in one tv spot , ulrich wickert , one of germany 's leading newscasters , even borrows a famous line from former us president john f. kennedy : " ask not what your country can do for you , but what you can do for your country . " all major public and private broadcasters simultaneously televised that first public service announcement on sept .
26 , reaching an estimated audience of 17 million .
but some german observers remain skeptical about whether it all will soothe the nation 's soul .
" it 's hard to say whether this initiative will mobilize people , " wrote dresden 's sächsische zeitung newspaper in an editorial .
" of course something has to change .
but the country 's economic situation has something to do with the miserable mood - whoever thinks the world will end tomorrow is n't about to spend a lot of money at a hardware store today . " marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berliners get the blues a new report shows that not only is depression on the rise in germany , but berliners are the most miserable of all .
is it something in the water , or are they simply more open about their feelings ?
-lrb- april 14 , 2005 -rrb- nothing ventured , nothing gained as germany tries to find its way out of the stubborn quagmire of high unemployment , many of those affected are more concerned with slinging the mud of blame than they are with changing the course of their own fates .

following the steep ascent of gasoline and natural gas , it looks as if germans will now also be hit by climbing electricity costs . just as motorists are facing record prices at the pump and homeowners are receiving inflated gas bills , the next bit of bad news for german consumers rolls in . on tuesday , germany 's two largest energy companies , rwe and e.on , said they wanted to hike electricity prices by a reported 5 or 6 percent starting next year .
the utilities justified the higher costs with increasing wholesale prices , expenses from renewable sources and greater demand . the move was instantly criticized by consumer watchdog groups . " i have the impression that the energy companies are using the current political vacuum , " german consumer protection association spokesman carel mohn told the dpa news agency , referring to political stalemate in berlin following last month 's election .
" there is no other sector that constantly makes such above-average profits .
that shows that competition still is n't working . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe spokesman wolfgang schley said in dortmund on tuesday that prices on the leipzig eex electricity market jumped around 30 percent in the first six months of the year and that politicial scrutiny politicians , aware that germans are fed-up with rising energy costs have also rushed to condemn the utilities .
economics minister wolfgang clement on tuesday called on state officials to check carefully whether higher electricity prices are warranted . " these price hikes are politically impossible to communicate , " hesse state economics minister alois rhiel told the süddeutsche zeitung .
" therefore i will be especially critical when looking at the petitions . " the decision to push for a rate hike could be undercut by the fact that germany 's third and fourth largest electricity utilities - vattenfall and enbw respectively - were not planning to raise prices in january . renewables not to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an official for a renewable energy association said such energy sources , wind power , for example , could not be held accountable for increasing prices .
" it 's wrong and brazen from rwe and e.on to associate the hikes in electricity costs with renewables , " said milan nitzschke from the federal association for renewable energy . the electricity news is sure to encourage even more germans to seek alternative energy sources .
following the recent surge in the cost of natural gas and oil , some are hoping a cozy fire could meet their energy needs .
but even that is costing more than it used to . " a lot of people want to heat with wood again , " schmallenberg forestry official adalbert koch told dpa , explaining that firewood had become as much as 40 percent more expensive this year . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's " electricity rebels " germany 's reputation for environmental friendliness may have found its expression in the black forest citizens ' initiative that won a david and goliath battle against the local electricity provider .

today , he can take much of the credit for the popularity of the new leipzig school , which has put germany in the international vanguard of fashionable painting . it might be a key date in german history , but oct .
3 , 1990 was a day like any other to gerd harry lybke .
born in 1961 , he 'd been running the leipzig gallery " eigen + art " since 1983 , and did n't necessarily see the west as a land of opportunities . " unification was something i experienced very much from a distance , " he said .
" it was n't obvious what one was supposed to do with it .
and i was n't the sort of person who expected to be welcomed with open arms in the west . " east german repression his checkered career in the gdr had taught lybke not to take anything for granted .
his original career ambition was to be an astronaut , but when he refused an opportunity to study in the soviet union , the communist regime barred him from public service . lybke 's first foray into the art world was as a model for students at the leipzig art school , work not officially recognized by the state .
after getting to know a number of artists , he began organizing private exhibitions in 1983 in his own apartment - an illegal practice which soon brought him to the attention of the east german authorities . " it was bad news , " he said .
" i was n't allowed to study , and my plan to become an actor was nipped in the bud .
there was n't much i was allowed to do . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lybke , right , and his assistant by the time lybke had been " rehabilitated " in 1990 , the berlin wall had fallen and the " eigen + art " gallery in leipzig , which had begun in his front room , had become an integral part of east germany 's subculture .
it had a reputation that had long reached the attention of the west german art scene . international impresario after opening a second branch of the gallery in berlin 's rapidly gentrifying mitte district in 1992 , lybke , the first private gallery owner from the former east to set up shop in the reunited city , went on to foster dozens of fledgling artists , propelling berlin to a secure place on the international art map . berlin might have been an unparalleled business opportunity after unification , but lybke kept his eye on the ball and realized that the real creative potential was back in leipzig . while the new german capital basked in its post-unification glory as a hotbed of burgeoning talent , by the mid 1990s the most exciting art action was unfolding several hundred kilometers east in leipzig , and lybke was playing the role of impresario . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : painting by neo rauch these days , the artists spawned by leipzig 's art school - including neo rauch -lrb- photo -rrb- , martin eder and carsten nicolai - can command prices up to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 60,000 -rrb- , and the man doing the selling is usually lybke . " leipzig has become one of the main hubs for contemporary art , " he said .

" but they said " personnel issues " must be decided before formal coalition negotiations could begin - officials from merkel 's christian democrats then revealed that the parties would sit down on thursday to begin talking through the high-stakes issue . a smiling merkel , who is bidding to become germany 's first woman chancellor , said after two and a half hours of talks with the social democrats : " i would say this was a rather good day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- chairwoman angela merkel , right , and bavarian governor edmund stoiber brief the media in berlin wednesday , oct .
5 , 2005 , about talks with the social democrat 's -lrb- spd -rrb- about a possible left-right coalition .
" i feel more optimistic than pessimistic .
we had great success in agreeing on the content -lrb- of a program -rrb- ...
i see a possibility to form a coalition . " schröder agreed , telling reporters : " we have a strong basis for a grand coalition . " way forward the remarks soothed fears that the talks , a third round of exploratory negotiations after the parties finished just four seats apart in legislative elections , would flounder because of the row over who should lead a new government . merkel said the parties would try to cut a deal at a summit of party leaders . " we need to see if we have a basis of trust for coalition talks .
we must see if we can put together our respective households and part of this will be the issue of personnel , " merkel said . however schröder said that more government posts than just the chancellor 's job would have to be discussed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , and social democratic party chairman franz müntefering " i think it has become clear to the union -lrb- christian democrats -rrb- that one can not just settle one issue first , " he said . schröder and merkel have both staked a claim to the chancellery to lead the european union 's biggest country after the september 18 election failed to give either of their parties a governing majority . their only option now appears to join together in a " grand coalition " last seen in germany in the late 1960s . the conservatives have heaped pressure on schröder to back down because as the leader of the biggest parliamentary group , albeit by a hair 's breadth , merkel holds the mandate to form a government . high-stakes poker ? but many observers believe the charismatic chancellor , who has held the post for the past seven years , is playing a political poker game intended to secure the best possible coalition deal for his party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " how much is schröder worth ? " the daily bild asked on wednesday , adding that the social democrats wanted to " sell the chancellery for as much gain as possible . " a poll by the forsa research institute released on wednesday showed that public support for merkel as chancellor has grown , with 34 percent of people canvassed favoring her for the job , compared to 26 percent for schröder . merkel has however faced criticism within her own party by its poor showing at the polls in an election that had seemed hers to win on the back of popular discontent with rising unemployment and schröder 's reform program . on wednesday one of her main rivals within the christian democrats , her former economics strategist friedrich merz , said the fact that only 35.2 percent of voters cast their ballots for the conservatives showed that there was a " problem with the campaign and with the people at the top . " dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder hints he could bow out chancellor gerhard schröder said on monday that he would be prepared to step aside in the interest of forming a stable coalition with the conservatives .
but his party said it still wanted a third term for him .

" we have a hiccup right now , " elbaradei , director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , said at a forum on nuclear safety issues in moscow .
" i am optimistic that in the coming months we will see a resumption of these negotiations .
we need to find a face-saving solution . " eu talks with tehran - spearheaded by the so-called eu-3 of britain , france and germany , as well as eu foreign policy chief javier solana - broke down in august after tehran resumed uranium conversion activities .
the united states claims these activities are a cover for developing nuclear weapons . last month the iaea threatened to refer tehran to the un security council over its nuclear program , but not before a november iaea meeting .
the european union has so far resisted calls for iran to be referred to the un , hoping to win pledges from tehran on its nuclear plans , in exchange for trade and other benefits . at wednesday 's forum in moscow , organized by the nuclear threat initiative , a us pressure group , elbaradei said that russia shared the same broad goals as other leading members of the international community as regards iran 's nuclear program .
washington has voiced worries about moscow 's building of the bushehr nuclear power plant in iran , suspecting that this could help tehran develop an offensive nuclear capacity . " i think everybody , russia included , agrees that nobody wants to see iran develop nuclear weapons .
on the strategic goal there is consensus , " elbaradei said .
" russia , like all other members , has been trying to see what is the best tactic to achieve that objective .
you have differences on the best tactics to be pursued , but that is democracy . " diplomat resigns meanwhile , one of iran 's most prominent diplomats , mohammad javad zarif , has resigned as a member of the country 's nuclear negotiating team , the official news agency irna reported wednesday . zarif , who is ambassador to the united nations , is widely considered a moderating influence over foreign policy and in favor of improving ties with the west .
the report , quoting an unidentified source , did not say why zarif quit the nuclear negotiating team , which has been almost totally changed following the june presidential election victory of hardliner mahmoud ahmadinejad . bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad leading negotiator hassan rowhani , also a moderate , was replaced by ultra-conservative ali larijani , who is seen as being at the opposite end of the regime 's political spectrum to diplomats like zarif . tensions with the west have also escalated after iran slammed the door on proposals from britain , france and germany that it abandon fuel-cycle technology in return for incentives , and decided to resume uranium conversion work in defiance of an agreement with the eu-3 . during the tenure of former president mohammad khatami , zarif played an active role in efforts to improve iran 's foreign relations .
he was notably involved in closed-door talks with the united states in 2001 on the formation of a post-taliban government for afghanistan , followed by secret contacts prior to the us invasion of iraq . moderates worried the uncompromising stance of iran 's new hardline authorities in a stand-off over the country 's nuclear program is worrying some iranian officials and leading to overt criticism .
the issue is not whether or not the country should hang on to its nuclear program , but more on how the regime should go about it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani the first to speak out was defeated presidential contender akbar hashemi rafsanjani , who on friday appealed to hardliners to exercise restraint - notably when it came to their increasingly violent rhetoric . " it is about diplomacy rather than slogans , " the still-powerful cleric said in a sermon last week .
" it is about being reasonable , negotiating and being diplomatically active . "
he reminded his fellow iranians that the stakes are " very serious . " on tuesday moderate deputies in the iranian parliament also warned of the economic consequences of international isolation and sanctions , complaining the new nuclear team is " failing to respect national interests in their statements . " in an open letter , the minority group said iran was at a " sensitive stage " and noted the " freefall of the tehran stock exchange " where nuclear jitters are hitting investor confidence .
" sadly , the first action of the government was to change the nuclear negotiators and deprive itself of their experience and the trust they built up , " hassan afarideh , a moderate mp , said in parliament . " certain officials and negotiators keep using threatening and intimidating language .
it is clear we can not reach a result through diplomacy with this kind of language , " he said , taking a clear shot at larijani , who threatened to respond to last month 's tough resolution passed by the iaea by limiting inspections and resuming enrichment . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran wants nuclear talks beyond europe iran does not consider britain , france and germany to be the sole negotiating partners on its nuclear program and believes the process should be opened out beyond europe , the foreign ministry said sunday .

he was notably involved in closed-door talks with the united states in 2001 on the formation of a post-taliban government for afghanistan , followed by secret contacts prior to the us invasion of iraq . moderates worried the uncompromising stance of iran 's new hardline authorities in a stand-off over the country 's nuclear program is worrying some iranian officials and leading to overt criticism .
the issue is not whether or not the country should hang on to its nuclear program , but more on how the regime should go about it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani the first to speak out was defeated presidential contender akbar hashemi rafsanjani , who on friday appealed to hardliners to exercise restraint - notably when it came to their increasingly violent rhetoric .

" we have a hiccup right now , " elbaradei , director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , said at a forum on nuclear safety issues in moscow .
" i am optimistic that in the coming months we will see a resumption of these negotiations .
we need to find a face-saving solution . " eu talks with tehran - spearheaded by the so-called eu-3 of britain , france and germany , as well as eu foreign policy chief javier solana - broke down in august after tehran resumed uranium conversion activities .
the united states claims these activities are a cover for developing nuclear weapons . last month the iaea threatened to refer tehran to the un security council over its nuclear program , but not before a november iaea meeting .
the european union has so far resisted calls for iran to be referred to the un , hoping to win pledges from tehran on its nuclear plans , in exchange for trade and other benefits . at wednesday 's forum in moscow , organized by the nuclear threat initiative , a us pressure group , elbaradei said that russia shared the same broad goals as other leading members of the international community as regards iran 's nuclear program .
washington has voiced worries about moscow 's building of the bushehr nuclear power plant in iran , suspecting that this could help tehran develop an offensive nuclear capacity . " i think everybody , russia included , agrees that nobody wants to see iran develop nuclear weapons .
on the strategic goal there is consensus , " elbaradei said .
" russia , like all other members , has been trying to see what is the best tactic to achieve that objective .
you have differences on the best tactics to be pursued , but that is democracy . " diplomat resigns meanwhile , one of iran 's most prominent diplomats , mohammad javad zarif , has resigned as a member of the country 's nuclear negotiating team , the official news agency irna reported wednesday . zarif , who is ambassador to the united nations , is widely considered a moderating influence over foreign policy and in favor of improving ties with the west .

today , he can take much of the credit for the popularity of the new leipzig school , which has put germany in the international vanguard of fashionable painting . it might be a key date in german history , but oct .
3 , 1990 was a day like any other to gerd harry lybke .
born in 1961 , he 'd been running the leipzig gallery " eigen + art " since 1983 , and did n't necessarily see the west as a land of opportunities . " unification was something i experienced very much from a distance , " he said .
" it was n't obvious what one was supposed to do with it .
and i was n't the sort of person who expected to be welcomed with open arms in the west . " east german repression his checkered career in the gdr had taught lybke not to take anything for granted .
his original career ambition was to be an astronaut , but when he refused an opportunity to study in the soviet union , the communist regime barred him from public service . lybke 's first foray into the art world was as a model for students at the leipzig art school , work not officially recognized by the state .
after getting to know a number of artists , he began organizing private exhibitions in 1983 in his own apartment - an illegal practice which soon brought him to the attention of the east german authorities . " it was bad news , " he said .
" i was n't allowed to study , and my plan to become an actor was nipped in the bud .
there was n't much i was allowed to do . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lybke , right , and his assistant by the time lybke had been " rehabilitated " in 1990 , the berlin wall had fallen and the " eigen + art " gallery in leipzig , which had begun in his front room , had become an integral part of east germany 's subculture .
it had a reputation that had long reached the attention of the west german art scene . international impresario after opening a second branch of the gallery in berlin 's rapidly gentrifying mitte district in 1992 , lybke , the first private gallery owner from the former east to set up shop in the reunited city , went on to foster dozens of fledgling artists , propelling berlin to a secure place on the international art map . berlin might have been an unparalleled business opportunity after unification , but lybke kept his eye on the ball and realized that the real creative potential was back in leipzig . while the new german capital basked in its post-unification glory as a hotbed of burgeoning talent , by the mid 1990s the most exciting art action was unfolding several hundred kilometers east in leipzig , and lybke was playing the role of impresario . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : painting by neo rauch these days , the artists spawned by leipzig 's art school - including neo rauch -lrb- photo -rrb- , martin eder and carsten nicolai - can command prices up to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 60,000 -rrb- , and the man doing the selling is usually lybke . " leipzig has become one of the main hubs for contemporary art , " he said .

" but they said " personnel issues " must be decided before formal coalition negotiations could begin - officials from merkel 's christian democrats then revealed that the parties would sit down on thursday to begin talking through the high-stakes issue . a smiling merkel , who is bidding to become germany 's first woman chancellor , said after two and a half hours of talks with the social democrats : " i would say this was a rather good day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- chairwoman angela merkel , right , and bavarian governor edmund stoiber brief the media in berlin wednesday , oct .

" i feel more optimistic than pessimistic .
we had great success in agreeing on the content -lrb- of a program -rrb- ...
i see a possibility to form a coalition . " schröder agreed , telling reporters : " we have a strong basis for a grand coalition . " way forward the remarks soothed fears that the talks , a third round of exploratory negotiations after the parties finished just four seats apart in legislative elections , would flounder because of the row over who should lead a new government . merkel said the parties would try to cut a deal at a summit of party leaders . " we need to see if we have a basis of trust for coalition talks .
we must see if we can put together our respective households and part of this will be the issue of personnel , " merkel said . however schröder said that more government posts than just the chancellor 's job would have to be discussed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , and social democratic party chairman franz müntefering " i think it has become clear to the union -lrb- christian democrats -rrb- that one can not just settle one issue first , " he said . schröder and merkel have both staked a claim to the chancellery to lead the european union 's biggest country after the september 18 election failed to give either of their parties a governing majority . their only option now appears to join together in a " grand coalition " last seen in germany in the late 1960s . the conservatives have heaped pressure on schröder to back down because as the leader of the biggest parliamentary group , albeit by a hair 's breadth , merkel holds the mandate to form a government . high-stakes poker ? but many observers believe the charismatic chancellor , who has held the post for the past seven years , is playing a political poker game intended to secure the best possible coalition deal for his party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " how much is schröder worth ? " the daily bild asked on wednesday , adding that the social democrats wanted to " sell the chancellery for as much gain as possible . " a poll by the forsa research institute released on wednesday showed that public support for merkel as chancellor has grown , with 34 percent of people canvassed favoring her for the job , compared to 26 percent for schröder . merkel has however faced criticism within her own party by its poor showing at the polls in an election that had seemed hers to win on the back of popular discontent with rising unemployment and schröder 's reform program . on wednesday one of her main rivals within the christian democrats , her former economics strategist friedrich merz , said the fact that only 35.2 percent of voters cast their ballots for the conservatives showed that there was a " problem with the campaign and with the people at the top .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.10.2005 after milosevic , serbia struggles to reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the anniversary of milosevic 's ousting attracts crowds each year on wednesday , belgrade marks the fifth anniversary of the protests that drove slobodan milosevic from office and ended a decade of violence .
but democratic and economic reforms have made slow progress since then . yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic wasn ’ t going to go without a fight , even when it was clear that vojislav kostunica , the candidate from the 18-party alliance , the serbian democratic opposition , had surprisingly won the 2000 presidential election . opposition leader zoran djindjic and the optor student movement then organized nationwide strikes .
a mass demonstration was organized for oct .
5 in belgrade .
tens of thousands flooded into the capital .
by the afternoon , hundreds of thousands of opposition supporters had gathered outside parliament , chanting death to milosevic and calling for kostunica to take power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic things came to a head when it emerged that milosevic -lrb- photo -rrb- had ordered the police to shoot into the crowd and the army to attack from the air - an order refused by generals and police officers .
only in front of parliament and the state television building was there shooting and tear gas used . milosevic exit a watershed serbian journalist dragan bujosevic , who was there , remembers the events vividly . " it was then i realized , woah , they really believe they could get killed today , " bujosevic said .
" part of the opposition certainly thought so . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the events of that momentous day spiraled out of control .
without informing the liberal-left majority of the opposition alliance , the nationalist-conservative kostunica -lrb- photo -rrb- met with milosevic .
a few hours later milosevic conceded live on state television . " i congratulate mr kostunica on his election victory and wish the citizens of yugoslavia much success during the new presidents mandate , " milosevic said . yet president kostunica soon fell out with the now reformist prime minister zoran djinjic .
he steadfastly refused djindjic ’ s wish to arrest milosevic and hand him over the war crimes tribunal in the hague . djinjic got his way in the end but lost the support of kostunica ’ s followers in parliament .
he accused them of lacking the will to make a clean break with the milosevic-era . " on oct .
6 , 2000 , i wanted to let every judge , policeman and state journalist go .
it ’ s no secret that i didn ’ t have a majority .
i ’ ve only rarely had a majority in this country , " djinjic said at the time . the power struggle hindered reforms that the country urgently needed after a decade of human rights violations , impoverishment and distrust . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic yugoslavia then became the federation of serbia-montenegro and kostunica lost his post .
and the governing coalition imploded in march 2003 when alleged war criminals assassinated djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- .
a year later kostunica was elected prime minister . more needs to be done since then kostunica has steered his country on the path to reform .
his greatest success came on monday this week , when the eu gave the green light to negotiations over a partnership with serbia-montenegro .
kostunica vowed to push through more reforms . " our laws must come into line with eu laws , the justice system needs to be strengthened and modernized , the constitution of serbia-montenegro needs to be adhered to and we need to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal in the hague , " he said . yet observers remain skeptical that , five years on , serbia is anywhere near having a stable democracy or a functional market economy .
many former colleagues accuse kostunica of corruption , failing to deal with the past and suppressing political opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic serbia also needs to hand in all fugitives suspected of committing war crimes , most importantly bosnian serb commander ratko mladic and his then political boss radovan karadzic -lrb- photo -rrb- to the hague tribunal before the country will earn the international community 's trust . " a balkan mindset " former justice minister vladan batic , one of kostunica ’ s loudest critics , blames the prime minister for blocking reforms . " only a few have been arrested , and it was kostunica who put the brakes on .
there ’ s no transparency to the state .
people were prepared to wait for a better standard of living , but they wanted justice , " batic said . last week batic himself was arrested for allegedly releasing a criminal involved in djindjic ’ s murder .
the case was dropped due to lack of evidence . serbia-montenegro human rights minister rasim ljajic told reuters in an interview recently that his country still had a long way to go . " we have an image problem , " ljajic said .
" the way to fix it is to show we can honor our commitments to the international community .
we ca n't ask to play in the european league with a balkan mindset , we must accept the rules of the game .

but democratic and economic reforms have made slow progress since then . yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic wasn ’ t going to go without a fight , even when it was clear that vojislav kostunica , the candidate from the 18-party alliance , the serbian democratic opposition , had surprisingly won the 2000 presidential election . opposition leader zoran djindjic and the optor student movement then organized nationwide strikes .
a mass demonstration was organized for oct .
5 in belgrade .
tens of thousands flooded into the capital .
by the afternoon , hundreds of thousands of opposition supporters had gathered outside parliament , chanting death to milosevic and calling for kostunica to take power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic things came to a head when it emerged that milosevic -lrb- photo -rrb- had ordered the police to shoot into the crowd and the army to attack from the air - an order refused by generals and police officers .
only in front of parliament and the state television building was there shooting and tear gas used . milosevic exit a watershed serbian journalist dragan bujosevic , who was there , remembers the events vividly . " it was then i realized , woah , they really believe they could get killed today , " bujosevic said .
" part of the opposition certainly thought so . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the events of that momentous day spiraled out of control .
without informing the liberal-left majority of the opposition alliance , the nationalist-conservative kostunica -lrb- photo -rrb- met with milosevic .
a few hours later milosevic conceded live on state television . " i congratulate mr kostunica on his election victory and wish the citizens of yugoslavia much success during the new presidents mandate , " milosevic said . yet president kostunica soon fell out with the now reformist prime minister zoran djinjic .
he steadfastly refused djindjic ’ s wish to arrest milosevic and hand him over the war crimes tribunal in the hague . djinjic got his way in the end but lost the support of kostunica ’ s followers in parliament .
he accused them of lacking the will to make a clean break with the milosevic-era . " on oct .
6 , 2000 , i wanted to let every judge , policeman and state journalist go .
it ’ s no secret that i didn ’ t have a majority .
i ’ ve only rarely had a majority in this country , " djinjic said at the time . the power struggle hindered reforms that the country urgently needed after a decade of human rights violations , impoverishment and distrust . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic yugoslavia then became the federation of serbia-montenegro and kostunica lost his post .
and the governing coalition imploded in march 2003 when alleged war criminals assassinated djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- .
a year later kostunica was elected prime minister . more needs to be done since then kostunica has steered his country on the path to reform .
his greatest success came on monday this week , when the eu gave the green light to negotiations over a partnership with serbia-montenegro .
kostunica vowed to push through more reforms . " our laws must come into line with eu laws , the justice system needs to be strengthened and modernized , the constitution of serbia-montenegro needs to be adhered to and we need to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal in the hague , " he said . yet observers remain skeptical that , five years on , serbia is anywhere near having a stable democracy or a functional market economy .
many former colleagues accuse kostunica of corruption , failing to deal with the past and suppressing political opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic serbia also needs to hand in all fugitives suspected of committing war crimes , most importantly bosnian serb commander ratko mladic and his then political boss radovan karadzic -lrb- photo -rrb- to the hague tribunal before the country will earn the international community 's trust . " a balkan mindset " former justice minister vladan batic , one of kostunica ’ s loudest critics , blames the prime minister for blocking reforms . " only a few have been arrested , and it was kostunica who put the brakes on .
there ’ s no transparency to the state .
people were prepared to wait for a better standard of living , but they wanted justice , " batic said . last week batic himself was arrested for allegedly releasing a criminal involved in djindjic ’ s murder .
the case was dropped due to lack of evidence . serbia-montenegro human rights minister rasim ljajic told reuters in an interview recently that his country still had a long way to go . " we have an image problem , " ljajic said .
" the way to fix it is to show we can honor our commitments to the international community .
we ca n't ask to play in the european league with a balkan mindset , we must accept the rules of the game .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.10.2005 campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the campaign compares average citizens to famous germans after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .
but now leading german media organizations have launched a new initiative to help lift their spirits . in the largest public-service campaign in german history , 25 top media organizations last week started a 30-million-euro -lrb- $ 35.7-million -rrb- advertising barrage called " you are germany " to help raise the spirits of the country 's 82 million citizens . amounting to a five-month nationwide pep talk , the initiative 's organizers will blanket the airwaves and fill newspapers , magazines and billboards with the message that germans need to be more optimistic about their country 's prospects despite high unemployment , weak growth and a muddled political situation . " germany makes itself out to be worse than it is , " bernd kundrun , board member of german media giant bertelsmann , said while announcing the new campaign in september .
" we want to do something about that with this unique joint effort by encouraging a change in consciousness towards more self-confidence and motivation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " du bist deutschland " albert einstein ad .
the broad media alliance - which is donating airtime and page space - has recruited an impressive cross-section of german society for the campaign .
besides including currently well-known personalities such as national soccer team goalkeeper oliver kahn and literary critic marcel reich-ranicki , it will also feature historical figures like beethoven and albert einstein .
whether on tv , in print or on the internet , all of the advertisements try to inspire germans to take a personal stake in getting germany back on track . doom and gloom but lifting the doom and gloom that have dominated the german public mood for years could be a tall order .
a record 5 million people are jobless in europe 's largest economy and recent surveys have shown that many germans remain fearful of the future . the sept .
18 general election has n't helped either .
the vote produced an inconclusive hung result that has both chancellor gerhard schröder and the leader of the conservative opposition , angela merkel , claiming the right to lead the country for the next four years . jo groebel , a psychologist and director of düsseldorf-based european institute for the media , praised the new initiative for attempting to shake the country out of its current self-pitying torpor , but said the roots of the german crisis of confidence went deep . " germans have been lurching from one identity crisis to another for the past 150 years , " groebel said , pointing out that oct .
3 marked 15 years since german reunification .
" it 's true germans tend to yearn for stability , but that 's because they have n't had it .
the economic problems like large unemployment have only added to the fears that everything could collapse . " to some extent , german worries are overblown .
germany is still the world 's leading exporter and the country continues to offer its citizens an extremely comfortable standard of living .
but as globalization has threatened high-paying german jobs and the government has been forced to trim extremely generous welfare benefits , complaining has become something of a national pastime . change of mentality though the organizers have no illusions that the television and print ads alone can end germany 's malaise , they hope their efforts will foster the kind of can-do mentality that helped the country tackle the far greater challenge of rebuilding after world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ard tv newscaster ulrich wickert .
in one tv spot , ulrich wickert , one of germany 's leading newscasters , even borrows a famous line from former us president john f. kennedy : " ask not what your country can do for you , but what you can do for your country . " all major public and private broadcasters simultaneously televised that first public service announcement on sept .
26 , reaching an estimated audience of 17 million .
but some german observers remain skeptical about whether it all will soothe the nation 's soul .
" it 's hard to say whether this initiative will mobilize people , " wrote dresden 's sächsische zeitung newspaper in an editorial .
" of course something has to change .
but the country 's economic situation has something to do with the miserable mood - whoever thinks the world will end tomorrow is n't about to spend a lot of money at a hardware store today . " marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berliners get the blues a new report shows that not only is depression on the rise in germany , but berliners are the most miserable of all .
is it something in the water , or are they simply more open about their feelings ?
-lrb- april 14 , 2005 -rrb- nothing ventured , nothing gained as germany tries to find its way out of the stubborn quagmire of high unemployment , many of those affected are more concerned with slinging the mud of blame than they are with changing the course of their own fates .
-lrb- march 16 , 2005 -rrb- the german fear of reform germany might be in the middle of a deep economic crisis , but the country 's high unemployment and weak growth are probably the best things ever to happen to angela merkel 's career .

it had a reputation that had long reached the attention of the west german art scene . international impresario after opening a second branch of the gallery in berlin 's rapidly gentrifying mitte district in 1992 , lybke , the first private gallery owner from the former east to set up shop in the reunited city , went on to foster dozens of fledgling artists , propelling berlin to a secure place on the international art map . berlin might have been an unparalleled business opportunity after unification , but lybke kept his eye on the ball and realized that the real creative potential was back in leipzig . while the new german capital basked in its post-unification glory as a hotbed of burgeoning talent , by the mid 1990s the most exciting art action was unfolding several hundred kilometers east in leipzig , and lybke was playing the role of impresario . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : painting by neo rauch these days , the artists spawned by leipzig 's art school - including neo rauch -lrb- photo -rrb- , martin eder and carsten nicolai - can command prices up to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 60,000 -rrb- , and the man doing the selling is usually lybke .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.10.2005 campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the campaign compares average citizens to famous germans after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .
but now leading german media organizations have launched a new initiative to help lift their spirits . in the largest public-service campaign in german history , 25 top media organizations last week started a 30-million-euro -lrb- $ 35.7-million -rrb- advertising barrage called " you are germany " to help raise the spirits of the country 's 82 million citizens . amounting to a five-month nationwide pep talk , the initiative 's organizers will blanket the airwaves and fill newspapers , magazines and billboards with the message that germans need to be more optimistic about their country 's prospects despite high unemployment , weak growth and a muddled political situation . " germany makes itself out to be worse than it is , " bernd kundrun , board member of german media giant bertelsmann , said while announcing the new campaign in september .
" we want to do something about that with this unique joint effort by encouraging a change in consciousness towards more self-confidence and motivation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " du bist deutschland " albert einstein ad .
the broad media alliance - which is donating airtime and page space - has recruited an impressive cross-section of german society for the campaign .
besides including currently well-known personalities such as national soccer team goalkeeper oliver kahn and literary critic marcel reich-ranicki , it will also feature historical figures like beethoven and albert einstein .
whether on tv , in print or on the internet , all of the advertisements try to inspire germans to take a personal stake in getting germany back on track . doom and gloom but lifting the doom and gloom that have dominated the german public mood for years could be a tall order .
a record 5 million people are jobless in europe 's largest economy and recent surveys have shown that many germans remain fearful of the future . the sept .
18 general election has n't helped either .
the vote produced an inconclusive hung result that has both chancellor gerhard schröder and the leader of the conservative opposition , angela merkel , claiming the right to lead the country for the next four years . jo groebel , a psychologist and director of düsseldorf-based european institute for the media , praised the new initiative for attempting to shake the country out of its current self-pitying torpor , but said the roots of the german crisis of confidence went deep . " germans have been lurching from one identity crisis to another for the past 150 years , " groebel said , pointing out that oct .
3 marked 15 years since german reunification .
" it 's true germans tend to yearn for stability , but that 's because they have n't had it .
the economic problems like large unemployment have only added to the fears that everything could collapse . " to some extent , german worries are overblown .
germany is still the world 's leading exporter and the country continues to offer its citizens an extremely comfortable standard of living .
but as globalization has threatened high-paying german jobs and the government has been forced to trim extremely generous welfare benefits , complaining has become something of a national pastime . change of mentality though the organizers have no illusions that the television and print ads alone can end germany 's malaise , they hope their efforts will foster the kind of can-do mentality that helped the country tackle the far greater challenge of rebuilding after world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ard tv newscaster ulrich wickert .
in one tv spot , ulrich wickert , one of germany 's leading newscasters , even borrows a famous line from former us president john f. kennedy : " ask not what your country can do for you , but what you can do for your country . " all major public and private broadcasters simultaneously televised that first public service announcement on sept .
26 , reaching an estimated audience of 17 million .
but some german observers remain skeptical about whether it all will soothe the nation 's soul .
" it 's hard to say whether this initiative will mobilize people , " wrote dresden 's sächsische zeitung newspaper in an editorial .
" of course something has to change .
but the country 's economic situation has something to do with the miserable mood - whoever thinks the world will end tomorrow is n't about to spend a lot of money at a hardware store today . " marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berliners get the blues a new report shows that not only is depression on the rise in germany , but berliners are the most miserable of all .
is it something in the water , or are they simply more open about their feelings ?
-lrb- april 14 , 2005 -rrb- nothing ventured , nothing gained as germany tries to find its way out of the stubborn quagmire of high unemployment , many of those affected are more concerned with slinging the mud of blame than they are with changing the course of their own fates .
-lrb- march 16 , 2005 -rrb- the german fear of reform germany might be in the middle of a deep economic crisis , but the country 's high unemployment and weak growth are probably the best things ever to happen to angela merkel 's career .

the vote produced an inconclusive hung result that has both chancellor gerhard schröder and the leader of the conservative opposition , angela merkel , claiming the right to lead the country for the next four years . jo groebel , a psychologist and director of düsseldorf-based european institute for the media , praised the new initiative for attempting to shake the country out of its current self-pitying torpor , but said the roots of the german crisis of confidence went deep . " germans have been lurching from one identity crisis to another for the past 150 years , " groebel said , pointing out that oct .
3 marked 15 years since german reunification .
" it 's true germans tend to yearn for stability , but that 's because they have n't had it .
the economic problems like large unemployment have only added to the fears that everything could collapse . " to some extent , german worries are overblown .
germany is still the world 's leading exporter and the country continues to offer its citizens an extremely comfortable standard of living .
but as globalization has threatened high-paying german jobs and the government has been forced to trim extremely generous welfare benefits , complaining has become something of a national pastime . change of mentality though the organizers have no illusions that the television and print ads alone can end germany 's malaise , they hope their efforts will foster the kind of can-do mentality that helped the country tackle the far greater challenge of rebuilding after world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ard tv newscaster ulrich wickert .
in one tv spot , ulrich wickert , one of germany 's leading newscasters , even borrows a famous line from former us president john f. kennedy : " ask not what your country can do for you , but what you can do for your country . " all major public and private broadcasters simultaneously televised that first public service announcement on sept .
26 , reaching an estimated audience of 17 million .
but some german observers remain skeptical about whether it all will soothe the nation 's soul .
" it 's hard to say whether this initiative will mobilize people , " wrote dresden 's sächsische zeitung newspaper in an editorial .
" of course something has to change .
but the country 's economic situation has something to do with the miserable mood - whoever thinks the world will end tomorrow is n't about to spend a lot of money at a hardware store today . " marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berliners get the blues a new report shows that not only is depression on the rise in germany , but berliners are the most miserable of all .
is it something in the water , or are they simply more open about their feelings ?
-lrb- april 14 , 2005 -rrb- nothing ventured , nothing gained as germany tries to find its way out of the stubborn quagmire of high unemployment , many of those affected are more concerned with slinging the mud of blame than they are with changing the course of their own fates .
-lrb- march 16 , 2005 -rrb- the german fear of reform germany might be in the middle of a deep economic crisis , but the country 's high unemployment and weak growth are probably the best things ever to happen to angela merkel 's career .

" we have a hiccup right now , " elbaradei , director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , said at a forum on nuclear safety issues in moscow .
" i am optimistic that in the coming months we will see a resumption of these negotiations .
we need to find a face-saving solution . " eu talks with tehran - spearheaded by the so-called eu-3 of britain , france and germany , as well as eu foreign policy chief javier solana - broke down in august after tehran resumed uranium conversion activities .
the united states claims these activities are a cover for developing nuclear weapons . last month the iaea threatened to refer tehran to the un security council over its nuclear program , but not before a november iaea meeting .
the european union has so far resisted calls for iran to be referred to the un , hoping to win pledges from tehran on its nuclear plans , in exchange for trade and other benefits . at wednesday 's forum in moscow , organized by the nuclear threat initiative , a us pressure group , elbaradei said that russia shared the same broad goals as other leading members of the international community as regards iran 's nuclear program .
washington has voiced worries about moscow 's building of the bushehr nuclear power plant in iran , suspecting that this could help tehran develop an offensive nuclear capacity . " i think everybody , russia included , agrees that nobody wants to see iran develop nuclear weapons .
on the strategic goal there is consensus , " elbaradei said .
" russia , like all other members , has been trying to see what is the best tactic to achieve that objective .
you have differences on the best tactics to be pursued , but that is democracy . " diplomat resigns meanwhile , one of iran 's most prominent diplomats , mohammad javad zarif , has resigned as a member of the country 's nuclear negotiating team , the official news agency irna reported wednesday . zarif , who is ambassador to the united nations , is widely considered a moderating influence over foreign policy and in favor of improving ties with the west .
the report , quoting an unidentified source , did not say why zarif quit the nuclear negotiating team , which has been almost totally changed following the june presidential election victory of hardliner mahmoud ahmadinejad . bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad leading negotiator hassan rowhani , also a moderate , was replaced by ultra-conservative ali larijani , who is seen as being at the opposite end of the regime 's political spectrum to diplomats like zarif . tensions with the west have also escalated after iran slammed the door on proposals from britain , france and germany that it abandon fuel-cycle technology in return for incentives , and decided to resume uranium conversion work in defiance of an agreement with the eu-3 . during the tenure of former president mohammad khatami , zarif played an active role in efforts to improve iran 's foreign relations .
he was notably involved in closed-door talks with the united states in 2001 on the formation of a post-taliban government for afghanistan , followed by secret contacts prior to the us invasion of iraq . moderates worried the uncompromising stance of iran 's new hardline authorities in a stand-off over the country 's nuclear program is worrying some iranian officials and leading to overt criticism .
the issue is not whether or not the country should hang on to its nuclear program , but more on how the regime should go about it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani the first to speak out was defeated presidential contender akbar hashemi rafsanjani , who on friday appealed to hardliners to exercise restraint - notably when it came to their increasingly violent rhetoric . " it is about diplomacy rather than slogans , " the still-powerful cleric said in a sermon last week .
" it is about being reasonable , negotiating and being diplomatically active . "
he reminded his fellow iranians that the stakes are " very serious . " on tuesday moderate deputies in the iranian parliament also warned of the economic consequences of international isolation and sanctions , complaining the new nuclear team is " failing to respect national interests in their statements . " in an open letter , the minority group said iran was at a " sensitive stage " and noted the " freefall of the tehran stock exchange " where nuclear jitters are hitting investor confidence .
" sadly , the first action of the government was to change the nuclear negotiators and deprive itself of their experience and the trust they built up , " hassan afarideh , a moderate mp , said in parliament . " certain officials and negotiators keep using threatening and intimidating language .
it is clear we can not reach a result through diplomacy with this kind of language , " he said , taking a clear shot at larijani , who threatened to respond to last month 's tough resolution passed by the iaea by limiting inspections and resuming enrichment . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran wants nuclear talks beyond europe iran does not consider britain , france and germany to be the sole negotiating partners on its nuclear program and believes the process should be opened out beyond europe , the foreign ministry said sunday .

he was notably involved in closed-door talks with the united states in 2001 on the formation of a post-taliban government for afghanistan , followed by secret contacts prior to the us invasion of iraq . moderates worried the uncompromising stance of iran 's new hardline authorities in a stand-off over the country 's nuclear program is worrying some iranian officials and leading to overt criticism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.10.2005 germans faced with rising power costs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many germans may soon be paying more for electricity all around the world , energy prices have soared in recent months .
following the steep ascent of gasoline and natural gas , it looks as if germans will now also be hit by climbing electricity costs . just as motorists are facing record prices at the pump and homeowners are receiving inflated gas bills , the next bit of bad news for german consumers rolls in . on tuesday , germany 's two largest energy companies , rwe and e.on , said they wanted to hike electricity prices by a reported 5 or 6 percent starting next year .
the utilities justified the higher costs with increasing wholesale prices , expenses from renewable sources and greater demand . the move was instantly criticized by consumer watchdog groups . " i have the impression that the energy companies are using the current political vacuum , " german consumer protection association spokesman carel mohn told the dpa news agency , referring to political stalemate in berlin following last month 's election .
" there is no other sector that constantly makes such above-average profits .
that shows that competition still is n't working . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rwe spokesman wolfgang schley said in dortmund on tuesday that prices on the leipzig eex electricity market jumped around 30 percent in the first six months of the year and that politicial scrutiny politicians , aware that germans are fed-up with rising energy costs have also rushed to condemn the utilities .
economics minister wolfgang clement on tuesday called on state officials to check carefully whether higher electricity prices are warranted . " these price hikes are politically impossible to communicate , " hesse state economics minister alois rhiel told the süddeutsche zeitung .
" therefore i will be especially critical when looking at the petitions . " the decision to push for a rate hike could be undercut by the fact that germany 's third and fourth largest electricity utilities - vattenfall and enbw respectively - were not planning to raise prices in january . renewables not to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an official for a renewable energy association said such energy sources , wind power , for example , could not be held accountable for increasing prices .
" it 's wrong and brazen from rwe and e.on to associate the hikes in electricity costs with renewables , " said milan nitzschke from the federal association for renewable energy . the electricity news is sure to encourage even more germans to seek alternative energy sources .
following the recent surge in the cost of natural gas and oil , some are hoping a cozy fire could meet their energy needs .
but even that is costing more than it used to . " a lot of people want to heat with wood again , " schmallenberg forestry official adalbert koch told dpa , explaining that firewood had become as much as 40 percent more expensive this year . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's " electricity rebels " germany 's reputation for environmental friendliness may have found its expression in the black forest citizens ' initiative that won a david and goliath battle against the local electricity provider .
-lrb- april 18 , 2005 -rrb- a rebirth for german nuclear energy ?
the prospect of victory by germany 's conservative opposition in an early general election has shaken up the country 's energy sector .
the nuclear power industry is hoping to slow the planned phase out atomic energy .
-lrb- may 25 , 2005 -rrb- germany moves to open energy market germany 's parliament has passed a new law that 's meant to help liberalize the country 's energy market .
but critics say changes to the bill are needed before people will actually be able to save money .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.10.2005 after milosevic , serbia struggles to reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the anniversary of milosevic 's ousting attracts crowds each year on wednesday , belgrade marks the fifth anniversary of the protests that drove slobodan milosevic from office and ended a decade of violence .
but democratic and economic reforms have made slow progress since then . yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic wasn ’ t going to go without a fight , even when it was clear that vojislav kostunica , the candidate from the 18-party alliance , the serbian democratic opposition , had surprisingly won the 2000 presidential election . opposition leader zoran djindjic and the optor student movement then organized nationwide strikes .
a mass demonstration was organized for oct .
5 in belgrade .
tens of thousands flooded into the capital .
by the afternoon , hundreds of thousands of opposition supporters had gathered outside parliament , chanting death to milosevic and calling for kostunica to take power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic things came to a head when it emerged that milosevic -lrb- photo -rrb- had ordered the police to shoot into the crowd and the army to attack from the air - an order refused by generals and police officers .
only in front of parliament and the state television building was there shooting and tear gas used . milosevic exit a watershed serbian journalist dragan bujosevic , who was there , remembers the events vividly . " it was then i realized , woah , they really believe they could get killed today , " bujosevic said .
" part of the opposition certainly thought so . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the events of that momentous day spiraled out of control .
without informing the liberal-left majority of the opposition alliance , the nationalist-conservative kostunica -lrb- photo -rrb- met with milosevic .
a few hours later milosevic conceded live on state television . " i congratulate mr kostunica on his election victory and wish the citizens of yugoslavia much success during the new presidents mandate , " milosevic said . yet president kostunica soon fell out with the now reformist prime minister zoran djinjic .
he steadfastly refused djindjic ’ s wish to arrest milosevic and hand him over the war crimes tribunal in the hague . djinjic got his way in the end but lost the support of kostunica ’ s followers in parliament .
he accused them of lacking the will to make a clean break with the milosevic-era . " on oct .
6 , 2000 , i wanted to let every judge , policeman and state journalist go .
it ’ s no secret that i didn ’ t have a majority .
i ’ ve only rarely had a majority in this country , " djinjic said at the time . the power struggle hindered reforms that the country urgently needed after a decade of human rights violations , impoverishment and distrust . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic yugoslavia then became the federation of serbia-montenegro and kostunica lost his post .
and the governing coalition imploded in march 2003 when alleged war criminals assassinated djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- .
a year later kostunica was elected prime minister . more needs to be done since then kostunica has steered his country on the path to reform .
his greatest success came on monday this week , when the eu gave the green light to negotiations over a partnership with serbia-montenegro .
kostunica vowed to push through more reforms .

he steadfastly refused djindjic ’ s wish to arrest milosevic and hand him over the war crimes tribunal in the hague . djinjic got his way in the end but lost the support of kostunica ’ s followers in parliament .
he accused them of lacking the will to make a clean break with the milosevic-era . " on oct .
6 , 2000 , i wanted to let every judge , policeman and state journalist go .
it ’ s no secret that i didn ’ t have a majority .
i ’ ve only rarely had a majority in this country , " djinjic said at the time . the power struggle hindered reforms that the country urgently needed after a decade of human rights violations , impoverishment and distrust . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic yugoslavia then became the federation of serbia-montenegro and kostunica lost his post .
and the governing coalition imploded in march 2003 when alleged war criminals assassinated djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- .
a year later kostunica was elected prime minister . more needs to be done since then kostunica has steered his country on the path to reform .
his greatest success came on monday this week , when the eu gave the green light to negotiations over a partnership with serbia-montenegro .
kostunica vowed to push through more reforms . " our laws must come into line with eu laws , the justice system needs to be strengthened and modernized , the constitution of serbia-montenegro needs to be adhered to and we need to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal in the hague , " he said . yet observers remain skeptical that , five years on , serbia is anywhere near having a stable democracy or a functional market economy .
many former colleagues accuse kostunica of corruption , failing to deal with the past and suppressing political opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic serbia also needs to hand in all fugitives suspected of committing war crimes , most importantly bosnian serb commander ratko mladic and his then political boss radovan karadzic -lrb- photo -rrb- to the hague tribunal before the country will earn the international community 's trust . " a balkan mindset " former justice minister vladan batic , one of kostunica ’ s loudest critics , blames the prime minister for blocking reforms . " only a few have been arrested , and it was kostunica who put the brakes on .
there ’ s no transparency to the state .
people were prepared to wait for a better standard of living , but they wanted justice , " batic said . last week batic himself was arrested for allegedly releasing a criminal involved in djindjic ’ s murder .
the case was dropped due to lack of evidence . serbia-montenegro human rights minister rasim ljajic told reuters in an interview recently that his country still had a long way to go . " we have an image problem , " ljajic said .
" the way to fix it is to show we can honor our commitments to the international community .
we ca n't ask to play in the european league with a balkan mindset , we must accept the rules of the game .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.10.2005 campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the campaign compares average citizens to famous germans after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .
but now leading german media organizations have launched a new initiative to help lift their spirits . in the largest public-service campaign in german history , 25 top media organizations last week started a 30-million-euro -lrb- $ 35.7-million -rrb- advertising barrage called " you are germany " to help raise the spirits of the country 's 82 million citizens . amounting to a five-month nationwide pep talk , the initiative 's organizers will blanket the airwaves and fill newspapers , magazines and billboards with the message that germans need to be more optimistic about their country 's prospects despite high unemployment , weak growth and a muddled political situation . " germany makes itself out to be worse than it is , " bernd kundrun , board member of german media giant bertelsmann , said while announcing the new campaign in september .
" we want to do something about that with this unique joint effort by encouraging a change in consciousness towards more self-confidence and motivation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " du bist deutschland " albert einstein ad .
the broad media alliance - which is donating airtime and page space - has recruited an impressive cross-section of german society for the campaign .
besides including currently well-known personalities such as national soccer team goalkeeper oliver kahn and literary critic marcel reich-ranicki , it will also feature historical figures like beethoven and albert einstein .
whether on tv , in print or on the internet , all of the advertisements try to inspire germans to take a personal stake in getting germany back on track . doom and gloom but lifting the doom and gloom that have dominated the german public mood for years could be a tall order .
a record 5 million people are jobless in europe 's largest economy and recent surveys have shown that many germans remain fearful of the future . the sept .
18 general election has n't helped either .
the vote produced an inconclusive hung result that has both chancellor gerhard schröder and the leader of the conservative opposition , angela merkel , claiming the right to lead the country for the next four years . jo groebel , a psychologist and director of düsseldorf-based european institute for the media , praised the new initiative for attempting to shake the country out of its current self-pitying torpor , but said the roots of the german crisis of confidence went deep . " germans have been lurching from one identity crisis to another for the past 150 years , " groebel said , pointing out that oct .
3 marked 15 years since german reunification .
" it 's true germans tend to yearn for stability , but that 's because they have n't had it .
the economic problems like large unemployment have only added to the fears that everything could collapse . " to some extent , german worries are overblown .
germany is still the world 's leading exporter and the country continues to offer its citizens an extremely comfortable standard of living .
but as globalization has threatened high-paying german jobs and the government has been forced to trim extremely generous welfare benefits , complaining has become something of a national pastime . change of mentality though the organizers have no illusions that the television and print ads alone can end germany 's malaise , they hope their efforts will foster the kind of can-do mentality that helped the country tackle the far greater challenge of rebuilding after world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ard tv newscaster ulrich wickert .
in one tv spot , ulrich wickert , one of germany 's leading newscasters , even borrows a famous line from former us president john f. kennedy : " ask not what your country can do for you , but what you can do for your country . " all major public and private broadcasters simultaneously televised that first public service announcement on sept .
26 , reaching an estimated audience of 17 million .
but some german observers remain skeptical about whether it all will soothe the nation 's soul .
" it 's hard to say whether this initiative will mobilize people , " wrote dresden 's sächsische zeitung newspaper in an editorial .
" of course something has to change .
but the country 's economic situation has something to do with the miserable mood - whoever thinks the world will end tomorrow is n't about to spend a lot of money at a hardware store today . " marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berliners get the blues a new report shows that not only is depression on the rise in germany , but berliners are the most miserable of all .
is it something in the water , or are they simply more open about their feelings ?
-lrb- april 14 , 2005 -rrb- nothing ventured , nothing gained as germany tries to find its way out of the stubborn quagmire of high unemployment , many of those affected are more concerned with slinging the mud of blame than they are with changing the course of their own fates .
-lrb- march 16 , 2005 -rrb- the german fear of reform germany might be in the middle of a deep economic crisis , but the country 's high unemployment and weak growth are probably the best things ever to happen to angela merkel 's career .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.10.2005 after milosevic , serbia struggles to reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the anniversary of milosevic 's ousting attracts crowds each year on wednesday , belgrade marks the fifth anniversary of the protests that drove slobodan milosevic from office and ended a decade of violence .
but democratic and economic reforms have made slow progress since then . yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic wasn ’ t going to go without a fight , even when it was clear that vojislav kostunica , the candidate from the 18-party alliance , the serbian democratic opposition , had surprisingly won the 2000 presidential election . opposition leader zoran djindjic and the optor student movement then organized nationwide strikes .
a mass demonstration was organized for oct .
5 in belgrade .
tens of thousands flooded into the capital .
by the afternoon , hundreds of thousands of opposition supporters had gathered outside parliament , chanting death to milosevic and calling for kostunica to take power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic things came to a head when it emerged that milosevic -lrb- photo -rrb- had ordered the police to shoot into the crowd and the army to attack from the air - an order refused by generals and police officers .
only in front of parliament and the state television building was there shooting and tear gas used . milosevic exit a watershed serbian journalist dragan bujosevic , who was there , remembers the events vividly . " it was then i realized , woah , they really believe they could get killed today , " bujosevic said .
" part of the opposition certainly thought so . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the events of that momentous day spiraled out of control .
without informing the liberal-left majority of the opposition alliance , the nationalist-conservative kostunica -lrb- photo -rrb- met with milosevic .
a few hours later milosevic conceded live on state television . " i congratulate mr kostunica on his election victory and wish the citizens of yugoslavia much success during the new presidents mandate , " milosevic said . yet president kostunica soon fell out with the now reformist prime minister zoran djinjic .
he steadfastly refused djindjic ’ s wish to arrest milosevic and hand him over the war crimes tribunal in the hague . djinjic got his way in the end but lost the support of kostunica ’ s followers in parliament .
he accused them of lacking the will to make a clean break with the milosevic-era . " on oct .
6 , 2000 , i wanted to let every judge , policeman and state journalist go .
it ’ s no secret that i didn ’ t have a majority .
i ’ ve only rarely had a majority in this country , " djinjic said at the time . the power struggle hindered reforms that the country urgently needed after a decade of human rights violations , impoverishment and distrust . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zoran djindjic yugoslavia then became the federation of serbia-montenegro and kostunica lost his post .
and the governing coalition imploded in march 2003 when alleged war criminals assassinated djindjic -lrb- photo -rrb- .
a year later kostunica was elected prime minister . more needs to be done since then kostunica has steered his country on the path to reform .
his greatest success came on monday this week , when the eu gave the green light to negotiations over a partnership with serbia-montenegro .
kostunica vowed to push through more reforms . " our laws must come into line with eu laws , the justice system needs to be strengthened and modernized , the constitution of serbia-montenegro needs to be adhered to and we need to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal in the hague , " he said . yet observers remain skeptical that , five years on , serbia is anywhere near having a stable democracy or a functional market economy .
many former colleagues accuse kostunica of corruption , failing to deal with the past and suppressing political opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic serbia also needs to hand in all fugitives suspected of committing war crimes , most importantly bosnian serb commander ratko mladic and his then political boss radovan karadzic -lrb- photo -rrb- to the hague tribunal before the country will earn the international community 's trust . " a balkan mindset " former justice minister vladan batic , one of kostunica ’ s loudest critics , blames the prime minister for blocking reforms . " only a few have been arrested , and it was kostunica who put the brakes on .
there ’ s no transparency to the state .
people were prepared to wait for a better standard of living , but they wanted justice , " batic said . last week batic himself was arrested for allegedly releasing a criminal involved in djindjic ’ s murder .
the case was dropped due to lack of evidence . serbia-montenegro human rights minister rasim ljajic told reuters in an interview recently that his country still had a long way to go . " we have an image problem , " ljajic said .
" the way to fix it is to show we can honor our commitments to the international community .
we ca n't ask to play in the european league with a balkan mindset , we must accept the rules of the game .

" we have a hiccup right now , " elbaradei , director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , said at a forum on nuclear safety issues in moscow .
" i am optimistic that in the coming months we will see a resumption of these negotiations .
we need to find a face-saving solution . " eu talks with tehran - spearheaded by the so-called eu-3 of britain , france and germany , as well as eu foreign policy chief javier solana - broke down in august after tehran resumed uranium conversion activities .
the united states claims these activities are a cover for developing nuclear weapons . last month the iaea threatened to refer tehran to the un security council over its nuclear program , but not before a november iaea meeting .
the european union has so far resisted calls for iran to be referred to the un , hoping to win pledges from tehran on its nuclear plans , in exchange for trade and other benefits . at wednesday 's forum in moscow , organized by the nuclear threat initiative , a us pressure group , elbaradei said that russia shared the same broad goals as other leading members of the international community as regards iran 's nuclear program .
washington has voiced worries about moscow 's building of the bushehr nuclear power plant in iran , suspecting that this could help tehran develop an offensive nuclear capacity . " i think everybody , russia included , agrees that nobody wants to see iran develop nuclear weapons .
on the strategic goal there is consensus , " elbaradei said .
" russia , like all other members , has been trying to see what is the best tactic to achieve that objective .
you have differences on the best tactics to be pursued , but that is democracy . " diplomat resigns meanwhile , one of iran 's most prominent diplomats , mohammad javad zarif , has resigned as a member of the country 's nuclear negotiating team , the official news agency irna reported wednesday . zarif , who is ambassador to the united nations , is widely considered a moderating influence over foreign policy and in favor of improving ties with the west .
the report , quoting an unidentified source , did not say why zarif quit the nuclear negotiating team , which has been almost totally changed following the june presidential election victory of hardliner mahmoud ahmadinejad . bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad leading negotiator hassan rowhani , also a moderate , was replaced by ultra-conservative ali larijani , who is seen as being at the opposite end of the regime 's political spectrum to diplomats like zarif . tensions with the west have also escalated after iran slammed the door on proposals from britain , france and germany that it abandon fuel-cycle technology in return for incentives , and decided to resume uranium conversion work in defiance of an agreement with the eu-3 . during the tenure of former president mohammad khatami , zarif played an active role in efforts to improve iran 's foreign relations .
he was notably involved in closed-door talks with the united states in 2001 on the formation of a post-taliban government for afghanistan , followed by secret contacts prior to the us invasion of iraq . moderates worried the uncompromising stance of iran 's new hardline authorities in a stand-off over the country 's nuclear program is worrying some iranian officials and leading to overt criticism .
the issue is not whether or not the country should hang on to its nuclear program , but more on how the regime should go about it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani the first to speak out was defeated presidential contender akbar hashemi rafsanjani , who on friday appealed to hardliners to exercise restraint - notably when it came to their increasingly violent rhetoric . " it is about diplomacy rather than slogans , " the still-powerful cleric said in a sermon last week .
" it is about being reasonable , negotiating and being diplomatically active . "
he reminded his fellow iranians that the stakes are " very serious . " on tuesday moderate deputies in the iranian parliament also warned of the economic consequences of international isolation and sanctions , complaining the new nuclear team is " failing to respect national interests in their statements .

" we have a hiccup right now , " elbaradei , director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , said at a forum on nuclear safety issues in moscow .
" i am optimistic that in the coming months we will see a resumption of these negotiations .
we need to find a face-saving solution . " eu talks with tehran - spearheaded by the so-called eu-3 of britain , france and germany , as well as eu foreign policy chief javier solana - broke down in august after tehran resumed uranium conversion activities .
the united states claims these activities are a cover for developing nuclear weapons . last month the iaea threatened to refer tehran to the un security council over its nuclear program , but not before a november iaea meeting .
the european union has so far resisted calls for iran to be referred to the un , hoping to win pledges from tehran on its nuclear plans , in exchange for trade and other benefits . at wednesday 's forum in moscow , organized by the nuclear threat initiative , a us pressure group , elbaradei said that russia shared the same broad goals as other leading members of the international community as regards iran 's nuclear program .
washington has voiced worries about moscow 's building of the bushehr nuclear power plant in iran , suspecting that this could help tehran develop an offensive nuclear capacity . " i think everybody , russia included , agrees that nobody wants to see iran develop nuclear weapons .
on the strategic goal there is consensus , " elbaradei said .
" russia , like all other members , has been trying to see what is the best tactic to achieve that objective .
you have differences on the best tactics to be pursued , but that is democracy . " diplomat resigns meanwhile , one of iran 's most prominent diplomats , mohammad javad zarif , has resigned as a member of the country 's nuclear negotiating team , the official news agency irna reported wednesday . zarif , who is ambassador to the united nations , is widely considered a moderating influence over foreign policy and in favor of improving ties with the west .
the report , quoting an unidentified source , did not say why zarif quit the nuclear negotiating team , which has been almost totally changed following the june presidential election victory of hardliner mahmoud ahmadinejad . bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad leading negotiator hassan rowhani , also a moderate , was replaced by ultra-conservative ali larijani , who is seen as being at the opposite end of the regime 's political spectrum to diplomats like zarif . tensions with the west have also escalated after iran slammed the door on proposals from britain , france and germany that it abandon fuel-cycle technology in return for incentives , and decided to resume uranium conversion work in defiance of an agreement with the eu-3 . during the tenure of former president mohammad khatami , zarif played an active role in efforts to improve iran 's foreign relations .
he was notably involved in closed-door talks with the united states in 2001 on the formation of a post-taliban government for afghanistan , followed by secret contacts prior to the us invasion of iraq . moderates worried the uncompromising stance of iran 's new hardline authorities in a stand-off over the country 's nuclear program is worrying some iranian officials and leading to overt criticism .
the issue is not whether or not the country should hang on to its nuclear program , but more on how the regime should go about it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani the first to speak out was defeated presidential contender akbar hashemi rafsanjani , who on friday appealed to hardliners to exercise restraint - notably when it came to their increasingly violent rhetoric . " it is about diplomacy rather than slogans , " the still-powerful cleric said in a sermon last week .
" it is about being reasonable , negotiating and being diplomatically active . "
he reminded his fellow iranians that the stakes are " very serious . " on tuesday moderate deputies in the iranian parliament also warned of the economic consequences of international isolation and sanctions , complaining the new nuclear team is " failing to respect national interests in their statements .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.10.2005 campaign aims to raise germany 's spirits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the campaign compares average citizens to famous germans after years of economic stagnation , many germans have become depressed about the future .
but now leading german media organizations have launched a new initiative to help lift their spirits . in the largest public-service campaign in german history , 25 top media organizations last week started a 30-million-euro -lrb- $ 35.7-million -rrb- advertising barrage called " you are germany " to help raise the spirits of the country 's 82 million citizens . amounting to a five-month nationwide pep talk , the initiative 's organizers will blanket the airwaves and fill newspapers , magazines and billboards with the message that germans need to be more optimistic about their country 's prospects despite high unemployment , weak growth and a muddled political situation . " germany makes itself out to be worse than it is , " bernd kundrun , board member of german media giant bertelsmann , said while announcing the new campaign in september .
" we want to do something about that with this unique joint effort by encouraging a change in consciousness towards more self-confidence and motivation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " du bist deutschland " albert einstein ad .
the broad media alliance - which is donating airtime and page space - has recruited an impressive cross-section of german society for the campaign .
besides including currently well-known personalities such as national soccer team goalkeeper oliver kahn and literary critic marcel reich-ranicki , it will also feature historical figures like beethoven and albert einstein .
whether on tv , in print or on the internet , all of the advertisements try to inspire germans to take a personal stake in getting germany back on track . doom and gloom but lifting the doom and gloom that have dominated the german public mood for years could be a tall order .
a record 5 million people are jobless in europe 's largest economy and recent surveys have shown that many germans remain fearful of the future . the sept .
18 general election has n't helped either .
the vote produced an inconclusive hung result that has both chancellor gerhard schröder and the leader of the conservative opposition , angela merkel , claiming the right to lead the country for the next four years . jo groebel , a psychologist and director of düsseldorf-based european institute for the media , praised the new initiative for attempting to shake the country out of its current self-pitying torpor , but said the roots of the german crisis of confidence went deep . " germans have been lurching from one identity crisis to another for the past 150 years , " groebel said , pointing out that oct .
3 marked 15 years since german reunification .
" it 's true germans tend to yearn for stability , but that 's because they have n't had it .
the economic problems like large unemployment have only added to the fears that everything could collapse . " to some extent , german worries are overblown .
germany is still the world 's leading exporter and the country continues to offer its citizens an extremely comfortable standard of living .
but as globalization has threatened high-paying german jobs and the government has been forced to trim extremely generous welfare benefits , complaining has become something of a national pastime . change of mentality though the organizers have no illusions that the television and print ads alone can end germany 's malaise , they hope their efforts will foster the kind of can-do mentality that helped the country tackle the far greater challenge of rebuilding after world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ard tv newscaster ulrich wickert .
in one tv spot , ulrich wickert , one of germany 's leading newscasters , even borrows a famous line from former us president john f. kennedy : " ask not what your country can do for you , but what you can do for your country . " all major public and private broadcasters simultaneously televised that first public service announcement on sept .
26 , reaching an estimated audience of 17 million .
but some german observers remain skeptical about whether it all will soothe the nation 's soul .
" it 's hard to say whether this initiative will mobilize people , " wrote dresden 's sächsische zeitung newspaper in an editorial .
" of course something has to change .
but the country 's economic situation has something to do with the miserable mood - whoever thinks the world will end tomorrow is n't about to spend a lot of money at a hardware store today . " marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berliners get the blues a new report shows that not only is depression on the rise in germany , but berliners are the most miserable of all .
is it something in the water , or are they simply more open about their feelings ?
-lrb- april 14 , 2005 -rrb- nothing ventured , nothing gained as germany tries to find its way out of the stubborn quagmire of high unemployment , many of those affected are more concerned with slinging the mud of blame than they are with changing the course of their own fates .
-lrb- march 16 , 2005 -rrb- the german fear of reform germany might be in the middle of a deep economic crisis , but the country 's high unemployment and weak growth are probably the best things ever to happen to angela merkel 's career .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.10.2005 iaea chief hopeful on iran nuclear talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's nuclear program continues to worry the iaea the head of the un atomic energy agency , mohamed elbaradei , said wednesday he was hopeful talks between the european union and tehran on the iranian nuclear crisis would resume in the coming months . " we have a hiccup right now , " elbaradei , director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , said at a forum on nuclear safety issues in moscow .
" i am optimistic that in the coming months we will see a resumption of these negotiations .
we need to find a face-saving solution . " eu talks with tehran - spearheaded by the so-called eu-3 of britain , france and germany , as well as eu foreign policy chief javier solana - broke down in august after tehran resumed uranium conversion activities .
the united states claims these activities are a cover for developing nuclear weapons . last month the iaea threatened to refer tehran to the un security council over its nuclear program , but not before a november iaea meeting .
the european union has so far resisted calls for iran to be referred to the un , hoping to win pledges from tehran on its nuclear plans , in exchange for trade and other benefits . at wednesday 's forum in moscow , organized by the nuclear threat initiative , a us pressure group , elbaradei said that russia shared the same broad goals as other leading members of the international community as regards iran 's nuclear program .
washington has voiced worries about moscow 's building of the bushehr nuclear power plant in iran , suspecting that this could help tehran develop an offensive nuclear capacity . " i think everybody , russia included , agrees that nobody wants to see iran develop nuclear weapons .
on the strategic goal there is consensus , " elbaradei said .
" russia , like all other members , has been trying to see what is the best tactic to achieve that objective .
you have differences on the best tactics to be pursued , but that is democracy . " diplomat resigns meanwhile , one of iran 's most prominent diplomats , mohammad javad zarif , has resigned as a member of the country 's nuclear negotiating team , the official news agency irna reported wednesday . zarif , who is ambassador to the united nations , is widely considered a moderating influence over foreign policy and in favor of improving ties with the west .
the report , quoting an unidentified source , did not say why zarif quit the nuclear negotiating team , which has been almost totally changed following the june presidential election victory of hardliner mahmoud ahmadinejad . bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad leading negotiator hassan rowhani , also a moderate , was replaced by ultra-conservative ali larijani , who is seen as being at the opposite end of the regime 's political spectrum to diplomats like zarif . tensions with the west have also escalated after iran slammed the door on proposals from britain , france and germany that it abandon fuel-cycle technology in return for incentives , and decided to resume uranium conversion work in defiance of an agreement with the eu-3 . during the tenure of former president mohammad khatami , zarif played an active role in efforts to improve iran 's foreign relations .
he was notably involved in closed-door talks with the united states in 2001 on the formation of a post-taliban government for afghanistan , followed by secret contacts prior to the us invasion of iraq . moderates worried the uncompromising stance of iran 's new hardline authorities in a stand-off over the country 's nuclear program is worrying some iranian officials and leading to overt criticism .
the issue is not whether or not the country should hang on to its nuclear program , but more on how the regime should go about it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani the first to speak out was defeated presidential contender akbar hashemi rafsanjani , who on friday appealed to hardliners to exercise restraint - notably when it came to their increasingly violent rhetoric . " it is about diplomacy rather than slogans , " the still-powerful cleric said in a sermon last week .
" it is about being reasonable , negotiating and being diplomatically active . "
he reminded his fellow iranians that the stakes are " very serious . " on tuesday moderate deputies in the iranian parliament also warned of the economic consequences of international isolation and sanctions , complaining the new nuclear team is " failing to respect national interests in their statements . " in an open letter , the minority group said iran was at a " sensitive stage " and noted the " freefall of the tehran stock exchange " where nuclear jitters are hitting investor confidence .
" sadly , the first action of the government was to change the nuclear negotiators and deprive itself of their experience and the trust they built up , " hassan afarideh , a moderate mp , said in parliament . " certain officials and negotiators keep using threatening and intimidating language .
it is clear we can not reach a result through diplomacy with this kind of language , " he said , taking a clear shot at larijani , who threatened to respond to last month 's tough resolution passed by the iaea by limiting inspections and resuming enrichment . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran wants nuclear talks beyond europe iran does not consider britain , france and germany to be the sole negotiating partners on its nuclear program and believes the process should be opened out beyond europe , the foreign ministry said sunday .

" but they said " personnel issues " must be decided before formal coalition negotiations could begin - officials from merkel 's christian democrats then revealed that the parties would sit down on thursday to begin talking through the high-stakes issue . a smiling merkel , who is bidding to become germany 's first woman chancellor , said after two and a half hours of talks with the social democrats : " i would say this was a rather good day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- chairwoman angela merkel , right , and bavarian governor edmund stoiber brief the media in berlin wednesday , oct .
5 , 2005 , about talks with the social democrat 's -lrb- spd -rrb- about a possible left-right coalition .
" i feel more optimistic than pessimistic .
we had great success in agreeing on the content -lrb- of a program -rrb- ...
i see a possibility to form a coalition . " schröder agreed , telling reporters : " we have a strong basis for a grand coalition . " way forward the remarks soothed fears that the talks , a third round of exploratory negotiations after the parties finished just four seats apart in legislative elections , would flounder because of the row over who should lead a new government . merkel said the parties would try to cut a deal at a summit of party leaders . " we need to see if we have a basis of trust for coalition talks .
we must see if we can put together our respective households and part of this will be the issue of personnel , " merkel said . however schröder said that more government posts than just the chancellor 's job would have to be discussed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , and social democratic party chairman franz müntefering " i think it has become clear to the union -lrb- christian democrats -rrb- that one can not just settle one issue first , " he said . schröder and merkel have both staked a claim to the chancellery to lead the european union 's biggest country after the september 18 election failed to give either of their parties a governing majority . their only option now appears to join together in a " grand coalition " last seen in germany in the late 1960s . the conservatives have heaped pressure on schröder to back down because as the leader of the biggest parliamentary group , albeit by a hair 's breadth , merkel holds the mandate to form a government . high-stakes poker ? but many observers believe the charismatic chancellor , who has held the post for the past seven years , is playing a political poker game intended to secure the best possible coalition deal for his party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " how much is schröder worth ? " the daily bild asked on wednesday , adding that the social democrats wanted to " sell the chancellery for as much gain as possible . " a poll by the forsa research institute released on wednesday showed that public support for merkel as chancellor has grown , with 34 percent of people canvassed favoring her for the job , compared to 26 percent for schröder . merkel has however faced criticism within her own party by its poor showing at the polls in an election that had seemed hers to win on the back of popular discontent with rising unemployment and schröder 's reform program . on wednesday one of her main rivals within the christian democrats , her former economics strategist friedrich merz , said the fact that only 35.2 percent of voters cast their ballots for the conservatives showed that there was a " problem with the campaign and with the people at the top .

but his party said it still wanted a third term for him .

but democratic and economic reforms have made slow progress since then . yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic wasn ’ t going to go without a fight , even when it was clear that vojislav kostunica , the candidate from the 18-party alliance , the serbian democratic opposition , had surprisingly won the 2000 presidential election . opposition leader zoran djindjic and the optor student movement then organized nationwide strikes .
a mass demonstration was organized for oct .

tens of thousands flooded into the capital .
by the afternoon , hundreds of thousands of opposition supporters had gathered outside parliament , chanting death to milosevic and calling for kostunica to take power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic things came to a head when it emerged that milosevic -lrb- photo -rrb- had ordered the police to shoot into the crowd and the army to attack from the air - an order refused by generals and police officers .

a few hours later milosevic conceded live on state television . " i congratulate mr kostunica on his election victory and wish the citizens of yugoslavia much success during the new presidents mandate , " milosevic said . yet president kostunica soon fell out with the now reformist prime minister zoran djinjic .
he steadfastly refused djindjic ’ s wish to arrest milosevic and hand him over the war crimes tribunal in the hague . djinjic got his way in the end but lost the support of kostunica ’ s followers in parliament .

a year later kostunica was elected prime minister . more needs to be done since then kostunica has steered his country on the path to reform .
his greatest success came on monday this week , when the eu gave the green light to negotiations over a partnership with serbia-montenegro .
kostunica vowed to push through more reforms . " our laws must come into line with eu laws , the justice system needs to be strengthened and modernized , the constitution of serbia-montenegro needs to be adhered to and we need to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal in the hague , " he said . yet observers remain skeptical that , five years on , serbia is anywhere near having a stable democracy or a functional market economy .

" a balkan mindset " former justice minister vladan batic , one of kostunica ’ s loudest critics , blames the prime minister for blocking reforms .

" it 's just one of a number of ideas on the table at the moment , " the spokesman told afp .
" but it 's still at a very early stage .
there 's no timeframe for it to become law as yet . "
the proposal comes amid concern that bigger , institutional investors such as hedge funds might use low attendance at annual shareholder meetings to push through their own agendas .
earlier this year , london-based hedge funds engineered a boardroom coup to oust the management of stock exchange operator deutsche börse .
attendance at german annual shareholder meetings has been falling for many years .
according figures compiled by the dsw association for small shareholders , the proportion of share capital represented at the annual shareholder meetings of all 30 blue-chip dax companies has fallen from an average 60.95 percent in 1998 to 45.87 percent in 2005 .
car parts maker continental saw the lowest attendance rate this year , with just 23.55 percent of its shareholders turning up at the annual shareholder meeting .
by contrast , the highest attendance rate was henkel , maker of persil washing powder , with 78.31 percent . dw-world.de deutsche börse chief steps down two top executives of the german stock exchage lost their jobs in a struggle with shareholders over a failed takeover bid for the london stock exchange .

" but they said " personnel issues " must be decided before formal coalition negotiations could begin - officials from merkel 's christian democrats then revealed that the parties would sit down on thursday to begin talking through the high-stakes issue . a smiling merkel , who is bidding to become germany 's first woman chancellor , said after two and a half hours of talks with the social democrats : " i would say this was a rather good day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- chairwoman angela merkel , right , and bavarian governor edmund stoiber brief the media in berlin wednesday , oct .

" i feel more optimistic than pessimistic .
we had great success in agreeing on the content -lrb- of a program -rrb- ...
i see a possibility to form a coalition . " schröder agreed , telling reporters : " we have a strong basis for a grand coalition . " way forward the remarks soothed fears that the talks , a third round of exploratory negotiations after the parties finished just four seats apart in legislative elections , would flounder because of the row over who should lead a new government . merkel said the parties would try to cut a deal at a summit of party leaders . " we need to see if we have a basis of trust for coalition talks .
we must see if we can put together our respective households and part of this will be the issue of personnel , " merkel said . however schröder said that more government posts than just the chancellor 's job would have to be discussed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , and social democratic party chairman franz müntefering " i think it has become clear to the union -lrb- christian democrats -rrb- that one can not just settle one issue first , " he said . schröder and merkel have both staked a claim to the chancellery to lead the european union 's biggest country after the september 18 election failed to give either of their parties a governing majority . their only option now appears to join together in a " grand coalition " last seen in germany in the late 1960s . the conservatives have heaped pressure on schröder to back down because as the leader of the biggest parliamentary group , albeit by a hair 's breadth , merkel holds the mandate to form a government . high-stakes poker ? but many observers believe the charismatic chancellor , who has held the post for the past seven years , is playing a political poker game intended to secure the best possible coalition deal for his party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " how much is schröder worth ? " the daily bild asked on wednesday , adding that the social democrats wanted to " sell the chancellery for as much gain as possible . " a poll by the forsa research institute released on wednesday showed that public support for merkel as chancellor has grown , with 34 percent of people canvassed favoring her for the job , compared to 26 percent for schröder . merkel has however faced criticism within her own party by its poor showing at the polls in an election that had seemed hers to win on the back of popular discontent with rising unemployment and schröder 's reform program . on wednesday one of her main rivals within the christian democrats , her former economics strategist friedrich merz , said the fact that only 35.2 percent of voters cast their ballots for the conservatives showed that there was a " problem with the campaign and with the people at the top .

but democratic and economic reforms have made slow progress since then . yugoslav leader slobodan milosevic wasn ’ t going to go without a fight , even when it was clear that vojislav kostunica , the candidate from the 18-party alliance , the serbian democratic opposition , had surprisingly won the 2000 presidential election . opposition leader zoran djindjic and the optor student movement then organized nationwide strikes .

tens of thousands flooded into the capital .
by the afternoon , hundreds of thousands of opposition supporters had gathered outside parliament , chanting death to milosevic and calling for kostunica to take power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic things came to a head when it emerged that milosevic -lrb- photo -rrb- had ordered the police to shoot into the crowd and the army to attack from the air - an order refused by generals and police officers .

a few hours later milosevic conceded live on state television . " i congratulate mr kostunica on his election victory and wish the citizens of yugoslavia much success during the new presidents mandate , " milosevic said . yet president kostunica soon fell out with the now reformist prime minister zoran djinjic .
he steadfastly refused djindjic ’ s wish to arrest milosevic and hand him over the war crimes tribunal in the hague . djinjic got his way in the end but lost the support of kostunica ’ s followers in parliament .

a year later kostunica was elected prime minister . more needs to be done since then kostunica has steered his country on the path to reform .
his greatest success came on monday this week , when the eu gave the green light to negotiations over a partnership with serbia-montenegro .
kostunica vowed to push through more reforms . " our laws must come into line with eu laws , the justice system needs to be strengthened and modernized , the constitution of serbia-montenegro needs to be adhered to and we need to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal in the hague , " he said . yet observers remain skeptical that , five years on , serbia is anywhere near having a stable democracy or a functional market economy .
many former colleagues accuse kostunica of corruption , failing to deal with the past and suppressing political opponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic serbia also needs to hand in all fugitives suspected of committing war crimes , most importantly bosnian serb commander ratko mladic and his then political boss radovan karadzic -lrb- photo -rrb- to the hague tribunal before the country will earn the international community 's trust . " a balkan mindset " former justice minister vladan batic , one of kostunica ’ s loudest critics , blames the prime minister for blocking reforms . " only a few have been arrested , and it was kostunica who put the brakes on .
there ’ s no transparency to the state .
people were prepared to wait for a better standard of living , but they wanted justice , " batic said . last week batic himself was arrested for allegedly releasing a criminal involved in djindjic ’ s murder .
the case was dropped due to lack of evidence . serbia-montenegro human rights minister rasim ljajic told reuters in an interview recently that his country still had a long way to go . " we have an image problem , " ljajic said .

" we have a hiccup right now , " elbaradei , director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , said at a forum on nuclear safety issues in moscow .
" i am optimistic that in the coming months we will see a resumption of these negotiations .
we need to find a face-saving solution . " eu talks with tehran - spearheaded by the so-called eu-3 of britain , france and germany , as well as eu foreign policy chief javier solana - broke down in august after tehran resumed uranium conversion activities .
the united states claims these activities are a cover for developing nuclear weapons . last month the iaea threatened to refer tehran to the un security council over its nuclear program , but not before a november iaea meeting .
the european union has so far resisted calls for iran to be referred to the un , hoping to win pledges from tehran on its nuclear plans , in exchange for trade and other benefits . at wednesday 's forum in moscow , organized by the nuclear threat initiative , a us pressure group , elbaradei said that russia shared the same broad goals as other leading members of the international community as regards iran 's nuclear program .
washington has voiced worries about moscow 's building of the bushehr nuclear power plant in iran , suspecting that this could help tehran develop an offensive nuclear capacity . " i think everybody , russia included , agrees that nobody wants to see iran develop nuclear weapons .
on the strategic goal there is consensus , " elbaradei said .
" russia , like all other members , has been trying to see what is the best tactic to achieve that objective .
you have differences on the best tactics to be pursued , but that is democracy . " diplomat resigns meanwhile , one of iran 's most prominent diplomats , mohammad javad zarif , has resigned as a member of the country 's nuclear negotiating team , the official news agency irna reported wednesday . zarif , who is ambassador to the united nations , is widely considered a moderating influence over foreign policy and in favor of improving ties with the west .
the report , quoting an unidentified source , did not say why zarif quit the nuclear negotiating team , which has been almost totally changed following the june presidential election victory of hardliner mahmoud ahmadinejad . bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad leading negotiator hassan rowhani , also a moderate , was replaced by ultra-conservative ali larijani , who is seen as being at the opposite end of the regime 's political spectrum to diplomats like zarif . tensions with the west have also escalated after iran slammed the door on proposals from britain , france and germany that it abandon fuel-cycle technology in return for incentives , and decided to resume uranium conversion work in defiance of an agreement with the eu-3 . during the tenure of former president mohammad khatami , zarif played an active role in efforts to improve iran 's foreign relations .
he was notably involved in closed-door talks with the united states in 2001 on the formation of a post-taliban government for afghanistan , followed by secret contacts prior to the us invasion of iraq . moderates worried the uncompromising stance of iran 's new hardline authorities in a stand-off over the country 's nuclear program is worrying some iranian officials and leading to overt criticism .
the issue is not whether or not the country should hang on to its nuclear program , but more on how the regime should go about it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani the first to speak out was defeated presidential contender akbar hashemi rafsanjani , who on friday appealed to hardliners to exercise restraint - notably when it came to their increasingly violent rhetoric . " it is about diplomacy rather than slogans , " the still-powerful cleric said in a sermon last week .
" it is about being reasonable , negotiating and being diplomatically active . "
he reminded his fellow iranians that the stakes are " very serious . " on tuesday moderate deputies in the iranian parliament also warned of the economic consequences of international isolation and sanctions , complaining the new nuclear team is " failing to respect national interests in their statements . " in an open letter , the minority group said iran was at a " sensitive stage " and noted the " freefall of the tehran stock exchange " where nuclear jitters are hitting investor confidence .
" sadly , the first action of the government was to change the nuclear negotiators and deprive itself of their experience and the trust they built up , " hassan afarideh , a moderate mp , said in parliament . " certain officials and negotiators keep using threatening and intimidating language .
it is clear we can not reach a result through diplomacy with this kind of language , " he said , taking a clear shot at larijani , who threatened to respond to last month 's tough resolution passed by the iaea by limiting inspections and resuming enrichment . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran wants nuclear talks beyond europe iran does not consider britain , france and germany to be the sole negotiating partners on its nuclear program and believes the process should be opened out beyond europe , the foreign ministry said sunday .

" we have a hiccup right now , " elbaradei , director general of the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , said at a forum on nuclear safety issues in moscow .
" i am optimistic that in the coming months we will see a resumption of these negotiations .
we need to find a face-saving solution . " eu talks with tehran - spearheaded by the so-called eu-3 of britain , france and germany , as well as eu foreign policy chief javier solana - broke down in august after tehran resumed uranium conversion activities .
the united states claims these activities are a cover for developing nuclear weapons . last month the iaea threatened to refer tehran to the un security council over its nuclear program , but not before a november iaea meeting .
the european union has so far resisted calls for iran to be referred to the un , hoping to win pledges from tehran on its nuclear plans , in exchange for trade and other benefits . at wednesday 's forum in moscow , organized by the nuclear threat initiative , a us pressure group , elbaradei said that russia shared the same broad goals as other leading members of the international community as regards iran 's nuclear program .
washington has voiced worries about moscow 's building of the bushehr nuclear power plant in iran , suspecting that this could help tehran develop an offensive nuclear capacity . " i think everybody , russia included , agrees that nobody wants to see iran develop nuclear weapons .
on the strategic goal there is consensus , " elbaradei said .
" russia , like all other members , has been trying to see what is the best tactic to achieve that objective .
you have differences on the best tactics to be pursued , but that is democracy . " diplomat resigns meanwhile , one of iran 's most prominent diplomats , mohammad javad zarif , has resigned as a member of the country 's nuclear negotiating team , the official news agency irna reported wednesday . zarif , who is ambassador to the united nations , is widely considered a moderating influence over foreign policy and in favor of improving ties with the west .
the report , quoting an unidentified source , did not say why zarif quit the nuclear negotiating team , which has been almost totally changed following the june presidential election victory of hardliner mahmoud ahmadinejad . bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad leading negotiator hassan rowhani , also a moderate , was replaced by ultra-conservative ali larijani , who is seen as being at the opposite end of the regime 's political spectrum to diplomats like zarif . tensions with the west have also escalated after iran slammed the door on proposals from britain , france and germany that it abandon fuel-cycle technology in return for incentives , and decided to resume uranium conversion work in defiance of an agreement with the eu-3 . during the tenure of former president mohammad khatami , zarif played an active role in efforts to improve iran 's foreign relations .
he was notably involved in closed-door talks with the united states in 2001 on the formation of a post-taliban government for afghanistan , followed by secret contacts prior to the us invasion of iraq . moderates worried the uncompromising stance of iran 's new hardline authorities in a stand-off over the country 's nuclear program is worrying some iranian officials and leading to overt criticism .
the issue is not whether or not the country should hang on to its nuclear program , but more on how the regime should go about it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani the first to speak out was defeated presidential contender akbar hashemi rafsanjani , who on friday appealed to hardliners to exercise restraint - notably when it came to their increasingly violent rhetoric . " it is about diplomacy rather than slogans , " the still-powerful cleric said in a sermon last week .
" it is about being reasonable , negotiating and being diplomatically active . "
he reminded his fellow iranians that the stakes are " very serious . " on tuesday moderate deputies in the iranian parliament also warned of the economic consequences of international isolation and sanctions , complaining the new nuclear team is " failing to respect national interests in their statements . " in an open letter , the minority group said iran was at a " sensitive stage " and noted the " freefall of the tehran stock exchange " where nuclear jitters are hitting investor confidence .
" sadly , the first action of the government was to change the nuclear negotiators and deprive itself of their experience and the trust they built up , " hassan afarideh , a moderate mp , said in parliament . " certain officials and negotiators keep using threatening and intimidating language .
it is clear we can not reach a result through diplomacy with this kind of language , " he said , taking a clear shot at larijani , who threatened to respond to last month 's tough resolution passed by the iaea by limiting inspections and resuming enrichment . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran wants nuclear talks beyond europe iran does not consider britain , france and germany to be the sole negotiating partners on its nuclear program and believes the process should be opened out beyond europe , the foreign ministry said sunday .

" diplomat resigns meanwhile , one of iran 's most prominent diplomats , mohammad javad zarif , has resigned as a member of the country 's nuclear negotiating team , the official news agency irna reported wednesday . zarif , who is ambassador to the united nations , is widely considered a moderating influence over foreign policy and in favor of improving ties with the west .
the report , quoting an unidentified source , did not say why zarif quit the nuclear negotiating team , which has been almost totally changed following the june presidential election victory of hardliner mahmoud ahmadinejad . bildunterschrift : mahmoud ahmadinejad leading negotiator hassan rowhani , also a moderate , was replaced by ultra-conservative ali larijani , who is seen as being at the opposite end of the regime 's political spectrum to diplomats like zarif . tensions with the west have also escalated after iran slammed the door on proposals from britain , france and germany that it abandon fuel-cycle technology in return for incentives , and decided to resume uranium conversion work in defiance of an agreement with the eu-3 . during the tenure of former president mohammad khatami , zarif played an active role in efforts to improve iran 's foreign relations .
he was notably involved in closed-door talks with the united states in 2001 on the formation of a post-taliban government for afghanistan , followed by secret contacts prior to the us invasion of iraq . moderates worried the uncompromising stance of iran 's new hardline authorities in a stand-off over the country 's nuclear program is worrying some iranian officials and leading to overt criticism .
the issue is not whether or not the country should hang on to its nuclear program , but more on how the regime should go about it . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ali akbar hashemi rafsanjani the first to speak out was defeated presidential contender akbar hashemi rafsanjani , who on friday appealed to hardliners to exercise restraint - notably when it came to their increasingly violent rhetoric . " it is about diplomacy rather than slogans , " the still-powerful cleric said in a sermon last week .
" it is about being reasonable , negotiating and being diplomatically active . "
he reminded his fellow iranians that the stakes are " very serious . " on tuesday moderate deputies in the iranian parliament also warned of the economic consequences of international isolation and sanctions , complaining the new nuclear team is " failing to respect national interests in their statements . " in an open letter , the minority group said iran was at a " sensitive stage " and noted the " freefall of the tehran stock exchange " where nuclear jitters are hitting investor confidence .
" sadly , the first action of the government was to change the nuclear negotiators and deprive itself of their experience and the trust they built up , " hassan afarideh , a moderate mp , said in parliament . " certain officials and negotiators keep using threatening and intimidating language .
it is clear we can not reach a result through diplomacy with this kind of language , " he said , taking a clear shot at larijani , who threatened to respond to last month 's tough resolution passed by the iaea by limiting inspections and resuming enrichment . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran wants nuclear talks beyond europe iran does not consider britain , france and germany to be the sole negotiating partners on its nuclear program and believes the process should be opened out beyond europe , the foreign ministry said sunday .

" but they said " personnel issues " must be decided before formal coalition negotiations could begin - officials from merkel 's christian democrats then revealed that the parties would sit down on thursday to begin talking through the high-stakes issue . a smiling merkel , who is bidding to become germany 's first woman chancellor , said after two and a half hours of talks with the social democrats : " i would say this was a rather good day . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- chairwoman angela merkel , right , and bavarian governor edmund stoiber brief the media in berlin wednesday , oct .

" i feel more optimistic than pessimistic .
we had great success in agreeing on the content -lrb- of a program -rrb- ...
i see a possibility to form a coalition . " schröder agreed , telling reporters : " we have a strong basis for a grand coalition . " way forward the remarks soothed fears that the talks , a third round of exploratory negotiations after the parties finished just four seats apart in legislative elections , would flounder because of the row over who should lead a new government . merkel said the parties would try to cut a deal at a summit of party leaders . " we need to see if we have a basis of trust for coalition talks .
we must see if we can put together our respective households and part of this will be the issue of personnel , " merkel said . however schröder said that more government posts than just the chancellor 's job would have to be discussed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schroeder , left , and social democratic party chairman franz müntefering " i think it has become clear to the union -lrb- christian democrats -rrb- that one can not just settle one issue first , " he said . schröder and merkel have both staked a claim to the chancellery to lead the european union 's biggest country after the september 18 election failed to give either of their parties a governing majority . their only option now appears to join together in a " grand coalition " last seen in germany in the late 1960s . the conservatives have heaped pressure on schröder to back down because as the leader of the biggest parliamentary group , albeit by a hair 's breadth , merkel holds the mandate to form a government . high-stakes poker ? but many observers believe the charismatic chancellor , who has held the post for the past seven years , is playing a political poker game intended to secure the best possible coalition deal for his party . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " how much is schröder worth ? " the daily bild asked on wednesday , adding that the social democrats wanted to " sell the chancellery for as much gain as possible . " a poll by the forsa research institute released on wednesday showed that public support for merkel as chancellor has grown , with 34 percent of people canvassed favoring her for the job , compared to 26 percent for schröder . merkel has however faced criticism within her own party by its poor showing at the polls in an election that had seemed hers to win on the back of popular discontent with rising unemployment and schröder 's reform program . on wednesday one of her main rivals within the christian democrats , her former economics strategist friedrich merz , said the fact that only 35.2 percent of voters cast their ballots for the conservatives showed that there was a " problem with the campaign and with the people at the top .

today , he can take much of the credit for the popularity of the new leipzig school , which has put germany in the international vanguard of fashionable painting . it might be a key date in german history , but oct .
3 , 1990 was a day like any other to gerd harry lybke .
born in 1961 , he 'd been running the leipzig gallery " eigen + art " since 1983 , and did n't necessarily see the west as a land of opportunities . " unification was something i experienced very much from a distance , " he said .
" it was n't obvious what one was supposed to do with it .
and i was n't the sort of person who expected to be welcomed with open arms in the west . " east german repression his checkered career in the gdr had taught lybke not to take anything for granted .
his original career ambition was to be an astronaut , but when he refused an opportunity to study in the soviet union , the communist regime barred him from public service . lybke 's first foray into the art world was as a model for students at the leipzig art school , work not officially recognized by the state .
after getting to know a number of artists , he began organizing private exhibitions in 1983 in his own apartment - an illegal practice which soon brought him to the attention of the east german authorities . " it was bad news , " he said .
" i was n't allowed to study , and my plan to become an actor was nipped in the bud .
there was n't much i was allowed to do . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lybke , right , and his assistant by the time lybke had been " rehabilitated " in 1990 , the berlin wall had fallen and the " eigen + art " gallery in leipzig , which had begun in his front room , had become an integral part of east germany 's subculture .
it had a reputation that had long reached the attention of the west german art scene . international impresario after opening a second branch of the gallery in berlin 's rapidly gentrifying mitte district in 1992 , lybke , the first private gallery owner from the former east to set up shop in the reunited city , went on to foster dozens of fledgling artists , propelling berlin to a secure place on the international art map . berlin might have been an unparalleled business opportunity after unification , but lybke kept his eye on the ball and realized that the real creative potential was back in leipzig . while the new german capital basked in its post-unification glory as a hotbed of burgeoning talent , by the mid 1990s the most exciting art action was unfolding several hundred kilometers east in leipzig , and lybke was playing the role of impresario . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : painting by neo rauch these days , the artists spawned by leipzig 's art school - including neo rauch -lrb- photo -rrb- , martin eder and carsten nicolai - can command prices up to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 60,000 -rrb- , and the man doing the selling is usually lybke . " leipzig has become one of the main hubs for contemporary art , " he said .

some got an a , or a b + , some a c or a d. one writer regularly emerged with the best marks , the mysterious gerald wiley .
no-one knew who this comic genius was , and there were frequent attempts to reveal his identity .
one day , ronnie barker stood up at a dinner and announced that he was gerald wiley .
barry cryer and the other writers did not believe him .
the only reason he had hidden his identity was because he had wanted his material to be included solely on merit barker was a great performer , a man with hundreds of voices and characters - surely he could n't be the best writer as well ?
he was , and the only reason he had hidden his identity was because he had wanted his material to be included solely on merit .
private man looking back on his life , it is a story that seems to define this quiet , private man .
he actively avoided the limelight .
he was not a frequenter of " showbiz parties " , his private life remained private and when he felt that the material was beginning to dry up he quietly retired to run an antique shop in chipping norton .
in many ways he was like another great and often overlooked comedy performer stanley baxter but working with him could be tough .
he had been a performer for more than 20 years before he teamed up with ronnie corbett in the two ronnies , and he knew what worked and what made people laugh .
the routines on the show were often daft , knockabout stuff but to anyone who studied them it was plain how carefully they were rehearsed and structured .
lasting power in many ways he was like another great and often overlooked comedy performer , stanley baxter .
it was the show and the performance which mattered , and in the 1970s and 1980s the stars often had rather more power over their output than they do today .
his surprise reappearance on bbc1 in 2005 in a two ronnies show that featured highlights of their best sketches confirmed that he had created something that had a lasting power to entertain .
we might not have laughed at every joke but there was never any question of turning over an audience of 7.9 million on a saturday night was proof enough .
however , it was not the 17 million they had sometimes brought in , in the 1970s .
and that is a big part of what this is all about .
the affection surrounding him is also wrapped up in an affection for a lost tv era .
porridge 's fletcher was one of barker 's most well formed characters his comedy is a reminder to millions of a time when there was only one tv in the house and everyone seemed to watch the same programme .
we might not have laughed at every joke but there was never any question of turning over .
i might have been only 10 years old but the seemingly never-ending serial about a " phantom raspberry blower " seemed just a bit too daft to laugh at .
nevertheless you always held on to see the funny song and dance at the end .
ronnie barker is like eric morecambe or bruce forsyth , an entertainer everyone of a certain age seemed to like , and you could share with almost anyone you met .
his ability to write and to disappear in to a character and create so many comic personalities made him a very special form of entertainer the joke about confusing four candles with " fork handles " , or the ministry for sex equality , or anyone one of hundreds of others could be mentioned as highlights , but it was the quantity and quality of his output over so many years that made him stand out .

some got an a , or a b + , some a c or a d. one writer regularly emerged with the best marks , the mysterious gerald wiley .
no-one knew who this comic genius was , and there were frequent attempts to reveal his identity .
one day , ronnie barker stood up at a dinner and announced that he was gerald wiley .
barry cryer and the other writers did not believe him .
the only reason he had hidden his identity was because he had wanted his material to be included solely on merit barker was a great performer , a man with hundreds of voices and characters - surely he could n't be the best writer as well ?
he was , and the only reason he had hidden his identity was because he had wanted his material to be included solely on merit .
private man looking back on his life , it is a story that seems to define this quiet , private man .
he actively avoided the limelight .
he was not a frequenter of " showbiz parties " , his private life remained private and when he felt that the material was beginning to dry up he quietly retired to run an antique shop in chipping norton .
in many ways he was like another great and often overlooked comedy performer stanley baxter but working with him could be tough .
he had been a performer for more than 20 years before he teamed up with ronnie corbett in the two ronnies , and he knew what worked and what made people laugh .
the routines on the show were often daft , knockabout stuff but to anyone who studied them it was plain how carefully they were rehearsed and structured .
lasting power in many ways he was like another great and often overlooked comedy performer , stanley baxter .
it was the show and the performance which mattered , and in the 1970s and 1980s the stars often had rather more power over their output than they do today .
his surprise reappearance on bbc1 in 2005 in a two ronnies show that featured highlights of their best sketches confirmed that he had created something that had a lasting power to entertain .
we might not have laughed at every joke but there was never any question of turning over an audience of 7.9 million on a saturday night was proof enough .
however , it was not the 17 million they had sometimes brought in , in the 1970s .
and that is a big part of what this is all about .
the affection surrounding him is also wrapped up in an affection for a lost tv era .
porridge 's fletcher was one of barker 's most well formed characters his comedy is a reminder to millions of a time when there was only one tv in the house and everyone seemed to watch the same programme .
we might not have laughed at every joke but there was never any question of turning over .
i might have been only 10 years old but the seemingly never-ending serial about a " phantom raspberry blower " seemed just a bit too daft to laugh at .
nevertheless you always held on to see the funny song and dance at the end .
ronnie barker is like eric morecambe or bruce forsyth , an entertainer everyone of a certain age seemed to like , and you could share with almost anyone you met .
his ability to write and to disappear in to a character and create so many comic personalities made him a very special form of entertainer the joke about confusing four candles with " fork handles " , or the ministry for sex equality , or anyone one of hundreds of others could be mentioned as highlights , but it was the quantity and quality of his output over so many years that made him stand out .

bbc one has a special programme about the issue at 0915 : the innocents .
on breakfast we spoke to our resident gp dr rosemary leonard and heard from tracey hayter whose son chris has been affected by her alcohol intake while pregnant dr rosemary leonard stressed that pregnant women who have the odd glass of wine should not now worry .
she said the chances of the baby being affected by a small amount of alcohol is very small indeed .
however dr raja mukherjee who is an expert on foetal alcohol spectrum disorder told breakfast that the safest option was for women not to drink at all , once they know that they are pregnant .
we also spoke to tracey hayter .
tracey often drank a bottle of wine a day during her pregnancy - her son chris is now thought to have fasd .
she said that she often did not realise quite how much she was drinking but that when chris was born she realised almost straightaway that there was a problem .
our discussion on fasd guidelines in the uk , the recommended safe weekly intake is one or two units of alcohol - this is because the alcohol in a pregnant woman 's bloodstream transfers into the baby 's .
you should be sure to check with your gp or health worker if you are unsure what a unit is .
it is important to remember that the quantity of alcohol in spirits , wine and beer varies so you must check how many units according to the drink - these are the safe guidelines .
however there have been calls to change the guidelines - and that would mean health professionals would recommend no units during pregnancy .

google aims to " explore opportunities to promote " sun 's openoffice software .
those downloading sun 's java program will be offered google 's toolbar .
word processing and spreadsheet products are some of microsoft 's biggest sales generators , earning the company $ 11bn -lrb- £ 6.3bn -rrb- last year .
microsoft is feeling pressure as firms offer cheaper or free rival products .
changing market " google and java are two of the most widely recognized technology brands because they provide users with online tools that enhance their lives on a day-to-day basis " eric schmidt , google chief executive one of the biggest challenges facing microsoft , the world 's biggest software company , is convincing customers to pay for bundles of software like office and windows when they can find cheaper or free versions elsewhere .
companies like google and sun , meanwhile , are looking to eat further and further into microsoft 's market share .
" working with google will make our technologies more available more broadly , increase options for users , lower barriers and expand participation worldwide , " said scott mcnealy , sun 's chief executive officer .
sun has long supported plans to create more open source software .
the deal may prove to be the first of many projects , the firms said .
google chief executive eric schmidt described the arrangement with sun as " a very significant deal " .
" google and java are two of the most widely recognized technology brands because they provide users with online tools that enhance their lives on a day-to-day basis , " said mr schmidt .
" we look forward to exploring other areas of collaboration . "
java software is needed to run a variety of web applications .

dr dewi evans , consultant paediatrician at singleton hospital , told bbc wales that centralising the city 's health services was a " better use of money " .
health chiefs are set to launch a review on tuesday that will examine the future of swansea 's two main hospitals .
the proposals include moving all critical and emergency services from singleton to morriston within 10 years .
the nhs trust said at this stage all it was doing was examining options and nothing concrete would be proposed for a year .
months of meetings and consultations with staff , patients and other partners are planned if the board approves the review on tuesday .
but dr evans said he thought creating one super hospital made more sense than running two separate hospitals just six miles apart .
he said : " it 's much better if you have the doctors and other staff all under one roof .
' superficial appeal ' " it 's much better for the patients because you can have all the disciplines , all the specialities in the same place .
it makes it more efficient , it 's a better use of money . "
under the proposals , singleton hospital would keep only day care , routine surgery and a nurse-led accident and emergency department .
surgical emergencies , complex surgery and high level intensive care would all be moved to morriston hospital .
but dai lloyd , plaid cymru am for south wales west , said the plans had a " superficial appeal " .
dr evans believes creating a super hospital will save money he said : " the issue is we need better services from the two current district general hospitals now because of our long waiting lists . "
an initial report to be discussed at the meeting states : " anyone looking at swansea from the outside would feel a city of less than 250,000 population would find it difficult to merit two large acute hospitals .
" increasingly , the concentration of specialist skills , the need for multi-disciplinary team working and the avoidance of duplicated facilities , whether diagnostic or supporting , make the idea of a single site acute hospital for swansea a preferred outcome . "
a spokesman for the trust said the project would consider how health services could best be delivered in swansea in the 21st century .
" this project will be firmly based around clinical services and not buildings , " said a spokeswoman .
" in line with welsh assembly government planning guidance , a wide range of options will need to be developed and considered .
" these will include the maintenance of services on two acute sites and the option of moving services to a single acute site . "
any arguments for change would be submitted to the assembly in autumn next year and , if approved , would have to be followed by an outline and full business case .

indonesian police have been questioning two people in connection with saturday 's suicide bombings on the tourist island of bali .
the three bombs exploded within moments of each other at tourist spots on the indonesian island .
police believe radical group jemaah islamiah -lrb- ji -rrb- was behind the bombings at jimbaran and kuta .
photos of the faces of the suspected suicide attackers have been published in local newspapers in an appeal to identify the gang responsible .
the attacks come nearly three years after bombs at two nightclubs killed 202 people in kuta , among them many foreign tourists .

bars and nightclubs closed and half way through the concert on the beach had to be cancelled .
everyone stayed at their hotels that night in fear and to scared to walk the streets of kuta .
i flew out on sunday night to sydney and people could n't get out of the country quick enough .
lee , banny , joe , ani , yama , taufiq please be safe .
jacky pew , swansea it is with a heavy heart , that i have been seeing the tourists disappear off the streets in kuta , as several governments have warned of further terrorist attacks .
i hope that the balinese people do not suffer any more , economically and physically , as they have been amongst the most welcoming of all peoples that i have met on my travels .
matthew pfaff , kuta , bali bali relies on tourism for there way of life but these terrorists are discouraging people from going there .
daniel , brisbane , australia i was in bali this summer , living in a hotel in kuta and working in jimbaran beach .
i was devastated to hear about these bombs .
the balinese have worked so hard to encourage return tourism to bali since the last bombings , and they were finally beginning to succeed .
this is an amazing country with the most helpful and friendly people i have ever met .
to not go to bali is giving the terrorists what they want .
i had an amazing time there and would go back tomorrow given the opportunity .
michelle dubbin , oxford , uk " the message is simple : people are staying , in droves , and it 's business as usual " nils wetterlind , bali , indonesia i returned back home to bali yesterday and was happily surprised that the flight from singapore was 80 % full .
arriving at ngurah rai airport , there were lines at immigration and the usual buss outside arrivals .
driving home through seminyak , i got held up in a traffic jam .
this morning , it took me longer than usual to get to work ; too many cars on the road .
at work -lrb- i have a property company -rrb- , we sold two houses , at full asking price .
so the message is simple : people are staying , in droves , and it 's business as usual .
take that , ji !
not even your murderous terror acts prevent people from loving bali , this wonderful island of the gods .
nils wetterlind , bali , indonesia i was in bali at the time of oct 2002 bombings -lrb- though not at the bombed site at the specific time -rrb- and i can only say that bali is an exemplary place of beauty , peace and kindness which is , unfortunately made victim of muslim political radicalism .
these terrorists wish to have the beautiful bali -lrb- like all beautiful and peaceful places on earth -rrb- disappear .
i had seen the balinese people grieving , crying and praying after the 2002 bombings ; i was touched very much by their grief and sensitivity .
sissy papagiannidi , athens , greece having returned from bali on the 3rd of october i can say that the only down part of my time over there was the bombings on my final evening .
staying in nusa dus i was a few kilometres away from the affected areas but could see the pain in the locals faces when the news spread .
although most are very poor the people are diamonds in this gem-filled paradise and my heart goes out to them as well as to those who suffered directly on this terrible night of murder and mayhem .
martin fittall , herne bay , england i have been in bali four times , and i am due to go to bali in the next two weeks .
i must admit that i was shock at first when i heard this terrible news of second bali attack , but i will never let those mindless perpetrators to ruin any parts of my normal life .
my heart goes to balinese people , and looking anxiously to meeting them very soon .
may holy hindu god be with you .
nadda , chiangmai , thailand this is very sad for not only the people of bali but also those on lombok - bali 's sister island .
we have just come back from lombok last week and what nobody has mentioned is that what happens to the tourist trade on bali affects lombok and the effects are much worse as lombok is normally only visited for just few nights by those tourists who have visited bali .
glen , woking , uk my husband and i had been toying with the idea of a trip to bali early next year .
our minds were made for us after another pointless attack last weekend .
the dignity and the celebration of life the bali people have displayed in recent days has convinced us this is still our dream destination .
and we will not be deterred by any terror group there , or anywhere else in the world .
sharon hughes , portsmouth we just arrived back from holiday in bali last week and i feel so sorry for the lovely people of bali who were just starting to get back on their feet following the incidents in 2002 .
i wish them well and hope the country can look forward to a safer future .
karen morris , guildford england i am an australian and have been living in the uk for nearly two years , i 'm about to leave and return home permanently and i have included a bali stopover in my trip and i wo n't be changing those plans .
this will be my sixth visit to the lovely island and anyone who has been there knows how important it is for their economy that we continue to holiday with the beautiful people of bali , no where in this world is safe while we have these types of terrorists among us , i am so saddened and scared but i refuse to stop my way of life to hand them any kind of victory !
donna stephens , whitchurch , england / rye , australia " i feel safer in bali even with the bombs " andrea , atlanta , georgia usa i was in bali this past january .
it is a wonderful place , with such kind and gentle people .
they are hurting immensely from the 2002 bombing and kept asking us to please tell people to come back to bali .
in spite of this latest bombing , i would still return .
i live in a large american city , and quite frankly , i feel safer in bali even with the bombs .
there is more to bali than kuta beach and jimbaran .
we must continue to support these people .
they are innocent in these bombings and their livelihood depends on us .
andrea , atlanta , georgia usa my girlfriend and i are just back from two great weeks in bali and having visited both places which have been devastated , my thoughts are with all of the balinese people and those that have been affected .
having read the other comments it is clear that everyone had the same experiences as we did ie lovely , warm , hardworking people , living on a beautiful island , who do n't deserve such mindless attacks .
if anyone reading this is about to go to bali my advice would be go .
bali needs you now more than ever .
mark davidson , edinburgh , scotland i am a painter living less than 300m from the jimbaran bomb blast .
i have a fine art gallery less than 200m away .
i fortunately cancelled my planned birthday dinner at the jimbaran seafood cafes , the site of the bomb blast , as my mother was too tired to attend .
we heard the bombs from my home on the hill overlooking the jimbaran beach .
are we convinced of our right to freedom and peace ?
i ask our two most powerful world leaders , george bush and tony blair , in the name of those who died last night - what primary actions have you taken and not taken ?
how did this violence come to be ?
zante gabriela-alexandria , british living in bali i was in kuta three months after the 2002 attack , determined to go no matter what .
it was unsettling .
tourist numbers were down by 90 % and the place resembled a ghost town .
the contrast with the old , lively and busy bali was unnerving .
sadly , i 'm quite pessimistic about the future of bali now .
this is a terrible setback for the local people , who have worked so hard to get back on track after the first bombing .
i wish them strength .
stephanie , london , uk i would like to know how i can help .
are any organisations looking for volunteers ?
katie stones , huddersfield , england we recently returned from bali and much to our surprise , we did not have to pass through immigration or customs when we entered bali .
a security officer waved us through , stating " they 've gone home " !
catherine trencher , boynton beach , fl .
usa " bali will recover , and be stronger for it all " mike teaney , nusa dua , bali we have moved to bali recently to start a new life .
the balinese are a friendly fun-loving people , who make you feel welcome wherever you go .
speaking to them over the past few days , they can only ask what they have done wrong to deserve this .
one thing they are sure of is that bali will recover , and be stronger for it all .
mike teaney , nusa dua , bali my husband and i have just returned from our honeymoon in bali and we could not have chosen a nicer place .
everywhere we went the balinese people were so nice and welcoming to us .
they catered for our every need and made our stay absolutely fantastic .
we hired cabs to drive us around during the day and evening and we travelled quite a bit and trusted the taxi drivers / guides as they were all so honest and genuinely wanted us to have a nice time exploring their beautiful country .
i am truly saddened at what has happened .
it 's a real shame as bali was just picking up again after the last bombing .
i do n't think people really know how the locals suffer at the hands of these suicide bombers .
obviously , i guess travellers will be reluctant to travel to bali but please do n't totally abandon going .
it 's so lovely and the balinese people very warm and friendly .
christine williams , luton , england i was in kuta , bali in august with my family and found the people there were just so lovely and friendly .
we spoke to one young waiter who told us the last bombings had devastated their tourist trade but they were just beginning to build back up again .
this must be sole destroying for them .
our thoughts are with those people and those families of the victims .
elsie hodges , bristol , uk my wife and i returned from holiday in bali three weeks ago - our third time there .
our hearts go out to the dead and injured but we feel very much for the people of bali - the most welcoming and friendly people anywhere in the world .
do n't stop going - they need our support and they need tourists to survive .
our thoughts and good wishes are with them and words can not express how we feel about the mindless perpetrators of the carnage .
keith millar , aberdeen , scotland i left bali just over 10 days ago and i am shocked and saddened at what has happened .
i was in kuta square just over two weeks ago and i noticed then that there was a lot of security around .
the balinese people are crying out for tourists to come back to the island , many locals asked us to come back next year and to bring our friends and family with us .
the island has so much to offer and the people are amazing .
we should n't let terrorists put us off travelling there - it is no different to going to london these days .
i am hoping to go back in april and will not let these terrorists put me off .
katie clarke , basingstoke , uk only a week ago we spent the most wonderful time at jimbaran beach and kuta .
the video and pictures we made will never be the same .
there will always be a spot of sadness when looking at them .
there is a lot of sorrow in me while thinking of those friendly balinese people who need us tourist so much .
there also is so much anger inside of me against those criminals who did this .
on and on i am asking why ?
sukeirda , amsterdam , netherlands i visited indonesia in the month of september and spent a week in bali , kuta specifically , approximately 1 week prior to the most recent senseless attack .
my eyes were opened upon witnessing the beauty and the kindness that i saw in the whole of indonesia .
i can not quite absorb this fully yet .
it leaves me with a feeling of powerlessness , and i struggle with my desire to help the people of bali and all of indonesia alike .
deeply saddened by witnessing the reality that the human race is prepared to destroy harmony and peace in such a way .
my deepest condolences are with the country and people of indonesia , and the families affected by all the related attacks .
michael mccoy , new york , new york i am a balinese .
it is a coincident that i was -lrb- in 2002 -rrb- and i am now in the uk doing research when the blast occurred .
i have a mix up feeling : sad , up set , and concern .
i hope bali and its people will become stronger .
i do appreciate the supports that are addressed to bali .
arya thanaya , leeds , uk i was in bali when the terrorists attacked in 2002 .
indeed , i lived only a few meters from the location of the bombing .
this year bombing has certainly brought back our sad memory .
i still remember very clearly how the balinese people tried very hard to get back on their feet .
a few months ago , my friend in bali told me that bali was busy again , tourism has lived again .
now , the terrorists attack again for the second time .
i just hope that the balinese people will be tougher .
iyan nurmansyah , an indonesian living in brighton i 'm due to go to bali in january , and am more determined now than ever .
having lived with 30 years of terrorism in northern ireland , the only thing to do is to clear up the mess and rebuild even stronger .
the people of bali need our support now more than ever and i for one intend to give them mine .
david , london , uk i am a british ex-pat living and working in indonesia .
i was not aware of the blasts in bali until i started receiving a flurry of telephone calls from the uk .
it saddens me to learn that there are still people out there who intend on this mindless violence .
indonesia needs the support of foreign tourists , i have lived here seven years and must stress that this violence is not the general attitude of indonesian people .
anthony clark , jakarta , indonesia " the people of bali are so welcoming and friendly and have feared the economic impact of more bombs . "
hayley hanratty , london , england i arrived back in london on saturday morning after my husband and i enjoyed our honeymoon on bali .
the sadness that i feel on hearing about the bombs can not be expressed in words .
the consequences are much greater than the loss of innocent lives and serious injuries .
the people of bali are so welcoming and friendly and have feared the economic impact of more bombs .
one example is a baliense man who we became friends with called eddie and his wife who both work in tourist surf shops .
they are expecting their first child .
their family 's future depends heavily on tourism , like so many other local people .
my thoughts are with all those on the beautiful island of bali .
hayley hanratty , london , england i spent the last month of my travels in bali before returning home in august and i left my heart there .
the balinese people need our support to help them back on their feet and they have my thoughts and prayers .
natalie george , london we left bali two days ago to continue our travels to malaysia .
our time there was so fantastic , the people so friendly and the island so beautiful ... it is such a shame .
while we were there we visited the memorial to those who lost their lives in the bombs of 2002 ... it is really upsetting to think that another memorial may have to be erected .
one hopes that the spirit of the balinese people will not be diminished by recent events our thoughts and prayers are with them .
zoe shaughnessy , london , england i arrived back from bali yesterday and had noticed that the security at our hotel at the conrad had been stepped up towards the end of last week .
instead of the usual hotel security , there was an armed guard .
the night before we left we went to pj 's at the four seasons hotel at jimbaran beach , i ca n't believe that i was so close to what was going to happen the next day .
i also visited kuta beach several times and saw the area where the bomb went off , i know it would have been really busy with tourists at that time .
my heart goes out to the balinese as they were talking about how they felt that life was just starting to get back to normal after the 2002 bombing .
they are the nicest people you could want to meet and they are so grateful to have tourism within their country , as it is the only form of income they have .
i will say a prayer tonight for all the balinese people .
martine alexander , manchester , uk i am deeply saddened by the news of the bali blasts .
my husband and i returned from bali almost two weeks ago .
it is a beautiful , enchanting and captivating place .
my heart goes out to all of bali and its charming , warm and welcoming people .
mrs paula warburton , lincolnshire , england this is clearly timed to coincide with the recent massive rise in the price of fuel in indonesia : the bombers want to destabilise the country and shake faith in the president .
martin percy , former long-term resident of indonesia " the scene of total desolation was in place with whispers of help from people who had been injured " mike gallagher , salisbury , uk i saw myself on one of your pics carrying an injured man into an ambulance .
his name is bruce and his wife had been injured and had already been rushed of to hospital .
i was 2 tables away from the second explosion .
after the first explosion on the beach , people were generally unsure as to what it was until the second explosion when the realization dawned on us that they were bombs .
the effect caused a ripple of running people in all directions .
the scene of total desolation was in place with whispers of help from people who had been injured a half buried in the sand .
to think that 5 mins earlier the whole place was the busiest i had seen since coming here .
mike gallagher , salisbury , uk we need to have a central web site where loved ones can go when such tragedies occur to help reunite family members .
i 've come across a few but we need our governments to get behind the idea .
here is an example www.lookingforsurvivors.com angelo , australia i am from england working here and i was out with me mates when we heard a big bang !
we ran out side of the shop we were in and saw just destruction !
people on the ground and blood everywhere !
ryan , kuta / ex england i 'm in kuta now .
manic on the streets , no one really knows what 's going on .
i saw people running and crying .
police telling everyone where to go .
all tourists have given up for the night , everyone trying to get internet access , nightspots are empty .
there 's an air of unease and unrest here .
george maccallum , greenwich , london i left kuta this morning due to a last minute change of plan .
i feel a mixture of guilt and luck to have left just in time .
my thoughts are with the local people who are re-living the horrors of the 2002 bombings and for all the injured .
grainne tierney , london , uk i left bali yesterday and am obviously shocked by the recent events in .
what i think saddens me the most if how friendly and hospitable i found people in indonesia and their eagerness for tourists to enjoy and return to their country .
with two bombings in three years tourism and along with it a lot of livelihoods will be lost , and for this i feel for the people of bali .
sally rice , wickham , hampshire i live in the kuta area and heard three explosions .
one hit the hard rock cafe area in kuta .
another was in front of the four seasons beach resort in jimbaran bay on the other side of the airport from kuta .
the third was apparently somewhere in the nusa dua resort area .
anon we were 40-50 meters away from the two explosions on jimbaran beach in pj 's restaurant in the four seasons .
we heard one loud explosion whereby everyone immediately stood up and thought the worst .
it was followed by another about 25 seconds later .
i believe they targeted a local open air fish market restaurant run by the balanise with no security .
we were the first out of there but saw two wounded by the roadside , one with shoulder and one with perhaps minor head injuries .
the first explosion seemed weak and for a split second we wondered if it was a large firework .
the second was slightly louder and we could see the smoke drift across the beach in front of us as people slipped from their tables on the beach to our right .
otherwise everyone seemed to be very rational , however i did n't witness events in the area of the immediate explosion .
my sympathy to all involved .
dan delhomme , stevenage , england i was in jimbaran bay when i heard two explosions closely follow by one another .
i was at a restaurant called ganesa at the time .
there is massive traffic in kuta .
still waiting for more details to flow in .
robert holmes , uk i am an english ex-pat living and working in indonesia .
it is terrible to hear this news about another attack on innocent victims .
however having lived in jakarta for the past three years i must remind people that indonesia is a safe place and the people are incredibly hospitable and warm .
this is nothing more than a mindless attack from a crazed minority and not a reflection of indonesians general attitude towards foreigners .
jeremy , jakarta , indonesia my heart goes out to the indonesian people .
be sure that the hearts of the australian people are with you and condemn these cowardly attacks on innocent people wayno , melbourne australia we were having dinner just down the road from the kuta explosion when it happened .
the noise was deafening .
like a thousand fireworks going off at one time .
people are still being transported to hospital from the site .
it seems like chaos .

this morning , it took me longer than usual to get to work ; too many cars on the road .
at work -lrb- i have a property company -rrb- , we sold two houses , at full asking price .
so the message is simple : people are staying , in droves , and it 's business as usual .
take that , ji !
not even your murderous terror acts prevent people from loving bali , this wonderful island of the gods .
nils wetterlind , bali , indonesia i was in bali at the time of oct 2002 bombings -lrb- though not at the bombed site at the specific time -rrb- and i can only say that bali is an exemplary place of beauty , peace and kindness which is , unfortunately made victim of muslim political radicalism .
these terrorists wish to have the beautiful bali -lrb- like all beautiful and peaceful places on earth -rrb- disappear .
i had seen the balinese people grieving , crying and praying after the 2002 bombings ; i was touched very much by their grief and sensitivity .
sissy papagiannidi , athens , greece having returned from bali on the 3rd of october i can say that the only down part of my time over there was the bombings on my final evening .
staying in nusa dus i was a few kilometres away from the affected areas but could see the pain in the locals faces when the news spread .
although most are very poor the people are diamonds in this gem-filled paradise and my heart goes out to them as well as to those who suffered directly on this terrible night of murder and mayhem .
martin fittall , herne bay , england i have been in bali four times , and i am due to go to bali in the next two weeks .
i must admit that i was shock at first when i heard this terrible news of second bali attack , but i will never let those mindless perpetrators to ruin any parts of my normal life .
my heart goes to balinese people , and looking anxiously to meeting them very soon .
may holy hindu god be with you .
nadda , chiangmai , thailand this is very sad for not only the people of bali but also those on lombok - bali 's sister island .
we have just come back from lombok last week and what nobody has mentioned is that what happens to the tourist trade on bali affects lombok and the effects are much worse as lombok is normally only visited for just few nights by those tourists who have visited bali .
glen , woking , uk my husband and i had been toying with the idea of a trip to bali early next year .
our minds were made for us after another pointless attack last weekend .
the dignity and the celebration of life the bali people have displayed in recent days has convinced us this is still our dream destination .
and we will not be deterred by any terror group there , or anywhere else in the world .
sharon hughes , portsmouth we just arrived back from holiday in bali last week and i feel so sorry for the lovely people of bali who were just starting to get back on their feet following the incidents in 2002 .
i wish them well and hope the country can look forward to a safer future .
karen morris , guildford england i am an australian and have been living in the uk for nearly two years , i 'm about to leave and return home permanently and i have included a bali stopover in my trip and i wo n't be changing those plans .
this will be my sixth visit to the lovely island and anyone who has been there knows how important it is for their economy that we continue to holiday with the beautiful people of bali , no where in this world is safe while we have these types of terrorists among us , i am so saddened and scared but i refuse to stop my way of life to hand them any kind of victory !
donna stephens , whitchurch , england / rye , australia i feel safer in bali even with the bombs andrea , atlanta , georgia usa i was in bali this past january .
it is a wonderful place , with such kind and gentle people .
they are hurting immensely from the 2002 bombing and kept asking us to please tell people to come back to bali .
in spite of this latest bombing , i would still return .
i live in a large american city , and quite frankly , i feel safer in bali even with the bombs .
there is more to bali than kuta beach and jimbaran .
we must continue to support these people .
they are innocent in these bombings and their livelihood depends on us .
andrea , atlanta , georgia usa my girlfriend and i are just back from two great weeks in bali and having visited both places which have been devastated , my thoughts are with all of the balinese people and those that have been affected .
having read the other comments it is clear that everyone had the same experiences as we did ie lovely , warm , hardworking people , living on a beautiful island , who do n't deserve such mindless attacks .
if anyone reading this is about to go to bali my advice would be go .
bali needs you now more than ever .
mark davidson , edinburgh , scotland i am a painter living less than 300m from the jimbaran bomb blast .
i have a fine art gallery less than 200m away .
i fortunately cancelled my planned birthday dinner at the jimbaran seafood cafes , the site of the bomb blast , as my mother was too tired to attend .
we heard the bombs from my home on the hill overlooking the jimbaran beach .
are we convinced of our right to freedom and peace ?
i ask our two most powerful world leaders , george bush and tony blair , in the name of those who died last night - what primary actions have you taken and not taken ?
how did this violence come to be ?
zante gabriela-alexandria , british living in bali i was in kuta three months after the 2002 attack , determined to go no matter what .
it was unsettling .
tourist numbers were down by 90 % and the place resembled a ghost town .
the contrast with the old , lively and busy bali was unnerving .
sadly , i 'm quite pessimistic about the future of bali now .
this is a terrible setback for the local people , who have worked so hard to get back on track after the first bombing .
i wish them strength .
stephanie , london , uk i would like to know how i can help .
are any organisations looking for volunteers ?
katie stones , huddersfield , england we recently returned from bali and much to our surprise , we did not have to pass through immigration or customs when we entered bali .
a security officer waved us through , stating " they 've gone home " !
catherine trencher , boynton beach , fl .
usa bali will recover , and be stronger for it all mike teaney , nusa dua , bali we have moved to bali recently to start a new life .
the balinese are a friendly fun-loving people , who make you feel welcome wherever you go .
speaking to them over the past few days , they can only ask what they have done wrong to deserve this .
one thing they are sure of is that bali will recover , and be stronger for it all .
mike teaney , nusa dua , bali my husband and i have just returned from our honeymoon in bali and we could not have chosen a nicer place .
everywhere we went the balinese people were so nice and welcoming to us .
they catered for our every need and made our stay absolutely fantastic .
we hired cabs to drive us around during the day and evening and we travelled quite a bit and trusted the taxi drivers / guides as they were all so honest and genuinely wanted us to have a nice time exploring their beautiful country .
i am truly saddened at what has happened .
it 's a real shame as bali was just picking up again after the last bombing .
i do n't think people really know how the locals suffer at the hands of these suicide bombers .
obviously , i guess travellers will be reluctant to travel to bali but please do n't totally abandon going .
it 's so lovely and the balinese people very warm and friendly .
christine williams , luton , england i was in kuta , bali in august with my family and found the people there were just so lovely and friendly .
we spoke to one young waiter who told us the last bombings had devastated their tourist trade but they were just beginning to build back up again .
this must be sole destroying for them .
our thoughts are with those people and those families of the victims .
elsie hodges , bristol , uk my wife and i returned from holiday in bali three weeks ago - our third time there .
our hearts go out to the dead and injured but we feel very much for the people of bali - the most welcoming and friendly people anywhere in the world .
do n't stop going - they need our support and they need tourists to survive .
our thoughts and good wishes are with them and words can not express how we feel about the mindless perpetrators of the carnage .
keith millar , aberdeen , scotland i left bali just over 10 days ago and i am shocked and saddened at what has happened .
i was in kuta square just over two weeks ago and i noticed then that there was a lot of security around .
the balinese people are crying out for tourists to come back to the island , many locals asked us to come back next year and to bring our friends and family with us .
the island has so much to offer and the people are amazing .
we should n't let terrorists put us off travelling there - it is no different to going to london these days .
i am hoping to go back in april and will not let these terrorists put me off .
katie clarke , basingstoke , uk only a week ago we spent the most wonderful time at jimbaran beach and kuta .
the video and pictures we made will never be the same .
there will always be a spot of sadness when looking at them .
there is a lot of sorrow in me while thinking of those friendly balinese people who need us tourist so much .
there also is so much anger inside of me against those criminals who did this .
on and on i am asking why ?
sukeirda , amsterdam , netherlands i visited indonesia in the month of september and spent a week in bali , kuta specifically , approximately 1 week prior to the most recent senseless attack .
my eyes were opened upon witnessing the beauty and the kindness that i saw in the whole of indonesia .
i can not quite absorb this fully yet .
it leaves me with a feeling of powerlessness , and i struggle with my desire to help the people of bali and all of indonesia alike .
deeply saddened by witnessing the reality that the human race is prepared to destroy harmony and peace in such a way .
my deepest condolences are with the country and people of indonesia , and the families affected by all the related attacks .
michael mccoy , new york , new york i am a balinese .
it is a coincident that i was -lrb- in 2002 -rrb- and i am now in the uk doing research when the blast occurred .
i have a mix up feeling : sad , up set , and concern .
i hope bali and its people will become stronger .
i do appreciate the supports that are addressed to bali .
arya thanaya , leeds , uk i was in bali when the terrorists attacked in 2002 .
indeed , i lived only a few meters from the location of the bombing .
this year bombing has certainly brought back our sad memory .
i still remember very clearly how the balinese people tried very hard to get back on their feet .
a few months ago , my friend in bali told me that bali was busy again , tourism has lived again .
now , the terrorists attack again for the second time .
i just hope that the balinese people will be tougher .
iyan nurmansyah , an indonesian living in brighton i 'm due to go to bali in january , and am more determined now than ever .
having lived with 30 years of terrorism in northern ireland , the only thing to do is to clear up the mess and rebuild even stronger .
the people of bali need our support now more than ever and i for one intend to give them mine .
david , london , uk i am a british ex-pat living and working in indonesia .
i was not aware of the blasts in bali until i started receiving a flurry of telephone calls from the uk .
it saddens me to learn that there are still people out there who intend on this mindless violence .
indonesia needs the support of foreign tourists , i have lived here seven years and must stress that this violence is not the general attitude of indonesian people .
anthony clark , jakarta , indonesia the people of bali are so welcoming and friendly and have feared the economic impact of more bombs .
hayley hanratty , london , england i arrived back in london on saturday morning after my husband and i enjoyed our honeymoon on bali .
the sadness that i feel on hearing about the bombs can not be expressed in words .
the consequences are much greater than the loss of innocent lives and serious injuries .
the people of bali are so welcoming and friendly and have feared the economic impact of more bombs .
one example is a baliense man who we became friends with called eddie and his wife who both work in tourist surf shops .
they are expecting their first child .
their family 's future depends heavily on tourism , like so many other local people .
my thoughts are with all those on the beautiful island of bali .
hayley hanratty , london , england i spent the last month of my travels in bali before returning home in august and i left my heart there .
the balinese people need our support to help them back on their feet and they have my thoughts and prayers .
natalie george , london we left bali two days ago to continue our travels to malaysia .
our time there was so fantastic , the people so friendly and the island so beautiful ... it is such a shame .
while we were there we visited the memorial to those who lost their lives in the bombs of 2002 ... it is really upsetting to think that another memorial may have to be erected .
one hopes that the spirit of the balinese people will not be diminished by recent events our thoughts and prayers are with them .
zoe shaughnessy , london , england i arrived back from bali yesterday and had noticed that the security at our hotel at the conrad had been stepped up towards the end of last week .
instead of the usual hotel security , there was an armed guard .
the night before we left we went to pj 's at the four seasons hotel at jimbaran beach , i ca n't believe that i was so close to what was going to happen the next day .
i also visited kuta beach several times and saw the area where the bomb went off , i know it would have been really busy with tourists at that time .
my heart goes out to the balinese as they were talking about how they felt that life was just starting to get back to normal after the 2002 bombing .
they are the nicest people you could want to meet and they are so grateful to have tourism within their country , as it is the only form of income they have .
i will say a prayer tonight for all the balinese people .
martine alexander , manchester , uk i am deeply saddened by the news of the bali blasts .
my husband and i returned from bali almost two weeks ago .
it is a beautiful , enchanting and captivating place .
my heart goes out to all of bali and its charming , warm and welcoming people .
mrs paula warburton , lincolnshire , england this is clearly timed to coincide with the recent massive rise in the price of fuel in indonesia : the bombers want to destabilise the country and shake faith in the president .
martin percy , former long-term resident of indonesia the scene of total desolation was in place with whispers of help from people who had been injured mike gallagher , salisbury , uk i saw myself on one of your pics carrying an injured man into an ambulance .
his name is bruce and his wife had been injured and had already been rushed of to hospital .
i was 2 tables away from the second explosion .
after the first explosion on the beach , people were generally unsure as to what it was until the second explosion when the realization dawned on us that they were bombs .
the effect caused a ripple of running people in all directions .
the scene of total desolation was in place with whispers of help from people who had been injured a half buried in the sand .
to think that 5 mins earlier the whole place was the busiest i had seen since coming here .
mike gallagher , salisbury , uk we need to have a central web site where loved ones can go when such tragedies occur to help reunite family members .
i 've come across a few but we need our governments to get behind the idea .
here is an example www.lookingforsurvivors.com angelo , australia i am from england working here and i was out with me mates when we heard a big bang !
we ran out side of the shop we were in and saw just destruction !
people on the ground and blood everywhere !
ryan , kuta / ex england i 'm in kuta now .
manic on the streets , no one really knows what 's going on .
i saw people running and crying .
police telling everyone where to go .
all tourists have given up for the night , everyone trying to get internet access , nightspots are empty .
there 's an air of unease and unrest here .
george maccallum , greenwich , london i left kuta this morning due to a last minute change of plan .
i feel a mixture of guilt and luck to have left just in time .
my thoughts are with the local people who are re-living the horrors of the 2002 bombings and for all the injured .
grainne tierney , london , uk i left bali yesterday and am obviously shocked by the recent events in .
what i think saddens me the most if how friendly and hospitable i found people in indonesia and their eagerness for tourists to enjoy and return to their country .
with two bombings in three years tourism and along with it a lot of livelihoods will be lost , and for this i feel for the people of bali .
sally rice , wickham , hampshire i live in the kuta area and heard three explosions .
one hit the hard rock cafe area in kuta .
another was in front of the four seasons beach resort in jimbaran bay on the other side of the airport from kuta .
the third was apparently somewhere in the nusa dua resort area .
anon we were 40-50 meters away from the two explosions on jimbaran beach in pj 's restaurant in the four seasons .
we heard one loud explosion whereby everyone immediately stood up and thought the worst .
it was followed by another about 25 seconds later .
i believe they targeted a local open air fish market restaurant run by the balanise with no security .
we were the first out of there but saw two wounded by the roadside , one with shoulder and one with perhaps minor head injuries .
the first explosion seemed weak and for a split second we wondered if it was a large firework .
the second was slightly louder and we could see the smoke drift across the beach in front of us as people slipped from their tables on the beach to our right .
otherwise everyone seemed to be very rational , however i did n't witness events in the area of the immediate explosion .
my sympathy to all involved .
dan delhomme , stevenage , england i was in jimbaran bay when i heard two explosions closely follow by one another .
i was at a restaurant called ganesa at the time .
there is massive traffic in kuta .
still waiting for more details to flow in .
robert holmes , uk i am an english ex-pat living and working in indonesia .
it is terrible to hear this news about another attack on innocent victims .
however having lived in jakarta for the past three years i must remind people that indonesia is a safe place and the people are incredibly hospitable and warm .
this is nothing more than a mindless attack from a crazed minority and not a reflection of indonesians general attitude towards foreigners .
jeremy , jakarta , indonesia my heart goes out to the indonesian people .
be sure that the hearts of the australian people are with you and condemn these cowardly attacks on innocent people wayno , melbourne australia we were having dinner just down the road from the kuta explosion when it happened .
the noise was deafening .
like a thousand fireworks going off at one time .
people are still being transported to hospital from the site .
it seems like chaos .

i flew out on sunday night to sydney and people could n't get out of the country quick enough .
lee , banny , joe , ani , yama , taufiq please be safe .
jacky pew , swansea it is with a heavy heart , that i have been seeing the tourists disappear off the streets in kuta , as several governments have warned of further terrorist attacks .
i hope that the balinese people do not suffer any more , economically and physically , as they have been amongst the most welcoming of all peoples that i have met on my travels .
matthew pfaff , kuta , bali bali relies on tourism for there way of life but these terrorists are discouraging people from going there .
daniel , brisbane , australia i was in bali this summer , living in a hotel in kuta and working in jimbaran beach .
i was devastated to hear about these bombs .
the balinese have worked so hard to encourage return tourism to bali since the last bombings , and they were finally beginning to succeed .
this is an amazing country with the most helpful and friendly people i have ever met .
to not go to bali is giving the terrorists what they want .
i had an amazing time there and would go back tomorrow given the opportunity .

arya thanaya , leeds , uk i was in bali when the terrorists attacked in 2002 .
indeed , i lived only a few meters from the location of the bombing .
this year bombing has certainly brought back our sad memory .
i still remember very clearly how the balinese people tried very hard to get back on their feet .
a few months ago , my friend in bali told me that bali was busy again , tourism has lived again .
now , the terrorists attack again for the second time .
i just hope that the balinese people will be tougher .
iyan nurmansyah , an indonesian living in brighton i 'm due to go to bali in january , and am more determined now than ever .
having lived with 30 years of terrorism in northern ireland , the only thing to do is to clear up the mess and rebuild even stronger .
the people of bali need our support now more than ever and i for one intend to give them mine .
david , london , uk i am a british ex-pat living and working in indonesia .
i was not aware of the blasts in bali until i started receiving a flurry of telephone calls from the uk .
it saddens me to learn that there are still people out there who intend on this mindless violence .
indonesia needs the support of foreign tourists , i have lived here seven years and must stress that this violence is not the general attitude of indonesian people .
anthony clark , jakarta , indonesia the people of bali are so welcoming and friendly and have feared the economic impact of more bombs .
hayley hanratty , london , england i arrived back in london on saturday morning after my husband and i enjoyed our honeymoon on bali .
the sadness that i feel on hearing about the bombs can not be expressed in words .
the consequences are much greater than the loss of innocent lives and serious injuries .
the people of bali are so welcoming and friendly and have feared the economic impact of more bombs .
one example is a baliense man who we became friends with called eddie and his wife who both work in tourist surf shops .
they are expecting their first child .
their family 's future depends heavily on tourism , like so many other local people .
my thoughts are with all those on the beautiful island of bali .
hayley hanratty , london , england i spent the last month of my travels in bali before returning home in august and i left my heart there .
the balinese people need our support to help them back on their feet and they have my thoughts and prayers .
natalie george , london we left bali two days ago to continue our travels to malaysia .
our time there was so fantastic , the people so friendly and the island so beautiful ... it is such a shame .
while we were there we visited the memorial to those who lost their lives in the bombs of 2002 ... it is really upsetting to think that another memorial may have to be erected .
one hopes that the spirit of the balinese people will not be diminished by recent events our thoughts and prayers are with them .
zoe shaughnessy , london , england i arrived back from bali yesterday and had noticed that the security at our hotel at the conrad had been stepped up towards the end of last week .
instead of the usual hotel security , there was an armed guard .
the night before we left we went to pj 's at the four seasons hotel at jimbaran beach , i ca n't believe that i was so close to what was going to happen the next day .
i also visited kuta beach several times and saw the area where the bomb went off , i know it would have been really busy with tourists at that time .
my heart goes out to the balinese as they were talking about how they felt that life was just starting to get back to normal after the 2002 bombing .
they are the nicest people you could want to meet and they are so grateful to have tourism within their country , as it is the only form of income they have .
i will say a prayer tonight for all the balinese people .
martine alexander , manchester , uk i am deeply saddened by the news of the bali blasts .
my husband and i returned from bali almost two weeks ago .
it is a beautiful , enchanting and captivating place .
my heart goes out to all of bali and its charming , warm and welcoming people .
mrs paula warburton , lincolnshire , england this is clearly timed to coincide with the recent massive rise in the price of fuel in indonesia : the bombers want to destabilise the country and shake faith in the president .
martin percy , former long-term resident of indonesia the scene of total desolation was in place with whispers of help from people who had been injured mike gallagher , salisbury , uk i saw myself on one of your pics carrying an injured man into an ambulance .
his name is bruce and his wife had been injured and had already been rushed of to hospital .
i was 2 tables away from the second explosion .
after the first explosion on the beach , people were generally unsure as to what it was until the second explosion when the realization dawned on us that they were bombs .
the effect caused a ripple of running people in all directions .
the scene of total desolation was in place with whispers of help from people who had been injured a half buried in the sand .
to think that 5 mins earlier the whole place was the busiest i had seen since coming here .
mike gallagher , salisbury , uk we need to have a central web site where loved ones can go when such tragedies occur to help reunite family members .
i 've come across a few but we need our governments to get behind the idea .
here is an example www.lookingforsurvivors.com angelo , australia i am from england working here and i was out with me mates when we heard a big bang !
we ran out side of the shop we were in and saw just destruction !
people on the ground and blood everywhere !
ryan , kuta / ex england i 'm in kuta now .
manic on the streets , no one really knows what 's going on .
i saw people running and crying .
police telling everyone where to go .
all tourists have given up for the night , everyone trying to get internet access , nightspots are empty .
there 's an air of unease and unrest here .
george maccallum , greenwich , london i left kuta this morning due to a last minute change of plan .
i feel a mixture of guilt and luck to have left just in time .
my thoughts are with the local people who are re-living the horrors of the 2002 bombings and for all the injured .
grainne tierney , london , uk i left bali yesterday and am obviously shocked by the recent events in .
what i think saddens me the most if how friendly and hospitable i found people in indonesia and their eagerness for tourists to enjoy and return to their country .
with two bombings in three years tourism and along with it a lot of livelihoods will be lost , and for this i feel for the people of bali .
sally rice , wickham , hampshire i live in the kuta area and heard three explosions .
one hit the hard rock cafe area in kuta .
another was in front of the four seasons beach resort in jimbaran bay on the other side of the airport from kuta .
the third was apparently somewhere in the nusa dua resort area .
anon we were 40-50 meters away from the two explosions on jimbaran beach in pj 's restaurant in the four seasons .
we heard one loud explosion whereby everyone immediately stood up and thought the worst .
it was followed by another about 25 seconds later .
i believe they targeted a local open air fish market restaurant run by the balanise with no security .
we were the first out of there but saw two wounded by the roadside , one with shoulder and one with perhaps minor head injuries .
the first explosion seemed weak and for a split second we wondered if it was a large firework .
the second was slightly louder and we could see the smoke drift across the beach in front of us as people slipped from their tables on the beach to our right .
otherwise everyone seemed to be very rational , however i did n't witness events in the area of the immediate explosion .
my sympathy to all involved .
dan delhomme , stevenage , england i was in jimbaran bay when i heard two explosions closely follow by one another .
i was at a restaurant called ganesa at the time .
there is massive traffic in kuta .
still waiting for more details to flow in .
robert holmes , uk i am an english ex-pat living and working in indonesia .
it is terrible to hear this news about another attack on innocent victims .
however having lived in jakarta for the past three years i must remind people that indonesia is a safe place and the people are incredibly hospitable and warm .
this is nothing more than a mindless attack from a crazed minority and not a reflection of indonesians general attitude towards foreigners .
jeremy , jakarta , indonesia my heart goes out to the indonesian people .
be sure that the hearts of the australian people are with you and condemn these cowardly attacks on innocent people wayno , melbourne australia we were having dinner just down the road from the kuta explosion when it happened .
the noise was deafening .
like a thousand fireworks going off at one time .
people are still being transported to hospital from the site .
it seems like chaos .

indonesian police have been questioning two people in connection with saturday 's suicide bombings on the tourist island of bali .
the three bombs exploded within moments of each other at tourist spots on the indonesian island .
police believe radical group jemaah islamiah -lrb- ji -rrb- was behind the bombings at jimbaran and kuta .
photos of the faces of the suspected suicide attackers have been published in local newspapers in an appeal to identify the gang responsible .
the attacks come nearly three years after bombs at two nightclubs killed 202 people in kuta , among them many foreign tourists .
did you witness the explosions ?

read a selection of your comments below .
the follow comments reflect the balance of opinion received so far : it was a terrifying feeling as kuta came to a standstill on saturday night jacky pew , swansea it was a terrifying feeling as kuta came to a standstill on saturday night .
bars and nightclubs closed and half way through the concert on the beach had to be cancelled .
everyone stayed at their hotels that night in fear and to scared to walk the streets of kuta .
i flew out on sunday night to sydney and people could n't get out of the country quick enough .
lee , banny , joe , ani , yama , taufiq please be safe .
jacky pew , swansea it is with a heavy heart , that i have been seeing the tourists disappear off the streets in kuta , as several governments have warned of further terrorist attacks .
i hope that the balinese people do not suffer any more , economically and physically , as they have been amongst the most welcoming of all peoples that i have met on my travels .
matthew pfaff , kuta , bali bali relies on tourism for there way of life but these terrorists are discouraging people from going there .
daniel , brisbane , australia i was in bali this summer , living in a hotel in kuta and working in jimbaran beach .
i was devastated to hear about these bombs .
the balinese have worked so hard to encourage return tourism to bali since the last bombings , and they were finally beginning to succeed .
this is an amazing country with the most helpful and friendly people i have ever met .
to not go to bali is giving the terrorists what they want .
i had an amazing time there and would go back tomorrow given the opportunity .
michelle dubbin , oxford , uk the message is simple : people are staying , in droves , and it 's business as usual nils wetterlind , bali , indonesia i returned back home to bali yesterday and was happily surprised that the flight from singapore was 80 % full .
arriving at ngurah rai airport , there were lines at immigration and the usual buss outside arrivals .
driving home through seminyak , i got held up in a traffic jam .
this morning , it took me longer than usual to get to work ; too many cars on the road .
at work -lrb- i have a property company -rrb- , we sold two houses , at full asking price .
so the message is simple : people are staying , in droves , and it 's business as usual .
take that , ji !
not even your murderous terror acts prevent people from loving bali , this wonderful island of the gods .
nils wetterlind , bali , indonesia i was in bali at the time of oct 2002 bombings -lrb- though not at the bombed site at the specific time -rrb- and i can only say that bali is an exemplary place of beauty , peace and kindness which is , unfortunately made victim of muslim political radicalism .
these terrorists wish to have the beautiful bali -lrb- like all beautiful and peaceful places on earth -rrb- disappear .
i had seen the balinese people grieving , crying and praying after the 2002 bombings ; i was touched very much by their grief and sensitivity .
sissy papagiannidi , athens , greece having returned from bali on the 3rd of october i can say that the only down part of my time over there was the bombings on my final evening .
staying in nusa dus i was a few kilometres away from the affected areas but could see the pain in the locals faces when the news spread .
although most are very poor the people are diamonds in this gem-filled paradise and my heart goes out to them as well as to those who suffered directly on this terrible night of murder and mayhem .
martin fittall , herne bay , england i have been in bali four times , and i am due to go to bali in the next two weeks .
i must admit that i was shock at first when i heard this terrible news of second bali attack , but i will never let those mindless perpetrators to ruin any parts of my normal life .
my heart goes to balinese people , and looking anxiously to meeting them very soon .
may holy hindu god be with you .
nadda , chiangmai , thailand this is very sad for not only the people of bali but also those on lombok - bali 's sister island .
we have just come back from lombok last week and what nobody has mentioned is that what happens to the tourist trade on bali affects lombok and the effects are much worse as lombok is normally only visited for just few nights by those tourists who have visited bali .
glen , woking , uk my husband and i had been toying with the idea of a trip to bali early next year .
our minds were made for us after another pointless attack last weekend .
the dignity and the celebration of life the bali people have displayed in recent days has convinced us this is still our dream destination .
and we will not be deterred by any terror group there , or anywhere else in the world .
sharon hughes , portsmouth we just arrived back from holiday in bali last week and i feel so sorry for the lovely people of bali who were just starting to get back on their feet following the incidents in 2002 .
i wish them well and hope the country can look forward to a safer future .
karen morris , guildford england i am an australian and have been living in the uk for nearly two years , i 'm about to leave and return home permanently and i have included a bali stopover in my trip and i wo n't be changing those plans .
this will be my sixth visit to the lovely island and anyone who has been there knows how important it is for their economy that we continue to holiday with the beautiful people of bali , no where in this world is safe while we have these types of terrorists among us , i am so saddened and scared but i refuse to stop my way of life to hand them any kind of victory !
donna stephens , whitchurch , england / rye , australia i feel safer in bali even with the bombs andrea , atlanta , georgia usa i was in bali this past january .
it is a wonderful place , with such kind and gentle people .
they are hurting immensely from the 2002 bombing and kept asking us to please tell people to come back to bali .
in spite of this latest bombing , i would still return .
i live in a large american city , and quite frankly , i feel safer in bali even with the bombs .
there is more to bali than kuta beach and jimbaran .
we must continue to support these people .
they are innocent in these bombings and their livelihood depends on us .
andrea , atlanta , georgia usa my girlfriend and i are just back from two great weeks in bali and having visited both places which have been devastated , my thoughts are with all of the balinese people and those that have been affected .
having read the other comments it is clear that everyone had the same experiences as we did ie lovely , warm , hardworking people , living on a beautiful island , who do n't deserve such mindless attacks .
if anyone reading this is about to go to bali my advice would be go .
bali needs you now more than ever .
mark davidson , edinburgh , scotland i am a painter living less than 300m from the jimbaran bomb blast .
i have a fine art gallery less than 200m away .
i fortunately cancelled my planned birthday dinner at the jimbaran seafood cafes , the site of the bomb blast , as my mother was too tired to attend .
we heard the bombs from my home on the hill overlooking the jimbaran beach .
are we convinced of our right to freedom and peace ?
i ask our two most powerful world leaders , george bush and tony blair , in the name of those who died last night - what primary actions have you taken and not taken ?
how did this violence come to be ?
zante gabriela-alexandria , british living in bali i was in kuta three months after the 2002 attack , determined to go no matter what .
it was unsettling .
tourist numbers were down by 90 % and the place resembled a ghost town .
the contrast with the old , lively and busy bali was unnerving .
sadly , i 'm quite pessimistic about the future of bali now .
this is a terrible setback for the local people , who have worked so hard to get back on track after the first bombing .
i wish them strength .
stephanie , london , uk i would like to know how i can help .
are any organisations looking for volunteers ?
katie stones , huddersfield , england we recently returned from bali and much to our surprise , we did not have to pass through immigration or customs when we entered bali .
a security officer waved us through , stating " they 've gone home " !
catherine trencher , boynton beach , fl .
usa bali will recover , and be stronger for it all mike teaney , nusa dua , bali we have moved to bali recently to start a new life .
the balinese are a friendly fun-loving people , who make you feel welcome wherever you go .
speaking to them over the past few days , they can only ask what they have done wrong to deserve this .
one thing they are sure of is that bali will recover , and be stronger for it all .
mike teaney , nusa dua , bali my husband and i have just returned from our honeymoon in bali and we could not have chosen a nicer place .
everywhere we went the balinese people were so nice and welcoming to us .
they catered for our every need and made our stay absolutely fantastic .
we hired cabs to drive us around during the day and evening and we travelled quite a bit and trusted the taxi drivers / guides as they were all so honest and genuinely wanted us to have a nice time exploring their beautiful country .
i am truly saddened at what has happened .
it 's a real shame as bali was just picking up again after the last bombing .
i do n't think people really know how the locals suffer at the hands of these suicide bombers .
obviously , i guess travellers will be reluctant to travel to bali but please do n't totally abandon going .
it 's so lovely and the balinese people very warm and friendly .
christine williams , luton , england i was in kuta , bali in august with my family and found the people there were just so lovely and friendly .
we spoke to one young waiter who told us the last bombings had devastated their tourist trade but they were just beginning to build back up again .
this must be sole destroying for them .
our thoughts are with those people and those families of the victims .
elsie hodges , bristol , uk my wife and i returned from holiday in bali three weeks ago - our third time there .
our hearts go out to the dead and injured but we feel very much for the people of bali - the most welcoming and friendly people anywhere in the world .
do n't stop going - they need our support and they need tourists to survive .
our thoughts and good wishes are with them and words can not express how we feel about the mindless perpetrators of the carnage .
keith millar , aberdeen , scotland i left bali just over 10 days ago and i am shocked and saddened at what has happened .
i was in kuta square just over two weeks ago and i noticed then that there was a lot of security around .
the balinese people are crying out for tourists to come back to the island , many locals asked us to come back next year and to bring our friends and family with us .
the island has so much to offer and the people are amazing .
we should n't let terrorists put us off travelling there - it is no different to going to london these days .
i am hoping to go back in april and will not let these terrorists put me off .
katie clarke , basingstoke , uk only a week ago we spent the most wonderful time at jimbaran beach and kuta .
the video and pictures we made will never be the same .
there will always be a spot of sadness when looking at them .
there is a lot of sorrow in me while thinking of those friendly balinese people who need us tourist so much .
there also is so much anger inside of me against those criminals who did this .
on and on i am asking why ?
sukeirda , amsterdam , netherlands i visited indonesia in the month of september and spent a week in bali , kuta specifically , approximately 1 week prior to the most recent senseless attack .
my eyes were opened upon witnessing the beauty and the kindness that i saw in the whole of indonesia .
i can not quite absorb this fully yet .
it leaves me with a feeling of powerlessness , and i struggle with my desire to help the people of bali and all of indonesia alike .
deeply saddened by witnessing the reality that the human race is prepared to destroy harmony and peace in such a way .
my deepest condolences are with the country and people of indonesia , and the families affected by all the related attacks .
michael mccoy , new york , new york i am a balinese .
it is a coincident that i was -lrb- in 2002 -rrb- and i am now in the uk doing research when the blast occurred .
i have a mix up feeling : sad , up set , and concern .
i hope bali and its people will become stronger .
i do appreciate the supports that are addressed to bali .
arya thanaya , leeds , uk i was in bali when the terrorists attacked in 2002 .

police believe radical group jemaah islamiah -lrb- ji -rrb- was behind the bombings at jimbaran and kuta .
photos of the faces of the suspected suicide attackers have been published in local newspapers in an appeal to identify the gang responsible .
the attacks come nearly three years after bombs at two nightclubs killed 202 people in kuta , among them many foreign tourists .

the follow comments reflect the balance of opinion received so far : it was a terrifying feeling as kuta came to a standstill on saturday night jacky pew , swansea it was a terrifying feeling as kuta came to a standstill on saturday night .
bars and nightclubs closed and half way through the concert on the beach had to be cancelled .
everyone stayed at their hotels that night in fear and to scared to walk the streets of kuta .
i flew out on sunday night to sydney and people could n't get out of the country quick enough .
lee , banny , joe , ani , yama , taufiq please be safe .
jacky pew , swansea it is with a heavy heart , that i have been seeing the tourists disappear off the streets in kuta , as several governments have warned of further terrorist attacks .
i hope that the balinese people do not suffer any more , economically and physically , as they have been amongst the most welcoming of all peoples that i have met on my travels .
matthew pfaff , kuta , bali bali relies on tourism for there way of life but these terrorists are discouraging people from going there .
daniel , brisbane , australia i was in bali this summer , living in a hotel in kuta and working in jimbaran beach .
i was devastated to hear about these bombs .
the balinese have worked so hard to encourage return tourism to bali since the last bombings , and they were finally beginning to succeed .
this is an amazing country with the most helpful and friendly people i have ever met .
to not go to bali is giving the terrorists what they want .
i had an amazing time there and would go back tomorrow given the opportunity .
michelle dubbin , oxford , uk the message is simple : people are staying , in droves , and it 's business as usual nils wetterlind , bali , indonesia i returned back home to bali yesterday and was happily surprised that the flight from singapore was 80 % full .
arriving at ngurah rai airport , there were lines at immigration and the usual buss outside arrivals .
driving home through seminyak , i got held up in a traffic jam .
this morning , it took me longer than usual to get to work ; too many cars on the road .
at work -lrb- i have a property company -rrb- , we sold two houses , at full asking price .
so the message is simple : people are staying , in droves , and it 's business as usual .
take that , ji !
not even your murderous terror acts prevent people from loving bali , this wonderful island of the gods .
nils wetterlind , bali , indonesia i was in bali at the time of oct 2002 bombings -lrb- though not at the bombed site at the specific time -rrb- and i can only say that bali is an exemplary place of beauty , peace and kindness which is , unfortunately made victim of muslim political radicalism .
these terrorists wish to have the beautiful bali -lrb- like all beautiful and peaceful places on earth -rrb- disappear .
i had seen the balinese people grieving , crying and praying after the 2002 bombings ; i was touched very much by their grief and sensitivity .
sissy papagiannidi , athens , greece having returned from bali on the 3rd of october i can say that the only down part of my time over there was the bombings on my final evening .
staying in nusa dus i was a few kilometres away from the affected areas but could see the pain in the locals faces when the news spread .
although most are very poor the people are diamonds in this gem-filled paradise and my heart goes out to them as well as to those who suffered directly on this terrible night of murder and mayhem .
martin fittall , herne bay , england i have been in bali four times , and i am due to go to bali in the next two weeks .
i must admit that i was shock at first when i heard this terrible news of second bali attack , but i will never let those mindless perpetrators to ruin any parts of my normal life .
my heart goes to balinese people , and looking anxiously to meeting them very soon .
may holy hindu god be with you .
nadda , chiangmai , thailand this is very sad for not only the people of bali but also those on lombok - bali 's sister island .
we have just come back from lombok last week and what nobody has mentioned is that what happens to the tourist trade on bali affects lombok and the effects are much worse as lombok is normally only visited for just few nights by those tourists who have visited bali .
glen , woking , uk my husband and i had been toying with the idea of a trip to bali early next year .
our minds were made for us after another pointless attack last weekend .
the dignity and the celebration of life the bali people have displayed in recent days has convinced us this is still our dream destination .
and we will not be deterred by any terror group there , or anywhere else in the world .
sharon hughes , portsmouth we just arrived back from holiday in bali last week and i feel so sorry for the lovely people of bali who were just starting to get back on their feet following the incidents in 2002 .
i wish them well and hope the country can look forward to a safer future .
karen morris , guildford england i am an australian and have been living in the uk for nearly two years , i 'm about to leave and return home permanently and i have included a bali stopover in my trip and i wo n't be changing those plans .
this will be my sixth visit to the lovely island and anyone who has been there knows how important it is for their economy that we continue to holiday with the beautiful people of bali , no where in this world is safe while we have these types of terrorists among us , i am so saddened and scared but i refuse to stop my way of life to hand them any kind of victory !
donna stephens , whitchurch , england / rye , australia i feel safer in bali even with the bombs andrea , atlanta , georgia usa i was in bali this past january .
it is a wonderful place , with such kind and gentle people .
they are hurting immensely from the 2002 bombing and kept asking us to please tell people to come back to bali .
in spite of this latest bombing , i would still return .
i live in a large american city , and quite frankly , i feel safer in bali even with the bombs .
there is more to bali than kuta beach and jimbaran .
we must continue to support these people .
they are innocent in these bombings and their livelihood depends on us .
andrea , atlanta , georgia usa my girlfriend and i are just back from two great weeks in bali and having visited both places which have been devastated , my thoughts are with all of the balinese people and those that have been affected .
having read the other comments it is clear that everyone had the same experiences as we did ie lovely , warm , hardworking people , living on a beautiful island , who do n't deserve such mindless attacks .
if anyone reading this is about to go to bali my advice would be go .
bali needs you now more than ever .
mark davidson , edinburgh , scotland i am a painter living less than 300m from the jimbaran bomb blast .
i have a fine art gallery less than 200m away .
i fortunately cancelled my planned birthday dinner at the jimbaran seafood cafes , the site of the bomb blast , as my mother was too tired to attend .
we heard the bombs from my home on the hill overlooking the jimbaran beach .
are we convinced of our right to freedom and peace ?
i ask our two most powerful world leaders , george bush and tony blair , in the name of those who died last night - what primary actions have you taken and not taken ?
how did this violence come to be ?
zante gabriela-alexandria , british living in bali i was in kuta three months after the 2002 attack , determined to go no matter what .
it was unsettling .
tourist numbers were down by 90 % and the place resembled a ghost town .
the contrast with the old , lively and busy bali was unnerving .
sadly , i 'm quite pessimistic about the future of bali now .
this is a terrible setback for the local people , who have worked so hard to get back on track after the first bombing .
i wish them strength .
stephanie , london , uk i would like to know how i can help .
are any organisations looking for volunteers ?
katie stones , huddersfield , england we recently returned from bali and much to our surprise , we did not have to pass through immigration or customs when we entered bali .
a security officer waved us through , stating " they 've gone home " !
catherine trencher , boynton beach , fl .
usa bali will recover , and be stronger for it all mike teaney , nusa dua , bali we have moved to bali recently to start a new life .
the balinese are a friendly fun-loving people , who make you feel welcome wherever you go .
speaking to them over the past few days , they can only ask what they have done wrong to deserve this .
one thing they are sure of is that bali will recover , and be stronger for it all .
mike teaney , nusa dua , bali my husband and i have just returned from our honeymoon in bali and we could not have chosen a nicer place .
everywhere we went the balinese people were so nice and welcoming to us .
they catered for our every need and made our stay absolutely fantastic .
we hired cabs to drive us around during the day and evening and we travelled quite a bit and trusted the taxi drivers / guides as they were all so honest and genuinely wanted us to have a nice time exploring their beautiful country .
i am truly saddened at what has happened .
it 's a real shame as bali was just picking up again after the last bombing .
i do n't think people really know how the locals suffer at the hands of these suicide bombers .
obviously , i guess travellers will be reluctant to travel to bali but please do n't totally abandon going .
it 's so lovely and the balinese people very warm and friendly .
christine williams , luton , england i was in kuta , bali in august with my family and found the people there were just so lovely and friendly .
we spoke to one young waiter who told us the last bombings had devastated their tourist trade but they were just beginning to build back up again .
this must be sole destroying for them .
our thoughts are with those people and those families of the victims .
elsie hodges , bristol , uk my wife and i returned from holiday in bali three weeks ago - our third time there .
our hearts go out to the dead and injured but we feel very much for the people of bali - the most welcoming and friendly people anywhere in the world .
do n't stop going - they need our support and they need tourists to survive .
our thoughts and good wishes are with them and words can not express how we feel about the mindless perpetrators of the carnage .
keith millar , aberdeen , scotland i left bali just over 10 days ago and i am shocked and saddened at what has happened .
i was in kuta square just over two weeks ago and i noticed then that there was a lot of security around .
the balinese people are crying out for tourists to come back to the island , many locals asked us to come back next year and to bring our friends and family with us .
the island has so much to offer and the people are amazing .
we should n't let terrorists put us off travelling there - it is no different to going to london these days .
i am hoping to go back in april and will not let these terrorists put me off .
katie clarke , basingstoke , uk only a week ago we spent the most wonderful time at jimbaran beach and kuta .
the video and pictures we made will never be the same .
there will always be a spot of sadness when looking at them .
there is a lot of sorrow in me while thinking of those friendly balinese people who need us tourist so much .
there also is so much anger inside of me against those criminals who did this .
on and on i am asking why ?
sukeirda , amsterdam , netherlands i visited indonesia in the month of september and spent a week in bali , kuta specifically , approximately 1 week prior to the most recent senseless attack .
my eyes were opened upon witnessing the beauty and the kindness that i saw in the whole of indonesia .
i can not quite absorb this fully yet .
it leaves me with a feeling of powerlessness , and i struggle with my desire to help the people of bali and all of indonesia alike .
deeply saddened by witnessing the reality that the human race is prepared to destroy harmony and peace in such a way .
my deepest condolences are with the country and people of indonesia , and the families affected by all the related attacks .
michael mccoy , new york , new york i am a balinese .
it is a coincident that i was -lrb- in 2002 -rrb- and i am now in the uk doing research when the blast occurred .
i have a mix up feeling : sad , up set , and concern .
i hope bali and its people will become stronger .
i do appreciate the supports that are addressed to bali .
arya thanaya , leeds , uk i was in bali when the terrorists attacked in 2002 .
indeed , i lived only a few meters from the location of the bombing .
this year bombing has certainly brought back our sad memory .
i still remember very clearly how the balinese people tried very hard to get back on their feet .
a few months ago , my friend in bali told me that bali was busy again , tourism has lived again .
now , the terrorists attack again for the second time .
i just hope that the balinese people will be tougher .
iyan nurmansyah , an indonesian living in brighton i 'm due to go to bali in january , and am more determined now than ever .
having lived with 30 years of terrorism in northern ireland , the only thing to do is to clear up the mess and rebuild even stronger .
the people of bali need our support now more than ever and i for one intend to give them mine .
david , london , uk i am a british ex-pat living and working in indonesia .
i was not aware of the blasts in bali until i started receiving a flurry of telephone calls from the uk .
it saddens me to learn that there are still people out there who intend on this mindless violence .
indonesia needs the support of foreign tourists , i have lived here seven years and must stress that this violence is not the general attitude of indonesian people .
anthony clark , jakarta , indonesia the people of bali are so welcoming and friendly and have feared the economic impact of more bombs .
hayley hanratty , london , england i arrived back in london on saturday morning after my husband and i enjoyed our honeymoon on bali .
the sadness that i feel on hearing about the bombs can not be expressed in words .
the consequences are much greater than the loss of innocent lives and serious injuries .
the people of bali are so welcoming and friendly and have feared the economic impact of more bombs .
one example is a baliense man who we became friends with called eddie and his wife who both work in tourist surf shops .
they are expecting their first child .
their family 's future depends heavily on tourism , like so many other local people .
my thoughts are with all those on the beautiful island of bali .
hayley hanratty , london , england i spent the last month of my travels in bali before returning home in august and i left my heart there .
the balinese people need our support to help them back on their feet and they have my thoughts and prayers .
natalie george , london we left bali two days ago to continue our travels to malaysia .
our time there was so fantastic , the people so friendly and the island so beautiful ... it is such a shame .
while we were there we visited the memorial to those who lost their lives in the bombs of 2002 ... it is really upsetting to think that another memorial may have to be erected .
one hopes that the spirit of the balinese people will not be diminished by recent events our thoughts and prayers are with them .
zoe shaughnessy , london , england i arrived back from bali yesterday and had noticed that the security at our hotel at the conrad had been stepped up towards the end of last week .
instead of the usual hotel security , there was an armed guard .
the night before we left we went to pj 's at the four seasons hotel at jimbaran beach , i ca n't believe that i was so close to what was going to happen the next day .
i also visited kuta beach several times and saw the area where the bomb went off , i know it would have been really busy with tourists at that time .
my heart goes out to the balinese as they were talking about how they felt that life was just starting to get back to normal after the 2002 bombing .
they are the nicest people you could want to meet and they are so grateful to have tourism within their country , as it is the only form of income they have .
i will say a prayer tonight for all the balinese people .
martine alexander , manchester , uk i am deeply saddened by the news of the bali blasts .
my husband and i returned from bali almost two weeks ago .
it is a beautiful , enchanting and captivating place .
my heart goes out to all of bali and its charming , warm and welcoming people .
mrs paula warburton , lincolnshire , england this is clearly timed to coincide with the recent massive rise in the price of fuel in indonesia : the bombers want to destabilise the country and shake faith in the president .
martin percy , former long-term resident of indonesia the scene of total desolation was in place with whispers of help from people who had been injured mike gallagher , salisbury , uk i saw myself on one of your pics carrying an injured man into an ambulance .
his name is bruce and his wife had been injured and had already been rushed of to hospital .
i was 2 tables away from the second explosion .
after the first explosion on the beach , people were generally unsure as to what it was until the second explosion when the realization dawned on us that they were bombs .
the effect caused a ripple of running people in all directions .
the scene of total desolation was in place with whispers of help from people who had been injured a half buried in the sand .
to think that 5 mins earlier the whole place was the busiest i had seen since coming here .
mike gallagher , salisbury , uk we need to have a central web site where loved ones can go when such tragedies occur to help reunite family members .
i 've come across a few but we need our governments to get behind the idea .
here is an example www.lookingforsurvivors.com angelo , australia i am from england working here and i was out with me mates when we heard a big bang !
we ran out side of the shop we were in and saw just destruction !
people on the ground and blood everywhere !
ryan , kuta / ex england i 'm in kuta now .
manic on the streets , no one really knows what 's going on .
i saw people running and crying .
police telling everyone where to go .
all tourists have given up for the night , everyone trying to get internet access , nightspots are empty .
there 's an air of unease and unrest here .
george maccallum , greenwich , london i left kuta this morning due to a last minute change of plan .
i feel a mixture of guilt and luck to have left just in time .
my thoughts are with the local people who are re-living the horrors of the 2002 bombings and for all the injured .
grainne tierney , london , uk i left bali yesterday and am obviously shocked by the recent events in .
what i think saddens me the most if how friendly and hospitable i found people in indonesia and their eagerness for tourists to enjoy and return to their country .
with two bombings in three years tourism and along with it a lot of livelihoods will be lost , and for this i feel for the people of bali .
sally rice , wickham , hampshire i live in the kuta area and heard three explosions .
one hit the hard rock cafe area in kuta .
another was in front of the four seasons beach resort in jimbaran bay on the other side of the airport from kuta .
the third was apparently somewhere in the nusa dua resort area .
anon we were 40-50 meters away from the two explosions on jimbaran beach in pj 's restaurant in the four seasons .
we heard one loud explosion whereby everyone immediately stood up and thought the worst .
it was followed by another about 25 seconds later .
i believe they targeted a local open air fish market restaurant run by the balanise with no security .
we were the first out of there but saw two wounded by the roadside , one with shoulder and one with perhaps minor head injuries .
the first explosion seemed weak and for a split second we wondered if it was a large firework .
the second was slightly louder and we could see the smoke drift across the beach in front of us as people slipped from their tables on the beach to our right .
otherwise everyone seemed to be very rational , however i did n't witness events in the area of the immediate explosion .
my sympathy to all involved .
dan delhomme , stevenage , england i was in jimbaran bay when i heard two explosions closely follow by one another .
i was at a restaurant called ganesa at the time .
there is massive traffic in kuta .
still waiting for more details to flow in .
robert holmes , uk i am an english ex-pat living and working in indonesia .
it is terrible to hear this news about another attack on innocent victims .
however having lived in jakarta for the past three years i must remind people that indonesia is a safe place and the people are incredibly hospitable and warm .
this is nothing more than a mindless attack from a crazed minority and not a reflection of indonesians general attitude towards foreigners .
jeremy , jakarta , indonesia my heart goes out to the indonesian people .
be sure that the hearts of the australian people are with you and condemn these cowardly attacks on innocent people wayno , melbourne australia we were having dinner just down the road from the kuta explosion when it happened .
the noise was deafening .
like a thousand fireworks going off at one time .
people are still being transported to hospital from the site .
it seems like chaos .

our hearts go out to the dead and injured but we feel very much for the people of bali - the most welcoming and friendly people anywhere in the world .
do n't stop going - they need our support and they need tourists to survive .
our thoughts and good wishes are with them and words can not express how we feel about the mindless perpetrators of the carnage .
keith millar , aberdeen , scotland i left bali just over 10 days ago and i am shocked and saddened at what has happened .
i was in kuta square just over two weeks ago and i noticed then that there was a lot of security around .
the balinese people are crying out for tourists to come back to the island , many locals asked us to come back next year and to bring our friends and family with us .
the island has so much to offer and the people are amazing .
we should n't let terrorists put us off travelling there - it is no different to going to london these days .
i am hoping to go back in april and will not let these terrorists put me off .
katie clarke , basingstoke , uk only a week ago we spent the most wonderful time at jimbaran beach and kuta .
the video and pictures we made will never be the same .
there will always be a spot of sadness when looking at them .
there is a lot of sorrow in me while thinking of those friendly balinese people who need us tourist so much .
there also is so much anger inside of me against those criminals who did this .
on and on i am asking why ?
sukeirda , amsterdam , netherlands i visited indonesia in the month of september and spent a week in bali , kuta specifically , approximately 1 week prior to the most recent senseless attack .
my eyes were opened upon witnessing the beauty and the kindness that i saw in the whole of indonesia .
i can not quite absorb this fully yet .
it leaves me with a feeling of powerlessness , and i struggle with my desire to help the people of bali and all of indonesia alike .
deeply saddened by witnessing the reality that the human race is prepared to destroy harmony and peace in such a way .
my deepest condolences are with the country and people of indonesia , and the families affected by all the related attacks .
michael mccoy , new york , new york i am a balinese .
it is a coincident that i was -lrb- in 2002 -rrb- and i am now in the uk doing research when the blast occurred .
i have a mix up feeling : sad , up set , and concern .
i hope bali and its people will become stronger .
i do appreciate the supports that are addressed to bali .
arya thanaya , leeds , uk i was in bali when the terrorists attacked in 2002 .
indeed , i lived only a few meters from the location of the bombing .
this year bombing has certainly brought back our sad memory .
i still remember very clearly how the balinese people tried very hard to get back on their feet .
a few months ago , my friend in bali told me that bali was busy again , tourism has lived again .
now , the terrorists attack again for the second time .
i just hope that the balinese people will be tougher .
iyan nurmansyah , an indonesian living in brighton i 'm due to go to bali in january , and am more determined now than ever .
having lived with 30 years of terrorism in northern ireland , the only thing to do is to clear up the mess and rebuild even stronger .
the people of bali need our support now more than ever and i for one intend to give them mine .
david , london , uk i am a british ex-pat living and working in indonesia .
i was not aware of the blasts in bali until i started receiving a flurry of telephone calls from the uk .
it saddens me to learn that there are still people out there who intend on this mindless violence .
indonesia needs the support of foreign tourists , i have lived here seven years and must stress that this violence is not the general attitude of indonesian people .
anthony clark , jakarta , indonesia the people of bali are so welcoming and friendly and have feared the economic impact of more bombs .
hayley hanratty , london , england i arrived back in london on saturday morning after my husband and i enjoyed our honeymoon on bali .
the sadness that i feel on hearing about the bombs can not be expressed in words .
the consequences are much greater than the loss of innocent lives and serious injuries .
the people of bali are so welcoming and friendly and have feared the economic impact of more bombs .
one example is a baliense man who we became friends with called eddie and his wife who both work in tourist surf shops .
they are expecting their first child .
their family 's future depends heavily on tourism , like so many other local people .
my thoughts are with all those on the beautiful island of bali .
hayley hanratty , london , england i spent the last month of my travels in bali before returning home in august and i left my heart there .
the balinese people need our support to help them back on their feet and they have my thoughts and prayers .
natalie george , london we left bali two days ago to continue our travels to malaysia .
our time there was so fantastic , the people so friendly and the island so beautiful ... it is such a shame .
while we were there we visited the memorial to those who lost their lives in the bombs of 2002 ... it is really upsetting to think that another memorial may have to be erected .
one hopes that the spirit of the balinese people will not be diminished by recent events our thoughts and prayers are with them .
zoe shaughnessy , london , england i arrived back from bali yesterday and had noticed that the security at our hotel at the conrad had been stepped up towards the end of last week .
instead of the usual hotel security , there was an armed guard .
the night before we left we went to pj 's at the four seasons hotel at jimbaran beach , i ca n't believe that i was so close to what was going to happen the next day .
i also visited kuta beach several times and saw the area where the bomb went off , i know it would have been really busy with tourists at that time .
my heart goes out to the balinese as they were talking about how they felt that life was just starting to get back to normal after the 2002 bombing .
they are the nicest people you could want to meet and they are so grateful to have tourism within their country , as it is the only form of income they have .
i will say a prayer tonight for all the balinese people .
martine alexander , manchester , uk i am deeply saddened by the news of the bali blasts .

i was 2 tables away from the second explosion .

the effect caused a ripple of running people in all directions .

what i think saddens me the most if how friendly and hospitable i found people in indonesia and their eagerness for tourists to enjoy and return to their country .
with two bombings in three years tourism and along with it a lot of livelihoods will be lost , and for this i feel for the people of bali .
sally rice , wickham , hampshire i live in the kuta area and heard three explosions .
one hit the hard rock cafe area in kuta .
another was in front of the four seasons beach resort in jimbaran bay on the other side of the airport from kuta .
the third was apparently somewhere in the nusa dua resort area .
anon we were 40-50 meters away from the two explosions on jimbaran beach in pj 's restaurant in the four seasons .
we heard one loud explosion whereby everyone immediately stood up and thought the worst .
it was followed by another about 25 seconds later .
i believe they targeted a local open air fish market restaurant run by the balanise with no security .
we were the first out of there but saw two wounded by the roadside , one with shoulder and one with perhaps minor head injuries .
the first explosion seemed weak and for a split second we wondered if it was a large firework .
the second was slightly louder and we could see the smoke drift across the beach in front of us as people slipped from their tables on the beach to our right .
otherwise everyone seemed to be very rational , however i did n't witness events in the area of the immediate explosion .
my sympathy to all involved .
dan delhomme , stevenage , england i was in jimbaran bay when i heard two explosions closely follow by one another .
i was at a restaurant called ganesa at the time .
there is massive traffic in kuta .
still waiting for more details to flow in .
robert holmes , uk i am an english ex-pat living and working in indonesia .
it is terrible to hear this news about another attack on innocent victims .
however having lived in jakarta for the past three years i must remind people that indonesia is a safe place and the people are incredibly hospitable and warm .
this is nothing more than a mindless attack from a crazed minority and not a reflection of indonesians general attitude towards foreigners .
jeremy , jakarta , indonesia my heart goes out to the indonesian people .
be sure that the hearts of the australian people are with you and condemn these cowardly attacks on innocent people wayno , melbourne australia we were having dinner just down the road from the kuta explosion when it happened .
the noise was deafening .
like a thousand fireworks going off at one time .
people are still being transported to hospital from the site .
it seems like chaos .

indonesian police have been questioning two people in connection with saturday 's suicide bombings on the tourist island of bali .
the three bombs exploded within moments of each other at tourist spots on the indonesian island .
police believe radical group jemaah islamiah -lrb- ji -rrb- was behind the bombings at jimbaran and kuta .
photos of the faces of the suspected suicide attackers have been published in local newspapers in an appeal to identify the gang responsible .
the attacks come nearly three years after bombs at two nightclubs killed 202 people in kuta , among them many foreign tourists .

the follow comments reflect the balance of opinion received so far : it was a terrifying feeling as kuta came to a standstill on saturday night jacky pew , swansea it was a terrifying feeling as kuta came to a standstill on saturday night .
bars and nightclubs closed and half way through the concert on the beach had to be cancelled .
everyone stayed at their hotels that night in fear and to scared to walk the streets of kuta .
i flew out on sunday night to sydney and people could n't get out of the country quick enough .
lee , banny , joe , ani , yama , taufiq please be safe .
jacky pew , swansea it is with a heavy heart , that i have been seeing the tourists disappear off the streets in kuta , as several governments have warned of further terrorist attacks .
i hope that the balinese people do not suffer any more , economically and physically , as they have been amongst the most welcoming of all peoples that i have met on my travels .
matthew pfaff , kuta , bali bali relies on tourism for there way of life but these terrorists are discouraging people from going there .
daniel , brisbane , australia i was in bali this summer , living in a hotel in kuta and working in jimbaran beach .
i was devastated to hear about these bombs .
the balinese have worked so hard to encourage return tourism to bali since the last bombings , and they were finally beginning to succeed .
this is an amazing country with the most helpful and friendly people i have ever met .
to not go to bali is giving the terrorists what they want .
i had an amazing time there and would go back tomorrow given the opportunity .
michelle dubbin , oxford , uk the message is simple : people are staying , in droves , and it 's business as usual nils wetterlind , bali , indonesia i returned back home to bali yesterday and was happily surprised that the flight from singapore was 80 % full .
arriving at ngurah rai airport , there were lines at immigration and the usual buss outside arrivals .
driving home through seminyak , i got held up in a traffic jam .
this morning , it took me longer than usual to get to work ; too many cars on the road .
at work -lrb- i have a property company -rrb- , we sold two houses , at full asking price .
so the message is simple : people are staying , in droves , and it 's business as usual .
take that , ji !
not even your murderous terror acts prevent people from loving bali , this wonderful island of the gods .
nils wetterlind , bali , indonesia i was in bali at the time of oct 2002 bombings -lrb- though not at the bombed site at the specific time -rrb- and i can only say that bali is an exemplary place of beauty , peace and kindness which is , unfortunately made victim of muslim political radicalism .
these terrorists wish to have the beautiful bali -lrb- like all beautiful and peaceful places on earth -rrb- disappear .
i had seen the balinese people grieving , crying and praying after the 2002 bombings ; i was touched very much by their grief and sensitivity .
sissy papagiannidi , athens , greece having returned from bali on the 3rd of october i can say that the only down part of my time over there was the bombings on my final evening .
staying in nusa dus i was a few kilometres away from the affected areas but could see the pain in the locals faces when the news spread .
although most are very poor the people are diamonds in this gem-filled paradise and my heart goes out to them as well as to those who suffered directly on this terrible night of murder and mayhem .
martin fittall , herne bay , england i have been in bali four times , and i am due to go to bali in the next two weeks .
i must admit that i was shock at first when i heard this terrible news of second bali attack , but i will never let those mindless perpetrators to ruin any parts of my normal life .
my heart goes to balinese people , and looking anxiously to meeting them very soon .
may holy hindu god be with you .
nadda , chiangmai , thailand this is very sad for not only the people of bali but also those on lombok - bali 's sister island .
we have just come back from lombok last week and what nobody has mentioned is that what happens to the tourist trade on bali affects lombok and the effects are much worse as lombok is normally only visited for just few nights by those tourists who have visited bali .
glen , woking , uk my husband and i had been toying with the idea of a trip to bali early next year .
our minds were made for us after another pointless attack last weekend .
the dignity and the celebration of life the bali people have displayed in recent days has convinced us this is still our dream destination .
and we will not be deterred by any terror group there , or anywhere else in the world .
sharon hughes , portsmouth we just arrived back from holiday in bali last week and i feel so sorry for the lovely people of bali who were just starting to get back on their feet following the incidents in 2002 .
i wish them well and hope the country can look forward to a safer future .
karen morris , guildford england i am an australian and have been living in the uk for nearly two years , i 'm about to leave and return home permanently and i have included a bali stopover in my trip and i wo n't be changing those plans .
this will be my sixth visit to the lovely island and anyone who has been there knows how important it is for their economy that we continue to holiday with the beautiful people of bali , no where in this world is safe while we have these types of terrorists among us , i am so saddened and scared but i refuse to stop my way of life to hand them any kind of victory !
donna stephens , whitchurch , england / rye , australia i feel safer in bali even with the bombs andrea , atlanta , georgia usa i was in bali this past january .
it is a wonderful place , with such kind and gentle people .
they are hurting immensely from the 2002 bombing and kept asking us to please tell people to come back to bali .
in spite of this latest bombing , i would still return .
i live in a large american city , and quite frankly , i feel safer in bali even with the bombs .
there is more to bali than kuta beach and jimbaran .
we must continue to support these people .
they are innocent in these bombings and their livelihood depends on us .
andrea , atlanta , georgia usa my girlfriend and i are just back from two great weeks in bali and having visited both places which have been devastated , my thoughts are with all of the balinese people and those that have been affected .
having read the other comments it is clear that everyone had the same experiences as we did ie lovely , warm , hardworking people , living on a beautiful island , who do n't deserve such mindless attacks .
if anyone reading this is about to go to bali my advice would be go .
bali needs you now more than ever .
mark davidson , edinburgh , scotland i am a painter living less than 300m from the jimbaran bomb blast .
i have a fine art gallery less than 200m away .
i fortunately cancelled my planned birthday dinner at the jimbaran seafood cafes , the site of the bomb blast , as my mother was too tired to attend .
we heard the bombs from my home on the hill overlooking the jimbaran beach .
are we convinced of our right to freedom and peace ?
i ask our two most powerful world leaders , george bush and tony blair , in the name of those who died last night - what primary actions have you taken and not taken ?
how did this violence come to be ?
zante gabriela-alexandria , british living in bali i was in kuta three months after the 2002 attack , determined to go no matter what .
it was unsettling .
tourist numbers were down by 90 % and the place resembled a ghost town .
the contrast with the old , lively and busy bali was unnerving .
sadly , i 'm quite pessimistic about the future of bali now .
this is a terrible setback for the local people , who have worked so hard to get back on track after the first bombing .
i wish them strength .
stephanie , london , uk i would like to know how i can help .
are any organisations looking for volunteers ?
katie stones , huddersfield , england we recently returned from bali and much to our surprise , we did not have to pass through immigration or customs when we entered bali .
a security officer waved us through , stating " they 've gone home " !
catherine trencher , boynton beach , fl .
usa bali will recover , and be stronger for it all mike teaney , nusa dua , bali we have moved to bali recently to start a new life .
the balinese are a friendly fun-loving people , who make you feel welcome wherever you go .
speaking to them over the past few days , they can only ask what they have done wrong to deserve this .
one thing they are sure of is that bali will recover , and be stronger for it all .
mike teaney , nusa dua , bali my husband and i have just returned from our honeymoon in bali and we could not have chosen a nicer place .
everywhere we went the balinese people were so nice and welcoming to us .
they catered for our every need and made our stay absolutely fantastic .
we hired cabs to drive us around during the day and evening and we travelled quite a bit and trusted the taxi drivers / guides as they were all so honest and genuinely wanted us to have a nice time exploring their beautiful country .
i am truly saddened at what has happened .
it 's a real shame as bali was just picking up again after the last bombing .
i do n't think people really know how the locals suffer at the hands of these suicide bombers .
obviously , i guess travellers will be reluctant to travel to bali but please do n't totally abandon going .
it 's so lovely and the balinese people very warm and friendly .
christine williams , luton , england i was in kuta , bali in august with my family and found the people there were just so lovely and friendly .
we spoke to one young waiter who told us the last bombings had devastated their tourist trade but they were just beginning to build back up again .
this must be sole destroying for them .
our thoughts are with those people and those families of the victims .
elsie hodges , bristol , uk my wife and i returned from holiday in bali three weeks ago - our third time there .

however having lived in jakarta for the past three years i must remind people that indonesia is a safe place and the people are incredibly hospitable and warm .
this is nothing more than a mindless attack from a crazed minority and not a reflection of indonesians general attitude towards foreigners .
jeremy , jakarta , indonesia my heart goes out to the indonesian people .
be sure that the hearts of the australian people are with you and condemn these cowardly attacks on innocent people wayno , melbourne australia we were having dinner just down the road from the kuta explosion when it happened .
the noise was deafening .
like a thousand fireworks going off at one time .
people are still being transported to hospital from the site .
it seems like chaos .

indonesian police have been questioning two people in connection with saturday 's suicide bombings on the tourist island of bali .
the three bombs exploded within moments of each other at tourist spots on the indonesian island .
police believe radical group jemaah islamiah -lrb- ji -rrb- was behind the bombings at jimbaran and kuta .
photos of the faces of the suspected suicide attackers have been published in local newspapers in an appeal to identify the gang responsible .
the attacks come nearly three years after bombs at two nightclubs killed 202 people in kuta , among them many foreign tourists .

read a selection of your comments below .
the follow comments reflect the balance of opinion received so far : it was a terrifying feeling as kuta came to a standstill on saturday night jacky pew , swansea it was a terrifying feeling as kuta came to a standstill on saturday night .
bars and nightclubs closed and half way through the concert on the beach had to be cancelled .
everyone stayed at their hotels that night in fear and to scared to walk the streets of kuta .
i flew out on sunday night to sydney and people could n't get out of the country quick enough .
lee , banny , joe , ani , yama , taufiq please be safe .
jacky pew , swansea it is with a heavy heart , that i have been seeing the tourists disappear off the streets in kuta , as several governments have warned of further terrorist attacks .
i hope that the balinese people do not suffer any more , economically and physically , as they have been amongst the most welcoming of all peoples that i have met on my travels .
matthew pfaff , kuta , bali bali relies on tourism for there way of life but these terrorists are discouraging people from going there .
daniel , brisbane , australia i was in bali this summer , living in a hotel in kuta and working in jimbaran beach .
i was devastated to hear about these bombs .
the balinese have worked so hard to encourage return tourism to bali since the last bombings , and they were finally beginning to succeed .
this is an amazing country with the most helpful and friendly people i have ever met .
to not go to bali is giving the terrorists what they want .
i had an amazing time there and would go back tomorrow given the opportunity .
michelle dubbin , oxford , uk the message is simple : people are staying , in droves , and it 's business as usual nils wetterlind , bali , indonesia i returned back home to bali yesterday and was happily surprised that the flight from singapore was 80 % full .
arriving at ngurah rai airport , there were lines at immigration and the usual buss outside arrivals .
driving home through seminyak , i got held up in a traffic jam .
this morning , it took me longer than usual to get to work ; too many cars on the road .
at work -lrb- i have a property company -rrb- , we sold two houses , at full asking price .
so the message is simple : people are staying , in droves , and it 's business as usual .
take that , ji !
not even your murderous terror acts prevent people from loving bali , this wonderful island of the gods .
nils wetterlind , bali , indonesia i was in bali at the time of oct 2002 bombings -lrb- though not at the bombed site at the specific time -rrb- and i can only say that bali is an exemplary place of beauty , peace and kindness which is , unfortunately made victim of muslim political radicalism .
these terrorists wish to have the beautiful bali -lrb- like all beautiful and peaceful places on earth -rrb- disappear .
i had seen the balinese people grieving , crying and praying after the 2002 bombings ; i was touched very much by their grief and sensitivity .
sissy papagiannidi , athens , greece having returned from bali on the 3rd of october i can say that the only down part of my time over there was the bombings on my final evening .
staying in nusa dus i was a few kilometres away from the affected areas but could see the pain in the locals faces when the news spread .
although most are very poor the people are diamonds in this gem-filled paradise and my heart goes out to them as well as to those who suffered directly on this terrible night of murder and mayhem .
martin fittall , herne bay , england i have been in bali four times , and i am due to go to bali in the next two weeks .
i must admit that i was shock at first when i heard this terrible news of second bali attack , but i will never let those mindless perpetrators to ruin any parts of my normal life .
my heart goes to balinese people , and looking anxiously to meeting them very soon .
may holy hindu god be with you .
nadda , chiangmai , thailand this is very sad for not only the people of bali but also those on lombok - bali 's sister island .
we have just come back from lombok last week and what nobody has mentioned is that what happens to the tourist trade on bali affects lombok and the effects are much worse as lombok is normally only visited for just few nights by those tourists who have visited bali .
glen , woking , uk my husband and i had been toying with the idea of a trip to bali early next year .
our minds were made for us after another pointless attack last weekend .
the dignity and the celebration of life the bali people have displayed in recent days has convinced us this is still our dream destination .
and we will not be deterred by any terror group there , or anywhere else in the world .
sharon hughes , portsmouth we just arrived back from holiday in bali last week and i feel so sorry for the lovely people of bali who were just starting to get back on their feet following the incidents in 2002 .
i wish them well and hope the country can look forward to a safer future .
karen morris , guildford england i am an australian and have been living in the uk for nearly two years , i 'm about to leave and return home permanently and i have included a bali stopover in my trip and i wo n't be changing those plans .
this will be my sixth visit to the lovely island and anyone who has been there knows how important it is for their economy that we continue to holiday with the beautiful people of bali , no where in this world is safe while we have these types of terrorists among us , i am so saddened and scared but i refuse to stop my way of life to hand them any kind of victory !
donna stephens , whitchurch , england / rye , australia i feel safer in bali even with the bombs andrea , atlanta , georgia usa i was in bali this past january .
it is a wonderful place , with such kind and gentle people .
they are hurting immensely from the 2002 bombing and kept asking us to please tell people to come back to bali .
in spite of this latest bombing , i would still return .
i live in a large american city , and quite frankly , i feel safer in bali even with the bombs .
there is more to bali than kuta beach and jimbaran .
we must continue to support these people .
they are innocent in these bombings and their livelihood depends on us .
andrea , atlanta , georgia usa my girlfriend and i are just back from two great weeks in bali and having visited both places which have been devastated , my thoughts are with all of the balinese people and those that have been affected .
having read the other comments it is clear that everyone had the same experiences as we did ie lovely , warm , hardworking people , living on a beautiful island , who do n't deserve such mindless attacks .
if anyone reading this is about to go to bali my advice would be go .
bali needs you now more than ever .
mark davidson , edinburgh , scotland i am a painter living less than 300m from the jimbaran bomb blast .
i have a fine art gallery less than 200m away .
i fortunately cancelled my planned birthday dinner at the jimbaran seafood cafes , the site of the bomb blast , as my mother was too tired to attend .
we heard the bombs from my home on the hill overlooking the jimbaran beach .
are we convinced of our right to freedom and peace ?
i ask our two most powerful world leaders , george bush and tony blair , in the name of those who died last night - what primary actions have you taken and not taken ?
how did this violence come to be ?
zante gabriela-alexandria , british living in bali i was in kuta three months after the 2002 attack , determined to go no matter what .
it was unsettling .
tourist numbers were down by 90 % and the place resembled a ghost town .
the contrast with the old , lively and busy bali was unnerving .
sadly , i 'm quite pessimistic about the future of bali now .
this is a terrible setback for the local people , who have worked so hard to get back on track after the first bombing .
i wish them strength .
stephanie , london , uk i would like to know how i can help .
are any organisations looking for volunteers ?
katie stones , huddersfield , england we recently returned from bali and much to our surprise , we did not have to pass through immigration or customs when we entered bali .
a security officer waved us through , stating " they 've gone home " !
catherine trencher , boynton beach , fl .
usa bali will recover , and be stronger for it all mike teaney , nusa dua , bali we have moved to bali recently to start a new life .
the balinese are a friendly fun-loving people , who make you feel welcome wherever you go .
speaking to them over the past few days , they can only ask what they have done wrong to deserve this .
one thing they are sure of is that bali will recover , and be stronger for it all .
mike teaney , nusa dua , bali my husband and i have just returned from our honeymoon in bali and we could not have chosen a nicer place .
everywhere we went the balinese people were so nice and welcoming to us .
they catered for our every need and made our stay absolutely fantastic .
we hired cabs to drive us around during the day and evening and we travelled quite a bit and trusted the taxi drivers / guides as they were all so honest and genuinely wanted us to have a nice time exploring their beautiful country .
i am truly saddened at what has happened .
it 's a real shame as bali was just picking up again after the last bombing .
i do n't think people really know how the locals suffer at the hands of these suicide bombers .
obviously , i guess travellers will be reluctant to travel to bali but please do n't totally abandon going .
it 's so lovely and the balinese people very warm and friendly .
christine williams , luton , england i was in kuta , bali in august with my family and found the people there were just so lovely and friendly .
we spoke to one young waiter who told us the last bombings had devastated their tourist trade but they were just beginning to build back up again .
this must be sole destroying for them .
our thoughts are with those people and those families of the victims .
elsie hodges , bristol , uk my wife and i returned from holiday in bali three weeks ago - our third time there .
our hearts go out to the dead and injured but we feel very much for the people of bali - the most welcoming and friendly people anywhere in the world .
do n't stop going - they need our support and they need tourists to survive .
our thoughts and good wishes are with them and words can not express how we feel about the mindless perpetrators of the carnage .
keith millar , aberdeen , scotland i left bali just over 10 days ago and i am shocked and saddened at what has happened .
i was in kuta square just over two weeks ago and i noticed then that there was a lot of security around .
the balinese people are crying out for tourists to come back to the island , many locals asked us to come back next year and to bring our friends and family with us .
the island has so much to offer and the people are amazing .
we should n't let terrorists put us off travelling there - it is no different to going to london these days .
i am hoping to go back in april and will not let these terrorists put me off .
katie clarke , basingstoke , uk only a week ago we spent the most wonderful time at jimbaran beach and kuta .
the video and pictures we made will never be the same .
there will always be a spot of sadness when looking at them .
there is a lot of sorrow in me while thinking of those friendly balinese people who need us tourist so much .
there also is so much anger inside of me against those criminals who did this .
on and on i am asking why ?
sukeirda , amsterdam , netherlands i visited indonesia in the month of september and spent a week in bali , kuta specifically , approximately 1 week prior to the most recent senseless attack .
my eyes were opened upon witnessing the beauty and the kindness that i saw in the whole of indonesia .
i can not quite absorb this fully yet .
it leaves me with a feeling of powerlessness , and i struggle with my desire to help the people of bali and all of indonesia alike .
deeply saddened by witnessing the reality that the human race is prepared to destroy harmony and peace in such a way .
my deepest condolences are with the country and people of indonesia , and the families affected by all the related attacks .
michael mccoy , new york , new york i am a balinese .
it is a coincident that i was -lrb- in 2002 -rrb- and i am now in the uk doing research when the blast occurred .
i have a mix up feeling : sad , up set , and concern .
i hope bali and its people will become stronger .
i do appreciate the supports that are addressed to bali .
arya thanaya , leeds , uk i was in bali when the terrorists attacked in 2002 .
indeed , i lived only a few meters from the location of the bombing .
this year bombing has certainly brought back our sad memory .
i still remember very clearly how the balinese people tried very hard to get back on their feet .
a few months ago , my friend in bali told me that bali was busy again , tourism has lived again .
now , the terrorists attack again for the second time .
i just hope that the balinese people will be tougher .
iyan nurmansyah , an indonesian living in brighton i 'm due to go to bali in january , and am more determined now than ever .
having lived with 30 years of terrorism in northern ireland , the only thing to do is to clear up the mess and rebuild even stronger .
the people of bali need our support now more than ever and i for one intend to give them mine .
david , london , uk i am a british ex-pat living and working in indonesia .
i was not aware of the blasts in bali until i started receiving a flurry of telephone calls from the uk .
it saddens me to learn that there are still people out there who intend on this mindless violence .
indonesia needs the support of foreign tourists , i have lived here seven years and must stress that this violence is not the general attitude of indonesian people .
anthony clark , jakarta , indonesia the people of bali are so welcoming and friendly and have feared the economic impact of more bombs .
hayley hanratty , london , england i arrived back in london on saturday morning after my husband and i enjoyed our honeymoon on bali .
the sadness that i feel on hearing about the bombs can not be expressed in words .
the consequences are much greater than the loss of innocent lives and serious injuries .
the people of bali are so welcoming and friendly and have feared the economic impact of more bombs .
one example is a baliense man who we became friends with called eddie and his wife who both work in tourist surf shops .
they are expecting their first child .
their family 's future depends heavily on tourism , like so many other local people .
my thoughts are with all those on the beautiful island of bali .
hayley hanratty , london , england i spent the last month of my travels in bali before returning home in august and i left my heart there .
the balinese people need our support to help them back on their feet and they have my thoughts and prayers .
natalie george , london we left bali two days ago to continue our travels to malaysia .
our time there was so fantastic , the people so friendly and the island so beautiful ... it is such a shame .
while we were there we visited the memorial to those who lost their lives in the bombs of 2002 ... it is really upsetting to think that another memorial may have to be erected .
one hopes that the spirit of the balinese people will not be diminished by recent events our thoughts and prayers are with them .
zoe shaughnessy , london , england i arrived back from bali yesterday and had noticed that the security at our hotel at the conrad had been stepped up towards the end of last week .
instead of the usual hotel security , there was an armed guard .
the night before we left we went to pj 's at the four seasons hotel at jimbaran beach , i ca n't believe that i was so close to what was going to happen the next day .
i also visited kuta beach several times and saw the area where the bomb went off , i know it would have been really busy with tourists at that time .
my heart goes out to the balinese as they were talking about how they felt that life was just starting to get back to normal after the 2002 bombing .
they are the nicest people you could want to meet and they are so grateful to have tourism within their country , as it is the only form of income they have .
i will say a prayer tonight for all the balinese people .
martine alexander , manchester , uk i am deeply saddened by the news of the bali blasts .
my husband and i returned from bali almost two weeks ago .
it is a beautiful , enchanting and captivating place .
my heart goes out to all of bali and its charming , warm and welcoming people .
mrs paula warburton , lincolnshire , england this is clearly timed to coincide with the recent massive rise in the price of fuel in indonesia : the bombers want to destabilise the country and shake faith in the president .
martin percy , former long-term resident of indonesia the scene of total desolation was in place with whispers of help from people who had been injured mike gallagher , salisbury , uk i saw myself on one of your pics carrying an injured man into an ambulance .
his name is bruce and his wife had been injured and had already been rushed of to hospital .
i was 2 tables away from the second explosion .
after the first explosion on the beach , people were generally unsure as to what it was until the second explosion when the realization dawned on us that they were bombs .
the effect caused a ripple of running people in all directions .
the scene of total desolation was in place with whispers of help from people who had been injured a half buried in the sand .
to think that 5 mins earlier the whole place was the busiest i had seen since coming here .
mike gallagher , salisbury , uk we need to have a central web site where loved ones can go when such tragedies occur to help reunite family members .
i 've come across a few but we need our governments to get behind the idea .
here is an example www.lookingforsurvivors.com angelo , australia i am from england working here and i was out with me mates when we heard a big bang !
we ran out side of the shop we were in and saw just destruction !
people on the ground and blood everywhere !
ryan , kuta / ex england i 'm in kuta now .
manic on the streets , no one really knows what 's going on .
i saw people running and crying .
police telling everyone where to go .
all tourists have given up for the night , everyone trying to get internet access , nightspots are empty .
there 's an air of unease and unrest here .
george maccallum , greenwich , london i left kuta this morning due to a last minute change of plan .
i feel a mixture of guilt and luck to have left just in time .
my thoughts are with the local people who are re-living the horrors of the 2002 bombings and for all the injured .
grainne tierney , london , uk i left bali yesterday and am obviously shocked by the recent events in .
what i think saddens me the most if how friendly and hospitable i found people in indonesia and their eagerness for tourists to enjoy and return to their country .
with two bombings in three years tourism and along with it a lot of livelihoods will be lost , and for this i feel for the people of bali .
sally rice , wickham , hampshire i live in the kuta area and heard three explosions .
one hit the hard rock cafe area in kuta .
another was in front of the four seasons beach resort in jimbaran bay on the other side of the airport from kuta .
the third was apparently somewhere in the nusa dua resort area .
anon we were 40-50 meters away from the two explosions on jimbaran beach in pj 's restaurant in the four seasons .
we heard one loud explosion whereby everyone immediately stood up and thought the worst .
it was followed by another about 25 seconds later .
i believe they targeted a local open air fish market restaurant run by the balanise with no security .
we were the first out of there but saw two wounded by the roadside , one with shoulder and one with perhaps minor head injuries .
the first explosion seemed weak and for a split second we wondered if it was a large firework .
the second was slightly louder and we could see the smoke drift across the beach in front of us as people slipped from their tables on the beach to our right .
otherwise everyone seemed to be very rational , however i did n't witness events in the area of the immediate explosion .
my sympathy to all involved .
dan delhomme , stevenage , england i was in jimbaran bay when i heard two explosions closely follow by one another .
i was at a restaurant called ganesa at the time .
there is massive traffic in kuta .
still waiting for more details to flow in .
robert holmes , uk i am an english ex-pat living and working in indonesia .
it is terrible to hear this news about another attack on innocent victims .
however having lived in jakarta for the past three years i must remind people that indonesia is a safe place and the people are incredibly hospitable and warm .
this is nothing more than a mindless attack from a crazed minority and not a reflection of indonesians general attitude towards foreigners .
jeremy , jakarta , indonesia my heart goes out to the indonesian people .
be sure that the hearts of the australian people are with you and condemn these cowardly attacks on innocent people wayno , melbourne australia we were having dinner just down the road from the kuta explosion when it happened .
the noise was deafening .
like a thousand fireworks going off at one time .
people are still being transported to hospital from the site .
it seems like chaos .

sadly , i 'm quite pessimistic about the future of bali now .
this is a terrible setback for the local people , who have worked so hard to get back on track after the first bombing .
i wish them strength .
stephanie , london , uk i would like to know how i can help .
are any organisations looking for volunteers ?
katie stones , huddersfield , england we recently returned from bali and much to our surprise , we did not have to pass through immigration or customs when we entered bali .
a security officer waved us through , stating " they 've gone home " !
catherine trencher , boynton beach , fl .
usa bali will recover , and be stronger for it all mike teaney , nusa dua , bali we have moved to bali recently to start a new life .
the balinese are a friendly fun-loving people , who make you feel welcome wherever you go .
speaking to them over the past few days , they can only ask what they have done wrong to deserve this .
one thing they are sure of is that bali will recover , and be stronger for it all .
mike teaney , nusa dua , bali my husband and i have just returned from our honeymoon in bali and we could not have chosen a nicer place .
everywhere we went the balinese people were so nice and welcoming to us .
they catered for our every need and made our stay absolutely fantastic .
we hired cabs to drive us around during the day and evening and we travelled quite a bit and trusted the taxi drivers / guides as they were all so honest and genuinely wanted us to have a nice time exploring their beautiful country .
i am truly saddened at what has happened .
it 's a real shame as bali was just picking up again after the last bombing .
i do n't think people really know how the locals suffer at the hands of these suicide bombers .
obviously , i guess travellers will be reluctant to travel to bali but please do n't totally abandon going .
it 's so lovely and the balinese people very warm and friendly .
christine williams , luton , england i was in kuta , bali in august with my family and found the people there were just so lovely and friendly .
we spoke to one young waiter who told us the last bombings had devastated their tourist trade but they were just beginning to build back up again .
this must be sole destroying for them .
our thoughts are with those people and those families of the victims .
elsie hodges , bristol , uk my wife and i returned from holiday in bali three weeks ago - our third time there .
our hearts go out to the dead and injured but we feel very much for the people of bali - the most welcoming and friendly people anywhere in the world .
do n't stop going - they need our support and they need tourists to survive .
our thoughts and good wishes are with them and words can not express how we feel about the mindless perpetrators of the carnage .
keith millar , aberdeen , scotland i left bali just over 10 days ago and i am shocked and saddened at what has happened .
i was in kuta square just over two weeks ago and i noticed then that there was a lot of security around .
the balinese people are crying out for tourists to come back to the island , many locals asked us to come back next year and to bring our friends and family with us .
the island has so much to offer and the people are amazing .
we should n't let terrorists put us off travelling there - it is no different to going to london these days .
i am hoping to go back in april and will not let these terrorists put me off .
katie clarke , basingstoke , uk only a week ago we spent the most wonderful time at jimbaran beach and kuta .
the video and pictures we made will never be the same .
there will always be a spot of sadness when looking at them .
there is a lot of sorrow in me while thinking of those friendly balinese people who need us tourist so much .
there also is so much anger inside of me against those criminals who did this .
on and on i am asking why ?
sukeirda , amsterdam , netherlands i visited indonesia in the month of september and spent a week in bali , kuta specifically , approximately 1 week prior to the most recent senseless attack .
my eyes were opened upon witnessing the beauty and the kindness that i saw in the whole of indonesia .
i can not quite absorb this fully yet .
it leaves me with a feeling of powerlessness , and i struggle with my desire to help the people of bali and all of indonesia alike .
deeply saddened by witnessing the reality that the human race is prepared to destroy harmony and peace in such a way .
my deepest condolences are with the country and people of indonesia , and the families affected by all the related attacks .
michael mccoy , new york , new york i am a balinese .
it is a coincident that i was -lrb- in 2002 -rrb- and i am now in the uk doing research when the blast occurred .
i have a mix up feeling : sad , up set , and concern .
i hope bali and its people will become stronger .
i do appreciate the supports that are addressed to bali .
arya thanaya , leeds , uk i was in bali when the terrorists attacked in 2002 .
indeed , i lived only a few meters from the location of the bombing .
this year bombing has certainly brought back our sad memory .
i still remember very clearly how the balinese people tried very hard to get back on their feet .
a few months ago , my friend in bali told me that bali was busy again , tourism has lived again .
now , the terrorists attack again for the second time .
i just hope that the balinese people will be tougher .
iyan nurmansyah , an indonesian living in brighton i 'm due to go to bali in january , and am more determined now than ever .
having lived with 30 years of terrorism in northern ireland , the only thing to do is to clear up the mess and rebuild even stronger .
the people of bali need our support now more than ever and i for one intend to give them mine .
david , london , uk i am a british ex-pat living and working in indonesia .
i was not aware of the blasts in bali until i started receiving a flurry of telephone calls from the uk .
it saddens me to learn that there are still people out there who intend on this mindless violence .
indonesia needs the support of foreign tourists , i have lived here seven years and must stress that this violence is not the general attitude of indonesian people .
anthony clark , jakarta , indonesia the people of bali are so welcoming and friendly and have feared the economic impact of more bombs .
hayley hanratty , london , england i arrived back in london on saturday morning after my husband and i enjoyed our honeymoon on bali .
the sadness that i feel on hearing about the bombs can not be expressed in words .
the consequences are much greater than the loss of innocent lives and serious injuries .
the people of bali are so welcoming and friendly and have feared the economic impact of more bombs .
one example is a baliense man who we became friends with called eddie and his wife who both work in tourist surf shops .
they are expecting their first child .
their family 's future depends heavily on tourism , like so many other local people .
my thoughts are with all those on the beautiful island of bali .
hayley hanratty , london , england i spent the last month of my travels in bali before returning home in august and i left my heart there .
the balinese people need our support to help them back on their feet and they have my thoughts and prayers .
natalie george , london we left bali two days ago to continue our travels to malaysia .
our time there was so fantastic , the people so friendly and the island so beautiful ... it is such a shame .
while we were there we visited the memorial to those who lost their lives in the bombs of 2002 ... it is really upsetting to think that another memorial may have to be erected .
one hopes that the spirit of the balinese people will not be diminished by recent events our thoughts and prayers are with them .
zoe shaughnessy , london , england i arrived back from bali yesterday and had noticed that the security at our hotel at the conrad had been stepped up towards the end of last week .
instead of the usual hotel security , there was an armed guard .
the night before we left we went to pj 's at the four seasons hotel at jimbaran beach , i ca n't believe that i was so close to what was going to happen the next day .
i also visited kuta beach several times and saw the area where the bomb went off , i know it would have been really busy with tourists at that time .
my heart goes out to the balinese as they were talking about how they felt that life was just starting to get back to normal after the 2002 bombing .
they are the nicest people you could want to meet and they are so grateful to have tourism within their country , as it is the only form of income they have .
i will say a prayer tonight for all the balinese people .
martine alexander , manchester , uk i am deeply saddened by the news of the bali blasts .
my husband and i returned from bali almost two weeks ago .
it is a beautiful , enchanting and captivating place .
my heart goes out to all of bali and its charming , warm and welcoming people .
mrs paula warburton , lincolnshire , england this is clearly timed to coincide with the recent massive rise in the price of fuel in indonesia : the bombers want to destabilise the country and shake faith in the president .
martin percy , former long-term resident of indonesia the scene of total desolation was in place with whispers of help from people who had been injured mike gallagher , salisbury , uk i saw myself on one of your pics carrying an injured man into an ambulance .
his name is bruce and his wife had been injured and had already been rushed of to hospital .
i was 2 tables away from the second explosion .
after the first explosion on the beach , people were generally unsure as to what it was until the second explosion when the realization dawned on us that they were bombs .
the effect caused a ripple of running people in all directions .
the scene of total desolation was in place with whispers of help from people who had been injured a half buried in the sand .
to think that 5 mins earlier the whole place was the busiest i had seen since coming here .
mike gallagher , salisbury , uk we need to have a central web site where loved ones can go when such tragedies occur to help reunite family members .
i 've come across a few but we need our governments to get behind the idea .
here is an example www.lookingforsurvivors.com angelo , australia i am from england working here and i was out with me mates when we heard a big bang !
we ran out side of the shop we were in and saw just destruction !
people on the ground and blood everywhere !
ryan , kuta / ex england i 'm in kuta now .
manic on the streets , no one really knows what 's going on .
i saw people running and crying .
police telling everyone where to go .
all tourists have given up for the night , everyone trying to get internet access , nightspots are empty .
there 's an air of unease and unrest here .
george maccallum , greenwich , london i left kuta this morning due to a last minute change of plan .
i feel a mixture of guilt and luck to have left just in time .
my thoughts are with the local people who are re-living the horrors of the 2002 bombings and for all the injured .
grainne tierney , london , uk i left bali yesterday and am obviously shocked by the recent events in .
what i think saddens me the most if how friendly and hospitable i found people in indonesia and their eagerness for tourists to enjoy and return to their country .
with two bombings in three years tourism and along with it a lot of livelihoods will be lost , and for this i feel for the people of bali .
sally rice , wickham , hampshire i live in the kuta area and heard three explosions .
one hit the hard rock cafe area in kuta .
another was in front of the four seasons beach resort in jimbaran bay on the other side of the airport from kuta .
the third was apparently somewhere in the nusa dua resort area .
anon we were 40-50 meters away from the two explosions on jimbaran beach in pj 's restaurant in the four seasons .
we heard one loud explosion whereby everyone immediately stood up and thought the worst .
it was followed by another about 25 seconds later .
i believe they targeted a local open air fish market restaurant run by the balanise with no security .
we were the first out of there but saw two wounded by the roadside , one with shoulder and one with perhaps minor head injuries .
the first explosion seemed weak and for a split second we wondered if it was a large firework .
the second was slightly louder and we could see the smoke drift across the beach in front of us as people slipped from their tables on the beach to our right .
otherwise everyone seemed to be very rational , however i did n't witness events in the area of the immediate explosion .
my sympathy to all involved .
dan delhomme , stevenage , england i was in jimbaran bay when i heard two explosions closely follow by one another .
i was at a restaurant called ganesa at the time .
there is massive traffic in kuta .
still waiting for more details to flow in .
robert holmes , uk i am an english ex-pat living and working in indonesia .
it is terrible to hear this news about another attack on innocent victims .
however having lived in jakarta for the past three years i must remind people that indonesia is a safe place and the people are incredibly hospitable and warm .
this is nothing more than a mindless attack from a crazed minority and not a reflection of indonesians general attitude towards foreigners .
jeremy , jakarta , indonesia my heart goes out to the indonesian people .
be sure that the hearts of the australian people are with you and condemn these cowardly attacks on innocent people wayno , melbourne australia we were having dinner just down the road from the kuta explosion when it happened .
the noise was deafening .
like a thousand fireworks going off at one time .
people are still being transported to hospital from the site .
it seems like chaos .

indonesian police have been questioning two people in connection with saturday 's suicide bombings on the tourist island of bali .
the three bombs exploded within moments of each other at tourist spots on the indonesian island .
police believe radical group jemaah islamiah -lrb- ji -rrb- was behind the bombings at jimbaran and kuta .
photos of the faces of the suspected suicide attackers have been published in local newspapers in an appeal to identify the gang responsible .
the attacks come nearly three years after bombs at two nightclubs killed 202 people in kuta , among them many foreign tourists .

the follow comments reflect the balance of opinion received so far : it was a terrifying feeling as kuta came to a standstill on saturday night jacky pew , swansea it was a terrifying feeling as kuta came to a standstill on saturday night .
bars and nightclubs closed and half way through the concert on the beach had to be cancelled .
everyone stayed at their hotels that night in fear and to scared to walk the streets of kuta .
i flew out on sunday night to sydney and people could n't get out of the country quick enough .
lee , banny , joe , ani , yama , taufiq please be safe .
jacky pew , swansea it is with a heavy heart , that i have been seeing the tourists disappear off the streets in kuta , as several governments have warned of further terrorist attacks .
i hope that the balinese people do not suffer any more , economically and physically , as they have been amongst the most welcoming of all peoples that i have met on my travels .
matthew pfaff , kuta , bali bali relies on tourism for there way of life but these terrorists are discouraging people from going there .
daniel , brisbane , australia i was in bali this summer , living in a hotel in kuta and working in jimbaran beach .
i was devastated to hear about these bombs .
the balinese have worked so hard to encourage return tourism to bali since the last bombings , and they were finally beginning to succeed .
this is an amazing country with the most helpful and friendly people i have ever met .
to not go to bali is giving the terrorists what they want .
i had an amazing time there and would go back tomorrow given the opportunity .
michelle dubbin , oxford , uk the message is simple : people are staying , in droves , and it 's business as usual nils wetterlind , bali , indonesia i returned back home to bali yesterday and was happily surprised that the flight from singapore was 80 % full .
arriving at ngurah rai airport , there were lines at immigration and the usual buss outside arrivals .
driving home through seminyak , i got held up in a traffic jam .
this morning , it took me longer than usual to get to work ; too many cars on the road .
at work -lrb- i have a property company -rrb- , we sold two houses , at full asking price .
so the message is simple : people are staying , in droves , and it 's business as usual .
take that , ji !
not even your murderous terror acts prevent people from loving bali , this wonderful island of the gods .
nils wetterlind , bali , indonesia i was in bali at the time of oct 2002 bombings -lrb- though not at the bombed site at the specific time -rrb- and i can only say that bali is an exemplary place of beauty , peace and kindness which is , unfortunately made victim of muslim political radicalism .
these terrorists wish to have the beautiful bali -lrb- like all beautiful and peaceful places on earth -rrb- disappear .
i had seen the balinese people grieving , crying and praying after the 2002 bombings ; i was touched very much by their grief and sensitivity .
sissy papagiannidi , athens , greece having returned from bali on the 3rd of october i can say that the only down part of my time over there was the bombings on my final evening .
staying in nusa dus i was a few kilometres away from the affected areas but could see the pain in the locals faces when the news spread .
although most are very poor the people are diamonds in this gem-filled paradise and my heart goes out to them as well as to those who suffered directly on this terrible night of murder and mayhem .
martin fittall , herne bay , england i have been in bali four times , and i am due to go to bali in the next two weeks .
i must admit that i was shock at first when i heard this terrible news of second bali attack , but i will never let those mindless perpetrators to ruin any parts of my normal life .
my heart goes to balinese people , and looking anxiously to meeting them very soon .
may holy hindu god be with you .
nadda , chiangmai , thailand this is very sad for not only the people of bali but also those on lombok - bali 's sister island .
we have just come back from lombok last week and what nobody has mentioned is that what happens to the tourist trade on bali affects lombok and the effects are much worse as lombok is normally only visited for just few nights by those tourists who have visited bali .
glen , woking , uk my husband and i had been toying with the idea of a trip to bali early next year .
our minds were made for us after another pointless attack last weekend .
the dignity and the celebration of life the bali people have displayed in recent days has convinced us this is still our dream destination .
and we will not be deterred by any terror group there , or anywhere else in the world .
sharon hughes , portsmouth we just arrived back from holiday in bali last week and i feel so sorry for the lovely people of bali who were just starting to get back on their feet following the incidents in 2002 .
i wish them well and hope the country can look forward to a safer future .
karen morris , guildford england i am an australian and have been living in the uk for nearly two years , i 'm about to leave and return home permanently and i have included a bali stopover in my trip and i wo n't be changing those plans .
this will be my sixth visit to the lovely island and anyone who has been there knows how important it is for their economy that we continue to holiday with the beautiful people of bali , no where in this world is safe while we have these types of terrorists among us , i am so saddened and scared but i refuse to stop my way of life to hand them any kind of victory !
donna stephens , whitchurch , england / rye , australia i feel safer in bali even with the bombs andrea , atlanta , georgia usa i was in bali this past january .
it is a wonderful place , with such kind and gentle people .
they are hurting immensely from the 2002 bombing and kept asking us to please tell people to come back to bali .
in spite of this latest bombing , i would still return .
i live in a large american city , and quite frankly , i feel safer in bali even with the bombs .
there is more to bali than kuta beach and jimbaran .
we must continue to support these people .
they are innocent in these bombings and their livelihood depends on us .
andrea , atlanta , georgia usa my girlfriend and i are just back from two great weeks in bali and having visited both places which have been devastated , my thoughts are with all of the balinese people and those that have been affected .
having read the other comments it is clear that everyone had the same experiences as we did ie lovely , warm , hardworking people , living on a beautiful island , who do n't deserve such mindless attacks .
if anyone reading this is about to go to bali my advice would be go .
bali needs you now more than ever .
mark davidson , edinburgh , scotland i am a painter living less than 300m from the jimbaran bomb blast .

i fortunately cancelled my planned birthday dinner at the jimbaran seafood cafes , the site of the bomb blast , as my mother was too tired to attend .
we heard the bombs from my home on the hill overlooking the jimbaran beach .
are we convinced of our right to freedom and peace ?
i ask our two most powerful world leaders , george bush and tony blair , in the name of those who died last night - what primary actions have you taken and not taken ?
how did this violence come to be ?

sally rice , wickham , hampshire i live in the kuta area and heard three explosions .
one hit the hard rock cafe area in kuta .
another was in front of the four seasons beach resort in jimbaran bay on the other side of the airport from kuta .
the third was apparently somewhere in the nusa dua resort area .
anon we were 40-50 meters away from the two explosions on jimbaran beach in pj 's restaurant in the four seasons .
we heard one loud explosion whereby everyone immediately stood up and thought the worst .
it was followed by another about 25 seconds later .
i believe they targeted a local open air fish market restaurant run by the balanise with no security .
we were the first out of there but saw two wounded by the roadside , one with shoulder and one with perhaps minor head injuries .
the first explosion seemed weak and for a split second we wondered if it was a large firework .
the second was slightly louder and we could see the smoke drift across the beach in front of us as people slipped from their tables on the beach to our right .
otherwise everyone seemed to be very rational , however i did n't witness events in the area of the immediate explosion .
my sympathy to all involved .
dan delhomme , stevenage , england i was in jimbaran bay when i heard two explosions closely follow by one another .
i was at a restaurant called ganesa at the time .

still waiting for more details to flow in .
robert holmes , uk i am an english ex-pat living and working in indonesia .
it is terrible to hear this news about another attack on innocent victims .
however having lived in jakarta for the past three years i must remind people that indonesia is a safe place and the people are incredibly hospitable and warm .
this is nothing more than a mindless attack from a crazed minority and not a reflection of indonesians general attitude towards foreigners .
jeremy , jakarta , indonesia my heart goes out to the indonesian people .
be sure that the hearts of the australian people are with you and condemn these cowardly attacks on innocent people wayno , melbourne australia we were having dinner just down the road from the kuta explosion when it happened .
the noise was deafening .
like a thousand fireworks going off at one time .
people are still being transported to hospital from the site .
it seems like chaos .

indonesian police have been questioning two people in connection with saturday 's suicide bombings on the tourist island of bali .
the three bombs exploded within moments of each other at tourist spots on the indonesian island .
police believe radical group jemaah islamiah -lrb- ji -rrb- was behind the bombings at jimbaran and kuta .
photos of the faces of the suspected suicide attackers have been published in local newspapers in an appeal to identify the gang responsible .
the attacks come nearly three years after bombs at two nightclubs killed 202 people in kuta , among them many foreign tourists .
did you witness the explosions ?

the follow comments reflect the balance of opinion received so far : it was a terrifying feeling as kuta came to a standstill on saturday night jacky pew , swansea it was a terrifying feeling as kuta came to a standstill on saturday night .
bars and nightclubs closed and half way through the concert on the beach had to be cancelled .
everyone stayed at their hotels that night in fear and to scared to walk the streets of kuta .
i flew out on sunday night to sydney and people could n't get out of the country quick enough .
lee , banny , joe , ani , yama , taufiq please be safe .
jacky pew , swansea it is with a heavy heart , that i have been seeing the tourists disappear off the streets in kuta , as several governments have warned of further terrorist attacks .
i hope that the balinese people do not suffer any more , economically and physically , as they have been amongst the most welcoming of all peoples that i have met on my travels .
matthew pfaff , kuta , bali bali relies on tourism for there way of life but these terrorists are discouraging people from going there .
daniel , brisbane , australia i was in bali this summer , living in a hotel in kuta and working in jimbaran beach .
i was devastated to hear about these bombs .
the balinese have worked so hard to encourage return tourism to bali since the last bombings , and they were finally beginning to succeed .
this is an amazing country with the most helpful and friendly people i have ever met .
to not go to bali is giving the terrorists what they want .
i had an amazing time there and would go back tomorrow given the opportunity .
michelle dubbin , oxford , uk the message is simple : people are staying , in droves , and it 's business as usual nils wetterlind , bali , indonesia i returned back home to bali yesterday and was happily surprised that the flight from singapore was 80 % full .
arriving at ngurah rai airport , there were lines at immigration and the usual buss outside arrivals .
driving home through seminyak , i got held up in a traffic jam .
this morning , it took me longer than usual to get to work ; too many cars on the road .
at work -lrb- i have a property company -rrb- , we sold two houses , at full asking price .
so the message is simple : people are staying , in droves , and it 's business as usual .
take that , ji !
not even your murderous terror acts prevent people from loving bali , this wonderful island of the gods .
nils wetterlind , bali , indonesia i was in bali at the time of oct 2002 bombings -lrb- though not at the bombed site at the specific time -rrb- and i can only say that bali is an exemplary place of beauty , peace and kindness which is , unfortunately made victim of muslim political radicalism .
these terrorists wish to have the beautiful bali -lrb- like all beautiful and peaceful places on earth -rrb- disappear .
i had seen the balinese people grieving , crying and praying after the 2002 bombings ; i was touched very much by their grief and sensitivity .
sissy papagiannidi , athens , greece having returned from bali on the 3rd of october i can say that the only down part of my time over there was the bombings on my final evening .
staying in nusa dus i was a few kilometres away from the affected areas but could see the pain in the locals faces when the news spread .
although most are very poor the people are diamonds in this gem-filled paradise and my heart goes out to them as well as to those who suffered directly on this terrible night of murder and mayhem .
martin fittall , herne bay , england i have been in bali four times , and i am due to go to bali in the next two weeks .
i must admit that i was shock at first when i heard this terrible news of second bali attack , but i will never let those mindless perpetrators to ruin any parts of my normal life .
my heart goes to balinese people , and looking anxiously to meeting them very soon .
may holy hindu god be with you .
nadda , chiangmai , thailand this is very sad for not only the people of bali but also those on lombok - bali 's sister island .
we have just come back from lombok last week and what nobody has mentioned is that what happens to the tourist trade on bali affects lombok and the effects are much worse as lombok is normally only visited for just few nights by those tourists who have visited bali .
glen , woking , uk my husband and i had been toying with the idea of a trip to bali early next year .
our minds were made for us after another pointless attack last weekend .
the dignity and the celebration of life the bali people have displayed in recent days has convinced us this is still our dream destination .
and we will not be deterred by any terror group there , or anywhere else in the world .
sharon hughes , portsmouth we just arrived back from holiday in bali last week and i feel so sorry for the lovely people of bali who were just starting to get back on their feet following the incidents in 2002 .
i wish them well and hope the country can look forward to a safer future .
karen morris , guildford england i am an australian and have been living in the uk for nearly two years , i 'm about to leave and return home permanently and i have included a bali stopover in my trip and i wo n't be changing those plans .
this will be my sixth visit to the lovely island and anyone who has been there knows how important it is for their economy that we continue to holiday with the beautiful people of bali , no where in this world is safe while we have these types of terrorists among us , i am so saddened and scared but i refuse to stop my way of life to hand them any kind of victory !
donna stephens , whitchurch , england / rye , australia i feel safer in bali even with the bombs andrea , atlanta , georgia usa i was in bali this past january .
it is a wonderful place , with such kind and gentle people .
they are hurting immensely from the 2002 bombing and kept asking us to please tell people to come back to bali .
in spite of this latest bombing , i would still return .
i live in a large american city , and quite frankly , i feel safer in bali even with the bombs .
there is more to bali than kuta beach and jimbaran .
we must continue to support these people .
they are innocent in these bombings and their livelihood depends on us .
andrea , atlanta , georgia usa my girlfriend and i are just back from two great weeks in bali and having visited both places which have been devastated , my thoughts are with all of the balinese people and those that have been affected .
having read the other comments it is clear that everyone had the same experiences as we did ie lovely , warm , hardworking people , living on a beautiful island , who do n't deserve such mindless attacks .
if anyone reading this is about to go to bali my advice would be go .
bali needs you now more than ever .
mark davidson , edinburgh , scotland i am a painter living less than 300m from the jimbaran bomb blast .
i have a fine art gallery less than 200m away .
i fortunately cancelled my planned birthday dinner at the jimbaran seafood cafes , the site of the bomb blast , as my mother was too tired to attend .
we heard the bombs from my home on the hill overlooking the jimbaran beach .
are we convinced of our right to freedom and peace ?
i ask our two most powerful world leaders , george bush and tony blair , in the name of those who died last night - what primary actions have you taken and not taken ?
how did this violence come to be ?
zante gabriela-alexandria , british living in bali i was in kuta three months after the 2002 attack , determined to go no matter what .
it was unsettling .
tourist numbers were down by 90 % and the place resembled a ghost town .
the contrast with the old , lively and busy bali was unnerving .
sadly , i 'm quite pessimistic about the future of bali now .
this is a terrible setback for the local people , who have worked so hard to get back on track after the first bombing .
i wish them strength .
stephanie , london , uk i would like to know how i can help .
are any organisations looking for volunteers ?
katie stones , huddersfield , england we recently returned from bali and much to our surprise , we did not have to pass through immigration or customs when we entered bali .
a security officer waved us through , stating " they 've gone home " !
catherine trencher , boynton beach , fl .
usa bali will recover , and be stronger for it all mike teaney , nusa dua , bali we have moved to bali recently to start a new life .
the balinese are a friendly fun-loving people , who make you feel welcome wherever you go .
speaking to them over the past few days , they can only ask what they have done wrong to deserve this .
one thing they are sure of is that bali will recover , and be stronger for it all .
mike teaney , nusa dua , bali my husband and i have just returned from our honeymoon in bali and we could not have chosen a nicer place .
everywhere we went the balinese people were so nice and welcoming to us .
they catered for our every need and made our stay absolutely fantastic .
we hired cabs to drive us around during the day and evening and we travelled quite a bit and trusted the taxi drivers / guides as they were all so honest and genuinely wanted us to have a nice time exploring their beautiful country .
i am truly saddened at what has happened .
it 's a real shame as bali was just picking up again after the last bombing .
i do n't think people really know how the locals suffer at the hands of these suicide bombers .
obviously , i guess travellers will be reluctant to travel to bali but please do n't totally abandon going .
it 's so lovely and the balinese people very warm and friendly .
christine williams , luton , england i was in kuta , bali in august with my family and found the people there were just so lovely and friendly .
we spoke to one young waiter who told us the last bombings had devastated their tourist trade but they were just beginning to build back up again .
this must be sole destroying for them .
our thoughts are with those people and those families of the victims .
elsie hodges , bristol , uk my wife and i returned from holiday in bali three weeks ago - our third time there .
our hearts go out to the dead and injured but we feel very much for the people of bali - the most welcoming and friendly people anywhere in the world .
do n't stop going - they need our support and they need tourists to survive .
our thoughts and good wishes are with them and words can not express how we feel about the mindless perpetrators of the carnage .
keith millar , aberdeen , scotland i left bali just over 10 days ago and i am shocked and saddened at what has happened .
i was in kuta square just over two weeks ago and i noticed then that there was a lot of security around .
the balinese people are crying out for tourists to come back to the island , many locals asked us to come back next year and to bring our friends and family with us .
the island has so much to offer and the people are amazing .
we should n't let terrorists put us off travelling there - it is no different to going to london these days .
i am hoping to go back in april and will not let these terrorists put me off .
katie clarke , basingstoke , uk only a week ago we spent the most wonderful time at jimbaran beach and kuta .
the video and pictures we made will never be the same .
there will always be a spot of sadness when looking at them .
there is a lot of sorrow in me while thinking of those friendly balinese people who need us tourist so much .
there also is so much anger inside of me against those criminals who did this .
on and on i am asking why ?
sukeirda , amsterdam , netherlands i visited indonesia in the month of september and spent a week in bali , kuta specifically , approximately 1 week prior to the most recent senseless attack .
my eyes were opened upon witnessing the beauty and the kindness that i saw in the whole of indonesia .
i can not quite absorb this fully yet .
it leaves me with a feeling of powerlessness , and i struggle with my desire to help the people of bali and all of indonesia alike .
deeply saddened by witnessing the reality that the human race is prepared to destroy harmony and peace in such a way .
my deepest condolences are with the country and people of indonesia , and the families affected by all the related attacks .
michael mccoy , new york , new york i am a balinese .
it is a coincident that i was -lrb- in 2002 -rrb- and i am now in the uk doing research when the blast occurred .
i have a mix up feeling : sad , up set , and concern .
i hope bali and its people will become stronger .
i do appreciate the supports that are addressed to bali .
arya thanaya , leeds , uk i was in bali when the terrorists attacked in 2002 .
indeed , i lived only a few meters from the location of the bombing .
this year bombing has certainly brought back our sad memory .
i still remember very clearly how the balinese people tried very hard to get back on their feet .
a few months ago , my friend in bali told me that bali was busy again , tourism has lived again .
now , the terrorists attack again for the second time .
i just hope that the balinese people will be tougher .
iyan nurmansyah , an indonesian living in brighton i 'm due to go to bali in january , and am more determined now than ever .
having lived with 30 years of terrorism in northern ireland , the only thing to do is to clear up the mess and rebuild even stronger .
the people of bali need our support now more than ever and i for one intend to give them mine .
david , london , uk i am a british ex-pat living and working in indonesia .
i was not aware of the blasts in bali until i started receiving a flurry of telephone calls from the uk .
it saddens me to learn that there are still people out there who intend on this mindless violence .
indonesia needs the support of foreign tourists , i have lived here seven years and must stress that this violence is not the general attitude of indonesian people .
anthony clark , jakarta , indonesia the people of bali are so welcoming and friendly and have feared the economic impact of more bombs .
hayley hanratty , london , england i arrived back in london on saturday morning after my husband and i enjoyed our honeymoon on bali .
the sadness that i feel on hearing about the bombs can not be expressed in words .
the consequences are much greater than the loss of innocent lives and serious injuries .
the people of bali are so welcoming and friendly and have feared the economic impact of more bombs .
one example is a baliense man who we became friends with called eddie and his wife who both work in tourist surf shops .
they are expecting their first child .
their family 's future depends heavily on tourism , like so many other local people .
my thoughts are with all those on the beautiful island of bali .
hayley hanratty , london , england i spent the last month of my travels in bali before returning home in august and i left my heart there .
the balinese people need our support to help them back on their feet and they have my thoughts and prayers .
natalie george , london we left bali two days ago to continue our travels to malaysia .
our time there was so fantastic , the people so friendly and the island so beautiful ... it is such a shame .
while we were there we visited the memorial to those who lost their lives in the bombs of 2002 ... it is really upsetting to think that another memorial may have to be erected .
one hopes that the spirit of the balinese people will not be diminished by recent events our thoughts and prayers are with them .
zoe shaughnessy , london , england i arrived back from bali yesterday and had noticed that the security at our hotel at the conrad had been stepped up towards the end of last week .
instead of the usual hotel security , there was an armed guard .
the night before we left we went to pj 's at the four seasons hotel at jimbaran beach , i ca n't believe that i was so close to what was going to happen the next day .
i also visited kuta beach several times and saw the area where the bomb went off , i know it would have been really busy with tourists at that time .
my heart goes out to the balinese as they were talking about how they felt that life was just starting to get back to normal after the 2002 bombing .
they are the nicest people you could want to meet and they are so grateful to have tourism within their country , as it is the only form of income they have .
i will say a prayer tonight for all the balinese people .
martine alexander , manchester , uk i am deeply saddened by the news of the bali blasts .
my husband and i returned from bali almost two weeks ago .
it is a beautiful , enchanting and captivating place .
my heart goes out to all of bali and its charming , warm and welcoming people .
mrs paula warburton , lincolnshire , england this is clearly timed to coincide with the recent massive rise in the price of fuel in indonesia : the bombers want to destabilise the country and shake faith in the president .
martin percy , former long-term resident of indonesia the scene of total desolation was in place with whispers of help from people who had been injured mike gallagher , salisbury , uk i saw myself on one of your pics carrying an injured man into an ambulance .
his name is bruce and his wife had been injured and had already been rushed of to hospital .
i was 2 tables away from the second explosion .
after the first explosion on the beach , people were generally unsure as to what it was until the second explosion when the realization dawned on us that they were bombs .
the effect caused a ripple of running people in all directions .
the scene of total desolation was in place with whispers of help from people who had been injured a half buried in the sand .
to think that 5 mins earlier the whole place was the busiest i had seen since coming here .
mike gallagher , salisbury , uk we need to have a central web site where loved ones can go when such tragedies occur to help reunite family members .
i 've come across a few but we need our governments to get behind the idea .
here is an example www.lookingforsurvivors.com angelo , australia i am from england working here and i was out with me mates when we heard a big bang !
we ran out side of the shop we were in and saw just destruction !
people on the ground and blood everywhere !
ryan , kuta / ex england i 'm in kuta now .
manic on the streets , no one really knows what 's going on .
i saw people running and crying .
police telling everyone where to go .
all tourists have given up for the night , everyone trying to get internet access , nightspots are empty .

this will be my sixth visit to the lovely island and anyone who has been there knows how important it is for their economy that we continue to holiday with the beautiful people of bali , no where in this world is safe while we have these types of terrorists among us , i am so saddened and scared but i refuse to stop my way of life to hand them any kind of victory !
donna stephens , whitchurch , england / rye , australia i feel safer in bali even with the bombs andrea , atlanta , georgia usa i was in bali this past january .
it is a wonderful place , with such kind and gentle people .
they are hurting immensely from the 2002 bombing and kept asking us to please tell people to come back to bali .
in spite of this latest bombing , i would still return .
i live in a large american city , and quite frankly , i feel safer in bali even with the bombs .
there is more to bali than kuta beach and jimbaran .
we must continue to support these people .
they are innocent in these bombings and their livelihood depends on us .
andrea , atlanta , georgia usa my girlfriend and i are just back from two great weeks in bali and having visited both places which have been devastated , my thoughts are with all of the balinese people and those that have been affected .
having read the other comments it is clear that everyone had the same experiences as we did ie lovely , warm , hardworking people , living on a beautiful island , who do n't deserve such mindless attacks .
if anyone reading this is about to go to bali my advice would be go .
bali needs you now more than ever .
mark davidson , edinburgh , scotland i am a painter living less than 300m from the jimbaran bomb blast .
i have a fine art gallery less than 200m away .
i fortunately cancelled my planned birthday dinner at the jimbaran seafood cafes , the site of the bomb blast , as my mother was too tired to attend .
we heard the bombs from my home on the hill overlooking the jimbaran beach .
are we convinced of our right to freedom and peace ?
i ask our two most powerful world leaders , george bush and tony blair , in the name of those who died last night - what primary actions have you taken and not taken ?
how did this violence come to be ?
zante gabriela-alexandria , british living in bali i was in kuta three months after the 2002 attack , determined to go no matter what .
it was unsettling .
tourist numbers were down by 90 % and the place resembled a ghost town .
the contrast with the old , lively and busy bali was unnerving .
sadly , i 'm quite pessimistic about the future of bali now .
this is a terrible setback for the local people , who have worked so hard to get back on track after the first bombing .
i wish them strength .
stephanie , london , uk i would like to know how i can help .
are any organisations looking for volunteers ?
katie stones , huddersfield , england we recently returned from bali and much to our surprise , we did not have to pass through immigration or customs when we entered bali .
a security officer waved us through , stating " they 've gone home " !
catherine trencher , boynton beach , fl .
usa bali will recover , and be stronger for it all mike teaney , nusa dua , bali we have moved to bali recently to start a new life .
the balinese are a friendly fun-loving people , who make you feel welcome wherever you go .
speaking to them over the past few days , they can only ask what they have done wrong to deserve this .
one thing they are sure of is that bali will recover , and be stronger for it all .
mike teaney , nusa dua , bali my husband and i have just returned from our honeymoon in bali and we could not have chosen a nicer place .
everywhere we went the balinese people were so nice and welcoming to us .
they catered for our every need and made our stay absolutely fantastic .
we hired cabs to drive us around during the day and evening and we travelled quite a bit and trusted the taxi drivers / guides as they were all so honest and genuinely wanted us to have a nice time exploring their beautiful country .
i am truly saddened at what has happened .
it 's a real shame as bali was just picking up again after the last bombing .
i do n't think people really know how the locals suffer at the hands of these suicide bombers .
obviously , i guess travellers will be reluctant to travel to bali but please do n't totally abandon going .
it 's so lovely and the balinese people very warm and friendly .
christine williams , luton , england i was in kuta , bali in august with my family and found the people there were just so lovely and friendly .
we spoke to one young waiter who told us the last bombings had devastated their tourist trade but they were just beginning to build back up again .
this must be sole destroying for them .
our thoughts are with those people and those families of the victims .
elsie hodges , bristol , uk my wife and i returned from holiday in bali three weeks ago - our third time there .
our hearts go out to the dead and injured but we feel very much for the people of bali - the most welcoming and friendly people anywhere in the world .
do n't stop going - they need our support and they need tourists to survive .
our thoughts and good wishes are with them and words can not express how we feel about the mindless perpetrators of the carnage .
keith millar , aberdeen , scotland i left bali just over 10 days ago and i am shocked and saddened at what has happened .
i was in kuta square just over two weeks ago and i noticed then that there was a lot of security around .
the balinese people are crying out for tourists to come back to the island , many locals asked us to come back next year and to bring our friends and family with us .
the island has so much to offer and the people are amazing .
we should n't let terrorists put us off travelling there - it is no different to going to london these days .
i am hoping to go back in april and will not let these terrorists put me off .
katie clarke , basingstoke , uk only a week ago we spent the most wonderful time at jimbaran beach and kuta .
the video and pictures we made will never be the same .
there will always be a spot of sadness when looking at them .
there is a lot of sorrow in me while thinking of those friendly balinese people who need us tourist so much .
there also is so much anger inside of me against those criminals who did this .
on and on i am asking why ?
sukeirda , amsterdam , netherlands i visited indonesia in the month of september and spent a week in bali , kuta specifically , approximately 1 week prior to the most recent senseless attack .
my eyes were opened upon witnessing the beauty and the kindness that i saw in the whole of indonesia .
i can not quite absorb this fully yet .
it leaves me with a feeling of powerlessness , and i struggle with my desire to help the people of bali and all of indonesia alike .
deeply saddened by witnessing the reality that the human race is prepared to destroy harmony and peace in such a way .
my deepest condolences are with the country and people of indonesia , and the families affected by all the related attacks .
michael mccoy , new york , new york i am a balinese .
it is a coincident that i was -lrb- in 2002 -rrb- and i am now in the uk doing research when the blast occurred .
i have a mix up feeling : sad , up set , and concern .
i hope bali and its people will become stronger .
i do appreciate the supports that are addressed to bali .
arya thanaya , leeds , uk i was in bali when the terrorists attacked in 2002 .
indeed , i lived only a few meters from the location of the bombing .
this year bombing has certainly brought back our sad memory .
i still remember very clearly how the balinese people tried very hard to get back on their feet .
a few months ago , my friend in bali told me that bali was busy again , tourism has lived again .
now , the terrorists attack again for the second time .
i just hope that the balinese people will be tougher .
iyan nurmansyah , an indonesian living in brighton i 'm due to go to bali in january , and am more determined now than ever .
having lived with 30 years of terrorism in northern ireland , the only thing to do is to clear up the mess and rebuild even stronger .
the people of bali need our support now more than ever and i for one intend to give them mine .
david , london , uk i am a british ex-pat living and working in indonesia .
i was not aware of the blasts in bali until i started receiving a flurry of telephone calls from the uk .
it saddens me to learn that there are still people out there who intend on this mindless violence .
indonesia needs the support of foreign tourists , i have lived here seven years and must stress that this violence is not the general attitude of indonesian people .
anthony clark , jakarta , indonesia the people of bali are so welcoming and friendly and have feared the economic impact of more bombs .
hayley hanratty , london , england i arrived back in london on saturday morning after my husband and i enjoyed our honeymoon on bali .
the sadness that i feel on hearing about the bombs can not be expressed in words .
the consequences are much greater than the loss of innocent lives and serious injuries .
the people of bali are so welcoming and friendly and have feared the economic impact of more bombs .
one example is a baliense man who we became friends with called eddie and his wife who both work in tourist surf shops .
they are expecting their first child .
their family 's future depends heavily on tourism , like so many other local people .
my thoughts are with all those on the beautiful island of bali .
hayley hanratty , london , england i spent the last month of my travels in bali before returning home in august and i left my heart there .
the balinese people need our support to help them back on their feet and they have my thoughts and prayers .
natalie george , london we left bali two days ago to continue our travels to malaysia .
our time there was so fantastic , the people so friendly and the island so beautiful ... it is such a shame .
while we were there we visited the memorial to those who lost their lives in the bombs of 2002 ... it is really upsetting to think that another memorial may have to be erected .
one hopes that the spirit of the balinese people will not be diminished by recent events our thoughts and prayers are with them .
zoe shaughnessy , london , england i arrived back from bali yesterday and had noticed that the security at our hotel at the conrad had been stepped up towards the end of last week .
instead of the usual hotel security , there was an armed guard .
the night before we left we went to pj 's at the four seasons hotel at jimbaran beach , i ca n't believe that i was so close to what was going to happen the next day .
i also visited kuta beach several times and saw the area where the bomb went off , i know it would have been really busy with tourists at that time .
my heart goes out to the balinese as they were talking about how they felt that life was just starting to get back to normal after the 2002 bombing .
they are the nicest people you could want to meet and they are so grateful to have tourism within their country , as it is the only form of income they have .
i will say a prayer tonight for all the balinese people .
martine alexander , manchester , uk i am deeply saddened by the news of the bali blasts .
my husband and i returned from bali almost two weeks ago .
it is a beautiful , enchanting and captivating place .
my heart goes out to all of bali and its charming , warm and welcoming people .
mrs paula warburton , lincolnshire , england this is clearly timed to coincide with the recent massive rise in the price of fuel in indonesia : the bombers want to destabilise the country and shake faith in the president .
martin percy , former long-term resident of indonesia the scene of total desolation was in place with whispers of help from people who had been injured mike gallagher , salisbury , uk i saw myself on one of your pics carrying an injured man into an ambulance .
his name is bruce and his wife had been injured and had already been rushed of to hospital .
i was 2 tables away from the second explosion .
after the first explosion on the beach , people were generally unsure as to what it was until the second explosion when the realization dawned on us that they were bombs .
the effect caused a ripple of running people in all directions .
the scene of total desolation was in place with whispers of help from people who had been injured a half buried in the sand .
to think that 5 mins earlier the whole place was the busiest i had seen since coming here .
mike gallagher , salisbury , uk we need to have a central web site where loved ones can go when such tragedies occur to help reunite family members .
i 've come across a few but we need our governments to get behind the idea .
here is an example www.lookingforsurvivors.com angelo , australia i am from england working here and i was out with me mates when we heard a big bang !
we ran out side of the shop we were in and saw just destruction !
people on the ground and blood everywhere !
ryan , kuta / ex england i 'm in kuta now .
manic on the streets , no one really knows what 's going on .
i saw people running and crying .
police telling everyone where to go .
all tourists have given up for the night , everyone trying to get internet access , nightspots are empty .
there 's an air of unease and unrest here .
george maccallum , greenwich , london i left kuta this morning due to a last minute change of plan .
i feel a mixture of guilt and luck to have left just in time .
my thoughts are with the local people who are re-living the horrors of the 2002 bombings and for all the injured .
grainne tierney , london , uk i left bali yesterday and am obviously shocked by the recent events in .
what i think saddens me the most if how friendly and hospitable i found people in indonesia and their eagerness for tourists to enjoy and return to their country .
with two bombings in three years tourism and along with it a lot of livelihoods will be lost , and for this i feel for the people of bali .
sally rice , wickham , hampshire i live in the kuta area and heard three explosions .
one hit the hard rock cafe area in kuta .
another was in front of the four seasons beach resort in jimbaran bay on the other side of the airport from kuta .
the third was apparently somewhere in the nusa dua resort area .
anon we were 40-50 meters away from the two explosions on jimbaran beach in pj 's restaurant in the four seasons .
we heard one loud explosion whereby everyone immediately stood up and thought the worst .
it was followed by another about 25 seconds later .
i believe they targeted a local open air fish market restaurant run by the balanise with no security .
we were the first out of there but saw two wounded by the roadside , one with shoulder and one with perhaps minor head injuries .
the first explosion seemed weak and for a split second we wondered if it was a large firework .
the second was slightly louder and we could see the smoke drift across the beach in front of us as people slipped from their tables on the beach to our right .
otherwise everyone seemed to be very rational , however i did n't witness events in the area of the immediate explosion .
my sympathy to all involved .
dan delhomme , stevenage , england i was in jimbaran bay when i heard two explosions closely follow by one another .
i was at a restaurant called ganesa at the time .
there is massive traffic in kuta .
still waiting for more details to flow in .
robert holmes , uk i am an english ex-pat living and working in indonesia .
it is terrible to hear this news about another attack on innocent victims .
however having lived in jakarta for the past three years i must remind people that indonesia is a safe place and the people are incredibly hospitable and warm .
this is nothing more than a mindless attack from a crazed minority and not a reflection of indonesians general attitude towards foreigners .
jeremy , jakarta , indonesia my heart goes out to the indonesian people .
be sure that the hearts of the australian people are with you and condemn these cowardly attacks on innocent people wayno , melbourne australia we were having dinner just down the road from the kuta explosion when it happened .
the noise was deafening .
like a thousand fireworks going off at one time .
people are still being transported to hospital from the site .
it seems like chaos .

after the rash of stories about supermodel kate moss ' alleged cocaine abuse , mr goggins says there is no need for a " counsel of despair " about drugs .
on thursday he will start a tour of england to try to show how the government is tackling the problem .
the tour comes after a bleak report on drugs from tony blair 's top thinkers .
a report from the prime minister 's strategy unit , written in 2003 but only published in july through freedom of information laws and leaks , said there had been no sustainable disruption of the drugs market at any level over the past 20 years .
roadshow mr goggins was interviewed by the bbc news website as part of a major series of articles about drugs in the uk .
britain 's drugs habit the bbc news website is exploring drugs in britain in a special series of features .
we look at how drugs get here , who uses them and whether current anti-drugs strategies are working .
in depth : britain 's drugs habit analysis : labour 's drug battle over the next month he will hold nine regional events about drugs policies in cities such as salford , durham , gloucester and hull .
the idea is to give local residents , police and councillors the chance to question him .
he said : " we need to have a slightly more mature debate about the drugs strategy because we 're constantly bombarded with stories in the media about individuals and problems of drug misuse and the impact they have .
" and i think we need to balance that out with more information about what precisely the government 's doing and what the impact is and the fact that drug misuse of the most serious drugs is at worst stable , and in some areas we may begin to see some reductions . "
he particularly wants to counter what he sees as a " popular misconception that drug misuse is escalating out of control " .
celebrity treatment by coincidence , the tour follows supermodel kate moss losing lucrative advertising contracts after claims she snorted cocaine .
mr goggins would not comment on any particular celebrity but said such headlines opened up the wider drugs debate .
there must an " unremitting " message to young people that " drugs are bad for you , " he said .
mr goggins is pleased more drugs are being seized " the thing about role models is they should be treated in exactly the same way as anybody else .
" they should not be given treatment either more severe or less severe either in the criticism or in the treatment than anybody else .
" anybody who has a problem needs to change their behaviour and the job of government is to be there to make sure that they get supported in that . "
asked if that meant celebrities should lose their jobs - as happened to ms moss - he replied : " that 's for others to decide . "
why not legalise ?
cocaine is now the second most widely taken drug after cannabis , with 755,000 users in england and wales , according to the british crime survey .
mr goggins said he was concerned about cocaine but said use of the drug was relatively stable overall , despite some evidence it had increased for over-25s .
cocaine is now the second most popular drug in the uk after cannabis the drugs debate was given a shake-up earlier this summer by the publication in the guardian newspaper of the strategy unit report .
it said the supply of drugs had increased and prices were low enough not to deter people taking up drugs , but high enough to make heavy users commit crime to feed their habits .
advocates of legalisation seized upon the report to support their cause .
mr goggins said it was interesting but should not be taken to reflect government policy .
" there are people who believe in legalisation in principle and there are people who believe in legalisation out of a pragmatic sense of complete failure , " he said .
" i 'd reject both of those arguments out of hand . "
' do n't despair ' cabinet minister tessa jowell earlier this year said prohibition did not work for tobacco , alcohol and gambling - so why are illegal drugs different ?
we 're posing a tough choice for people , saying ' we 're prepared to offer you treatment ... but you 've got to be prepared to get off drugs , to stay out of crime ' mr goggins said there was no reason to give ground on harmful illegal drugs just because drinking and smoking have been allowed in the uk 's history .
he warned : " if you legalise them then far more people would be using them and that overall would be doing far more harm to our society than is currently the case . "
instead of adopting a " counsel of despair " , the government must stick resolutely to its strategy , he argued .
with the focus now on turning that strategy into reality , mr goggins said a " step change " in resources meant the government was half way towards its target of 1,000 people into treatment a week by 2008 .
he predicted : " once we get this kind of critical mass developing i think we will see a bigger impact in terms of the number of people coming off drugs and the number of people therefore not committing crimes to feed that habit . "
' tough choice ' he said property crime , often related to drugs , fell by 12 % in the year to april 2005 .
people charged with offences can already be tested for drugs .
key trends in uk drug use at-a-glance parliament has agreed to extend the power to anybody arrested - something which looks set to be rolled out this autumn , possibly tied to a drugs conference being attended by tony blair .
" increasingly what we 're doing is posing a tough choice for people , " said mr goggins .
" it 's about saying ' this is a serious issue , we 're prepared to offer you treatment , help and support but you 've got to be prepared to get off drugs , to stay out of crime ...
" ' and by the way , if you are not going to co-operate with that , well there are going to be some consequences . " '
does treatment work ?
critics say the problem with putting so much attention on treatment is that only about a third of people finish the course .
mr goggins acknowledges quality , not just quantity , of treatment is vital but he said signs from early trials show pushing people into treatment can work .
" these were people who were thieving every day to feed a very expensive drug habit and at the end of the treatment they 'd stopped and that 's quite impressive , " he said .
the latest evidence suggests more than half of those on all types of treatment are lasting the course , he says .
mr goggins is also upbeat about efforts to disrupt the supply of drugs , pointing to figures released in august showing more drugs were seized from fewer raids in 2003 than 2002 .
the minister believes the rates will increase as the new serious organised crime agency begins work .
and he also pointed to new measures to seize drug dealers ' assets .
but the strategy unit report suggested successful drug traffickers were only put out of business if more than 60 % of their drugs were seized .
mr goggins ' response is simple : " what i 'm responsible for is not the drugs strategy unit report but for the drugs strategy . "
newspaper headlines then are perhaps the least of his worries .

after the rash of stories about supermodel kate moss ' alleged cocaine abuse , mr goggins says there is no need for a " counsel of despair " about drugs .
on thursday he will start a tour of england to try to show how the government is tackling the problem .
the tour comes after a bleak report on drugs from tony blair 's top thinkers .
a report from the prime minister 's strategy unit , written in 2003 but only published in july through freedom of information laws and leaks , said there had been no sustainable disruption of the drugs market at any level over the past 20 years .
roadshow mr goggins was interviewed by the bbc news website as part of a major series of articles about drugs in the uk .
britain 's drugs habit the bbc news website is exploring drugs in britain in a special series of features .
we look at how drugs get here , who uses them and whether current anti-drugs strategies are working .
in depth : britain 's drugs habit analysis : labour 's drug battle over the next month he will hold nine regional events about drugs policies in cities such as salford , durham , gloucester and hull .
the idea is to give local residents , police and councillors the chance to question him .
he said : " we need to have a slightly more mature debate about the drugs strategy because we 're constantly bombarded with stories in the media about individuals and problems of drug misuse and the impact they have .
" and i think we need to balance that out with more information about what precisely the government 's doing and what the impact is and the fact that drug misuse of the most serious drugs is at worst stable , and in some areas we may begin to see some reductions . "
he particularly wants to counter what he sees as a " popular misconception that drug misuse is escalating out of control " .
celebrity treatment by coincidence , the tour follows supermodel kate moss losing lucrative advertising contracts after claims she snorted cocaine .
mr goggins would not comment on any particular celebrity but said such headlines opened up the wider drugs debate .
there must an " unremitting " message to young people that " drugs are bad for you , " he said .
mr goggins is pleased more drugs are being seized " the thing about role models is they should be treated in exactly the same way as anybody else .
" they should not be given treatment either more severe or less severe either in the criticism or in the treatment than anybody else .
" anybody who has a problem needs to change their behaviour and the job of government is to be there to make sure that they get supported in that . "
asked if that meant celebrities should lose their jobs - as happened to ms moss - he replied : " that 's for others to decide . "
why not legalise ?
cocaine is now the second most widely taken drug after cannabis , with 755,000 users in england and wales , according to the british crime survey .
mr goggins said he was concerned about cocaine but said use of the drug was relatively stable overall , despite some evidence it had increased for over-25s .
cocaine is now the second most popular drug in the uk after cannabis the drugs debate was given a shake-up earlier this summer by the publication in the guardian newspaper of the strategy unit report .
it said the supply of drugs had increased and prices were low enough not to deter people taking up drugs , but high enough to make heavy users commit crime to feed their habits .
advocates of legalisation seized upon the report to support their cause .
mr goggins said it was interesting but should not be taken to reflect government policy .
" there are people who believe in legalisation in principle and there are people who believe in legalisation out of a pragmatic sense of complete failure , " he said .
" i 'd reject both of those arguments out of hand . "
' do n't despair ' cabinet minister tessa jowell earlier this year said prohibition did not work for tobacco , alcohol and gambling - so why are illegal drugs different ?
we 're posing a tough choice for people , saying ' we 're prepared to offer you treatment ... but you 've got to be prepared to get off drugs , to stay out of crime ' mr goggins said there was no reason to give ground on harmful illegal drugs just because drinking and smoking have been allowed in the uk 's history .
he warned : " if you legalise them then far more people would be using them and that overall would be doing far more harm to our society than is currently the case . "
instead of adopting a " counsel of despair " , the government must stick resolutely to its strategy , he argued .
with the focus now on turning that strategy into reality , mr goggins said a " step change " in resources meant the government was half way towards its target of 1,000 people into treatment a week by 2008 .
he predicted : " once we get this kind of critical mass developing i think we will see a bigger impact in terms of the number of people coming off drugs and the number of people therefore not committing crimes to feed that habit . "
' tough choice ' he said property crime , often related to drugs , fell by 12 % in the year to april 2005 .
people charged with offences can already be tested for drugs .
key trends in uk drug use at-a-glance parliament has agreed to extend the power to anybody arrested - something which looks set to be rolled out this autumn , possibly tied to a drugs conference being attended by tony blair .
" increasingly what we 're doing is posing a tough choice for people , " said mr goggins .
" it 's about saying ' this is a serious issue , we 're prepared to offer you treatment , help and support but you 've got to be prepared to get off drugs , to stay out of crime ...
" ' and by the way , if you are not going to co-operate with that , well there are going to be some consequences . " '
does treatment work ?
critics say the problem with putting so much attention on treatment is that only about a third of people finish the course .
mr goggins acknowledges quality , not just quantity , of treatment is vital but he said signs from early trials show pushing people into treatment can work .
" these were people who were thieving every day to feed a very expensive drug habit and at the end of the treatment they 'd stopped and that 's quite impressive , " he said .
the latest evidence suggests more than half of those on all types of treatment are lasting the course , he says .
mr goggins is also upbeat about efforts to disrupt the supply of drugs , pointing to figures released in august showing more drugs were seized from fewer raids in 2003 than 2002 .
the minister believes the rates will increase as the new serious organised crime agency begins work .
and he also pointed to new measures to seize drug dealers ' assets .
but the strategy unit report suggested successful drug traffickers were only put out of business if more than 60 % of their drugs were seized .
mr goggins ' response is simple : " what i 'm responsible for is not the drugs strategy unit report but for the drugs strategy . "
newspaper headlines then are perhaps the least of his worries .

after the rash of stories about supermodel kate moss ' alleged cocaine abuse , mr goggins says there is no need for a " counsel of despair " about drugs .
on thursday he will start a tour of england to try to show how the government is tackling the problem .
the tour comes after a bleak report on drugs from tony blair 's top thinkers .
a report from the prime minister 's strategy unit , written in 2003 but only published in july through freedom of information laws and leaks , said there had been no sustainable disruption of the drugs market at any level over the past 20 years .
roadshow mr goggins was interviewed by the bbc news website as part of a major series of articles about drugs in the uk .
britain 's drugs habit the bbc news website is exploring drugs in britain in a special series of features .
we look at how drugs get here , who uses them and whether current anti-drugs strategies are working .
in depth : britain 's drugs habit analysis : labour 's drug battle over the next month he will hold nine regional events about drugs policies in cities such as salford , durham , gloucester and hull .
the idea is to give local residents , police and councillors the chance to question him .
he said : " we need to have a slightly more mature debate about the drugs strategy because we 're constantly bombarded with stories in the media about individuals and problems of drug misuse and the impact they have .
" and i think we need to balance that out with more information about what precisely the government 's doing and what the impact is and the fact that drug misuse of the most serious drugs is at worst stable , and in some areas we may begin to see some reductions . "
he particularly wants to counter what he sees as a " popular misconception that drug misuse is escalating out of control " .
celebrity treatment by coincidence , the tour follows supermodel kate moss losing lucrative advertising contracts after claims she snorted cocaine .
mr goggins would not comment on any particular celebrity but said such headlines opened up the wider drugs debate .
there must an " unremitting " message to young people that " drugs are bad for you , " he said .
mr goggins is pleased more drugs are being seized " the thing about role models is they should be treated in exactly the same way as anybody else .
" they should not be given treatment either more severe or less severe either in the criticism or in the treatment than anybody else .
" anybody who has a problem needs to change their behaviour and the job of government is to be there to make sure that they get supported in that . "
asked if that meant celebrities should lose their jobs - as happened to ms moss - he replied : " that 's for others to decide . "
why not legalise ?
cocaine is now the second most widely taken drug after cannabis , with 755,000 users in england and wales , according to the british crime survey .
mr goggins said he was concerned about cocaine but said use of the drug was relatively stable overall , despite some evidence it had increased for over-25s .
cocaine is now the second most popular drug in the uk after cannabis the drugs debate was given a shake-up earlier this summer by the publication in the guardian newspaper of the strategy unit report .
it said the supply of drugs had increased and prices were low enough not to deter people taking up drugs , but high enough to make heavy users commit crime to feed their habits .
advocates of legalisation seized upon the report to support their cause .
mr goggins said it was interesting but should not be taken to reflect government policy .
" there are people who believe in legalisation in principle and there are people who believe in legalisation out of a pragmatic sense of complete failure , " he said .
" i 'd reject both of those arguments out of hand . "
' do n't despair ' cabinet minister tessa jowell earlier this year said prohibition did not work for tobacco , alcohol and gambling - so why are illegal drugs different ?
we 're posing a tough choice for people , saying ' we 're prepared to offer you treatment ... but you 've got to be prepared to get off drugs , to stay out of crime ' mr goggins said there was no reason to give ground on harmful illegal drugs just because drinking and smoking have been allowed in the uk 's history .
he warned : " if you legalise them then far more people would be using them and that overall would be doing far more harm to our society than is currently the case . "
instead of adopting a " counsel of despair " , the government must stick resolutely to its strategy , he argued .
with the focus now on turning that strategy into reality , mr goggins said a " step change " in resources meant the government was half way towards its target of 1,000 people into treatment a week by 2008 .
he predicted : " once we get this kind of critical mass developing i think we will see a bigger impact in terms of the number of people coming off drugs and the number of people therefore not committing crimes to feed that habit . "
' tough choice ' he said property crime , often related to drugs , fell by 12 % in the year to april 2005 .
people charged with offences can already be tested for drugs .
key trends in uk drug use at-a-glance parliament has agreed to extend the power to anybody arrested - something which looks set to be rolled out this autumn , possibly tied to a drugs conference being attended by tony blair .
" increasingly what we 're doing is posing a tough choice for people , " said mr goggins .
" it 's about saying ' this is a serious issue , we 're prepared to offer you treatment , help and support but you 've got to be prepared to get off drugs , to stay out of crime ...
" ' and by the way , if you are not going to co-operate with that , well there are going to be some consequences . " '
does treatment work ?
critics say the problem with putting so much attention on treatment is that only about a third of people finish the course .
mr goggins acknowledges quality , not just quantity , of treatment is vital but he said signs from early trials show pushing people into treatment can work .
" these were people who were thieving every day to feed a very expensive drug habit and at the end of the treatment they 'd stopped and that 's quite impressive , " he said .
the latest evidence suggests more than half of those on all types of treatment are lasting the course , he says .
mr goggins is also upbeat about efforts to disrupt the supply of drugs , pointing to figures released in august showing more drugs were seized from fewer raids in 2003 than 2002 .
the minister believes the rates will increase as the new serious organised crime agency begins work .
and he also pointed to new measures to seize drug dealers ' assets .
but the strategy unit report suggested successful drug traffickers were only put out of business if more than 60 % of their drugs were seized .
mr goggins ' response is simple : " what i 'm responsible for is not the drugs strategy unit report but for the drugs strategy . "
newspaper headlines then are perhaps the least of his worries .

after the rash of stories about supermodel kate moss ' alleged cocaine abuse , mr goggins says there is no need for a " counsel of despair " about drugs .
on thursday he will start a tour of england to try to show how the government is tackling the problem .
the tour comes after a bleak report on drugs from tony blair 's top thinkers .
a report from the prime minister 's strategy unit , written in 2003 but only published in july through freedom of information laws and leaks , said there had been no sustainable disruption of the drugs market at any level over the past 20 years .
roadshow mr goggins was interviewed by the bbc news website as part of a major series of articles about drugs in the uk .
britain 's drugs habit the bbc news website is exploring drugs in britain in a special series of features .
we look at how drugs get here , who uses them and whether current anti-drugs strategies are working .
in depth : britain 's drugs habit analysis : labour 's drug battle over the next month he will hold nine regional events about drugs policies in cities such as salford , durham , gloucester and hull .
the idea is to give local residents , police and councillors the chance to question him .
he said : " we need to have a slightly more mature debate about the drugs strategy because we 're constantly bombarded with stories in the media about individuals and problems of drug misuse and the impact they have .
" and i think we need to balance that out with more information about what precisely the government 's doing and what the impact is and the fact that drug misuse of the most serious drugs is at worst stable , and in some areas we may begin to see some reductions . "
he particularly wants to counter what he sees as a " popular misconception that drug misuse is escalating out of control " .
celebrity treatment by coincidence , the tour follows supermodel kate moss losing lucrative advertising contracts after claims she snorted cocaine .
mr goggins would not comment on any particular celebrity but said such headlines opened up the wider drugs debate .
there must an " unremitting " message to young people that " drugs are bad for you , " he said .
mr goggins is pleased more drugs are being seized " the thing about role models is they should be treated in exactly the same way as anybody else .
" they should not be given treatment either more severe or less severe either in the criticism or in the treatment than anybody else .
" anybody who has a problem needs to change their behaviour and the job of government is to be there to make sure that they get supported in that . "
asked if that meant celebrities should lose their jobs - as happened to ms moss - he replied : " that 's for others to decide . "
why not legalise ?
cocaine is now the second most widely taken drug after cannabis , with 755,000 users in england and wales , according to the british crime survey .
mr goggins said he was concerned about cocaine but said use of the drug was relatively stable overall , despite some evidence it had increased for over-25s .
cocaine is now the second most popular drug in the uk after cannabis the drugs debate was given a shake-up earlier this summer by the publication in the guardian newspaper of the strategy unit report .
it said the supply of drugs had increased and prices were low enough not to deter people taking up drugs , but high enough to make heavy users commit crime to feed their habits .
advocates of legalisation seized upon the report to support their cause .
mr goggins said it was interesting but should not be taken to reflect government policy .
" there are people who believe in legalisation in principle and there are people who believe in legalisation out of a pragmatic sense of complete failure , " he said .
" i 'd reject both of those arguments out of hand . "
' do n't despair ' cabinet minister tessa jowell earlier this year said prohibition did not work for tobacco , alcohol and gambling - so why are illegal drugs different ?
we 're posing a tough choice for people , saying ' we 're prepared to offer you treatment ... but you 've got to be prepared to get off drugs , to stay out of crime ' mr goggins said there was no reason to give ground on harmful illegal drugs just because drinking and smoking have been allowed in the uk 's history .
he warned : " if you legalise them then far more people would be using them and that overall would be doing far more harm to our society than is currently the case . "
instead of adopting a " counsel of despair " , the government must stick resolutely to its strategy , he argued .
with the focus now on turning that strategy into reality , mr goggins said a " step change " in resources meant the government was half way towards its target of 1,000 people into treatment a week by 2008 .
he predicted : " once we get this kind of critical mass developing i think we will see a bigger impact in terms of the number of people coming off drugs and the number of people therefore not committing crimes to feed that habit . "
' tough choice ' he said property crime , often related to drugs , fell by 12 % in the year to april 2005 .
people charged with offences can already be tested for drugs .
key trends in uk drug use at-a-glance parliament has agreed to extend the power to anybody arrested - something which looks set to be rolled out this autumn , possibly tied to a drugs conference being attended by tony blair .
" increasingly what we 're doing is posing a tough choice for people , " said mr goggins .
" it 's about saying ' this is a serious issue , we 're prepared to offer you treatment , help and support but you 've got to be prepared to get off drugs , to stay out of crime ...
" ' and by the way , if you are not going to co-operate with that , well there are going to be some consequences . " '
does treatment work ?
critics say the problem with putting so much attention on treatment is that only about a third of people finish the course .
mr goggins acknowledges quality , not just quantity , of treatment is vital but he said signs from early trials show pushing people into treatment can work .
" these were people who were thieving every day to feed a very expensive drug habit and at the end of the treatment they 'd stopped and that 's quite impressive , " he said .
the latest evidence suggests more than half of those on all types of treatment are lasting the course , he says .
mr goggins is also upbeat about efforts to disrupt the supply of drugs , pointing to figures released in august showing more drugs were seized from fewer raids in 2003 than 2002 .
the minister believes the rates will increase as the new serious organised crime agency begins work .
and he also pointed to new measures to seize drug dealers ' assets .
but the strategy unit report suggested successful drug traffickers were only put out of business if more than 60 % of their drugs were seized .
mr goggins ' response is simple : " what i 'm responsible for is not the drugs strategy unit report but for the drugs strategy . "
newspaper headlines then are perhaps the least of his worries .

after the rash of stories about supermodel kate moss ' alleged cocaine abuse , mr goggins says there is no need for a " counsel of despair " about drugs .
on thursday he will start a tour of england to try to show how the government is tackling the problem .
the tour comes after a bleak report on drugs from tony blair 's top thinkers .
a report from the prime minister 's strategy unit , written in 2003 but only published in july through freedom of information laws and leaks , said there had been no sustainable disruption of the drugs market at any level over the past 20 years .
roadshow mr goggins was interviewed by the bbc news website as part of a major series of articles about drugs in the uk .
britain 's drugs habit the bbc news website is exploring drugs in britain in a special series of features .
we look at how drugs get here , who uses them and whether current anti-drugs strategies are working .
in depth : britain 's drugs habit analysis : labour 's drug battle over the next month he will hold nine regional events about drugs policies in cities such as salford , durham , gloucester and hull .
the idea is to give local residents , police and councillors the chance to question him .
he said : " we need to have a slightly more mature debate about the drugs strategy because we 're constantly bombarded with stories in the media about individuals and problems of drug misuse and the impact they have .
" and i think we need to balance that out with more information about what precisely the government 's doing and what the impact is and the fact that drug misuse of the most serious drugs is at worst stable , and in some areas we may begin to see some reductions . "
he particularly wants to counter what he sees as a " popular misconception that drug misuse is escalating out of control " .
celebrity treatment by coincidence , the tour follows supermodel kate moss losing lucrative advertising contracts after claims she snorted cocaine .
mr goggins would not comment on any particular celebrity but said such headlines opened up the wider drugs debate .
there must an " unremitting " message to young people that " drugs are bad for you , " he said .
mr goggins is pleased more drugs are being seized " the thing about role models is they should be treated in exactly the same way as anybody else .
" they should not be given treatment either more severe or less severe either in the criticism or in the treatment than anybody else .
" anybody who has a problem needs to change their behaviour and the job of government is to be there to make sure that they get supported in that . "
asked if that meant celebrities should lose their jobs - as happened to ms moss - he replied : " that 's for others to decide . "
why not legalise ?
cocaine is now the second most widely taken drug after cannabis , with 755,000 users in england and wales , according to the british crime survey .
mr goggins said he was concerned about cocaine but said use of the drug was relatively stable overall , despite some evidence it had increased for over-25s .
cocaine is now the second most popular drug in the uk after cannabis the drugs debate was given a shake-up earlier this summer by the publication in the guardian newspaper of the strategy unit report .
it said the supply of drugs had increased and prices were low enough not to deter people taking up drugs , but high enough to make heavy users commit crime to feed their habits .
advocates of legalisation seized upon the report to support their cause .
mr goggins said it was interesting but should not be taken to reflect government policy .
" there are people who believe in legalisation in principle and there are people who believe in legalisation out of a pragmatic sense of complete failure , " he said .
" i 'd reject both of those arguments out of hand . "
' do n't despair ' cabinet minister tessa jowell earlier this year said prohibition did not work for tobacco , alcohol and gambling - so why are illegal drugs different ?
we 're posing a tough choice for people , saying ' we 're prepared to offer you treatment ... but you 've got to be prepared to get off drugs , to stay out of crime ' mr goggins said there was no reason to give ground on harmful illegal drugs just because drinking and smoking have been allowed in the uk 's history .
he warned : " if you legalise them then far more people would be using them and that overall would be doing far more harm to our society than is currently the case . "
instead of adopting a " counsel of despair " , the government must stick resolutely to its strategy , he argued .
with the focus now on turning that strategy into reality , mr goggins said a " step change " in resources meant the government was half way towards its target of 1,000 people into treatment a week by 2008 .
he predicted : " once we get this kind of critical mass developing i think we will see a bigger impact in terms of the number of people coming off drugs and the number of people therefore not committing crimes to feed that habit . "
' tough choice ' he said property crime , often related to drugs , fell by 12 % in the year to april 2005 .
people charged with offences can already be tested for drugs .
key trends in uk drug use at-a-glance parliament has agreed to extend the power to anybody arrested - something which looks set to be rolled out this autumn , possibly tied to a drugs conference being attended by tony blair .
" increasingly what we 're doing is posing a tough choice for people , " said mr goggins .
" it 's about saying ' this is a serious issue , we 're prepared to offer you treatment , help and support but you 've got to be prepared to get off drugs , to stay out of crime ...
" ' and by the way , if you are not going to co-operate with that , well there are going to be some consequences . " '
does treatment work ?
critics say the problem with putting so much attention on treatment is that only about a third of people finish the course .
mr goggins acknowledges quality , not just quantity , of treatment is vital but he said signs from early trials show pushing people into treatment can work .
" these were people who were thieving every day to feed a very expensive drug habit and at the end of the treatment they 'd stopped and that 's quite impressive , " he said .
the latest evidence suggests more than half of those on all types of treatment are lasting the course , he says .
mr goggins is also upbeat about efforts to disrupt the supply of drugs , pointing to figures released in august showing more drugs were seized from fewer raids in 2003 than 2002 .
the minister believes the rates will increase as the new serious organised crime agency begins work .
and he also pointed to new measures to seize drug dealers ' assets .
but the strategy unit report suggested successful drug traffickers were only put out of business if more than 60 % of their drugs were seized .
mr goggins ' response is simple : " what i 'm responsible for is not the drugs strategy unit report but for the drugs strategy . "
newspaper headlines then are perhaps the least of his worries .

after the rash of stories about supermodel kate moss ' alleged cocaine abuse , mr goggins says there is no need for a " counsel of despair " about drugs .
on thursday he will start a tour of england to try to show how the government is tackling the problem .
the tour comes after a bleak report on drugs from tony blair 's top thinkers .
a report from the prime minister 's strategy unit , written in 2003 but only published in july through freedom of information laws and leaks , said there had been no sustainable disruption of the drugs market at any level over the past 20 years .
roadshow mr goggins was interviewed by the bbc news website as part of a major series of articles about drugs in the uk .
britain 's drugs habit the bbc news website is exploring drugs in britain in a special series of features .
we look at how drugs get here , who uses them and whether current anti-drugs strategies are working .
in depth : britain 's drugs habit analysis : labour 's drug battle over the next month he will hold nine regional events about drugs policies in cities such as salford , durham , gloucester and hull .
the idea is to give local residents , police and councillors the chance to question him .
he said : " we need to have a slightly more mature debate about the drugs strategy because we 're constantly bombarded with stories in the media about individuals and problems of drug misuse and the impact they have .
" and i think we need to balance that out with more information about what precisely the government 's doing and what the impact is and the fact that drug misuse of the most serious drugs is at worst stable , and in some areas we may begin to see some reductions . "
he particularly wants to counter what he sees as a " popular misconception that drug misuse is escalating out of control " .
celebrity treatment by coincidence , the tour follows supermodel kate moss losing lucrative advertising contracts after claims she snorted cocaine .
mr goggins would not comment on any particular celebrity but said such headlines opened up the wider drugs debate .
there must an " unremitting " message to young people that " drugs are bad for you , " he said .
mr goggins is pleased more drugs are being seized " the thing about role models is they should be treated in exactly the same way as anybody else .
" they should not be given treatment either more severe or less severe either in the criticism or in the treatment than anybody else .
" anybody who has a problem needs to change their behaviour and the job of government is to be there to make sure that they get supported in that . "
asked if that meant celebrities should lose their jobs - as happened to ms moss - he replied : " that 's for others to decide . "
why not legalise ?
cocaine is now the second most widely taken drug after cannabis , with 755,000 users in england and wales , according to the british crime survey .
mr goggins said he was concerned about cocaine but said use of the drug was relatively stable overall , despite some evidence it had increased for over-25s .
cocaine is now the second most popular drug in the uk after cannabis the drugs debate was given a shake-up earlier this summer by the publication in the guardian newspaper of the strategy unit report .
it said the supply of drugs had increased and prices were low enough not to deter people taking up drugs , but high enough to make heavy users commit crime to feed their habits .
advocates of legalisation seized upon the report to support their cause .
mr goggins said it was interesting but should not be taken to reflect government policy .
" there are people who believe in legalisation in principle and there are people who believe in legalisation out of a pragmatic sense of complete failure , " he said .
" i 'd reject both of those arguments out of hand . "
' do n't despair ' cabinet minister tessa jowell earlier this year said prohibition did not work for tobacco , alcohol and gambling - so why are illegal drugs different ?
we 're posing a tough choice for people , saying ' we 're prepared to offer you treatment ... but you 've got to be prepared to get off drugs , to stay out of crime ' mr goggins said there was no reason to give ground on harmful illegal drugs just because drinking and smoking have been allowed in the uk 's history .
he warned : " if you legalise them then far more people would be using them and that overall would be doing far more harm to our society than is currently the case . "
instead of adopting a " counsel of despair " , the government must stick resolutely to its strategy , he argued .
with the focus now on turning that strategy into reality , mr goggins said a " step change " in resources meant the government was half way towards its target of 1,000 people into treatment a week by 2008 .
he predicted : " once we get this kind of critical mass developing i think we will see a bigger impact in terms of the number of people coming off drugs and the number of people therefore not committing crimes to feed that habit . "
' tough choice ' he said property crime , often related to drugs , fell by 12 % in the year to april 2005 .
people charged with offences can already be tested for drugs .
key trends in uk drug use at-a-glance parliament has agreed to extend the power to anybody arrested - something which looks set to be rolled out this autumn , possibly tied to a drugs conference being attended by tony blair .
" increasingly what we 're doing is posing a tough choice for people , " said mr goggins .
" it 's about saying ' this is a serious issue , we 're prepared to offer you treatment , help and support but you 've got to be prepared to get off drugs , to stay out of crime ...
" ' and by the way , if you are not going to co-operate with that , well there are going to be some consequences . " '
does treatment work ?
critics say the problem with putting so much attention on treatment is that only about a third of people finish the course .
mr goggins acknowledges quality , not just quantity , of treatment is vital but he said signs from early trials show pushing people into treatment can work .
" these were people who were thieving every day to feed a very expensive drug habit and at the end of the treatment they 'd stopped and that 's quite impressive , " he said .
the latest evidence suggests more than half of those on all types of treatment are lasting the course , he says .
mr goggins is also upbeat about efforts to disrupt the supply of drugs , pointing to figures released in august showing more drugs were seized from fewer raids in 2003 than 2002 .
the minister believes the rates will increase as the new serious organised crime agency begins work .
and he also pointed to new measures to seize drug dealers ' assets .
but the strategy unit report suggested successful drug traffickers were only put out of business if more than 60 % of their drugs were seized .
mr goggins ' response is simple : " what i 'm responsible for is not the drugs strategy unit report but for the drugs strategy . "
newspaper headlines then are perhaps the least of his worries .
