the list was published by the french civil aviation authority , dgac , on its internet site monday .
most of the interdictions had already been made in 2004 ; the air koryo interdiction goes as far back as april 2001 .
' black mo n th ' of august the blacklist is france 's reaction to the " black month " of august , which to date has seen five bad airline accidents and more than 330 resultant deaths .
a week ago , a west caribean airways plane crashed in venezuela en route to the french caribbean island of martinique , causing 160 deaths of which 152 were french citizens .

so far , france is the third european country , after great britain and sweden , to publicize its own blacklist for airlines .
belgium has also announced plans to publish its own list .
britain not only forbids certain airlines from flying to the country , it disallows planes or airlines from entire countries on the grounds that they do not implement security measures strictly enough .
these countries include the democratic republic of congo , equatorial guinea , liberia , sierra leone , swaziland and tajikistan .
the swiss civil aviation authority said it will publish its own list on thursday .
eu list slated for year e n d in publishing its list , france beat the european union to the punch .
the eu plans to have prepared a european-wide list of banned airlines by the end of 2005 .
candidates for the list are currently being discussed in the european parliament , but no fast date has been set for publication of the list .
bildunterschrift : the west caribbean airways plane that crashed in the mountains of western venezuela in august " we hope the list will be adopted very soon , late this year or early next year , " european commission spokesman rupert krietemeyer said recently at a briefing .
but while the eu 's 25 member states agreed in april to the idea of eventually publishing the names of banned airlines , they disagree on what criteria to use for drawing up such a list .
" we have to set common criteria at the european level , " said an official at the european commission .
airli n e i n dustry doubtful for its part , the aviation industry is skeptical about the effectiveness of blacklists .
such lists are usually based on already known security deficits or high accident rates .
therefore , it gives " the false impression that those who are not on the list are entirely safe , " according to lufthansa manager carsten spohr .
" even bad airlines have safe flights on most days . "
bildunterschrift : tunisian airline wreck in italy , in august .
on an international level , airlines are currently not obligated to publicize security problems that have come to light .
thus the french authorities did not know that in columbia - the home of west caribbean airways - had imposed a fine on the airline for severe safety violations .
i n formatio n shari n g i n europe in europe , the situation is different .
the european civil aviation conference -lrb- ecac -rrb- has begun a control and warning system for airlines .
" if a national aviation authority finds technical defects during a random control , that information goes into a data bank and the information then goes out to the other member countries , " said cornelia eichhorn , speaker for the german aviation authority .
then each nation can decide for itself whether to restrict that airline 's landing rights .
but the main problem in putting together blacklists is unlikely to be affected by european cooperation .
each individual airline 's safety can only be effectively tested by its own country .
in terms of the safety of foreign carriers , european officials need to rely on the individual country 's safety regulators and their own controls . sebastian ertinger -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu airlines blacklist easier said than done a series of airplane crashes has spurred european countries to ban airlines deemed unsafe , although drawing up an eu-wide list of trouble-plagued carriers - as the eu 's executive commission wants - is proving elusive .
-lrb- aug .
26 , 2005 -rrb- eu air safety rules fall short although the european union has stepped up safety rules for the air transport sector in recent years , the bloc is still dogged by a lack of coordination and sometimes patchy application of existing regulations .

or should europe make such a list for all eu countries ?

the list was published by the french civil aviation authority , dgac , on its internet site monday .
most of the interdictions had already been made in 2004 ; the air koryo interdiction goes as far back as april 2001 .
' black mo n th ' of august the blacklist is france 's reaction to the " black month " of august , which to date has seen five bad airline accidents and more than 330 resultant deaths .
a week ago , a west caribean airways plane crashed in venezuela en route to the french caribbean island of martinique , causing 160 deaths of which 152 were french citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescue workers examine site of an airplane crash in niederanven , luxembourg , in 2002 .
so far , france is the third european country , after great britain and sweden , to publicize its own blacklist for airlines .
belgium has also announced plans to publish its own list .
britain not only forbids certain airlines from flying to the country , it disallows planes or airlines from entire countries on the grounds that they do not implement security measures strictly enough .
these countries include the democratic republic of congo , equatorial guinea , liberia , sierra leone , swaziland and tajikistan .
the swiss civil aviation authority said it will publish its own list on thursday .
eu list slated for year e n d in publishing its list , france beat the european union to the punch .
the eu plans to have prepared a european-wide list of banned airlines by the end of 2005 .
candidates for the list are currently being discussed in the european parliament , but no fast date has been set for publication of the list .
bildunterschrift : the west caribbean airways plane that crashed in the mountains of western venezuela in august " we hope the list will be adopted very soon , late this year or early next year , " european commission spokesman rupert krietemeyer said recently at a briefing .
but while the eu 's 25 member states agreed in april to the idea of eventually publishing the names of banned airlines , they disagree on what criteria to use for drawing up such a list .
" we have to set common criteria at the european level , " said an official at the european commission .
airli n e i n dustry doubtful for its part , the aviation industry is skeptical about the effectiveness of blacklists .
such lists are usually based on already known security deficits or high accident rates .
therefore , it gives " the false impression that those who are not on the list are entirely safe , " according to lufthansa manager carsten spohr .
" even bad airlines have safe flights on most days . "
bildunterschrift : tunisian airline wreck in italy , in august .
on an international level , airlines are currently not obligated to publicize security problems that have come to light .
thus the french authorities did not know that in columbia - the home of west caribbean airways - had imposed a fine on the airline for severe safety violations .
i n formatio n shari n g i n europe in europe , the situation is different .
the european civil aviation conference -lrb- ecac -rrb- has begun a control and warning system for airlines .
" if a national aviation authority finds technical defects during a random control , that information goes into a data bank and the information then goes out to the other member countries , " said cornelia eichhorn , speaker for the german aviation authority .
then each nation can decide for itself whether to restrict that airline 's landing rights .
but the main problem in putting together blacklists is unlikely to be affected by european cooperation .
each individual airline 's safety can only be effectively tested by its own country .
in terms of the safety of foreign carriers , european officials need to rely on the individual country 's safety regulators and their own controls . sebastian ertinger -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu airlines blacklist easier said than done a series of airplane crashes has spurred european countries to ban airlines deemed unsafe , although drawing up an eu-wide list of trouble-plagued carriers - as the eu 's executive commission wants - is proving elusive .

26 , 2005 -rrb- eu air safety rules fall short although the european union has stepped up safety rules for the air transport sector in recent years , the bloc is still dogged by a lack of coordination and sometimes patchy application of existing regulations .

" what 's happened now is the team from brussels is returning to brussels to report back , " said michael jennings , an eu spokesman in beijing , adding that they had departed .
" the talks are still ongoing in beijing , the contact is still ongoing , the discussion is still ongoing , " he said . he said that while the entire delegation , headed by trade director fritz-harald wenig , was going back to europe , the dialogue was being carried on by the resident eu mission in beijing . " our delegation , the delegation of the european commission , is continuing the talks , " he said . jennings said he had no details on the results of the four-day negotiations but described them as " constructive . " ma n delso n claims imports could resume n ext mo n th eu trade commissioner peter mandelson on sunday outlined a possible make-shift deal , saying that the eu could resume imports of textiles from china next month , allowing blocked shipments into the 25 member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , left , and his chinese counterpart bo xilai " i shall make proposals tomorrow -lrb- monday -rrb- morning to begin proceedings to unblock all the goods that are currently held at customs , " mandelson said in a british television broadcast . some 75 million garments , including sweaters , trousers , blouses , t-shirts , bras and tons of flax yarn , are being blocked at customs in european ports .
they are barred from entering into the continent because they exceed an eu quota imposed in june to protect european manufacturers . chinese observers said they were optimistic since they were not facing a monolithic european bloc . " the two sides will probably reach a compromise , " said liu li , vice director of the china wto research institute , a think tank attached to the commerce ministry .
" currently , there are different voices among the eu countries , so the situation is good for china . " two solutio n s but ma n y stumbli n g blocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two main solutions appear to be on the table .
the first , favored by germany , the netherlands and the scandinavian countries , all traditionally free-traders , would consist of raising the permitted level of chinese textile imports . the second , more attractive to france , italy , poland and spain , would allow china to use some of its 2006 quota to export blocked garments into the eu this year . " personally , i think the two sides will reach a compromise which will allow china to use some of next year 's quota , and then come next year , the eu will give china extra quotas , " li said .
" both sides have a strong wish to reach a consensus . " chi n a a n d us prepari n g for talks one reason why china may be eager to wrap up the talks now is that it is getting ready to host yet another negotiating team , this time from the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us commerce secretary , donald evans is involved in the negotiations with china chinese and american delegates will begin a fourth round of textile talks tuesday , with the us pushing to limit chinese imports to protect its own industry . the talks , scheduled to last just two days , follow a meeting in san francisco this month at which negotiators failed to overcome " fundamental differences " on how to cap the exports . observers say europe and china are also eager to make the embarrassing textile dispute go away as soon as possible since beijing will host an eu-china summit attended by british prime minister tony blair next week . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-china textile import talks continue the european union and china held a second day of talks friday on a dispute over textile exports that has left millions of chinese-made clothes stuck in customs and off the shelves of stores in europe .

parents are invited to come to lectures for the first time , the college town of münster has invited mom and dad to come see how junior is getting on at school .
is the aim to bring parents and kids closer together ?
maybe .
but they also want to promote the town . a university student 's worst nightmare may be a dream come true for this quaint german city .
with an event they 're calling elternalarm !
-lrb- look out , parents ! -rrb- , münster has decided to tap one of its greatest assets - its 50,000-strong student population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : münster is germany 's cycling capital ' look out , parents ! ' is slated to take place the first weekend in november .
different from your typical visiting day , when students might check out a school they want to attend , the acidly named ' look out ! is a full-court press to win the hearts and minds of the students and their folks .
long-term tourists hotels will offer visiting parents student rates ; old folks can take part in programmed activities from lectures , to concerts , to city tours .
they can even join their offspring for a meal in the student canteen .
organizers hope that after the weekend , parents will think of münster as a tourist destination long after their child has graduated .
moreover , with tuition fees going into effect by 2007 , creating entire families of münster boosters simply makes sense .
" competition among universities is increasing ...
in the long term , we have to show them what we are doing with their money , " university of münster spokesman norbert frie told the kna news agency .
so far , only 150 parents have signed up to take part , which could be a sign that the kids are less than enthusiastic about having their folks spend a weekend poking into their stuff , their friends and their daily routines - not to mention killing any party plans they had .
mom and dad who ?
organizers say they expect more people to enlist after the semester begins in october , but it 's not hard to imagine that the low turnout could be the result of an age old phenomenon - teenagers wanting to put distance between themselves and their parents after they leave the nest .

the dangerously misguided campaign exposes the worst side of germany 's conservatives , says dw-world 's marc young . with a victory by germany 's conservative opposition looking fairly certain when voters go to the polls next month , i 've been trying to accentuate the positive . i 've never been convinced that angela merkel , the leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will be a more zealous reformer than chancellor gerhard schröder has been , but i still hold out hope that the conservatives might be able to shake germany out of its current economic funk . i would have no problem with loosening some of the country 's job protection measures or lowering non-wage labor costs in an attempt to slash unemployment , as the cdu has occasionally mooted .
and at this point , i 'm not sure whether schröder - even if he managed a surprise comeback win - would be able to convince his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to back more radical measures to get europe 's largest economy back on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but just as i start thinking i can overlook some of the uglier aspects of her party 's platform , merkel decides to step up her campaign against turkey 's attempt eventually to join the european union .
on friday , merkel sent a letter to conservative eu heads of state ahead of a sept .
1 summit .
in it she renewed her call for the eu to offer ankara a downgraded " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . she wants to raise the issue at the meeting of european conservatives which will take place just before an informal meeting on thursday of eu foreign ministers , where accession negotiations with turkey - expected to open membership negotiations on oct .
3 - will be discussed . anti-islamic ? besides having a nasty whiff of anti-islamic sentiment - which is as contemptible as it is misplaced - the timing of merkel 's initiative smacks of pandering to darker anti-foreigner sentiment simply in order to fish for votes . sadly , this is n't the first time we 've seen this " fortress germany " mentality from the christian democrats .
this is the same party that brought us the horrible leitkultur debate about how germany need some sort of guiding teutonic culture instead of the healthy multiculturalism seen in most western democracies .
it is the same vein of german conservatism that is opposed to immigration and refuses to comprehend that german citizenship should be a matter of where someone is born and not whether they have german blood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara , turkey on monday 16 february 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister on monday rejected outright a proposition from german opposition leader angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than outright membership .
the biggest irony , of course , is that merkel does n't seem to realize that the moderate islamic ak party of turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan is simply a muslim version of her christian democratic union - a conservative party with its moral compass rooted in religion . merkel and others opposed to turkey joining the eu contend the country is too large and too poor to become a part of the 25-member bloc , which is already overstretched after its enlargement including most of eastern europe last year . now , i 'll be the first to admit that the eu needs some time to consolidate its recent expansion .
however , the current challenges facing europe are no argument against turkish membership .
first of all , turkish accession is realistically at least 15 years off .
that 's a long time and the prospect of eventual membership would be a driving force in pushing along the country 's modernization . the west needs turkey in the age of osama bin laden and al qaeda , europe - and the rest of the world - need turkey as a prosperous , peaceful and democratic muslim nation .
so long as other islamic nations are either politically oppressed or outright hostile to western ideals , the worst thing the eu could do is push turkey away . it shocks me that merkel and others opposed to its bid do n't seem to realize the potential danger a jilted turkey could pose as reactionary and anti-reformist forces were strengthened .
does europe really want a hostile nation supporting an extreme form of islam at its doorstep ? clearly , turkey has a lot of work to do politically , economically and socially before it has a serious chance of joining europe 's elite club .
the country must continue to improve its human rights record and it needs to strengthen its protection of minority rights for its large kurdish population .
but engagement by the eu is the best guarantor that the country will continue down the path of reform . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election editorials : dw 's take all of dw-world 's election 2005 opinion pieces .
conservatives say no to turkey again in a letter to conservative eu heads of state ahead of a sept .
1 summit , chancellor candidate angela merkel has renewed her call for the eu to offer turkey a " privileged partnership " instead of full membership .
-lrb- aug .
26 , 2005 -rrb- turkey rejects new eu entry conditions turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has rejected a french call for his country to recognize cyprus in order to begin membership talks with the eu and asserted that ankara would not bow to new conditions .

the list was published by the french civil aviation authority , dgac , on its internet site monday .
most of the interdictions had already been made in 2004 ; the air koryo interdiction goes as far back as april 2001 .
' black mo n th ' of august the blacklist is france 's reaction to the " black month " of august , which to date has seen five bad airline accidents and more than 330 resultant deaths .
a week ago , a west caribean airways plane crashed in venezuela en route to the french caribbean island of martinique , causing 160 deaths of which 152 were french citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescue workers examine site of an airplane crash in niederanven , luxembourg , in 2002 .
so far , france is the third european country , after great britain and sweden , to publicize its own blacklist for airlines .
belgium has also announced plans to publish its own list .
britain not only forbids certain airlines from flying to the country , it disallows planes or airlines from entire countries on the grounds that they do not implement security measures strictly enough .
these countries include the democratic republic of congo , equatorial guinea , liberia , sierra leone , swaziland and tajikistan .
the swiss civil aviation authority said it will publish its own list on thursday .
eu list slated for year e n d in publishing its list , france beat the european union to the punch .
the eu plans to have prepared a european-wide list of banned airlines by the end of 2005 .
candidates for the list are currently being discussed in the european parliament , but no fast date has been set for publication of the list .
bildunterschrift : the west caribbean airways plane that crashed in the mountains of western venezuela in august " we hope the list will be adopted very soon , late this year or early next year , " european commission spokesman rupert krietemeyer said recently at a briefing .
but while the eu 's 25 member states agreed in april to the idea of eventually publishing the names of banned airlines , they disagree on what criteria to use for drawing up such a list .
" we have to set common criteria at the european level , " said an official at the european commission .
airli n e i n dustry doubtful for its part , the aviation industry is skeptical about the effectiveness of blacklists .
such lists are usually based on already known security deficits or high accident rates .
therefore , it gives " the false impression that those who are not on the list are entirely safe , " according to lufthansa manager carsten spohr .
" even bad airlines have safe flights on most days . "
bildunterschrift : tunisian airline wreck in italy , in august .
on an international level , airlines are currently not obligated to publicize security problems that have come to light .
thus the french authorities did not know that in columbia - the home of west caribbean airways - had imposed a fine on the airline for severe safety violations .
i n formatio n shari n g i n europe in europe , the situation is different .
the european civil aviation conference -lrb- ecac -rrb- has begun a control and warning system for airlines .
" if a national aviation authority finds technical defects during a random control , that information goes into a data bank and the information then goes out to the other member countries , " said cornelia eichhorn , speaker for the german aviation authority .
then each nation can decide for itself whether to restrict that airline 's landing rights .
but the main problem in putting together blacklists is unlikely to be affected by european cooperation .
each individual airline 's safety can only be effectively tested by its own country .
in terms of the safety of foreign carriers , european officials need to rely on the individual country 's safety regulators and their own controls . sebastian ertinger -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu airlines blacklist easier said than done a series of airplane crashes has spurred european countries to ban airlines deemed unsafe , although drawing up an eu-wide list of trouble-plagued carriers - as the eu 's executive commission wants - is proving elusive .

the dangerously misguided campaign exposes the worst side of germany 's conservatives , says dw-world 's marc young . with a victory by germany 's conservative opposition looking fairly certain when voters go to the polls next month , i 've been trying to accentuate the positive . i 've never been convinced that angela merkel , the leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will be a more zealous reformer than chancellor gerhard schröder has been , but i still hold out hope that the conservatives might be able to shake germany out of its current economic funk . i would have no problem with loosening some of the country 's job protection measures or lowering non-wage labor costs in an attempt to slash unemployment , as the cdu has occasionally mooted .
and at this point , i 'm not sure whether schröder - even if he managed a surprise comeback win - would be able to convince his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to back more radical measures to get europe 's largest economy back on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but just as i start thinking i can overlook some of the uglier aspects of her party 's platform , merkel decides to step up her campaign against turkey 's attempt eventually to join the european union .
on friday , merkel sent a letter to conservative eu heads of state ahead of a sept .
1 summit .
in it she renewed her call for the eu to offer ankara a downgraded " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . she wants to raise the issue at the meeting of european conservatives which will take place just before an informal meeting on thursday of eu foreign ministers , where accession negotiations with turkey - expected to open membership negotiations on oct .
3 - will be discussed . anti-islamic ? besides having a nasty whiff of anti-islamic sentiment - which is as contemptible as it is misplaced - the timing of merkel 's initiative smacks of pandering to darker anti-foreigner sentiment simply in order to fish for votes . sadly , this is n't the first time we 've seen this " fortress germany " mentality from the christian democrats .
this is the same party that brought us the horrible leitkultur debate about how germany need some sort of guiding teutonic culture instead of the healthy multiculturalism seen in most western democracies .
it is the same vein of german conservatism that is opposed to immigration and refuses to comprehend that german citizenship should be a matter of where someone is born and not whether they have german blood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara , turkey on monday 16 february 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister on monday rejected outright a proposition from german opposition leader angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than outright membership .
the biggest irony , of course , is that merkel does n't seem to realize that the moderate islamic ak party of turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan is simply a muslim version of her christian democratic union - a conservative party with its moral compass rooted in religion . merkel and others opposed to turkey joining the eu contend the country is too large and too poor to become a part of the 25-member bloc , which is already overstretched after its enlargement including most of eastern europe last year . now , i 'll be the first to admit that the eu needs some time to consolidate its recent expansion .
however , the current challenges facing europe are no argument against turkish membership .
first of all , turkish accession is realistically at least 15 years off .
that 's a long time and the prospect of eventual membership would be a driving force in pushing along the country 's modernization . the west needs turkey in the age of osama bin laden and al qaeda , europe - and the rest of the world - need turkey as a prosperous , peaceful and democratic muslim nation .
so long as other islamic nations are either politically oppressed or outright hostile to western ideals , the worst thing the eu could do is push turkey away . it shocks me that merkel and others opposed to its bid do n't seem to realize the potential danger a jilted turkey could pose as reactionary and anti-reformist forces were strengthened .
does europe really want a hostile nation supporting an extreme form of islam at its doorstep ? clearly , turkey has a lot of work to do politically , economically and socially before it has a serious chance of joining europe 's elite club .
the country must continue to improve its human rights record and it needs to strengthen its protection of minority rights for its large kurdish population .
but engagement by the eu is the best guarantor that the country will continue down the path of reform . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election editorials : dw 's take all of dw-world 's election 2005 opinion pieces .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : election editorials : dw 's take opinion : dissolving the doubt opinion : greens must learn to let go the german fear of reform opinion : germany left behind europe -pipe- 29.08.2005 opinion : merkel 's turkish delight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel wants to offer turkey a " privileged partnership " chancellor candidate angela merkel has renewed her efforts to kibosh turkey 's bid to join the eu .
the dangerously misguided campaign exposes the worst side of germany 's conservatives , says dw-world 's marc young . with a victory by germany 's conservative opposition looking fairly certain when voters go to the polls next month , i 've been trying to accentuate the positive . i 've never been convinced that angela merkel , the leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will be a more zealous reformer than chancellor gerhard schröder has been , but i still hold out hope that the conservatives might be able to shake germany out of its current economic funk . i would have no problem with loosening some of the country 's job protection measures or lowering non-wage labor costs in an attempt to slash unemployment , as the cdu has occasionally mooted .
and at this point , i 'm not sure whether schröder - even if he managed a surprise comeback win - would be able to convince his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to back more radical measures to get europe 's largest economy back on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but just as i start thinking i can overlook some of the uglier aspects of her party 's platform , merkel decides to step up her campaign against turkey 's attempt eventually to join the european union .
on friday , merkel sent a letter to conservative eu heads of state ahead of a sept .
1 summit .
in it she renewed her call for the eu to offer ankara a downgraded " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . she wants to raise the issue at the meeting of european conservatives which will take place just before an informal meeting on thursday of eu foreign ministers , where accession negotiations with turkey - expected to open membership negotiations on oct .
3 - will be discussed . anti-islamic ? besides having a nasty whiff of anti-islamic sentiment - which is as contemptible as it is misplaced - the timing of merkel 's initiative smacks of pandering to darker anti-foreigner sentiment simply in order to fish for votes . sadly , this is n't the first time we 've seen this " fortress germany " mentality from the christian democrats .
this is the same party that brought us the horrible leitkultur debate about how germany need some sort of guiding teutonic culture instead of the healthy multiculturalism seen in most western democracies .
it is the same vein of german conservatism that is opposed to immigration and refuses to comprehend that german citizenship should be a matter of where someone is born and not whether they have german blood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara , turkey on monday 16 february 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister on monday rejected outright a proposition from german opposition leader angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than outright membership .
the biggest irony , of course , is that merkel does n't seem to realize that the moderate islamic ak party of turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan is simply a muslim version of her christian democratic union - a conservative party with its moral compass rooted in religion . merkel and others opposed to turkey joining the eu contend the country is too large and too poor to become a part of the 25-member bloc , which is already overstretched after its enlargement including most of eastern europe last year . now , i 'll be the first to admit that the eu needs some time to consolidate its recent expansion .
however , the current challenges facing europe are no argument against turkish membership .
first of all , turkish accession is realistically at least 15 years off .
that 's a long time and the prospect of eventual membership would be a driving force in pushing along the country 's modernization . the west needs turkey in the age of osama bin laden and al qaeda , europe - and the rest of the world - need turkey as a prosperous , peaceful and democratic muslim nation .
so long as other islamic nations are either politically oppressed or outright hostile to western ideals , the worst thing the eu could do is push turkey away . it shocks me that merkel and others opposed to its bid do n't seem to realize the potential danger a jilted turkey could pose as reactionary and anti-reformist forces were strengthened .
does europe really want a hostile nation supporting an extreme form of islam at its doorstep ? clearly , turkey has a lot of work to do politically , economically and socially before it has a serious chance of joining europe 's elite club .
the country must continue to improve its human rights record and it needs to strengthen its protection of minority rights for its large kurdish population .
but engagement by the eu is the best guarantor that the country will continue down the path of reform . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election editorials : dw 's take all of dw-world 's election 2005 opinion pieces .
conservatives say no to turkey again in a letter to conservative eu heads of state ahead of a sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : election editorials : dw 's take opinion : dissolving the doubt opinion : greens must learn to let go the german fear of reform opinion : germany left behind europe -pipe- 29.08.2005 opinion : merkel 's turkish delight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel wants to offer turkey a " privileged partnership " chancellor candidate angela merkel has renewed her efforts to kibosh turkey 's bid to join the eu .
the dangerously misguided campaign exposes the worst side of germany 's conservatives , says dw-world 's marc young . with a victory by germany 's conservative opposition looking fairly certain when voters go to the polls next month , i 've been trying to accentuate the positive . i 've never been convinced that angela merkel , the leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will be a more zealous reformer than chancellor gerhard schröder has been , but i still hold out hope that the conservatives might be able to shake germany out of its current economic funk . i would have no problem with loosening some of the country 's job protection measures or lowering non-wage labor costs in an attempt to slash unemployment , as the cdu has occasionally mooted .
and at this point , i 'm not sure whether schröder - even if he managed a surprise comeback win - would be able to convince his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to back more radical measures to get europe 's largest economy back on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but just as i start thinking i can overlook some of the uglier aspects of her party 's platform , merkel decides to step up her campaign against turkey 's attempt eventually to join the european union .
on friday , merkel sent a letter to conservative eu heads of state ahead of a sept .
1 summit .
in it she renewed her call for the eu to offer ankara a downgraded " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . she wants to raise the issue at the meeting of european conservatives which will take place just before an informal meeting on thursday of eu foreign ministers , where accession negotiations with turkey - expected to open membership negotiations on oct .
3 - will be discussed . anti-islamic ? besides having a nasty whiff of anti-islamic sentiment - which is as contemptible as it is misplaced - the timing of merkel 's initiative smacks of pandering to darker anti-foreigner sentiment simply in order to fish for votes . sadly , this is n't the first time we 've seen this " fortress germany " mentality from the christian democrats .
this is the same party that brought us the horrible leitkultur debate about how germany need some sort of guiding teutonic culture instead of the healthy multiculturalism seen in most western democracies .
it is the same vein of german conservatism that is opposed to immigration and refuses to comprehend that german citizenship should be a matter of where someone is born and not whether they have german blood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara , turkey on monday 16 february 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister on monday rejected outright a proposition from german opposition leader angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than outright membership .
the biggest irony , of course , is that merkel does n't seem to realize that the moderate islamic ak party of turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan is simply a muslim version of her christian democratic union - a conservative party with its moral compass rooted in religion . merkel and others opposed to turkey joining the eu contend the country is too large and too poor to become a part of the 25-member bloc , which is already overstretched after its enlargement including most of eastern europe last year . now , i 'll be the first to admit that the eu needs some time to consolidate its recent expansion .
however , the current challenges facing europe are no argument against turkish membership .
first of all , turkish accession is realistically at least 15 years off .
that 's a long time and the prospect of eventual membership would be a driving force in pushing along the country 's modernization . the west needs turkey in the age of osama bin laden and al qaeda , europe - and the rest of the world - need turkey as a prosperous , peaceful and democratic muslim nation .
so long as other islamic nations are either politically oppressed or outright hostile to western ideals , the worst thing the eu could do is push turkey away . it shocks me that merkel and others opposed to its bid do n't seem to realize the potential danger a jilted turkey could pose as reactionary and anti-reformist forces were strengthened .
does europe really want a hostile nation supporting an extreme form of islam at its doorstep ? clearly , turkey has a lot of work to do politically , economically and socially before it has a serious chance of joining europe 's elite club .
the country must continue to improve its human rights record and it needs to strengthen its protection of minority rights for its large kurdish population .
but engagement by the eu is the best guarantor that the country will continue down the path of reform . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election editorials : dw 's take all of dw-world 's election 2005 opinion pieces .

the dangerously misguided campaign exposes the worst side of germany 's conservatives , says dw-world 's marc young . with a victory by germany 's conservative opposition looking fairly certain when voters go to the polls next month , i 've been trying to accentuate the positive . i 've never been convinced that angela merkel , the leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will be a more zealous reformer than chancellor gerhard schröder has been , but i still hold out hope that the conservatives might be able to shake germany out of its current economic funk . i would have no problem with loosening some of the country 's job protection measures or lowering non-wage labor costs in an attempt to slash unemployment , as the cdu has occasionally mooted .
and at this point , i 'm not sure whether schröder - even if he managed a surprise comeback win - would be able to convince his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to back more radical measures to get europe 's largest economy back on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but just as i start thinking i can overlook some of the uglier aspects of her party 's platform , merkel decides to step up her campaign against turkey 's attempt eventually to join the european union .
on friday , merkel sent a letter to conservative eu heads of state ahead of a sept .
1 summit .
in it she renewed her call for the eu to offer ankara a downgraded " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . she wants to raise the issue at the meeting of european conservatives which will take place just before an informal meeting on thursday of eu foreign ministers , where accession negotiations with turkey - expected to open membership negotiations on oct .

this is the same party that brought us the horrible leitkultur debate about how germany need some sort of guiding teutonic culture instead of the healthy multiculturalism seen in most western democracies .
it is the same vein of german conservatism that is opposed to immigration and refuses to comprehend that german citizenship should be a matter of where someone is born and not whether they have german blood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara , turkey on monday 16 february 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister on monday rejected outright a proposition from german opposition leader angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than outright membership .
the biggest irony , of course , is that merkel does n't seem to realize that the moderate islamic ak party of turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan is simply a muslim version of her christian democratic union - a conservative party with its moral compass rooted in religion . merkel and others opposed to turkey joining the eu contend the country is too large and too poor to become a part of the 25-member bloc , which is already overstretched after its enlargement including most of eastern europe last year . now , i 'll be the first to admit that the eu needs some time to consolidate its recent expansion .
however , the current challenges facing europe are no argument against turkish membership .
first of all , turkish accession is realistically at least 15 years off .
that 's a long time and the prospect of eventual membership would be a driving force in pushing along the country 's modernization . the west needs turkey in the age of osama bin laden and al qaeda , europe - and the rest of the world - need turkey as a prosperous , peaceful and democratic muslim nation .
so long as other islamic nations are either politically oppressed or outright hostile to western ideals , the worst thing the eu could do is push turkey away . it shocks me that merkel and others opposed to its bid do n't seem to realize the potential danger a jilted turkey could pose as reactionary and anti-reformist forces were strengthened .
does europe really want a hostile nation supporting an extreme form of islam at its doorstep ? clearly , turkey has a lot of work to do politically , economically and socially before it has a serious chance of joining europe 's elite club .
the country must continue to improve its human rights record and it needs to strengthen its protection of minority rights for its large kurdish population .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : election editorials : dw 's take opinion : dissolving the doubt opinion : greens must learn to let go the german fear of reform opinion : germany left behind europe -pipe- 29.08.2005 opinion : merkel 's turkish delight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel wants to offer turkey a " privileged partnership " chancellor candidate angela merkel has renewed her efforts to kibosh turkey 's bid to join the eu .
the dangerously misguided campaign exposes the worst side of germany 's conservatives , says dw-world 's marc young . with a victory by germany 's conservative opposition looking fairly certain when voters go to the polls next month , i 've been trying to accentuate the positive . i 've never been convinced that angela merkel , the leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will be a more zealous reformer than chancellor gerhard schröder has been , but i still hold out hope that the conservatives might be able to shake germany out of its current economic funk . i would have no problem with loosening some of the country 's job protection measures or lowering non-wage labor costs in an attempt to slash unemployment , as the cdu has occasionally mooted .
and at this point , i 'm not sure whether schröder - even if he managed a surprise comeback win - would be able to convince his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to back more radical measures to get europe 's largest economy back on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but just as i start thinking i can overlook some of the uglier aspects of her party 's platform , merkel decides to step up her campaign against turkey 's attempt eventually to join the european union .
on friday , merkel sent a letter to conservative eu heads of state ahead of a sept .
1 summit .
in it she renewed her call for the eu to offer ankara a downgraded " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . she wants to raise the issue at the meeting of european conservatives which will take place just before an informal meeting on thursday of eu foreign ministers , where accession negotiations with turkey - expected to open membership negotiations on oct .
3 - will be discussed . anti-islamic ? besides having a nasty whiff of anti-islamic sentiment - which is as contemptible as it is misplaced - the timing of merkel 's initiative smacks of pandering to darker anti-foreigner sentiment simply in order to fish for votes . sadly , this is n't the first time we 've seen this " fortress germany " mentality from the christian democrats .
this is the same party that brought us the horrible leitkultur debate about how germany need some sort of guiding teutonic culture instead of the healthy multiculturalism seen in most western democracies .
it is the same vein of german conservatism that is opposed to immigration and refuses to comprehend that german citizenship should be a matter of where someone is born and not whether they have german blood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara , turkey on monday 16 february 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister on monday rejected outright a proposition from german opposition leader angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than outright membership .
the biggest irony , of course , is that merkel does n't seem to realize that the moderate islamic ak party of turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan is simply a muslim version of her christian democratic union - a conservative party with its moral compass rooted in religion . merkel and others opposed to turkey joining the eu contend the country is too large and too poor to become a part of the 25-member bloc , which is already overstretched after its enlargement including most of eastern europe last year . now , i 'll be the first to admit that the eu needs some time to consolidate its recent expansion .
however , the current challenges facing europe are no argument against turkish membership .
first of all , turkish accession is realistically at least 15 years off .
that 's a long time and the prospect of eventual membership would be a driving force in pushing along the country 's modernization . the west needs turkey in the age of osama bin laden and al qaeda , europe - and the rest of the world - need turkey as a prosperous , peaceful and democratic muslim nation .
so long as other islamic nations are either politically oppressed or outright hostile to western ideals , the worst thing the eu could do is push turkey away . it shocks me that merkel and others opposed to its bid do n't seem to realize the potential danger a jilted turkey could pose as reactionary and anti-reformist forces were strengthened .
does europe really want a hostile nation supporting an extreme form of islam at its doorstep ? clearly , turkey has a lot of work to do politically , economically and socially before it has a serious chance of joining europe 's elite club .
the country must continue to improve its human rights record and it needs to strengthen its protection of minority rights for its large kurdish population .
but engagement by the eu is the best guarantor that the country will continue down the path of reform . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election editorials : dw 's take all of dw-world 's election 2005 opinion pieces .

-lrb- look out , parents ! -rrb- , münster has decided to tap one of its greatest assets - its 50,000-strong student population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : münster is germany 's cycling capital ' look out , parents ! ' is slated to take place the first weekend in november .
different from your typical visiting day , when students might check out a school they want to attend , the acidly named ' look out ! is a full-court press to win the hearts and minds of the students and their folks .
long-term tourists hotels will offer visiting parents student rates ; old folks can take part in programmed activities from lectures , to concerts , to city tours .
they can even join their offspring for a meal in the student canteen .
organizers hope that after the weekend , parents will think of münster as a tourist destination long after their child has graduated .
moreover , with tuition fees going into effect by 2007 , creating entire families of münster boosters simply makes sense .
" competition among universities is increasing ...
in the long term , we have to show them what we are doing with their money , " university of münster spokesman norbert frie told the kna news agency .
so far , only 150 parents have signed up to take part , which could be a sign that the kids are less than enthusiastic about having their folks spend a weekend poking into their stuff , their friends and their daily routines - not to mention killing any party plans they had .
mom and dad who ?
organizers say they expect more people to enlist after the semester begins in october , but it 's not hard to imagine that the low turnout could be the result of an age old phenomenon - teenagers wanting to put distance between themselves and their parents after they leave the nest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : münster 's aasee will be the site of a goodbye brunch " people are certainly divided over it , " said fries .

the dangerously misguided campaign exposes the worst side of germany 's conservatives , says dw-world 's marc young . with a victory by germany 's conservative opposition looking fairly certain when voters go to the polls next month , i 've been trying to accentuate the positive . i 've never been convinced that angela merkel , the leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will be a more zealous reformer than chancellor gerhard schröder has been , but i still hold out hope that the conservatives might be able to shake germany out of its current economic funk . i would have no problem with loosening some of the country 's job protection measures or lowering non-wage labor costs in an attempt to slash unemployment , as the cdu has occasionally mooted .
and at this point , i 'm not sure whether schröder - even if he managed a surprise comeback win - would be able to convince his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to back more radical measures to get europe 's largest economy back on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but just as i start thinking i can overlook some of the uglier aspects of her party 's platform , merkel decides to step up her campaign against turkey 's attempt eventually to join the european union .
on friday , merkel sent a letter to conservative eu heads of state ahead of a sept .
1 summit .
in it she renewed her call for the eu to offer ankara a downgraded " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . she wants to raise the issue at the meeting of european conservatives which will take place just before an informal meeting on thursday of eu foreign ministers , where accession negotiations with turkey - expected to open membership negotiations on oct .
3 - will be discussed . anti-islamic ? besides having a nasty whiff of anti-islamic sentiment - which is as contemptible as it is misplaced - the timing of merkel 's initiative smacks of pandering to darker anti-foreigner sentiment simply in order to fish for votes . sadly , this is n't the first time we 've seen this " fortress germany " mentality from the christian democrats .
this is the same party that brought us the horrible leitkultur debate about how germany need some sort of guiding teutonic culture instead of the healthy multiculturalism seen in most western democracies .
it is the same vein of german conservatism that is opposed to immigration and refuses to comprehend that german citizenship should be a matter of where someone is born and not whether they have german blood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara , turkey on monday 16 february 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister on monday rejected outright a proposition from german opposition leader angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than outright membership .
the biggest irony , of course , is that merkel does n't seem to realize that the moderate islamic ak party of turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan is simply a muslim version of her christian democratic union - a conservative party with its moral compass rooted in religion . merkel and others opposed to turkey joining the eu contend the country is too large and too poor to become a part of the 25-member bloc , which is already overstretched after its enlargement including most of eastern europe last year . now , i 'll be the first to admit that the eu needs some time to consolidate its recent expansion .
however , the current challenges facing europe are no argument against turkish membership .
first of all , turkish accession is realistically at least 15 years off .
that 's a long time and the prospect of eventual membership would be a driving force in pushing along the country 's modernization . the west needs turkey in the age of osama bin laden and al qaeda , europe - and the rest of the world - need turkey as a prosperous , peaceful and democratic muslim nation .
so long as other islamic nations are either politically oppressed or outright hostile to western ideals , the worst thing the eu could do is push turkey away . it shocks me that merkel and others opposed to its bid do n't seem to realize the potential danger a jilted turkey could pose as reactionary and anti-reformist forces were strengthened .
does europe really want a hostile nation supporting an extreme form of islam at its doorstep ? clearly , turkey has a lot of work to do politically , economically and socially before it has a serious chance of joining europe 's elite club .
the country must continue to improve its human rights record and it needs to strengthen its protection of minority rights for its large kurdish population .
but engagement by the eu is the best guarantor that the country will continue down the path of reform . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election editorials : dw 's take all of dw-world 's election 2005 opinion pieces .

and at this point , i 'm not sure whether schröder - even if he managed a surprise comeback win - would be able to convince his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to back more radical measures to get europe 's largest economy back on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but just as i start thinking i can overlook some of the uglier aspects of her party 's platform , merkel decides to step up her campaign against turkey 's attempt eventually to join the european union .
on friday , merkel sent a letter to conservative eu heads of state ahead of a sept .
1 summit .
in it she renewed her call for the eu to offer ankara a downgraded " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . she wants to raise the issue at the meeting of european conservatives which will take place just before an informal meeting on thursday of eu foreign ministers , where accession negotiations with turkey - expected to open membership negotiations on oct .
3 - will be discussed . anti-islamic ? besides having a nasty whiff of anti-islamic sentiment - which is as contemptible as it is misplaced - the timing of merkel 's initiative smacks of pandering to darker anti-foreigner sentiment simply in order to fish for votes . sadly , this is n't the first time we 've seen this " fortress germany " mentality from the christian democrats .
this is the same party that brought us the horrible leitkultur debate about how germany need some sort of guiding teutonic culture instead of the healthy multiculturalism seen in most western democracies .
it is the same vein of german conservatism that is opposed to immigration and refuses to comprehend that german citizenship should be a matter of where someone is born and not whether they have german blood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara , turkey on monday 16 february 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister on monday rejected outright a proposition from german opposition leader angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than outright membership .
the biggest irony , of course , is that merkel does n't seem to realize that the moderate islamic ak party of turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan is simply a muslim version of her christian democratic union - a conservative party with its moral compass rooted in religion . merkel and others opposed to turkey joining the eu contend the country is too large and too poor to become a part of the 25-member bloc , which is already overstretched after its enlargement including most of eastern europe last year . now , i 'll be the first to admit that the eu needs some time to consolidate its recent expansion .
however , the current challenges facing europe are no argument against turkish membership .
first of all , turkish accession is realistically at least 15 years off .
that 's a long time and the prospect of eventual membership would be a driving force in pushing along the country 's modernization . the west needs turkey in the age of osama bin laden and al qaeda , europe - and the rest of the world - need turkey as a prosperous , peaceful and democratic muslim nation .
so long as other islamic nations are either politically oppressed or outright hostile to western ideals , the worst thing the eu could do is push turkey away . it shocks me that merkel and others opposed to its bid do n't seem to realize the potential danger a jilted turkey could pose as reactionary and anti-reformist forces were strengthened .
does europe really want a hostile nation supporting an extreme form of islam at its doorstep ? clearly , turkey has a lot of work to do politically , economically and socially before it has a serious chance of joining europe 's elite club .
the country must continue to improve its human rights record and it needs to strengthen its protection of minority rights for its large kurdish population .

turkey 's prime minister on monday rejected outright a proposition from german opposition leader angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than outright membership .
the biggest irony , of course , is that merkel does n't seem to realize that the moderate islamic ak party of turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan is simply a muslim version of her christian democratic union - a conservative party with its moral compass rooted in religion . merkel and others opposed to turkey joining the eu contend the country is too large and too poor to become a part of the 25-member bloc , which is already overstretched after its enlargement including most of eastern europe last year . now , i 'll be the first to admit that the eu needs some time to consolidate its recent expansion .

so long as other islamic nations are either politically oppressed or outright hostile to western ideals , the worst thing the eu could do is push turkey away . it shocks me that merkel and others opposed to its bid do n't seem to realize the potential danger a jilted turkey could pose as reactionary and anti-reformist forces were strengthened .

the dangerously misguided campaign exposes the worst side of germany 's conservatives , says dw-world 's marc young . with a victory by germany 's conservative opposition looking fairly certain when voters go to the polls next month , i 've been trying to accentuate the positive . i 've never been convinced that angela merkel , the leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will be a more zealous reformer than chancellor gerhard schröder has been , but i still hold out hope that the conservatives might be able to shake germany out of its current economic funk . i would have no problem with loosening some of the country 's job protection measures or lowering non-wage labor costs in an attempt to slash unemployment , as the cdu has occasionally mooted .
and at this point , i 'm not sure whether schröder - even if he managed a surprise comeback win - would be able to convince his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to back more radical measures to get europe 's largest economy back on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but just as i start thinking i can overlook some of the uglier aspects of her party 's platform , merkel decides to step up her campaign against turkey 's attempt eventually to join the european union .

on monday , the storm caused oil prices to surge to record highs .
stock exchanges stumbled and insurers buckled as anxiety grew . katrina pounded vulnerable , low-lying new orleans with howling winds on monday , damaging the roof of the superdome stadium where thousands of poor and homeless residents had sought refuge .
the storm knocked out power , flooded streets and threatened to spread destruction along a wide swathe of the us gulf coast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people seek shelter in a doorway in the french quarter of new orleans the large and extremely dangerous hurricane has claimed the lives of at least ten people so far and sent crude oil prices soaring following the evacuation of offshore rigs in the oil-rich gulf of mexico and the closure of refineries in louisiana . packing winds of 240 kilometers -lrb- 150 miles -rrb- per hour , the storm made landfall on a louisiana barrier island early monday before losing strength as it hit the mainland east of new orleans , sparing the city a direct hit . three elderly people died , apparently from dehydration , as they were being evacuated from a nursing home in new orleans on sunday , police said .
katrina claimed seven lives as it slammed florida last week . us president george w. bush declared a state of emergency that clears the way for federal aid to affected areas .
" we can not stress enough the dangers this hurricane poses to gulf coast communities , " bush said from his texas ranch on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush administration said it was ready to tap into its strategic oil reserves to keep supplies flowing . up to 40 percent of crude production along a wide swathe of the us coast from texas in the west to florida in the east was said by experts to be affected . " we probably deal with almost a third of the nation 's domestic oil that is produced , and that will most likely be shut down , " new orleans mayor ray nagin told cnn .
" that could have a significant impact on oil prices going forward , " he said . europe jittery even as experts were estimating that hurricane katrina may be the most expensive ever to hit the united states , european stock exchanges and insurers in capitals as far away as frankfurt and paris were counting their losses monday as the hurricane spent its fury . battered by surging oil prices , european stock exchanges faltered in early trading monday , with the cac 40 in paris opening lower for the sixth straight day . the cac was down 0.33 percent at 4,328.53 in early deals while in frankfurt the dax fell 0.42 percent to 4,763.61 .

" it 's all about oil today , " a brussels trader told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil prices shot up to fresh records after breaking through the 70-dollar-per-barrel threshold in asian trading monday . with the psychological barrier now breached , some analysts said prices could aim for the once unthinkable $ 80 a barrel - a level economists fear could severely dent consumer demand and curb business activities . germany worried german economy minister wolfgang clement reiterated concern monday about the negative economic effects of the latest surge in oil prices .
germany has been battling record high gasoline prices in recent weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " i view with great concern the rise in crude oil prices , " clement said in berlin .
at the weekend , clement had said in a newspaper interview that " the strong rise in oil and energy prices ... endangers growth , which was just getting back on track . " in an interview broadcast monday on the television news channel n-tv , the minister described the latest rise in oil prices as " completely exaggerated and way above the market situation . " it was not demand that was driving the price of oil , clement insisted .
" a lot of this is speculation .
there 's a lot of uncertainty .
we must do everything to restore some calm and that means , above all , transparency . " germany would do what it could at a european level , clement continued .
" but it 's a global problem , a global market problem .
the g8 -lrb- group of eight -rrb- , the big countries must work together with the oil-producing countries to calm the markets , " he said . in addition to shares in companies such as france 's engineering giant alstom and germany 's lufthansa flagship carrier tumbling on monday , insurers were among the worst hit on fears of huge claims from the hurricane damage .

the list was published by the french civil aviation authority , dgac , on its internet site monday .
most of the interdictions had already been made in 2004 ; the air koryo interdiction goes as far back as april 2001 .
' black mo n th ' of august the blacklist is france 's reaction to the " black month " of august , which to date has seen five bad airline accidents and more than 330 resultant deaths .
a week ago , a west caribean airways plane crashed in venezuela en route to the french caribbean island of martinique , causing 160 deaths of which 152 were french citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescue workers examine site of an airplane crash in niederanven , luxembourg , in 2002 .
so far , france is the third european country , after great britain and sweden , to publicize its own blacklist for airlines .
belgium has also announced plans to publish its own list .
britain not only forbids certain airlines from flying to the country , it disallows planes or airlines from entire countries on the grounds that they do not implement security measures strictly enough .
these countries include the democratic republic of congo , equatorial guinea , liberia , sierra leone , swaziland and tajikistan .
the swiss civil aviation authority said it will publish its own list on thursday .
eu list slated for year e n d in publishing its list , france beat the european union to the punch .
the eu plans to have prepared a european-wide list of banned airlines by the end of 2005 .
candidates for the list are currently being discussed in the european parliament , but no fast date has been set for publication of the list .
bildunterschrift : the west caribbean airways plane that crashed in the mountains of western venezuela in august " we hope the list will be adopted very soon , late this year or early next year , " european commission spokesman rupert krietemeyer said recently at a briefing .
but while the eu 's 25 member states agreed in april to the idea of eventually publishing the names of banned airlines , they disagree on what criteria to use for drawing up such a list .
" we have to set common criteria at the european level , " said an official at the european commission .
airli n e i n dustry doubtful for its part , the aviation industry is skeptical about the effectiveness of blacklists .
such lists are usually based on already known security deficits or high accident rates .
therefore , it gives " the false impression that those who are not on the list are entirely safe , " according to lufthansa manager carsten spohr .
" even bad airlines have safe flights on most days . "
bildunterschrift : tunisian airline wreck in italy , in august .
on an international level , airlines are currently not obligated to publicize security problems that have come to light .
thus the french authorities did not know that in columbia - the home of west caribbean airways - had imposed a fine on the airline for severe safety violations .
i n formatio n shari n g i n europe in europe , the situation is different .
the european civil aviation conference -lrb- ecac -rrb- has begun a control and warning system for airlines .
" if a national aviation authority finds technical defects during a random control , that information goes into a data bank and the information then goes out to the other member countries , " said cornelia eichhorn , speaker for the german aviation authority .
then each nation can decide for itself whether to restrict that airline 's landing rights .
but the main problem in putting together blacklists is unlikely to be affected by european cooperation .
each individual airline 's safety can only be effectively tested by its own country .
in terms of the safety of foreign carriers , european officials need to rely on the individual country 's safety regulators and their own controls . sebastian ertinger -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu airlines blacklist easier said than done a series of airplane crashes has spurred european countries to ban airlines deemed unsafe , although drawing up an eu-wide list of trouble-plagued carriers - as the eu 's executive commission wants - is proving elusive .

on monday , the storm caused oil prices to surge to record highs .
stock exchanges stumbled and insurers buckled as anxiety grew . katrina pounded vulnerable , low-lying new orleans with howling winds on monday , damaging the roof of the superdome stadium where thousands of poor and homeless residents had sought refuge .
the storm knocked out power , flooded streets and threatened to spread destruction along a wide swathe of the us gulf coast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people seek shelter in a doorway in the french quarter of new orleans the large and extremely dangerous hurricane has claimed the lives of at least ten people so far and sent crude oil prices soaring following the evacuation of offshore rigs in the oil-rich gulf of mexico and the closure of refineries in louisiana . packing winds of 240 kilometers -lrb- 150 miles -rrb- per hour , the storm made landfall on a louisiana barrier island early monday before losing strength as it hit the mainland east of new orleans , sparing the city a direct hit . three elderly people died , apparently from dehydration , as they were being evacuated from a nursing home in new orleans on sunday , police said .
katrina claimed seven lives as it slammed florida last week . us president george w. bush declared a state of emergency that clears the way for federal aid to affected areas .
" we can not stress enough the dangers this hurricane poses to gulf coast communities , " bush said from his texas ranch on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush administration said it was ready to tap into its strategic oil reserves to keep supplies flowing . up to 40 percent of crude production along a wide swathe of the us coast from texas in the west to florida in the east was said by experts to be affected . " we probably deal with almost a third of the nation 's domestic oil that is produced , and that will most likely be shut down , " new orleans mayor ray nagin told cnn .
" that could have a significant impact on oil prices going forward , " he said . europe jittery even as experts were estimating that hurricane katrina may be the most expensive ever to hit the united states , european stock exchanges and insurers in capitals as far away as frankfurt and paris were counting their losses monday as the hurricane spent its fury . battered by surging oil prices , european stock exchanges faltered in early trading monday , with the cac 40 in paris opening lower for the sixth straight day . the cac was down 0.33 percent at 4,328.53 in early deals while in frankfurt the dax fell 0.42 percent to 4,763.61 .

" a lot of this is speculation .

" what 's happened now is the team from brussels is returning to brussels to report back , " said michael jennings , an eu spokesman in beijing , adding that they had departed .
" the talks are still ongoing in beijing , the contact is still ongoing , the discussion is still ongoing , " he said . he said that while the entire delegation , headed by trade director fritz-harald wenig , was going back to europe , the dialogue was being carried on by the resident eu mission in beijing . " our delegation , the delegation of the european commission , is continuing the talks , " he said . jennings said he had no details on the results of the four-day negotiations but described them as " constructive . " ma n delso n claims imports could resume n ext mo n th eu trade commissioner peter mandelson on sunday outlined a possible make-shift deal , saying that the eu could resume imports of textiles from china next month , allowing blocked shipments into the 25 member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , left , and his chinese counterpart bo xilai " i shall make proposals tomorrow -lrb- monday -rrb- morning to begin proceedings to unblock all the goods that are currently held at customs , " mandelson said in a british television broadcast . some 75 million garments , including sweaters , trousers , blouses , t-shirts , bras and tons of flax yarn , are being blocked at customs in european ports .
they are barred from entering into the continent because they exceed an eu quota imposed in june to protect european manufacturers . chinese observers said they were optimistic since they were not facing a monolithic european bloc . " the two sides will probably reach a compromise , " said liu li , vice director of the china wto research institute , a think tank attached to the commerce ministry .
" currently , there are different voices among the eu countries , so the situation is good for china . " two solutio n s but ma n y stumbli n g blocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two main solutions appear to be on the table .
the first , favored by germany , the netherlands and the scandinavian countries , all traditionally free-traders , would consist of raising the permitted level of chinese textile imports . the second , more attractive to france , italy , poland and spain , would allow china to use some of its 2006 quota to export blocked garments into the eu this year . " personally , i think the two sides will reach a compromise which will allow china to use some of next year 's quota , and then come next year , the eu will give china extra quotas , " li said .
" both sides have a strong wish to reach a consensus . " chi n a a n d us prepari n g for talks one reason why china may be eager to wrap up the talks now is that it is getting ready to host yet another negotiating team , this time from the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us commerce secretary , donald evans is involved in the negotiations with china chinese and american delegates will begin a fourth round of textile talks tuesday , with the us pushing to limit chinese imports to protect its own industry . the talks , scheduled to last just two days , follow a meeting in san francisco this month at which negotiators failed to overcome " fundamental differences " on how to cap the exports . observers say europe and china are also eager to make the embarrassing textile dispute go away as soon as possible since beijing will host an eu-china summit attended by british prime minister tony blair next week . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-china textile import talks continue the european union and china held a second day of talks friday on a dispute over textile exports that has left millions of chinese-made clothes stuck in customs and off the shelves of stores in europe .

" what 's happened now is the team from brussels is returning to brussels to report back , " said michael jennings , an eu spokesman in beijing , adding that they had departed .
" the talks are still ongoing in beijing , the contact is still ongoing , the discussion is still ongoing , " he said . he said that while the entire delegation , headed by trade director fritz-harald wenig , was going back to europe , the dialogue was being carried on by the resident eu mission in beijing . " our delegation , the delegation of the european commission , is continuing the talks , " he said . jennings said he had no details on the results of the four-day negotiations but described them as " constructive . " ma n delso n claims imports could resume n ext mo n th eu trade commissioner peter mandelson on sunday outlined a possible make-shift deal , saying that the eu could resume imports of textiles from china next month , allowing blocked shipments into the 25 member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , left , and his chinese counterpart bo xilai " i shall make proposals tomorrow -lrb- monday -rrb- morning to begin proceedings to unblock all the goods that are currently held at customs , " mandelson said in a british television broadcast . some 75 million garments , including sweaters , trousers , blouses , t-shirts , bras and tons of flax yarn , are being blocked at customs in european ports .
they are barred from entering into the continent because they exceed an eu quota imposed in june to protect european manufacturers . chinese observers said they were optimistic since they were not facing a monolithic european bloc . " the two sides will probably reach a compromise , " said liu li , vice director of the china wto research institute , a think tank attached to the commerce ministry .
" currently , there are different voices among the eu countries , so the situation is good for china . " two solutio n s but ma n y stumbli n g blocks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two main solutions appear to be on the table .
the first , favored by germany , the netherlands and the scandinavian countries , all traditionally free-traders , would consist of raising the permitted level of chinese textile imports . the second , more attractive to france , italy , poland and spain , would allow china to use some of its 2006 quota to export blocked garments into the eu this year . " personally , i think the two sides will reach a compromise which will allow china to use some of next year 's quota , and then come next year , the eu will give china extra quotas , " li said .
" both sides have a strong wish to reach a consensus . " chi n a a n d us prepari n g for talks one reason why china may be eager to wrap up the talks now is that it is getting ready to host yet another negotiating team , this time from the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us commerce secretary , donald evans is involved in the negotiations with china chinese and american delegates will begin a fourth round of textile talks tuesday , with the us pushing to limit chinese imports to protect its own industry . the talks , scheduled to last just two days , follow a meeting in san francisco this month at which negotiators failed to overcome " fundamental differences " on how to cap the exports . observers say europe and china are also eager to make the embarrassing textile dispute go away as soon as possible since beijing will host an eu-china summit attended by british prime minister tony blair next week . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-china textile import talks continue the european union and china held a second day of talks friday on a dispute over textile exports that has left millions of chinese-made clothes stuck in customs and off the shelves of stores in europe .

the list was published by the french civil aviation authority , dgac , on its internet site monday .
most of the interdictions had already been made in 2004 ; the air koryo interdiction goes as far back as april 2001 .

so far , france is the third european country , after great britain and sweden , to publicize its own blacklist for airlines .
belgium has also announced plans to publish its own list .
britain not only forbids certain airlines from flying to the country , it disallows planes or airlines from entire countries on the grounds that they do not implement security measures strictly enough .

the eu plans to have prepared a european-wide list of banned airlines by the end of 2005 .
candidates for the list are currently being discussed in the european parliament , but no fast date has been set for publication of the list .
bildunterschrift : the west caribbean airways plane that crashed in the mountains of western venezuela in august " we hope the list will be adopted very soon , late this year or early next year , " european commission spokesman rupert krietemeyer said recently at a briefing .
but while the eu 's 25 member states agreed in april to the idea of eventually publishing the names of banned airlines , they disagree on what criteria to use for drawing up such a list .

then each nation can decide for itself whether to restrict that airline 's landing rights .
but the main problem in putting together blacklists is unlikely to be affected by european cooperation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.08.2005 stash the beer , the parents are coming ! großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : so where will they sit ?
parents are invited to come to lectures for the first time , the college town of münster has invited mom and dad to come see how junior is getting on at school .
is the aim to bring parents and kids closer together ?
maybe .
but they also want to promote the town . a university student 's worst nightmare may be a dream come true for this quaint german city .
with an event they 're calling elternalarm !
-lrb- look out , parents ! -rrb- , münster has decided to tap one of its greatest assets - its 50,000-strong student population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : münster is germany 's cycling capital ' look out , parents ! ' is slated to take place the first weekend in november .
different from your typical visiting day , when students might check out a school they want to attend , the acidly named ' look out ! is a full-court press to win the hearts and minds of the students and their folks .
long-term tourists hotels will offer visiting parents student rates ; old folks can take part in programmed activities from lectures , to concerts , to city tours .
they can even join their offspring for a meal in the student canteen .
organizers hope that after the weekend , parents will think of münster as a tourist destination long after their child has graduated .
moreover , with tuition fees going into effect by 2007 , creating entire families of münster boosters simply makes sense .
" competition among universities is increasing ...
in the long term , we have to show them what we are doing with their money , " university of münster spokesman norbert frie told the kna news agency .
so far , only 150 parents have signed up to take part , which could be a sign that the kids are less than enthusiastic about having their folks spend a weekend poking into their stuff , their friends and their daily routines - not to mention killing any party plans they had .

parents are invited to come to lectures for the first time , the college town of münster has invited mom and dad to come see how junior is getting on at school .
is the aim to bring parents and kids closer together ?
maybe .
but they also want to promote the town . a university student 's worst nightmare may be a dream come true for this quaint german city .
with an event they 're calling elternalarm !
-lrb- look out , parents ! -rrb- , münster has decided to tap one of its greatest assets - its 50,000-strong student population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : münster is germany 's cycling capital ' look out , parents ! ' is slated to take place the first weekend in november .
different from your typical visiting day , when students might check out a school they want to attend , the acidly named ' look out ! is a full-court press to win the hearts and minds of the students and their folks .
long-term tourists hotels will offer visiting parents student rates ; old folks can take part in programmed activities from lectures , to concerts , to city tours .
they can even join their offspring for a meal in the student canteen .
organizers hope that after the weekend , parents will think of münster as a tourist destination long after their child has graduated .
moreover , with tuition fees going into effect by 2007 , creating entire families of münster boosters simply makes sense .
" competition among universities is increasing ...
in the long term , we have to show them what we are doing with their money , " university of münster spokesman norbert frie told the kna news agency .
so far , only 150 parents have signed up to take part , which could be a sign that the kids are less than enthusiastic about having their folks spend a weekend poking into their stuff , their friends and their daily routines - not to mention killing any party plans they had .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : election editorials : dw 's take opinion : dissolving the doubt opinion : greens must learn to let go the german fear of reform opinion : germany left behind europe -pipe- 29.08.2005 opinion : merkel 's turkish delight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel wants to offer turkey a " privileged partnership " chancellor candidate angela merkel has renewed her efforts to kibosh turkey 's bid to join the eu .
the dangerously misguided campaign exposes the worst side of germany 's conservatives , says dw-world 's marc young . with a victory by germany 's conservative opposition looking fairly certain when voters go to the polls next month , i 've been trying to accentuate the positive . i 've never been convinced that angela merkel , the leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will be a more zealous reformer than chancellor gerhard schröder has been , but i still hold out hope that the conservatives might be able to shake germany out of its current economic funk . i would have no problem with loosening some of the country 's job protection measures or lowering non-wage labor costs in an attempt to slash unemployment , as the cdu has occasionally mooted .
and at this point , i 'm not sure whether schröder - even if he managed a surprise comeback win - would be able to convince his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to back more radical measures to get europe 's largest economy back on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but just as i start thinking i can overlook some of the uglier aspects of her party 's platform , merkel decides to step up her campaign against turkey 's attempt eventually to join the european union .
on friday , merkel sent a letter to conservative eu heads of state ahead of a sept .
1 summit .
in it she renewed her call for the eu to offer ankara a downgraded " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . she wants to raise the issue at the meeting of european conservatives which will take place just before an informal meeting on thursday of eu foreign ministers , where accession negotiations with turkey - expected to open membership negotiations on oct .
3 - will be discussed . anti-islamic ? besides having a nasty whiff of anti-islamic sentiment - which is as contemptible as it is misplaced - the timing of merkel 's initiative smacks of pandering to darker anti-foreigner sentiment simply in order to fish for votes . sadly , this is n't the first time we 've seen this " fortress germany " mentality from the christian democrats .
this is the same party that brought us the horrible leitkultur debate about how germany need some sort of guiding teutonic culture instead of the healthy multiculturalism seen in most western democracies .
it is the same vein of german conservatism that is opposed to immigration and refuses to comprehend that german citizenship should be a matter of where someone is born and not whether they have german blood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara , turkey on monday 16 february 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister on monday rejected outright a proposition from german opposition leader angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than outright membership .
the biggest irony , of course , is that merkel does n't seem to realize that the moderate islamic ak party of turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan is simply a muslim version of her christian democratic union - a conservative party with its moral compass rooted in religion . merkel and others opposed to turkey joining the eu contend the country is too large and too poor to become a part of the 25-member bloc , which is already overstretched after its enlargement including most of eastern europe last year . now , i 'll be the first to admit that the eu needs some time to consolidate its recent expansion .
however , the current challenges facing europe are no argument against turkish membership .
first of all , turkish accession is realistically at least 15 years off .
that 's a long time and the prospect of eventual membership would be a driving force in pushing along the country 's modernization . the west needs turkey in the age of osama bin laden and al qaeda , europe - and the rest of the world - need turkey as a prosperous , peaceful and democratic muslim nation .
so long as other islamic nations are either politically oppressed or outright hostile to western ideals , the worst thing the eu could do is push turkey away . it shocks me that merkel and others opposed to its bid do n't seem to realize the potential danger a jilted turkey could pose as reactionary and anti-reformist forces were strengthened .
does europe really want a hostile nation supporting an extreme form of islam at its doorstep ? clearly , turkey has a lot of work to do politically , economically and socially before it has a serious chance of joining europe 's elite club .
the country must continue to improve its human rights record and it needs to strengthen its protection of minority rights for its large kurdish population .
but engagement by the eu is the best guarantor that the country will continue down the path of reform . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election editorials : dw 's take all of dw-world 's election 2005 opinion pieces .

on monday , the storm caused oil prices to surge to record highs .
stock exchanges stumbled and insurers buckled as anxiety grew . katrina pounded vulnerable , low-lying new orleans with howling winds on monday , damaging the roof of the superdome stadium where thousands of poor and homeless residents had sought refuge .
the storm knocked out power , flooded streets and threatened to spread destruction along a wide swathe of the us gulf coast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people seek shelter in a doorway in the french quarter of new orleans the large and extremely dangerous hurricane has claimed the lives of at least ten people so far and sent crude oil prices soaring following the evacuation of offshore rigs in the oil-rich gulf of mexico and the closure of refineries in louisiana . packing winds of 240 kilometers -lrb- 150 miles -rrb- per hour , the storm made landfall on a louisiana barrier island early monday before losing strength as it hit the mainland east of new orleans , sparing the city a direct hit . three elderly people died , apparently from dehydration , as they were being evacuated from a nursing home in new orleans on sunday , police said .
katrina claimed seven lives as it slammed florida last week . us president george w. bush declared a state of emergency that clears the way for federal aid to affected areas .
" we can not stress enough the dangers this hurricane poses to gulf coast communities , " bush said from his texas ranch on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush administration said it was ready to tap into its strategic oil reserves to keep supplies flowing . up to 40 percent of crude production along a wide swathe of the us coast from texas in the west to florida in the east was said by experts to be affected . " we probably deal with almost a third of the nation 's domestic oil that is produced , and that will most likely be shut down , " new orleans mayor ray nagin told cnn .
" that could have a significant impact on oil prices going forward , " he said . europe jittery even as experts were estimating that hurricane katrina may be the most expensive ever to hit the united states , european stock exchanges and insurers in capitals as far away as frankfurt and paris were counting their losses monday as the hurricane spent its fury . battered by surging oil prices , european stock exchanges faltered in early trading monday , with the cac 40 in paris opening lower for the sixth straight day . the cac was down 0.33 percent at 4,328.53 in early deals while in frankfurt the dax fell 0.42 percent to 4,763.61 .
the london exchange was closed for a bank holiday . " it 's all about oil today , " a brussels trader told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil prices shot up to fresh records after breaking through the 70-dollar-per-barrel threshold in asian trading monday . with the psychological barrier now breached , some analysts said prices could aim for the once unthinkable $ 80 a barrel - a level economists fear could severely dent consumer demand and curb business activities . germany worried german economy minister wolfgang clement reiterated concern monday about the negative economic effects of the latest surge in oil prices .
germany has been battling record high gasoline prices in recent weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " i view with great concern the rise in crude oil prices , " clement said in berlin .
at the weekend , clement had said in a newspaper interview that " the strong rise in oil and energy prices ... endangers growth , which was just getting back on track . " in an interview broadcast monday on the television news channel n-tv , the minister described the latest rise in oil prices as " completely exaggerated and way above the market situation . " it was not demand that was driving the price of oil , clement insisted .
" a lot of this is speculation .
there 's a lot of uncertainty .
we must do everything to restore some calm and that means , above all , transparency . " germany would do what it could at a european level , clement continued .
" but it 's a global problem , a global market problem .
the g8 -lrb- group of eight -rrb- , the big countries must work together with the oil-producing countries to calm the markets , " he said . in addition to shares in companies such as france 's engineering giant alstom and germany 's lufthansa flagship carrier tumbling on monday , insurers were among the worst hit on fears of huge claims from the hurricane damage .

the dangerously misguided campaign exposes the worst side of germany 's conservatives , says dw-world 's marc young . with a victory by germany 's conservative opposition looking fairly certain when voters go to the polls next month , i 've been trying to accentuate the positive . i 've never been convinced that angela merkel , the leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will be a more zealous reformer than chancellor gerhard schröder has been , but i still hold out hope that the conservatives might be able to shake germany out of its current economic funk . i would have no problem with loosening some of the country 's job protection measures or lowering non-wage labor costs in an attempt to slash unemployment , as the cdu has occasionally mooted .
and at this point , i 'm not sure whether schröder - even if he managed a surprise comeback win - would be able to convince his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to back more radical measures to get europe 's largest economy back on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but just as i start thinking i can overlook some of the uglier aspects of her party 's platform , merkel decides to step up her campaign against turkey 's attempt eventually to join the european union .
on friday , merkel sent a letter to conservative eu heads of state ahead of a sept .

this is the same party that brought us the horrible leitkultur debate about how germany need some sort of guiding teutonic culture instead of the healthy multiculturalism seen in most western democracies .

turkey 's prime minister on monday rejected outright a proposition from german opposition leader angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than outright membership .
the biggest irony , of course , is that merkel does n't seem to realize that the moderate islamic ak party of turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan is simply a muslim version of her christian democratic union - a conservative party with its moral compass rooted in religion . merkel and others opposed to turkey joining the eu contend the country is too large and too poor to become a part of the 25-member bloc , which is already overstretched after its enlargement including most of eastern europe last year . now , i 'll be the first to admit that the eu needs some time to consolidate its recent expansion .
however , the current challenges facing europe are no argument against turkish membership .
first of all , turkish accession is realistically at least 15 years off .
that 's a long time and the prospect of eventual membership would be a driving force in pushing along the country 's modernization . the west needs turkey in the age of osama bin laden and al qaeda , europe - and the rest of the world - need turkey as a prosperous , peaceful and democratic muslim nation .
so long as other islamic nations are either politically oppressed or outright hostile to western ideals , the worst thing the eu could do is push turkey away . it shocks me that merkel and others opposed to its bid do n't seem to realize the potential danger a jilted turkey could pose as reactionary and anti-reformist forces were strengthened .
does europe really want a hostile nation supporting an extreme form of islam at its doorstep ? clearly , turkey has a lot of work to do politically , economically and socially before it has a serious chance of joining europe 's elite club .
the country must continue to improve its human rights record and it needs to strengthen its protection of minority rights for its large kurdish population .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : election editorials : dw 's take opinion : dissolving the doubt opinion : greens must learn to let go the german fear of reform opinion : germany left behind europe -pipe- 29.08.2005 opinion : merkel 's turkish delight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel wants to offer turkey a " privileged partnership " chancellor candidate angela merkel has renewed her efforts to kibosh turkey 's bid to join the eu .
the dangerously misguided campaign exposes the worst side of germany 's conservatives , says dw-world 's marc young . with a victory by germany 's conservative opposition looking fairly certain when voters go to the polls next month , i 've been trying to accentuate the positive . i 've never been convinced that angela merkel , the leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will be a more zealous reformer than chancellor gerhard schröder has been , but i still hold out hope that the conservatives might be able to shake germany out of its current economic funk . i would have no problem with loosening some of the country 's job protection measures or lowering non-wage labor costs in an attempt to slash unemployment , as the cdu has occasionally mooted .
and at this point , i 'm not sure whether schröder - even if he managed a surprise comeback win - would be able to convince his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to back more radical measures to get europe 's largest economy back on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but just as i start thinking i can overlook some of the uglier aspects of her party 's platform , merkel decides to step up her campaign against turkey 's attempt eventually to join the european union .
on friday , merkel sent a letter to conservative eu heads of state ahead of a sept .
1 summit .
in it she renewed her call for the eu to offer ankara a downgraded " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . she wants to raise the issue at the meeting of european conservatives which will take place just before an informal meeting on thursday of eu foreign ministers , where accession negotiations with turkey - expected to open membership negotiations on oct .
3 - will be discussed . anti-islamic ? besides having a nasty whiff of anti-islamic sentiment - which is as contemptible as it is misplaced - the timing of merkel 's initiative smacks of pandering to darker anti-foreigner sentiment simply in order to fish for votes . sadly , this is n't the first time we 've seen this " fortress germany " mentality from the christian democrats .
this is the same party that brought us the horrible leitkultur debate about how germany need some sort of guiding teutonic culture instead of the healthy multiculturalism seen in most western democracies .
it is the same vein of german conservatism that is opposed to immigration and refuses to comprehend that german citizenship should be a matter of where someone is born and not whether they have german blood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara , turkey on monday 16 february 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister on monday rejected outright a proposition from german opposition leader angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than outright membership .
the biggest irony , of course , is that merkel does n't seem to realize that the moderate islamic ak party of turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan is simply a muslim version of her christian democratic union - a conservative party with its moral compass rooted in religion . merkel and others opposed to turkey joining the eu contend the country is too large and too poor to become a part of the 25-member bloc , which is already overstretched after its enlargement including most of eastern europe last year . now , i 'll be the first to admit that the eu needs some time to consolidate its recent expansion .
however , the current challenges facing europe are no argument against turkish membership .
first of all , turkish accession is realistically at least 15 years off .
that 's a long time and the prospect of eventual membership would be a driving force in pushing along the country 's modernization . the west needs turkey in the age of osama bin laden and al qaeda , europe - and the rest of the world - need turkey as a prosperous , peaceful and democratic muslim nation .
so long as other islamic nations are either politically oppressed or outright hostile to western ideals , the worst thing the eu could do is push turkey away . it shocks me that merkel and others opposed to its bid do n't seem to realize the potential danger a jilted turkey could pose as reactionary and anti-reformist forces were strengthened .
does europe really want a hostile nation supporting an extreme form of islam at its doorstep ? clearly , turkey has a lot of work to do politically , economically and socially before it has a serious chance of joining europe 's elite club .
the country must continue to improve its human rights record and it needs to strengthen its protection of minority rights for its large kurdish population .
but engagement by the eu is the best guarantor that the country will continue down the path of reform . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election editorials : dw 's take all of dw-world 's election 2005 opinion pieces .
conservatives say no to turkey again in a letter to conservative eu heads of state ahead of a sept .

the dangerously misguided campaign exposes the worst side of germany 's conservatives , says dw-world 's marc young . with a victory by germany 's conservative opposition looking fairly certain when voters go to the polls next month , i 've been trying to accentuate the positive . i 've never been convinced that angela merkel , the leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will be a more zealous reformer than chancellor gerhard schröder has been , but i still hold out hope that the conservatives might be able to shake germany out of its current economic funk . i would have no problem with loosening some of the country 's job protection measures or lowering non-wage labor costs in an attempt to slash unemployment , as the cdu has occasionally mooted .

on friday , merkel sent a letter to conservative eu heads of state ahead of a sept .
1 summit .
in it she renewed her call for the eu to offer ankara a downgraded " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . she wants to raise the issue at the meeting of european conservatives which will take place just before an informal meeting on thursday of eu foreign ministers , where accession negotiations with turkey - expected to open membership negotiations on oct .
3 - will be discussed . anti-islamic ? besides having a nasty whiff of anti-islamic sentiment - which is as contemptible as it is misplaced - the timing of merkel 's initiative smacks of pandering to darker anti-foreigner sentiment simply in order to fish for votes . sadly , this is n't the first time we 've seen this " fortress germany " mentality from the christian democrats .
this is the same party that brought us the horrible leitkultur debate about how germany need some sort of guiding teutonic culture instead of the healthy multiculturalism seen in most western democracies .
it is the same vein of german conservatism that is opposed to immigration and refuses to comprehend that german citizenship should be a matter of where someone is born and not whether they have german blood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara , turkey on monday 16 february 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister on monday rejected outright a proposition from german opposition leader angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than outright membership .
the biggest irony , of course , is that merkel does n't seem to realize that the moderate islamic ak party of turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan is simply a muslim version of her christian democratic union - a conservative party with its moral compass rooted in religion . merkel and others opposed to turkey joining the eu contend the country is too large and too poor to become a part of the 25-member bloc , which is already overstretched after its enlargement including most of eastern europe last year . now , i 'll be the first to admit that the eu needs some time to consolidate its recent expansion .
however , the current challenges facing europe are no argument against turkish membership .
first of all , turkish accession is realistically at least 15 years off .
that 's a long time and the prospect of eventual membership would be a driving force in pushing along the country 's modernization . the west needs turkey in the age of osama bin laden and al qaeda , europe - and the rest of the world - need turkey as a prosperous , peaceful and democratic muslim nation .
so long as other islamic nations are either politically oppressed or outright hostile to western ideals , the worst thing the eu could do is push turkey away . it shocks me that merkel and others opposed to its bid do n't seem to realize the potential danger a jilted turkey could pose as reactionary and anti-reformist forces were strengthened .
does europe really want a hostile nation supporting an extreme form of islam at its doorstep ? clearly , turkey has a lot of work to do politically , economically and socially before it has a serious chance of joining europe 's elite club .
the country must continue to improve its human rights record and it needs to strengthen its protection of minority rights for its large kurdish population .

in it she renewed her call for the eu to offer ankara a downgraded " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . she wants to raise the issue at the meeting of european conservatives which will take place just before an informal meeting on thursday of eu foreign ministers , where accession negotiations with turkey - expected to open membership negotiations on oct .

this is the same party that brought us the horrible leitkultur debate about how germany need some sort of guiding teutonic culture instead of the healthy multiculturalism seen in most western democracies .
it is the same vein of german conservatism that is opposed to immigration and refuses to comprehend that german citizenship should be a matter of where someone is born and not whether they have german blood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara , turkey on monday 16 february 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister on monday rejected outright a proposition from german opposition leader angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than outright membership .
the biggest irony , of course , is that merkel does n't seem to realize that the moderate islamic ak party of turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan is simply a muslim version of her christian democratic union - a conservative party with its moral compass rooted in religion . merkel and others opposed to turkey joining the eu contend the country is too large and too poor to become a part of the 25-member bloc , which is already overstretched after its enlargement including most of eastern europe last year . now , i 'll be the first to admit that the eu needs some time to consolidate its recent expansion .
however , the current challenges facing europe are no argument against turkish membership .
first of all , turkish accession is realistically at least 15 years off .
that 's a long time and the prospect of eventual membership would be a driving force in pushing along the country 's modernization . the west needs turkey in the age of osama bin laden and al qaeda , europe - and the rest of the world - need turkey as a prosperous , peaceful and democratic muslim nation .
so long as other islamic nations are either politically oppressed or outright hostile to western ideals , the worst thing the eu could do is push turkey away . it shocks me that merkel and others opposed to its bid do n't seem to realize the potential danger a jilted turkey could pose as reactionary and anti-reformist forces were strengthened .
does europe really want a hostile nation supporting an extreme form of islam at its doorstep ? clearly , turkey has a lot of work to do politically , economically and socially before it has a serious chance of joining europe 's elite club .
the country must continue to improve its human rights record and it needs to strengthen its protection of minority rights for its large kurdish population .

on monday , the storm caused oil prices to surge to record highs .
stock exchanges stumbled and insurers buckled as anxiety grew . katrina pounded vulnerable , low-lying new orleans with howling winds on monday , damaging the roof of the superdome stadium where thousands of poor and homeless residents had sought refuge .
the storm knocked out power , flooded streets and threatened to spread destruction along a wide swathe of the us gulf coast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people seek shelter in a doorway in the french quarter of new orleans the large and extremely dangerous hurricane has claimed the lives of at least ten people so far and sent crude oil prices soaring following the evacuation of offshore rigs in the oil-rich gulf of mexico and the closure of refineries in louisiana . packing winds of 240 kilometers -lrb- 150 miles -rrb- per hour , the storm made landfall on a louisiana barrier island early monday before losing strength as it hit the mainland east of new orleans , sparing the city a direct hit . three elderly people died , apparently from dehydration , as they were being evacuated from a nursing home in new orleans on sunday , police said .
katrina claimed seven lives as it slammed florida last week . us president george w. bush declared a state of emergency that clears the way for federal aid to affected areas .
" we can not stress enough the dangers this hurricane poses to gulf coast communities , " bush said from his texas ranch on sunday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush administration said it was ready to tap into its strategic oil reserves to keep supplies flowing . up to 40 percent of crude production along a wide swathe of the us coast from texas in the west to florida in the east was said by experts to be affected . " we probably deal with almost a third of the nation 's domestic oil that is produced , and that will most likely be shut down , " new orleans mayor ray nagin told cnn .
" that could have a significant impact on oil prices going forward , " he said . europe jittery even as experts were estimating that hurricane katrina may be the most expensive ever to hit the united states , european stock exchanges and insurers in capitals as far away as frankfurt and paris were counting their losses monday as the hurricane spent its fury . battered by surging oil prices , european stock exchanges faltered in early trading monday , with the cac 40 in paris opening lower for the sixth straight day . the cac was down 0.33 percent at 4,328.53 in early deals while in frankfurt the dax fell 0.42 percent to 4,763.61 .
the london exchange was closed for a bank holiday . " it 's all about oil today , " a brussels trader told afp . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil prices shot up to fresh records after breaking through the 70-dollar-per-barrel threshold in asian trading monday . with the psychological barrier now breached , some analysts said prices could aim for the once unthinkable $ 80 a barrel - a level economists fear could severely dent consumer demand and curb business activities . germany worried german economy minister wolfgang clement reiterated concern monday about the negative economic effects of the latest surge in oil prices .
germany has been battling record high gasoline prices in recent weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang clement " i view with great concern the rise in crude oil prices , " clement said in berlin .
at the weekend , clement had said in a newspaper interview that " the strong rise in oil and energy prices ... endangers growth , which was just getting back on track .

the list was published by the french civil aviation authority , dgac , on its internet site monday .
most of the interdictions had already been made in 2004 ; the air koryo interdiction goes as far back as april 2001 .
' black mo n th ' of august the blacklist is france 's reaction to the " black month " of august , which to date has seen five bad airline accidents and more than 330 resultant deaths .
a week ago , a west caribean airways plane crashed in venezuela en route to the french caribbean island of martinique , causing 160 deaths of which 152 were french citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescue workers examine site of an airplane crash in niederanven , luxembourg , in 2002 .
so far , france is the third european country , after great britain and sweden , to publicize its own blacklist for airlines .
belgium has also announced plans to publish its own list .
britain not only forbids certain airlines from flying to the country , it disallows planes or airlines from entire countries on the grounds that they do not implement security measures strictly enough .
these countries include the democratic republic of congo , equatorial guinea , liberia , sierra leone , swaziland and tajikistan .
the swiss civil aviation authority said it will publish its own list on thursday .
eu list slated for year e n d in publishing its list , france beat the european union to the punch .
the eu plans to have prepared a european-wide list of banned airlines by the end of 2005 .
candidates for the list are currently being discussed in the european parliament , but no fast date has been set for publication of the list .
bildunterschrift : the west caribbean airways plane that crashed in the mountains of western venezuela in august " we hope the list will be adopted very soon , late this year or early next year , " european commission spokesman rupert krietemeyer said recently at a briefing .
but while the eu 's 25 member states agreed in april to the idea of eventually publishing the names of banned airlines , they disagree on what criteria to use for drawing up such a list .
" we have to set common criteria at the european level , " said an official at the european commission .
airli n e i n dustry doubtful for its part , the aviation industry is skeptical about the effectiveness of blacklists .
such lists are usually based on already known security deficits or high accident rates .
therefore , it gives " the false impression that those who are not on the list are entirely safe , " according to lufthansa manager carsten spohr .
" even bad airlines have safe flights on most days . "
bildunterschrift : tunisian airline wreck in italy , in august .
on an international level , airlines are currently not obligated to publicize security problems that have come to light .
thus the french authorities did not know that in columbia - the home of west caribbean airways - had imposed a fine on the airline for severe safety violations .
i n formatio n shari n g i n europe in europe , the situation is different .
the european civil aviation conference -lrb- ecac -rrb- has begun a control and warning system for airlines .
" if a national aviation authority finds technical defects during a random control , that information goes into a data bank and the information then goes out to the other member countries , " said cornelia eichhorn , speaker for the german aviation authority .
then each nation can decide for itself whether to restrict that airline 's landing rights .
but the main problem in putting together blacklists is unlikely to be affected by european cooperation .
each individual airline 's safety can only be effectively tested by its own country .
in terms of the safety of foreign carriers , european officials need to rely on the individual country 's safety regulators and their own controls . sebastian ertinger -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu airlines blacklist easier said than done a series of airplane crashes has spurred european countries to ban airlines deemed unsafe , although drawing up an eu-wide list of trouble-plagued carriers - as the eu 's executive commission wants - is proving elusive .

belgium has also announced plans to publish its own list .
britain not only forbids certain airlines from flying to the country , it disallows planes or airlines from entire countries on the grounds that they do not implement security measures strictly enough .

but while the eu 's 25 member states agreed in april to the idea of eventually publishing the names of banned airlines , they disagree on what criteria to use for drawing up such a list .

the list was published by the french civil aviation authority , dgac , on its internet site monday .
most of the interdictions had already been made in 2004 ; the air koryo interdiction goes as far back as april 2001 .
' black mo n th ' of august the blacklist is france 's reaction to the " black month " of august , which to date has seen five bad airline accidents and more than 330 resultant deaths .
a week ago , a west caribean airways plane crashed in venezuela en route to the french caribbean island of martinique , causing 160 deaths of which 152 were french citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescue workers examine site of an airplane crash in niederanven , luxembourg , in 2002 .
so far , france is the third european country , after great britain and sweden , to publicize its own blacklist for airlines .
belgium has also announced plans to publish its own list .
britain not only forbids certain airlines from flying to the country , it disallows planes or airlines from entire countries on the grounds that they do not implement security measures strictly enough .
these countries include the democratic republic of congo , equatorial guinea , liberia , sierra leone , swaziland and tajikistan .
the swiss civil aviation authority said it will publish its own list on thursday .
eu list slated for year e n d in publishing its list , france beat the european union to the punch .
the eu plans to have prepared a european-wide list of banned airlines by the end of 2005 .
candidates for the list are currently being discussed in the european parliament , but no fast date has been set for publication of the list .
bildunterschrift : the west caribbean airways plane that crashed in the mountains of western venezuela in august " we hope the list will be adopted very soon , late this year or early next year , " european commission spokesman rupert krietemeyer said recently at a briefing .
but while the eu 's 25 member states agreed in april to the idea of eventually publishing the names of banned airlines , they disagree on what criteria to use for drawing up such a list .
" we have to set common criteria at the european level , " said an official at the european commission .
airli n e i n dustry doubtful for its part , the aviation industry is skeptical about the effectiveness of blacklists .
such lists are usually based on already known security deficits or high accident rates .
therefore , it gives " the false impression that those who are not on the list are entirely safe , " according to lufthansa manager carsten spohr .
" even bad airlines have safe flights on most days . "
bildunterschrift : tunisian airline wreck in italy , in august .
on an international level , airlines are currently not obligated to publicize security problems that have come to light .
thus the french authorities did not know that in columbia - the home of west caribbean airways - had imposed a fine on the airline for severe safety violations .
i n formatio n shari n g i n europe in europe , the situation is different .
the european civil aviation conference -lrb- ecac -rrb- has begun a control and warning system for airlines .
" if a national aviation authority finds technical defects during a random control , that information goes into a data bank and the information then goes out to the other member countries , " said cornelia eichhorn , speaker for the german aviation authority .
then each nation can decide for itself whether to restrict that airline 's landing rights .
but the main problem in putting together blacklists is unlikely to be affected by european cooperation .
each individual airline 's safety can only be effectively tested by its own country .
in terms of the safety of foreign carriers , european officials need to rely on the individual country 's safety regulators and their own controls . sebastian ertinger -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu airlines blacklist easier said than done a series of airplane crashes has spurred european countries to ban airlines deemed unsafe , although drawing up an eu-wide list of trouble-plagued carriers - as the eu 's executive commission wants - is proving elusive .
-lrb- aug .
26 , 2005 -rrb- eu air safety rules fall short although the european union has stepped up safety rules for the air transport sector in recent years , the bloc is still dogged by a lack of coordination and sometimes patchy application of existing regulations .
-lrb- aug .

-lrb- may 14 , 2005 -rrb- feedback do you think each individual european country should have its own list of unsafe airlines ?
or should europe make such a list for all eu countries ?

steinhäuser was said to have wanted to take revenge on the school for expelling him earlier . the incident deeply stunned a nation unaccustomed to brutal violence in schools and triggered a heated debate on the tightening of gun laws and the impact of violent computer games on youth . re n ovatio n a n ew begi n n i n g ? following the bloodbath , the surviving 600 students and 60 teachers were moved to alternative premises .
the school , an art nouveau building named after the german 15th century printer johannes gutenberg who invented movable metal type , was completely renovated at a cost of some 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.3 million -rrb- provided by the german government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , left , with the school director christiane alt on thursday , schröder said that the entire country sympathized with the affected families . " there were legal consequences across party lines , regarding youth protection , gun law and even school law , " schröder said , adding that though a few answers had been provided , the wounds inflicted by the dark day had still not healed . the chancellor however underlined that he was happy that the city had decided to hold on to the old school building , saying the revamping of the place was also a sign of national solidarity with the victims and the affected families . " a piece of normality has returned , " schroder said , warning however that one should n't expect too much from the reopened school .
" it is only as strong as the society which it is a part of , " he said . bildunterschrift : dieter althaus , premier of the state of thuringia said that though pain , sorrow and anger still surrounded the event , " hope is also there . " normality far from easy despite the optimistic note , it will be far from easy for the students and teachers to resume classes at the scene of the horrific tragedy .
33 students and nine teachers are currently undergoing psychological counseling and some of them have only recently sought out treatment even though the massacre happened three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : psychologists say this is n't unusual as effects of a traumatic experience frequently make themselves felt long after the event that caused them .
they also warn against overestimating the beneficial , psychological impact of the renovation work symbolizing a new beginning . christiane alt , director of the gutenberg high school , who returned to her office some months ago , said many of the students are desperately hoping for a return to normal school life . " the most uplifting moment will be when life returns to the building and the voices of children can be heard once again , " alt said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us shootings resurrect erfurt horror on monday , a pupil entered the red lake high school in minnesota and killed ten people .

the list was published by the french civil aviation authority , dgac , on its internet site monday .
most of the interdictions had already been made in 2004 ; the air koryo interdiction goes as far back as april 2001 .
' black mo n th ' of august the blacklist is france 's reaction to the " black month " of august , which to date has seen five bad airline accidents and more than 330 resultant deaths .
a week ago , a west caribean airways plane crashed in venezuela en route to the french caribbean island of martinique , causing 160 deaths of which 152 were french citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescue workers examine site of an airplane crash in niederanven , luxembourg , in 2002 .
so far , france is the third european country , after great britain and sweden , to publicize its own blacklist for airlines .
belgium has also announced plans to publish its own list .
britain not only forbids certain airlines from flying to the country , it disallows planes or airlines from entire countries on the grounds that they do not implement security measures strictly enough .
these countries include the democratic republic of congo , equatorial guinea , liberia , sierra leone , swaziland and tajikistan .
the swiss civil aviation authority said it will publish its own list on thursday .
eu list slated for year e n d in publishing its list , france beat the european union to the punch .
the eu plans to have prepared a european-wide list of banned airlines by the end of 2005 .
candidates for the list are currently being discussed in the european parliament , but no fast date has been set for publication of the list .
bildunterschrift : the west caribbean airways plane that crashed in the mountains of western venezuela in august " we hope the list will be adopted very soon , late this year or early next year , " european commission spokesman rupert krietemeyer said recently at a briefing .
but while the eu 's 25 member states agreed in april to the idea of eventually publishing the names of banned airlines , they disagree on what criteria to use for drawing up such a list .
" we have to set common criteria at the european level , " said an official at the european commission .
airli n e i n dustry doubtful for its part , the aviation industry is skeptical about the effectiveness of blacklists .
such lists are usually based on already known security deficits or high accident rates .
therefore , it gives " the false impression that those who are not on the list are entirely safe , " according to lufthansa manager carsten spohr .
" even bad airlines have safe flights on most days . "
bildunterschrift : tunisian airline wreck in italy , in august .
on an international level , airlines are currently not obligated to publicize security problems that have come to light .
thus the french authorities did not know that in columbia - the home of west caribbean airways - had imposed a fine on the airline for severe safety violations .
i n formatio n shari n g i n europe in europe , the situation is different .
the european civil aviation conference -lrb- ecac -rrb- has begun a control and warning system for airlines .
" if a national aviation authority finds technical defects during a random control , that information goes into a data bank and the information then goes out to the other member countries , " said cornelia eichhorn , speaker for the german aviation authority .
then each nation can decide for itself whether to restrict that airline 's landing rights .
but the main problem in putting together blacklists is unlikely to be affected by european cooperation .
each individual airline 's safety can only be effectively tested by its own country .
in terms of the safety of foreign carriers , european officials need to rely on the individual country 's safety regulators and their own controls . sebastian ertinger -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu airlines blacklist easier said than done a series of airplane crashes has spurred european countries to ban airlines deemed unsafe , although drawing up an eu-wide list of trouble-plagued carriers - as the eu 's executive commission wants - is proving elusive .

" a lot of this is speculation .
there 's a lot of uncertainty .
we must do everything to restore some calm and that means , above all , transparency . " germany would do what it could at a european level , clement continued .

schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- on the other hand remained stable at 29 percent - not the trend of a chancellor on the rebound . that 's why the cdu / csu under chancellor candidate angela merkel will likely be able to lead germany according to their vision after sept .

the composition of party alliances is perhaps as important as the question of who becomes chancellor . if he could have his way , gerhard schröder would continue to lead germany in " the existing , successful coalition " with the greens , the chancellor said recently . but , according to the latest polls , that contingency seems increasingly unlikely .
despite recent gaffes by conservative challengers , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , were able to climb a percentage point to 41 percent .
schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- on the other hand remained stable at 29 percent - not the trend of a chancellor on the rebound . that 's why the cdu / csu under chancellor candidate angela merkel will likely be able to lead germany according to their vision after sept .

but the question of which party - or parties - will comprise the ruling fraction in germany 's parliament , the bundestag , is open to great speculation . it is this question that plays a key role in the direction germany 's parliamentary democracy .
but most top politicians tend to play down the issue and voters do not directly decide which coalition will rule the country . the debate over possible coalitions is difficult to avoid as no party is likely to get an outright majority .
but schröder , merkel , german foreign minister joschka fischer of the greens and guido westerwelle , the leader of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- have all discouraged it in their own ways . " until the election , i would advise everyone in my party to not engage in coalition debates , " schröder recently told financial times deutschland .
" my goal is to make the spd the strongest possible party .
thus i have no time for coalition debates , and i also think they 're wrong . " a taboo topic ? schröder 's warning to avoid this sort of talk is no fluke , but the advice of an experienced politician , according to experts .
when the spd , or any party for that matter , starts to publicly mull their potential partners , this already demonstrates weakness , said manfred güllner , the founder and head of opinion research institute forsa . " when the spd talks about a ' grand coalition , ' it shows that they already see themselves as the losers , " he told financial times deutschland newspaper .
" it cements an image of weakness . " but not everyone in schröder 's team has heeded his advice .
interior minister schily , for example , recently praised the cooperation on national security issues with the christian union and even went so far as to speak positively of the possibility of a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily toyed with the idea of a grand coalition on ard television .
" you ca n't rule out the option of a grand coalition from the get-go , " schily recently said in an interview on german public broadcaster ard . but fischer - like schröder - has been an outspoken critic of the coalition debate .
the pugnacious politician is devoting his undivided attention to strengthening his own party to ensure a good bargaining position during the coalition negotiations that will follow the election . the greens , who were most hurt by schröder and spd chief franz müntefering 's call for new elections , also hold out hope for a continued red-green coalition . " the wind is changing directions , " an optimistic fischer said two weeks ago .
but poll results since then have not been promising . please continue reading to find out what coalitions are most likely after the sept .

despite recent gaffes by conservative challengers , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , were able to climb a percentage point to 41 percent .
schröder 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- on the other hand remained stable at 29 percent - not the trend of a chancellor on the rebound . that 's why the cdu / csu under chancellor candidate angela merkel will likely be able to lead germany according to their vision after sept .
18 .
but the question of which party - or parties - will comprise the ruling fraction in germany 's parliament , the bundestag , is open to great speculation . it is this question that plays a key role in the direction germany 's parliamentary democracy .
but most top politicians tend to play down the issue and voters do not directly decide which coalition will rule the country . the debate over possible coalitions is difficult to avoid as no party is likely to get an outright majority .
but schröder , merkel , german foreign minister joschka fischer of the greens and guido westerwelle , the leader of the free-market liberal free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- have all discouraged it in their own ways . " until the election , i would advise everyone in my party to not engage in coalition debates , " schröder recently told financial times deutschland .
" my goal is to make the spd the strongest possible party .
thus i have no time for coalition debates , and i also think they 're wrong . " a taboo topic ? schröder 's warning to avoid this sort of talk is no fluke , but the advice of an experienced politician , according to experts .
when the spd , or any party for that matter , starts to publicly mull their potential partners , this already demonstrates weakness , said manfred güllner , the founder and head of opinion research institute forsa . " when the spd talks about a ' grand coalition , ' it shows that they already see themselves as the losers , " he told financial times deutschland newspaper .
" it cements an image of weakness . " but not everyone in schröder 's team has heeded his advice .
interior minister schily , for example , recently praised the cooperation on national security issues with the christian union and even went so far as to speak positively of the possibility of a grand coalition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily toyed with the idea of a grand coalition on ard television .
" you ca n't rule out the option of a grand coalition from the get-go , " schily recently said in an interview on german public broadcaster ard . but fischer - like schröder - has been an outspoken critic of the coalition debate .
the pugnacious politician is devoting his undivided attention to strengthening his own party to ensure a good bargaining position during the coalition negotiations that will follow the election . the greens , who were most hurt by schröder and spd chief franz müntefering 's call for new elections , also hold out hope for a continued red-green coalition . " the wind is changing directions , " an optimistic fischer said two weeks ago .
but poll results since then have not been promising . please continue reading to find out what coalitions are most likely after the sept .

the dark horse party in the 2005 election , the left party has been making waves by establishing itself in the polls at around 10 percent and upsetting the greens and the fdp as a force to be reckoned with among the small parties . left party figureheads gregor gysi and oskar lafontaine may not have a chance at the chancellery and it is next to impossible to imagine them governing with merkel .
but the next legislative term looks like it will see a five-fraction parliament rather than four . the cdu / csu itself would prefer to rule with its current opposition partner , the fdp .

" the union with the spd is the most likely one . " a so-called ampelkoalition , or " traffic light coalition , " named for the symbolic colors of the three parties red , yellow , and green , would be political suicide for the spd , he added .

on monday , the storm caused oil prices to surge to record highs .
stock exchanges stumbled and insurers buckled as anxiety grew . katrina pounded vulnerable , low-lying new orleans with howling winds on monday , damaging the roof of the superdome stadium where thousands of poor and homeless residents had sought refuge .
the storm knocked out power , flooded streets and threatened to spread destruction along a wide swathe of the us gulf coast . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people seek shelter in a doorway in the french quarter of new orleans the large and extremely dangerous hurricane has claimed the lives of at least ten people so far and sent crude oil prices soaring following the evacuation of offshore rigs in the oil-rich gulf of mexico and the closure of refineries in louisiana . packing winds of 240 kilometers -lrb- 150 miles -rrb- per hour , the storm made landfall on a louisiana barrier island early monday before losing strength as it hit the mainland east of new orleans , sparing the city a direct hit . three elderly people died , apparently from dehydration , as they were being evacuated from a nursing home in new orleans on sunday , police said .
katrina claimed seven lives as it slammed florida last week . us president george w. bush declared a state of emergency that clears the way for federal aid to affected areas .

turkey 's prime minister on monday rejected outright a proposition from german opposition leader angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than outright membership .
the biggest irony , of course , is that merkel does n't seem to realize that the moderate islamic ak party of turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan is simply a muslim version of her christian democratic union - a conservative party with its moral compass rooted in religion . merkel and others opposed to turkey joining the eu contend the country is too large and too poor to become a part of the 25-member bloc , which is already overstretched after its enlargement including most of eastern europe last year . now , i 'll be the first to admit that the eu needs some time to consolidate its recent expansion .

parents are invited to come to lectures for the first time , the college town of münster has invited mom and dad to come see how junior is getting on at school .
is the aim to bring parents and kids closer together ?
maybe .
but they also want to promote the town . a university student 's worst nightmare may be a dream come true for this quaint german city .
with an event they 're calling elternalarm !
-lrb- look out , parents ! -rrb- , münster has decided to tap one of its greatest assets - its 50,000-strong student population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : münster is germany 's cycling capital ' look out , parents ! ' is slated to take place the first weekend in november .
different from your typical visiting day , when students might check out a school they want to attend , the acidly named ' look out ! is a full-court press to win the hearts and minds of the students and their folks .
long-term tourists hotels will offer visiting parents student rates ; old folks can take part in programmed activities from lectures , to concerts , to city tours .
they can even join their offspring for a meal in the student canteen .
organizers hope that after the weekend , parents will think of münster as a tourist destination long after their child has graduated .
moreover , with tuition fees going into effect by 2007 , creating entire families of münster boosters simply makes sense .
" competition among universities is increasing ...
in the long term , we have to show them what we are doing with their money , " university of münster spokesman norbert frie told the kna news agency .
so far , only 150 parents have signed up to take part , which could be a sign that the kids are less than enthusiastic about having their folks spend a weekend poking into their stuff , their friends and their daily routines - not to mention killing any party plans they had .
mom and dad who ?
organizers say they expect more people to enlist after the semester begins in october , but it 's not hard to imagine that the low turnout could be the result of an age old phenomenon - teenagers wanting to put distance between themselves and their parents after they leave the nest .

spanish troops attached to the isaf have also been engaged in recent heavy fighting around herat . struck said germany had no intention of pulling out of afghanistan despite the increasing danger . " if we withdrew , we would leave the warlords , drug dealers and taliban to take over , " he said . the german commander in faizabad , colonel peter baierl , said the troops had repeatedly been the target of attacks in recent days .
a lone rocket struck the german military camp of the civil-military faizabad provincial reconstruction team late saturday but caused no injuries . he said he believed most of the violence in faizabad was not politically motivated but rather the product of drug wars in the region . struck was to visit german soldiers in the northeastern province of kunduz later monday . more germa n troops expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in kabul .

" what 's happened now is the team from brussels is returning to brussels to report back , " said michael jennings , an eu spokesman in beijing , adding that they had departed .
" the talks are still ongoing in beijing , the contact is still ongoing , the discussion is still ongoing , " he said . he said that while the entire delegation , headed by trade director fritz-harald wenig , was going back to europe , the dialogue was being carried on by the resident eu mission in beijing . " our delegation , the delegation of the european commission , is continuing the talks , " he said . jennings said he had no details on the results of the four-day negotiations but described them as " constructive .

they are barred from entering into the continent because they exceed an eu quota imposed in june to protect european manufacturers . chinese observers said they were optimistic since they were not facing a monolithic european bloc . " the two sides will probably reach a compromise , " said liu li , vice director of the china wto research institute , a think tank attached to the commerce ministry .

the first , favored by germany , the netherlands and the scandinavian countries , all traditionally free-traders , would consist of raising the permitted level of chinese textile imports . the second , more attractive to france , italy , poland and spain , would allow china to use some of its 2006 quota to export blocked garments into the eu this year . " personally , i think the two sides will reach a compromise which will allow china to use some of next year 's quota , and then come next year , the eu will give china extra quotas , " li said .
" both sides have a strong wish to reach a consensus . " chi n a a n d us prepari n g for talks one reason why china may be eager to wrap up the talks now is that it is getting ready to host yet another negotiating team , this time from the united states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us commerce secretary , donald evans is involved in the negotiations with china chinese and american delegates will begin a fourth round of textile talks tuesday , with the us pushing to limit chinese imports to protect its own industry . the talks , scheduled to last just two days , follow a meeting in san francisco this month at which negotiators failed to overcome " fundamental differences " on how to cap the exports . observers say europe and china are also eager to make the embarrassing textile dispute go away as soon as possible since beijing will host an eu-china summit attended by british prime minister tony blair next week . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu-china textile import talks continue the european union and china held a second day of talks friday on a dispute over textile exports that has left millions of chinese-made clothes stuck in customs and off the shelves of stores in europe .

parents are invited to come to lectures for the first time , the college town of münster has invited mom and dad to come see how junior is getting on at school .
is the aim to bring parents and kids closer together ?
maybe .
but they also want to promote the town . a university student 's worst nightmare may be a dream come true for this quaint german city .
with an event they 're calling elternalarm !
-lrb- look out , parents ! -rrb- , münster has decided to tap one of its greatest assets - its 50,000-strong student population .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : münster is germany 's cycling capital ' look out , parents ! ' is slated to take place the first weekend in november .
different from your typical visiting day , when students might check out a school they want to attend , the acidly named ' look out ! is a full-court press to win the hearts and minds of the students and their folks .
long-term tourists hotels will offer visiting parents student rates ; old folks can take part in programmed activities from lectures , to concerts , to city tours .
they can even join their offspring for a meal in the student canteen .
organizers hope that after the weekend , parents will think of münster as a tourist destination long after their child has graduated .
moreover , with tuition fees going into effect by 2007 , creating entire families of münster boosters simply makes sense .
" competition among universities is increasing ...
in the long term , we have to show them what we are doing with their money , " university of münster spokesman norbert frie told the kna news agency .
so far , only 150 parents have signed up to take part , which could be a sign that the kids are less than enthusiastic about having their folks spend a weekend poking into their stuff , their friends and their daily routines - not to mention killing any party plans they had .
mom and dad who ?
organizers say they expect more people to enlist after the semester begins in october , but it 's not hard to imagine that the low turnout could be the result of an age old phenomenon - teenagers wanting to put distance between themselves and their parents after they leave the nest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : münster 's aasee will be the site of a goodbye brunch " people are certainly divided over it , " said fries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.08.2005 france compiles blacklist for airlines großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recent crash in greece cost 121 people their lives france has published a list of airlines that are n't allowed to fly its airspace - beating european regulators to the punch . north korea 's air koryo , air st. thomas of the us , international air service from liberia , mozambique 's lineas aer and the thai phuket airlines are all on a " blacklist " of airlines that breach international regulations and therefore can no longer fly in france .
the list was published by the french civil aviation authority , dgac , on its internet site monday .
most of the interdictions had already been made in 2004 ; the air koryo interdiction goes as far back as april 2001 .
' black mo n th ' of august the blacklist is france 's reaction to the " black month " of august , which to date has seen five bad airline accidents and more than 330 resultant deaths .
a week ago , a west caribean airways plane crashed in venezuela en route to the french caribbean island of martinique , causing 160 deaths of which 152 were french citizens .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rescue workers examine site of an airplane crash in niederanven , luxembourg , in 2002 .
so far , france is the third european country , after great britain and sweden , to publicize its own blacklist for airlines .
belgium has also announced plans to publish its own list .
britain not only forbids certain airlines from flying to the country , it disallows planes or airlines from entire countries on the grounds that they do not implement security measures strictly enough .
these countries include the democratic republic of congo , equatorial guinea , liberia , sierra leone , swaziland and tajikistan .
the swiss civil aviation authority said it will publish its own list on thursday .
eu list slated for year e n d in publishing its list , france beat the european union to the punch .
the eu plans to have prepared a european-wide list of banned airlines by the end of 2005 .
candidates for the list are currently being discussed in the european parliament , but no fast date has been set for publication of the list .
bildunterschrift : the west caribbean airways plane that crashed in the mountains of western venezuela in august " we hope the list will be adopted very soon , late this year or early next year , " european commission spokesman rupert krietemeyer said recently at a briefing .
but while the eu 's 25 member states agreed in april to the idea of eventually publishing the names of banned airlines , they disagree on what criteria to use for drawing up such a list .
" we have to set common criteria at the european level , " said an official at the european commission .
airli n e i n dustry doubtful for its part , the aviation industry is skeptical about the effectiveness of blacklists .
such lists are usually based on already known security deficits or high accident rates .
therefore , it gives " the false impression that those who are not on the list are entirely safe , " according to lufthansa manager carsten spohr .
" even bad airlines have safe flights on most days . "
bildunterschrift : tunisian airline wreck in italy , in august .
on an international level , airlines are currently not obligated to publicize security problems that have come to light .
thus the french authorities did not know that in columbia - the home of west caribbean airways - had imposed a fine on the airline for severe safety violations .
i n formatio n shari n g i n europe in europe , the situation is different .
the european civil aviation conference -lrb- ecac -rrb- has begun a control and warning system for airlines .
" if a national aviation authority finds technical defects during a random control , that information goes into a data bank and the information then goes out to the other member countries , " said cornelia eichhorn , speaker for the german aviation authority .
then each nation can decide for itself whether to restrict that airline 's landing rights .
but the main problem in putting together blacklists is unlikely to be affected by european cooperation .
each individual airline 's safety can only be effectively tested by its own country .
in terms of the safety of foreign carriers , european officials need to rely on the individual country 's safety regulators and their own controls . sebastian ertinger -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu airlines blacklist easier said than done a series of airplane crashes has spurred european countries to ban airlines deemed unsafe , although drawing up an eu-wide list of trouble-plagued carriers - as the eu 's executive commission wants - is proving elusive .

26 , 2005 -rrb- eu air safety rules fall short although the european union has stepped up safety rules for the air transport sector in recent years , the bloc is still dogged by a lack of coordination and sometimes patchy application of existing regulations .

the list was published by the french civil aviation authority , dgac , on its internet site monday .
most of the interdictions had already been made in 2004 ; the air koryo interdiction goes as far back as april 2001 .
' black mo n th ' of august the blacklist is france 's reaction to the " black month " of august , which to date has seen five bad airline accidents and more than 330 resultant deaths .
a week ago , a west caribean airways plane crashed in venezuela en route to the french caribbean island of martinique , causing 160 deaths of which 152 were french citizens .

so far , france is the third european country , after great britain and sweden , to publicize its own blacklist for airlines .
belgium has also announced plans to publish its own list .
britain not only forbids certain airlines from flying to the country , it disallows planes or airlines from entire countries on the grounds that they do not implement security measures strictly enough .

the eu plans to have prepared a european-wide list of banned airlines by the end of 2005 .
candidates for the list are currently being discussed in the european parliament , but no fast date has been set for publication of the list .
bildunterschrift : the west caribbean airways plane that crashed in the mountains of western venezuela in august " we hope the list will be adopted very soon , late this year or early next year , " european commission spokesman rupert krietemeyer said recently at a briefing .
but while the eu 's 25 member states agreed in april to the idea of eventually publishing the names of banned airlines , they disagree on what criteria to use for drawing up such a list .
" we have to set common criteria at the european level , " said an official at the european commission .
airli n e i n dustry doubtful for its part , the aviation industry is skeptical about the effectiveness of blacklists .

" even bad airlines have safe flights on most days . "

then each nation can decide for itself whether to restrict that airline 's landing rights .
but the main problem in putting together blacklists is unlikely to be affected by european cooperation .

" competition among universities is increasing ...
in the long term , we have to show them what we are doing with their money , " university of münster spokesman norbert frie told the kna news agency .
so far , only 150 parents have signed up to take part , which could be a sign that the kids are less than enthusiastic about having their folks spend a weekend poking into their stuff , their friends and their daily routines - not to mention killing any party plans they had .

organizers say they expect more people to enlist after the semester begins in october , but it 's not hard to imagine that the low turnout could be the result of an age old phenomenon - teenagers wanting to put distance between themselves and their parents after they leave the nest .

the dangerously misguided campaign exposes the worst side of germany 's conservatives , says dw-world 's marc young . with a victory by germany 's conservative opposition looking fairly certain when voters go to the polls next month , i 've been trying to accentuate the positive . i 've never been convinced that angela merkel , the leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will be a more zealous reformer than chancellor gerhard schröder has been , but i still hold out hope that the conservatives might be able to shake germany out of its current economic funk . i would have no problem with loosening some of the country 's job protection measures or lowering non-wage labor costs in an attempt to slash unemployment , as the cdu has occasionally mooted .
and at this point , i 'm not sure whether schröder - even if he managed a surprise comeback win - would be able to convince his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to back more radical measures to get europe 's largest economy back on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but just as i start thinking i can overlook some of the uglier aspects of her party 's platform , merkel decides to step up her campaign against turkey 's attempt eventually to join the european union .
on friday , merkel sent a letter to conservative eu heads of state ahead of a sept .
1 summit .
in it she renewed her call for the eu to offer ankara a downgraded " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . she wants to raise the issue at the meeting of european conservatives which will take place just before an informal meeting on thursday of eu foreign ministers , where accession negotiations with turkey - expected to open membership negotiations on oct .
3 - will be discussed . anti-islamic ? besides having a nasty whiff of anti-islamic sentiment - which is as contemptible as it is misplaced - the timing of merkel 's initiative smacks of pandering to darker anti-foreigner sentiment simply in order to fish for votes . sadly , this is n't the first time we 've seen this " fortress germany " mentality from the christian democrats .
this is the same party that brought us the horrible leitkultur debate about how germany need some sort of guiding teutonic culture instead of the healthy multiculturalism seen in most western democracies .
it is the same vein of german conservatism that is opposed to immigration and refuses to comprehend that german citizenship should be a matter of where someone is born and not whether they have german blood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara , turkey on monday 16 february 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister on monday rejected outright a proposition from german opposition leader angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than outright membership .
the biggest irony , of course , is that merkel does n't seem to realize that the moderate islamic ak party of turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan is simply a muslim version of her christian democratic union - a conservative party with its moral compass rooted in religion . merkel and others opposed to turkey joining the eu contend the country is too large and too poor to become a part of the 25-member bloc , which is already overstretched after its enlargement including most of eastern europe last year . now , i 'll be the first to admit that the eu needs some time to consolidate its recent expansion .
however , the current challenges facing europe are no argument against turkish membership .
first of all , turkish accession is realistically at least 15 years off .
that 's a long time and the prospect of eventual membership would be a driving force in pushing along the country 's modernization . the west needs turkey in the age of osama bin laden and al qaeda , europe - and the rest of the world - need turkey as a prosperous , peaceful and democratic muslim nation .
so long as other islamic nations are either politically oppressed or outright hostile to western ideals , the worst thing the eu could do is push turkey away . it shocks me that merkel and others opposed to its bid do n't seem to realize the potential danger a jilted turkey could pose as reactionary and anti-reformist forces were strengthened .
does europe really want a hostile nation supporting an extreme form of islam at its doorstep ? clearly , turkey has a lot of work to do politically , economically and socially before it has a serious chance of joining europe 's elite club .
the country must continue to improve its human rights record and it needs to strengthen its protection of minority rights for its large kurdish population .
but engagement by the eu is the best guarantor that the country will continue down the path of reform . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election editorials : dw 's take all of dw-world 's election 2005 opinion pieces .

he said the security situation before the sept .

a bomb attached to a bicycle killed at least 10 people , most of them children , in the southern city of kandahar on tuesday , underlining the violence still plaguing afghanistan .
rebel fighters loyal to afghanistan 's ousted taliban regime have pledged to disrupt the elections .
around 1,000 people have died so far this year during a rise in violence linked to the militants . taliban insurgents are battling the government army and about 20,000 us troops across south and east afghanistan .
spanish troops attached to the isaf have also been engaged in recent heavy fighting around herat . struck said germany had no intention of pulling out of afghanistan despite the increasing danger . " if we withdrew , we would leave the warlords , drug dealers and taliban to take over , " he said . the german commander in faizabad , colonel peter baierl , said the troops had repeatedly been the target of attacks in recent days .
a lone rocket struck the german military camp of the civil-military faizabad provincial reconstruction team late saturday but caused no injuries . he said he believed most of the violence in faizabad was not politically motivated but rather the product of drug wars in the region . struck was to visit german soldiers in the northeastern province of kunduz later monday . more germa n troops expected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers in kabul .
germany currently has some 2,200 troops serving with the 10,500-strong isaf working to bolster security in northern and western afghanistan and the capital kabul . media reports in july suggested that the defense ministry could employ german troops further afield across the whole of region patrolled by isaf . a defense ministry spokesman told reuters the bundestag would be asked to approve a government request to extend the soldiers ' mandate beyond oct .

the dangerously misguided campaign exposes the worst side of germany 's conservatives , says dw-world 's marc young . with a victory by germany 's conservative opposition looking fairly certain when voters go to the polls next month , i 've been trying to accentuate the positive . i 've never been convinced that angela merkel , the leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will be a more zealous reformer than chancellor gerhard schröder has been , but i still hold out hope that the conservatives might be able to shake germany out of its current economic funk . i would have no problem with loosening some of the country 's job protection measures or lowering non-wage labor costs in an attempt to slash unemployment , as the cdu has occasionally mooted .
and at this point , i 'm not sure whether schröder - even if he managed a surprise comeback win - would be able to convince his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to back more radical measures to get europe 's largest economy back on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but just as i start thinking i can overlook some of the uglier aspects of her party 's platform , merkel decides to step up her campaign against turkey 's attempt eventually to join the european union .
on friday , merkel sent a letter to conservative eu heads of state ahead of a sept .
1 summit .
in it she renewed her call for the eu to offer ankara a downgraded " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . she wants to raise the issue at the meeting of european conservatives which will take place just before an informal meeting on thursday of eu foreign ministers , where accession negotiations with turkey - expected to open membership negotiations on oct .
3 - will be discussed . anti-islamic ? besides having a nasty whiff of anti-islamic sentiment - which is as contemptible as it is misplaced - the timing of merkel 's initiative smacks of pandering to darker anti-foreigner sentiment simply in order to fish for votes . sadly , this is n't the first time we 've seen this " fortress germany " mentality from the christian democrats .
this is the same party that brought us the horrible leitkultur debate about how germany need some sort of guiding teutonic culture instead of the healthy multiculturalism seen in most western democracies .
it is the same vein of german conservatism that is opposed to immigration and refuses to comprehend that german citizenship should be a matter of where someone is born and not whether they have german blood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara , turkey on monday 16 february 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister on monday rejected outright a proposition from german opposition leader angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than outright membership .
the biggest irony , of course , is that merkel does n't seem to realize that the moderate islamic ak party of turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan is simply a muslim version of her christian democratic union - a conservative party with its moral compass rooted in religion . merkel and others opposed to turkey joining the eu contend the country is too large and too poor to become a part of the 25-member bloc , which is already overstretched after its enlargement including most of eastern europe last year . now , i 'll be the first to admit that the eu needs some time to consolidate its recent expansion .
however , the current challenges facing europe are no argument against turkish membership .
first of all , turkish accession is realistically at least 15 years off .
that 's a long time and the prospect of eventual membership would be a driving force in pushing along the country 's modernization . the west needs turkey in the age of osama bin laden and al qaeda , europe - and the rest of the world - need turkey as a prosperous , peaceful and democratic muslim nation .
so long as other islamic nations are either politically oppressed or outright hostile to western ideals , the worst thing the eu could do is push turkey away . it shocks me that merkel and others opposed to its bid do n't seem to realize the potential danger a jilted turkey could pose as reactionary and anti-reformist forces were strengthened .
does europe really want a hostile nation supporting an extreme form of islam at its doorstep ? clearly , turkey has a lot of work to do politically , economically and socially before it has a serious chance of joining europe 's elite club .
the country must continue to improve its human rights record and it needs to strengthen its protection of minority rights for its large kurdish population .
but engagement by the eu is the best guarantor that the country will continue down the path of reform . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election editorials : dw 's take all of dw-world 's election 2005 opinion pieces .

steinhäuser was said to have wanted to take revenge on the school for expelling him earlier . the incident deeply stunned a nation unaccustomed to brutal violence in schools and triggered a heated debate on the tightening of gun laws and the impact of violent computer games on youth . re n ovatio n a n ew begi n n i n g ? following the bloodbath , the surviving 600 students and 60 teachers were moved to alternative premises .
the school , an art nouveau building named after the german 15th century printer johannes gutenberg who invented movable metal type , was completely renovated at a cost of some 10 million euros -lrb- $ 12.3 million -rrb- provided by the german government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder , left , with the school director christiane alt on thursday , schröder said that the entire country sympathized with the affected families . " there were legal consequences across party lines , regarding youth protection , gun law and even school law , " schröder said , adding that though a few answers had been provided , the wounds inflicted by the dark day had still not healed . the chancellor however underlined that he was happy that the city had decided to hold on to the old school building , saying the revamping of the place was also a sign of national solidarity with the victims and the affected families . " a piece of normality has returned , " schroder said , warning however that one should n't expect too much from the reopened school .

they also warn against overestimating the beneficial , psychological impact of the renovation work symbolizing a new beginning . christiane alt , director of the gutenberg high school , who returned to her office some months ago , said many of the students are desperately hoping for a return to normal school life .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : election editorials : dw 's take opinion : dissolving the doubt opinion : greens must learn to let go the german fear of reform opinion : germany left behind europe -pipe- 29.08.2005 opinion : merkel 's turkish delight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel wants to offer turkey a " privileged partnership " chancellor candidate angela merkel has renewed her efforts to kibosh turkey 's bid to join the eu .
the dangerously misguided campaign exposes the worst side of germany 's conservatives , says dw-world 's marc young . with a victory by germany 's conservative opposition looking fairly certain when voters go to the polls next month , i 've been trying to accentuate the positive . i 've never been convinced that angela merkel , the leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will be a more zealous reformer than chancellor gerhard schröder has been , but i still hold out hope that the conservatives might be able to shake germany out of its current economic funk . i would have no problem with loosening some of the country 's job protection measures or lowering non-wage labor costs in an attempt to slash unemployment , as the cdu has occasionally mooted .
and at this point , i 'm not sure whether schröder - even if he managed a surprise comeback win - would be able to convince his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to back more radical measures to get europe 's largest economy back on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but just as i start thinking i can overlook some of the uglier aspects of her party 's platform , merkel decides to step up her campaign against turkey 's attempt eventually to join the european union .
on friday , merkel sent a letter to conservative eu heads of state ahead of a sept .
1 summit .
in it she renewed her call for the eu to offer ankara a downgraded " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . she wants to raise the issue at the meeting of european conservatives which will take place just before an informal meeting on thursday of eu foreign ministers , where accession negotiations with turkey - expected to open membership negotiations on oct .
3 - will be discussed . anti-islamic ? besides having a nasty whiff of anti-islamic sentiment - which is as contemptible as it is misplaced - the timing of merkel 's initiative smacks of pandering to darker anti-foreigner sentiment simply in order to fish for votes . sadly , this is n't the first time we 've seen this " fortress germany " mentality from the christian democrats .
this is the same party that brought us the horrible leitkultur debate about how germany need some sort of guiding teutonic culture instead of the healthy multiculturalism seen in most western democracies .
it is the same vein of german conservatism that is opposed to immigration and refuses to comprehend that german citizenship should be a matter of where someone is born and not whether they have german blood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara , turkey on monday 16 february 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister on monday rejected outright a proposition from german opposition leader angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than outright membership .
the biggest irony , of course , is that merkel does n't seem to realize that the moderate islamic ak party of turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan is simply a muslim version of her christian democratic union - a conservative party with its moral compass rooted in religion . merkel and others opposed to turkey joining the eu contend the country is too large and too poor to become a part of the 25-member bloc , which is already overstretched after its enlargement including most of eastern europe last year . now , i 'll be the first to admit that the eu needs some time to consolidate its recent expansion .
however , the current challenges facing europe are no argument against turkish membership .
first of all , turkish accession is realistically at least 15 years off .
that 's a long time and the prospect of eventual membership would be a driving force in pushing along the country 's modernization . the west needs turkey in the age of osama bin laden and al qaeda , europe - and the rest of the world - need turkey as a prosperous , peaceful and democratic muslim nation .
so long as other islamic nations are either politically oppressed or outright hostile to western ideals , the worst thing the eu could do is push turkey away . it shocks me that merkel and others opposed to its bid do n't seem to realize the potential danger a jilted turkey could pose as reactionary and anti-reformist forces were strengthened .
does europe really want a hostile nation supporting an extreme form of islam at its doorstep ? clearly , turkey has a lot of work to do politically , economically and socially before it has a serious chance of joining europe 's elite club .
the country must continue to improve its human rights record and it needs to strengthen its protection of minority rights for its large kurdish population .
but engagement by the eu is the best guarantor that the country will continue down the path of reform . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election editorials : dw 's take all of dw-world 's election 2005 opinion pieces .
conservatives say no to turkey again in a letter to conservative eu heads of state ahead of a sept .

the list was published by the french civil aviation authority , dgac , on its internet site monday .
most of the interdictions had already been made in 2004 ; the air koryo interdiction goes as far back as april 2001 .
' black mo n th ' of august the blacklist is france 's reaction to the " black month " of august , which to date has seen five bad airline accidents and more than 330 resultant deaths .
a week ago , a west caribean airways plane crashed in venezuela en route to the french caribbean island of martinique , causing 160 deaths of which 152 were french citizens .

so far , france is the third european country , after great britain and sweden , to publicize its own blacklist for airlines .
belgium has also announced plans to publish its own list .
britain not only forbids certain airlines from flying to the country , it disallows planes or airlines from entire countries on the grounds that they do not implement security measures strictly enough .
these countries include the democratic republic of congo , equatorial guinea , liberia , sierra leone , swaziland and tajikistan .
the swiss civil aviation authority said it will publish its own list on thursday .
eu list slated for year e n d in publishing its list , france beat the european union to the punch .
the eu plans to have prepared a european-wide list of banned airlines by the end of 2005 .
candidates for the list are currently being discussed in the european parliament , but no fast date has been set for publication of the list .
bildunterschrift : the west caribbean airways plane that crashed in the mountains of western venezuela in august " we hope the list will be adopted very soon , late this year or early next year , " european commission spokesman rupert krietemeyer said recently at a briefing .
but while the eu 's 25 member states agreed in april to the idea of eventually publishing the names of banned airlines , they disagree on what criteria to use for drawing up such a list .
" we have to set common criteria at the european level , " said an official at the european commission .
airli n e i n dustry doubtful for its part , the aviation industry is skeptical about the effectiveness of blacklists .
such lists are usually based on already known security deficits or high accident rates .
therefore , it gives " the false impression that those who are not on the list are entirely safe , " according to lufthansa manager carsten spohr .
" even bad airlines have safe flights on most days . "
bildunterschrift : tunisian airline wreck in italy , in august .
on an international level , airlines are currently not obligated to publicize security problems that have come to light .
thus the french authorities did not know that in columbia - the home of west caribbean airways - had imposed a fine on the airline for severe safety violations .
i n formatio n shari n g i n europe in europe , the situation is different .
the european civil aviation conference -lrb- ecac -rrb- has begun a control and warning system for airlines .
" if a national aviation authority finds technical defects during a random control , that information goes into a data bank and the information then goes out to the other member countries , " said cornelia eichhorn , speaker for the german aviation authority .
then each nation can decide for itself whether to restrict that airline 's landing rights .
but the main problem in putting together blacklists is unlikely to be affected by european cooperation .
each individual airline 's safety can only be effectively tested by its own country .
in terms of the safety of foreign carriers , european officials need to rely on the individual country 's safety regulators and their own controls . sebastian ertinger -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu airlines blacklist easier said than done a series of airplane crashes has spurred european countries to ban airlines deemed unsafe , although drawing up an eu-wide list of trouble-plagued carriers - as the eu 's executive commission wants - is proving elusive .

the dangerously misguided campaign exposes the worst side of germany 's conservatives , says dw-world 's marc young . with a victory by germany 's conservative opposition looking fairly certain when voters go to the polls next month , i 've been trying to accentuate the positive . i 've never been convinced that angela merkel , the leader of the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , will be a more zealous reformer than chancellor gerhard schröder has been , but i still hold out hope that the conservatives might be able to shake germany out of its current economic funk . i would have no problem with loosening some of the country 's job protection measures or lowering non-wage labor costs in an attempt to slash unemployment , as the cdu has occasionally mooted .
and at this point , i 'm not sure whether schröder - even if he managed a surprise comeback win - would be able to convince his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to back more radical measures to get europe 's largest economy back on track . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but just as i start thinking i can overlook some of the uglier aspects of her party 's platform , merkel decides to step up her campaign against turkey 's attempt eventually to join the european union .
on friday , merkel sent a letter to conservative eu heads of state ahead of a sept .
1 summit .
in it she renewed her call for the eu to offer ankara a downgraded " privileged partnership " instead of full membership . she wants to raise the issue at the meeting of european conservatives which will take place just before an informal meeting on thursday of eu foreign ministers , where accession negotiations with turkey - expected to open membership negotiations on oct .
3 - will be discussed . anti-islamic ? besides having a nasty whiff of anti-islamic sentiment - which is as contemptible as it is misplaced - the timing of merkel 's initiative smacks of pandering to darker anti-foreigner sentiment simply in order to fish for votes . sadly , this is n't the first time we 've seen this " fortress germany " mentality from the christian democrats .
this is the same party that brought us the horrible leitkultur debate about how germany need some sort of guiding teutonic culture instead of the healthy multiculturalism seen in most western democracies .
it is the same vein of german conservatism that is opposed to immigration and refuses to comprehend that german citizenship should be a matter of where someone is born and not whether they have german blood . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel and turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan address the media in ankara , turkey on monday 16 february 2004 .
turkey 's prime minister on monday rejected outright a proposition from german opposition leader angela merkel that turkey should make do with a " privileged partnership " with the european union rather than outright membership .
the biggest irony , of course , is that merkel does n't seem to realize that the moderate islamic ak party of turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan is simply a muslim version of her christian democratic union - a conservative party with its moral compass rooted in religion . merkel and others opposed to turkey joining the eu contend the country is too large and too poor to become a part of the 25-member bloc , which is already overstretched after its enlargement including most of eastern europe last year . now , i 'll be the first to admit that the eu needs some time to consolidate its recent expansion .
however , the current challenges facing europe are no argument against turkish membership .
first of all , turkish accession is realistically at least 15 years off .
that 's a long time and the prospect of eventual membership would be a driving force in pushing along the country 's modernization . the west needs turkey in the age of osama bin laden and al qaeda , europe - and the rest of the world - need turkey as a prosperous , peaceful and democratic muslim nation .
so long as other islamic nations are either politically oppressed or outright hostile to western ideals , the worst thing the eu could do is push turkey away . it shocks me that merkel and others opposed to its bid do n't seem to realize the potential danger a jilted turkey could pose as reactionary and anti-reformist forces were strengthened .
does europe really want a hostile nation supporting an extreme form of islam at its doorstep ? clearly , turkey has a lot of work to do politically , economically and socially before it has a serious chance of joining europe 's elite club .
the country must continue to improve its human rights record and it needs to strengthen its protection of minority rights for its large kurdish population .
but engagement by the eu is the best guarantor that the country will continue down the path of reform . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : election editorials : dw 's take all of dw-world 's election 2005 opinion pieces .

the train operator announced in june that it was to withdraw smoking compartments in response to feedback from its customers .
it said research showed more than 90 % of its passengers do not smoke and that most wanted smoking on trains to end .
the company said customer complaints had risen by 172 % over the past two years and it followed similar bans by other public transport operators .
gner has been running a communications campaign , including posters and announcements on trains , to make passengers aware of the changes .
when the ban was announced , gner chief operating officer jonathan metcalfe said : " up until now we have tried hard to accommodate the diminishing number of people who wish to smoke whilst travelling with us .
good compromise " but it is now very clear that the majority of our passengers are in favour of a total ban on smoking on our trains .
" we have responded accordingly . "
the rail passenger committee 's east coast passengers panel said it welcomed the move .
simon clark , director of smokers ' lobby group forest , said the move was not unexpected .
he said it was a shame because gner was the last train company with smoking compartments and that they had seemed a good compromise .
the company runs services on the east coast main line between london kings cross , the east midlands , yorkshire and humberside , the north east of england and scotland .

researchers moved a tiny droplet of water along a surface , and even up a slope , using only light sensitive molecules .
they said it means that an age where laser beams are used to lift objects up and move them around could be closer than previously thought .
the machines used were 80,000 times thinner than a hair 's breadth .
it is the first time nanotechnology has been used to move an object large enough to be seen by the naked eye .
in the short term we 're thinking of ' lab on a chip ' technologies prof david leigh team members stressed that the research was in its early stages .
professor david leigh told bbc radio 's good morning scotland programme : " getting things from the lab to the real world is a major hurdle and what we 've been able to demonstrate is that artificial molecular machines can be interfaced with , and perform a physical task in , our everyday world .
" in the short term we 're thinking of ' lab on a chip ' technologies , where we move a droplet of liquid around on a silicon chip and it can be used for many different sorts of tests . "
but he said in future it is hoped to be able to move much larger , more solid objects , using something as simple as a laser point .
there are high hopes for the future of nanotechnology in the future , the technology could lead to artificial muscles being built and the creation of surfaces that change their shape in response to light or electricity .
nanotech manipulates molecules , and even atoms , to make novel materials .
the precision engineering exploits unusual electrical , optical and other properties - and the global race is on to develop the potential of the science .
a human hair is about 80,000 nanometres wide , while one nanometre is about a million times smaller than the diameter of a pinhead .
nanoscale coatings are used to make stronger tennis rackets , clothes that are stain resistant , and windows that clean themselves .
however , the emerging science has its critics .

researchers moved a tiny droplet of water along a surface , and even up a slope , using only light sensitive molecules .
they said it means that an age where laser beams are used to lift objects up and move them around could be closer than previously thought .
the machines used were 80,000 times thinner than a hair 's breadth .
it is the first time nanotechnology has been used to move an object large enough to be seen by the naked eye . "
in the short term we 're thinking of ' lab on a chip ' technologies " prof david leigh team members stressed that the research was in its early stages .
professor david leigh told bbc radio 's good morning scotland programme : " getting things from the lab to the real world is a major hurdle and what we 've been able to demonstrate is that artificial molecular machines can be interfaced with , and perform a physical task in , our everyday world .
" in the short term we 're thinking of ' lab on a chip ' technologies , where we move a droplet of liquid around on a silicon chip and it can be used for many different sorts of tests . "
but he said in future it is hoped to be able to move much larger , more solid objects , using something as simple as a laser point .
in the future , the technology could lead to artificial muscles being built and the creation of surfaces that change their shape in response to light or electricity .
nanotech manipulates molecules , and even atoms , to make novel materials .
the precision engineering exploits unusual electrical , optical and other properties - and the global race is on to develop the potential of the science .
a human hair is about 80,000 nanometres wide , while one nanometre is about a million times smaller than the diameter of a pinhead .
nanoscale coatings are used to make stronger tennis rackets , clothes that are stain resistant , and windows that clean themselves .
however , the emerging science has its critics .
one organisation , the etc group , wants more commitment to the possible risks of nanotech already in use .

it 's not easy , but such is the state of northern ireland politics that anyone who sets out to poke fun at the situation there needs a finely tuned sense of humour - and a strong nerve .
for the past four-and-a-half years that 's been the role of newton emerson , editor and sole writer of the portadown news .
do n't be fooled by the title , the portadown news is not a local paper but a sharply satirical website that has become something of an institution among locals and ex-pats .
former unionist leader david trimble was a reader , says emerson , and a print out is even said to have landed on tony blair 's desk .
farewell in a region still characterised by the centuries-old divide between protestants and catholics , emerson , 35 , has injected some much-needed humour into the political scene .
but his followers will have to look elsewhere after emerson 's decision to " decommission " the site , having been offered a column in a " real newspaper " .
so it 's farewell to stories such as the one from a recent edition about the baffling state of competing loyalist paramilitary groups : " police in east belfast have refused to tackle a uvf mob which is tackling an lvf mob which police refused to tackle . "

"
" i think it 's served its purpose , " says emerson .
" i 've said all i can say in this format and face the risk of repeating myself . "
humour and politics are never natural stable mates at the best of times , but in northern ireland they seem almost mutually exclusive .
so what inspired emerson to start the site in 2001 ?
" i 'd been living in my home town of portadown and for nine years we 'd had this drumcree stand-off , " he says referring to the annual july march by protestants that had , periodically , ended in sectarian rioting .
" like most people i was annoyed with these groups who had completely destroyed my town - the night life , the commercial life .
that was where the frustration came from .
" i started it as a joke , for a few friends , " he says .
but within a couple of months a local paper , sniffing controversy , seized on it .
suddenly visitor numbers to the site rocketed to about 10,000 and have hovered around that mark ever since .
" it got into all the papers around the world .
i think there were a lot of journalists looking for a new angle on the stupid , boring drumcree story . "
reprisals but emerson , who is from a protestant background , was still dipping his toe in the pool .
despite mocking both sides in equal measure , he remained anonymous , fearing reprisals .
" that 's how we thought it worked in northern ireland , but it turns out when you do something like this , nobody really has a go at you at all .
" i 'm not saying real journalists are safe .
but the days when you could n't stick your head above the parapet are gone . "
emerson used humour as a shield .
" the worst thing you can say about anyone in northern ireland is that they ca n't take a slagging .

it 's what saved me .
if i 'd been making the points i have been in standard prose form , i 'd have been sued and shot and had my arse kicked a hundred times over .
you 're protected if you 're cracking a joke i think . "
that 's not to say he is n't threatened , on average a new threat against him is e-mailed or posted on the web every couple of months .
but he has relaxed , saying : " a sports reporter would get more than that . "
puncturing pomposity by and large though , public figures have tolerated him , shaking his hand " through gritted teeth " when they would " prefer to wring my neck " .
emerson views northern ireland politics as patently absurd .
" part of the reason portadown news has been so easy to write down the years is that when you have parish pump politicians swanning around world capitals , appearing on cnn and demanding to be treated as if they are international political leaders ... the absurdity and pomposity of that is just a total gift to comedy . "
but how does he judge the humour in what can still be a bitterly divided community ?
it would have been " difficult to write something like the portadown news when people were dying in large numbers " .
" the murder of robert mccartney was not amusing at all , " he says , setting out his stall .
" you simply wait a little while until the political hypocrisy emerges and then the hypocritical responses that follow , and so forth .

a small , grilled window is the only source of fresh air .
a fluorescent tube above lights what is otherwise a dark and dingy hut .
it is midday but divya has no time to rest .
she has to ensure that the threads are ready for the weaver to make an intricate design on a green silk sari .
" i have been working for the last three years .
earlier i earned 150 rupees -lrb- around $ 3 -rrb- a month .
in the last one year my new employer is paying 200 rupees -lrb- over $ 4 -rrb- a month , " said divya .
" i do not want to do this .
i want to go to school but my parents have borrowed 5000 rupees -lrb- $ 111 -rrb- from the loom owner .
i have to work . "
bonded labourers divya 's parents are masons .
driven by poverty they borrowed money from a loom owner and in return started sending their daughter to work on his loom .
she has been working for three years .
but the loan and its interest never get repaid .
poor and illiterate weavers remain at the mercy of employers .
social action movement -lrb- sam -rrb- - a charity based in kanchipuram - is working to eradicate child labour .
" it is claimed that children are employed because of their nimble fingers .
that is not true .
they are being exploited and paid very low wages .
they are bonded labourers , " t raj , project co-ordinator of sam , told the bbc .
divya is not alone .
it is estimated that there are around 10,000 children in the districts of kanchipuram and thiruvannamalai in tamil nadu work in the silk industry .
there are over 100,000 looms set up in individual homes on which these famous silk saris are woven .
many of these saris cost several thousand rupees .
these looms are located in individual households and most of them employ at least one child .
these children work every day of the week for up to 10 hours a day .
