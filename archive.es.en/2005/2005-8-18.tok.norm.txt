angela merkel has announced she wants to appoint radical tax reform advocate paul kirchhof as finance minister if her party wins on sept .

it could radically remake german fiscal policy , conservative supporters say . when cdu leader and chancellor candidate angela merkel picked paul kirchhof , a heidelberg university professor and former constitutional court judge , as her top finance adviser wednesday , she signaled that she was ready to move towards radical reform .
" if it is up to me and the coalition talks allow it , he will become finance minister , " merkel said during a campaign stop .
kirchhof , 62 , is best known for a tax reform proposal he presented in 2003 which calls for a flat 25 percent tax for corporations and individuals .
but many financial experts and politicians criticize the choice because kirchhof , they say , is a political novice and lacks the cdu party connections to run the finance ministry effectively .
merkel 's plans could be derailed if bavarian premier edmund stoiber or a member of the free democrats , the likely coalition partner , lay claim to the portfolio .
the post is considered critical because of germany 's fight to cut its debt and lower its deficit .
must set good example kirchhof told the mass-circulation newspaper bild that if elected , the conservatives would bring the german budget deficit below the european union 's limit of three percent of gdp in the " near future . "
he also said that germany must again set a good financial example for europe .
bildunterschrift : angela 's a-team " i am convinced that government debt is currently the most dramatic problem we face , " he said .
" it 's simply obscene to pass this fundamental burden on to future generations . "
germany breached the eu stability pact rules for the third time last year and is expected to do so again 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.08.2005 german cars overtaken in eco-race großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not all environmentally sound , but which are the culprits ?
it 's might be hard to believe , but the great master of vorsprung durch technik , the german automobile industry , is no longer in pole position in the race to make modern cars more environmentally friendly . a study published on wednesday by germany 's automobile club , vcd , revealed that japan and france have their feet to the floor when it comes to environmental matters , and have left german car manufacturers spluttering in their wake . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the smart car is too small to do too much damage the vcd have been assessing anti-pollution merits of popular cars since 1989 , and the findings from their most recent review were the worst ever for germany , which only managed to squeeze one model , the opel corsa eco 1.0 into the top ten . and even that only made it into sixth place on the ranking table . it 's bad news for germany , which is currently still ruled in part by the green party , and which has long nurtured its reputation for being environmentally altruistic . bad boy volkswagen the vcd was particularly harsh in its criticism of the peoples ' favorite , volkswagen , for not installing a particle-filter to counter diesel soot in its best-selling model , the golf . " german manufacturers face the prospect of losing touch with environmental technology , " said deputy vcd chairman , hermann-josef vogt .
and the upshot of that , says the report , is that germany could lose credibility as a centre of automobile technology , subsequently become less competitive and having to shed jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can environmental technology keep up with the cars ?
the comments were met with roaring disapproval from the german association of the automotive industry , vda , which delivered a vitriolic response , accusing the automobile club of being a " smorgasbord of smug , self-important people with no substance " and describing the report as being " disproportionately out of touch with reality . " so exactly what is the reality ?
simply that toyota tops the list - which measures cars for both economic virtue and emission levels - with its no frills prius 1 , and that citroen , peugeot and daihatsu are hotter on its wheels than any german make . missed opportunity a spokesman for the vcd said it need not have been that way , and that volkswagen could have pipped toyota to the post had it concentrated less on honing its super-speed luxury limos and simply installed standard-issue filters in its audi 2 and lupo model , which have now been withdrawn from the market . # b # the spokesman , gerd lottsiepen , said that without the filter , diesel cars were " yesterday 's technology " , and a clear statement from the makers that they do n't care about the health of their customers . solicitousness was higher in the compact car category , which featured two appearances each from mercedes and opel and one from audi , but there was again a conspicuous absence of german names on the list of family models .
vw just managed to roll onto the bottom of the table at tenth place with its golf 2.0 variant bifuel . that 's not good enough for lottsiepen , who says it is time for the government , however it may look following the elections , to introduce tax benefits on cars which are equipped with today 's technology . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers move on diesel filters the eu 's new clean air law and hesitant consumers are causing german carmakers to scramble to equip diesel cars with soot filters as several german cities have reached pollution levels that require driving bans .
-lrb- march 30 , 2005 -rrb- german cars still stars ... for now in germany , it used to be that you knew you 'd made it in life when you bought your first mercedes .
but as affordable foreign cars offer consumers an attractive alternative , how long will this still be the case ?

but environmental groups themselves are n't so sure .

it 's might be hard to believe , but the great master of vorsprung durch technik , the german automobile industry , is no longer in pole position in the race to make modern cars more environmentally friendly . a study published on wednesday by germany 's automobile club , vcd , revealed that japan and france have their feet to the floor when it comes to environmental matters , and have left german car manufacturers spluttering in their wake . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the smart car is too small to do too much damage the vcd have been assessing anti-pollution merits of popular cars since 1989 , and the findings from their most recent review were the worst ever for germany , which only managed to squeeze one model , the opel corsa eco 1.0 into the top ten . and even that only made it into sixth place on the ranking table . it 's bad news for germany , which is currently still ruled in part by the green party , and which has long nurtured its reputation for being environmentally altruistic . bad boy volkswagen the vcd was particularly harsh in its criticism of the peoples ' favorite , volkswagen , for not installing a particle-filter to counter diesel soot in its best-selling model , the golf . " german manufacturers face the prospect of losing touch with environmental technology , " said deputy vcd chairman , hermann-josef vogt .
and the upshot of that , says the report , is that germany could lose credibility as a centre of automobile technology , subsequently become less competitive and having to shed jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can environmental technology keep up with the cars ?
the comments were met with roaring disapproval from the german association of the automotive industry , vda , which delivered a vitriolic response , accusing the automobile club of being a " smorgasbord of smug , self-important people with no substance " and describing the report as being " disproportionately out of touch with reality . " so exactly what is the reality ?
simply that toyota tops the list - which measures cars for both economic virtue and emission levels - with its no frills prius 1 , and that citroen , peugeot and daihatsu are hotter on its wheels than any german make . missed opportunity a spokesman for the vcd said it need not have been that way , and that volkswagen could have pipped toyota to the post had it concentrated less on honing its super-speed luxury limos and simply installed standard-issue filters in its audi 2 and lupo model , which have now been withdrawn from the market . # b # the spokesman , gerd lottsiepen , said that without the filter , diesel cars were " yesterday 's technology " , and a clear statement from the makers that they do n't care about the health of their customers . solicitousness was higher in the compact car category , which featured two appearances each from mercedes and opel and one from audi , but there was again a conspicuous absence of german names on the list of family models .
vw just managed to roll onto the bottom of the table at tenth place with its golf 2.0 variant bifuel . that 's not good enough for lottsiepen , who says it is time for the government , however it may look following the elections , to introduce tax benefits on cars which are equipped with today 's technology . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers move on diesel filters the eu 's new clean air law and hesitant consumers are causing german carmakers to scramble to equip diesel cars with soot filters as several german cities have reached pollution levels that require driving bans .
-lrb- march 30 , 2005 -rrb- german cars still stars ... for now in germany , it used to be that you knew you 'd made it in life when you bought your first mercedes .
but as affordable foreign cars offer consumers an attractive alternative , how long will this still be the case ?

on wednesday night , coach jürgen klinsmann ’ s side faced their arch rivals the netherlands in rotterdam . with the netherlands currently ranked third in the world and germany ranked 11th german coach jürgen klinsmann knew his side faced a stiff task in the cauldron of rotterdam ’ s de kuip stadium .
the match finished in a 2-2 draw , a rather flattering result for the german side .
the dutch are spoilt for choice when it comes to world-class strikers and could allow themswelves to leave bayern munich ’ s striker roy makaay on the bench in the first half with ruud van nistelroy and arjen robben up front .
veteran defender christian wörns was recalled to the german side along with didi hamann to help sure up germany ’ s weak defense with midfielder bernd schneider playing at left back .
dutch coach van basten is a shrewd man , noticed schneider was playing out of position and switched arjen robben to the right wing to trouble schneider ... this move paid dividends early on as the dutch took a third minute lead through chelsea striker robben .
at half-time germany could count themselves lucky to be only one goal down as the dutch wasted several golden opportunities .
one minute into the second half though germany found themselves two goals down . again the scorer was arjen robben .
the game looked over .
klinsmann ’ s biggest defeat ?
jürgen klinsmann , the striker-turned coach was solely responsible for germany 's last victory over the oranje by converting a penalty for a 1-0 win in 1996 - also in rotterdam .
but on wednesday night , he looked as if he would be suffering his worst defeat as coach .
but michael ballack had other ideas and quickly pulled a goal back for germany with a diving header .
yet it was still the dutch magicians who were playing the beautiful football but who continued to squander chance after chance , hitting the crossbar twice .
suddenly germany broke and after good work by tim borowski , substitute gerald asamoah came in on the right to squeeze the ball over the line from an sharp angle .
2-2 was the final score . a typical german comeback and totally against the run of play .
while germany were delighted to equalise their miserable run against the big nations continues and it is 15 games since they defeated a recognised top team .

on wednesday night , coach jürgen klinsmann ’ s side faced their arch rivals the netherlands in rotterdam . with the netherlands currently ranked third in the world and germany ranked 11th german coach jürgen klinsmann knew his side faced a stiff task in the cauldron of rotterdam ’ s de kuip stadium .
the match finished in a 2-2 draw , a rather flattering result for the german side .
the dutch are spoilt for choice when it comes to world-class strikers and could allow themswelves to leave bayern munich ’ s striker roy makaay on the bench in the first half with ruud van nistelroy and arjen robben up front .
veteran defender christian wörns was recalled to the german side along with didi hamann to help sure up germany ’ s weak defense with midfielder bernd schneider playing at left back .
dutch coach van basten is a shrewd man , noticed schneider was playing out of position and switched arjen robben to the right wing to trouble schneider ... this move paid dividends early on as the dutch took a third minute lead through chelsea striker robben .
at half-time germany could count themselves lucky to be only one goal down as the dutch wasted several golden opportunities .
one minute into the second half though germany found themselves two goals down . again the scorer was arjen robben .
the game looked over .
klinsmann ’ s biggest defeat ?
jürgen klinsmann , the striker-turned coach was solely responsible for germany 's last victory over the oranje by converting a penalty for a 1-0 win in 1996 - also in rotterdam .
but on wednesday night , he looked as if he would be suffering his worst defeat as coach .
but michael ballack had other ideas and quickly pulled a goal back for germany with a diving header .
yet it was still the dutch magicians who were playing the beautiful football but who continued to squander chance after chance , hitting the crossbar twice .
suddenly germany broke and after good work by tim borowski , substitute gerald asamoah came in on the right to squeeze the ball over the line from an sharp angle .
2-2 was the final score . a typical german comeback and totally against the run of play .
while germany were delighted to equalise their miserable run against the big nations continues and it is 15 games since they defeated a recognised top team .

the disaster came only days after a cypriot airplane hit a hillside near athens , taking the lives of 121 passengers , most of whom were cypriots . earlier this month a tunisian-operated charter plane crash landed at sea off the sicilian coast killing 13 people , including 12 italians . in reaction to the crash in venezuela , eu transportation officials have called for tougher safety measures . " this accident … shows that we must collectively step up efforts to ensure the highest level of air transport security in europe and shelter all of the -lrb- european -rrb- union 's passengers and crew from such dramas , " said eu transport commissioner jacques barrot . beefing up checks in january 2004 , the crash in egypt of a boeing airliner operated by flash airlines , which killed 148 people , spurred the eu into action after years of negotiations and led to a beefing-up of safety checks on non-eu airplanes at airports in member states . the transport commissioner at the time , loyola de palacio , was quick to say that the flash airlines accident probably would never have happened had the rules been in place before the crash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent air disasters are spurring a new look at air safety in 1994 , the eu made it a requirement after air accidents that a technical probe be carried out by a body independent of the national civil aviation authorities . but like many eu rules , this one has not always been followed by all member states .
in july , the european commission scolded cyprus for not having adopted the regulation when it joined the bloc on may 1 of last year . expanding duties on tuesday , transport commissioner barrot called for more monitoring : " the european commission will strictly watch over the full application of existing measures and -lrb- those -rrb- under preparation to ensure ... the security of all european flights , including from third countries at departure or to destinations in member states . " the commissioner aims to extend in the coming months the responsibilities of the european aviation safety agency -lrb- easa -rrb- , which currently issues airworthiness certificates for aeronautical products , parts and equipment . in particular , barrot wants to see the easa play a greater role in monitoring flight safety and the security of non-eu airlines , and in certifying crew members . bildunterschrift : before the crash in venezuela keeping passengers in the loop plans for regulations on keeping passengers informed about flights are also in the works . ahead of a first reading of the regulations by the european parliament , eu members agreed in principle in april that passengers be informed as soon as possible and , in any case , before take-off of changes in the airline operating a flight . the new rules also propose improved information exchange about grounded airlines , although belgium , france , germany and spain want more coordination on the criteria used to designate such carriers . new legislation a 2004 regulation on the safety of airplanes from non-eu members , which members have until may 2006 to adopt into their national legislation , opens the way for an eu-wide flight ban if such a ban has been declared by a single member state . however , an extension of the regulation would have to be proposed by the european commission and backed by a qualified majority of member states , which tend to jealously hold on to their authority to authorize flights . the lack of eu-wide coordination sparked chaos in may when thousands of passengers were left stranded after a ban on turkish carrier onur air - by france , germany , the netherlands and switzerland - until their flights were finally rerouted via belgium . blacklist possible the european commission is considering publishing a blacklist of airlines and aircraft subject to bans or restrictions in eu member states on the internet , barrot said wednesday . the european union blacklist idea is similar to a mechanism already operational in the united states , where would-be passengers can consult a website publishing the names of airlines with relatively poor safety records .

many of the young pilgrims in cologne this week have found new ways of living their religion , which sometimes involve ignoring official church doctrine . katja jarc knows fewer younger people are going to church .
the 18-year-old slovenian can see it every sunday when she single-handedly brings down parish 's average age .
" nearly everyone is at least 60 years old , " she said .
" it 's hard to find anyone my age there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims wait to enter the cologne cathedral finding more young people interested in religion is one of the reasons jarc decided to attend the world youth day event in cologne .
she 's achieved that goal , since there are some 400,000 young faithful who have come to cologne for prayer , song , revivals and some good old-fashioned partying .
the catholic festival also sent her on the pilgrimage of sorts even after she arrived in this city on the rhine .
this second pilgrimage was shorter , however , than the long trip from slovenia .
this one started at the river 's edge and ended at cologne 's famous cathedral .
" here there are so many friendly people who are interested in church and prayer , " she said as groups passed by .
some people were waving national flags ; others whispered the rosary in a handful of different languages .
" i want to meet as many people like me as i can here in cologne . "
covering a distance of about two kilometers -lrb- 1.2 miles -rrb- , the pilgrimage is intended to represent the three wise men 's search for god .
world youth day organizers have recommended all visitors take the walk before visiting the shrine to the biblical kings inside the cathedral .
differing view of church 's teaching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young catholics have their own ideas about faith though the 400,000 pilgrims from some 120 different countries are united by a single faith at the catholic festival , the young people 's interpretation of their religion tends to differ , especially when it comes to personal issues like contraception and abortion .
" something is n't right when there are so many devout believers in africa and lots of them end up dying of aids , " said daniela gall , 18 , who lives near munich .
but the church should n't just sway with the mores of the day either , according to bryan brochu of alberta , canada .
" one of the strengths of the church is that it does n't change every time society wants it to , " said brochu , 21 , as speakers played recordings of the hail mary in german , english , french and italian .
" there are people who say the church is too old school , but i think it should stick to its values and traditions . "
admitting that he is not overly religious , tobias straub , 18 , came to the world youth day at the urging of his priest at home in bavaria who told him to look at the church 's teachings as a lighthouse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pilgrimage continues outside the cathedral " there are times you really need some direction and other times you can go on your own , " he said as his group joined the parade snaking its way around the square outside the cathedral .
" people should decide for themselves . "
keeping youth interested catholicism should n't force all of its tenets on people who are looking for guidance since the church has bigger problems it should concentrate on , according to jarc .
" i think the church should concentrate more on finding ways to get more younger people interested in religion , " she said .
young people want to know the church is also taking them into consideration every day , not just when it 's organizing concerts along the rhine .
" i like the times when i can organize something like a mass or other meeting myself , " gall said .
" that and a great priest who helps us do what we want is what keeps me interested in the church 's youth group . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi will say mass for 800,000 on sunday in an interview with vatican radio , pope benedict xvi -lrb- photo -rrb- agreed that sparking interest in religion among youth is key to the world youth day 's success .
" if this zest , this joy , to know christ would come alive again and give the church in germany and europe a new dynamic , then i think the aim of world youth day would be achieved . "
according to jarc , the songs , prayers and chants of " hey , hey benito " heard along the pilgrims ' trail show that a spark has already been lit .
now it 's up to the church and the pilgrims to keep it from going out , she said .
" the world youth day is great , " she added .
" but it 's only one week . "

many of the young pilgrims in cologne this week have found new ways of living their religion , which sometimes involve ignoring official church doctrine . katja jarc knows fewer younger people are going to church .

the catholic festival also sent her on the pilgrimage of sorts even after she arrived in this city on the rhine .
this second pilgrimage was shorter , however , than the long trip from slovenia .
this one started at the river 's edge and ended at cologne 's famous cathedral .

some people were waving national flags ; others whispered the rosary in a handful of different languages .
" i want to meet as many people like me as i can here in cologne . "
covering a distance of about two kilometers -lrb- 1.2 miles -rrb- , the pilgrimage is intended to represent the three wise men 's search for god .
world youth day organizers have recommended all visitors take the walk before visiting the shrine to the biblical kings inside the cathedral .

young people want to know the church is also taking them into consideration every day , not just when it 's organizing concerts along the rhine .
" i like the times when i can organize something like a mass or other meeting myself , " gall said .
" that and a great priest who helps us do what we want is what keeps me interested in the church 's youth group . "

" if this zest , this joy , to know christ would come alive again and give the church in germany and europe a new dynamic , then i think the aim of world youth day would be achieved . "
according to jarc , the songs , prayers and chants of " hey , hey benito " heard along the pilgrims ' trail show that a spark has already been lit .
now it 's up to the church and the pilgrims to keep it from going out , she said .
" the world youth day is great , " she added .

german regulators are launching an investigation regarding possible insider dealings of daimlerchrysler 's shares .
the german-us company is already being probed on bribery charges in the us . suspecting possible insider trading and stock manipulation following the publicized resignation of daimlerchrysler 's chief executive jürgen schrempp on july 28 , the german federal agency for financial supervision -lrb- bafin -rrb- announced it was launching an official investigation . " we have launched a formal inquiry , " said the the bafin spokesperson sabine reimer on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schrempp 's resignation was announced on july 28 a formal inquiry means that financial institutions are required by law to disclose the names of all those involved in securities transactions .
purchasing or selling shares while privy to information which is not publicly available is considered illegal according to the german law . " we will find out from the credit institution who bought and who sold the shares , " said reimer . " then we 'll try to find cross-links to the people who knew about schrempp 's plans , " she said . the investigation is expected to take several weeks .
a spokesperson for daimlerchrysler , the world 's second largest producer of luxury vehicles , offered no comments . more than a coincidence ? after jürgen schrempp 's resignation was announced , daimlerchrysler shares rose dramatically - by nine percent in frankfurt and almost ten percent in new york .
the rise was the steepest intraday gain posted in the company 's history .
more than 61 million shares were traded on that day , 10 times the average volume . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schrempp 's successor , dieter zetsche schrempp , who was responsible for the $ 36 billion takeover of chrysler corp. in 1998 , had been severely criticized for eroding more than 30 percent of the company value since the merger .
he will succeeded by head of chrysler , dieter zetsche . jürgen grässlin , president of a minority shareholders group that owns 1.5 % of daimlerchrysler , said shortly after schrempp 's resignation that " insider trade has opened the floodgates . "
grässlin claims to have known of the forthcoming resignation twelve days before it was officially announced . " if we , the shareholders , had invested into daimlerchrysler at that point , we would 've made ourselves rich , " said grässlin . parallel investigations daimlerchrysler is currently pursuing legal action against grässlin for spreading false information .
grässlin has denied the charges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark clouds over daimlerchrysler yet several daimlerchrysler executives have indeed sold their shares since schrempp 's resignation was made public .
eckhard hordes , who heads the mercedes division , acquired 92,500 shares at 34.40 euros on july 29 , only to sell them at 39.58 euros on the same day . the german-us concern is currently under investigation by the us regulators and department of justice over alleged bribery of foreign officials .

computer games are big business in germany as the games convention in leipzig proves . for the next four days , avid computer fans can feast their insatiable appetites on a stunning array of state-of-the-art entertainment in an event which promises not to disappoint . thursday was the first day of the computer games convention , but even before the gates were thrown open , hundreds of eager fans had gathered outside in a bid to be among the first to size up the latest in computer game technology . bildunterschrift : visitors to the convention it calls itself " europe 's leading trade fair for interactive entertainment , infotainment and edutainment " , and with 280 exhibitors from 15 countries and some 110,000 visitors expected to show up , organisers could just be justified in blowing their event 's own trumpet . but just what is it that drives so many thousands of people into the loud lap of video entertainment when they could be outside creating their own in the sudden burst of summer sunshine ? fact is , there 's more to the event than row upon row of 21st century blow-your-mind , blow-up-the-world type games , which large slices of the general public still believe to be synonymous with computer-generated entertainment .

angela merkel has announced she wants to appoint radical tax reform advocate paul kirchhof as finance minister if her party wins on sept .
18 .
it could radically remake german fiscal policy , conservative supporters say . when cdu leader and chancellor candidate angela merkel picked paul kirchhof , a heidelberg university professor and former constitutional court judge , as her top finance adviser wednesday , she signaled that she was ready to move towards radical reform .
" if it is up to me and the coalition talks allow it , he will become finance minister , " merkel said during a campaign stop .
kirchhof , 62 , is best known for a tax reform proposal he presented in 2003 which calls for a flat 25 percent tax for corporations and individuals .
but many financial experts and politicians criticize the choice because kirchhof , they say , is a political novice and lacks the cdu party connections to run the finance ministry effectively .
merkel 's plans could be derailed if bavarian premier edmund stoiber or a member of the free democrats , the likely coalition partner , lay claim to the portfolio .
the post is considered critical because of germany 's fight to cut its debt and lower its deficit .
must set good example kirchhof told the mass-circulation newspaper bild that if elected , the conservatives would bring the german budget deficit below the european union 's limit of three percent of gdp in the " near future . "
he also said that germany must again set a good financial example for europe .
bildunterschrift : angela 's a-team " i am convinced that government debt is currently the most dramatic problem we face , " he said .
" it 's simply obscene to pass this fundamental burden on to future generations . "
germany breached the eu stability pact rules for the third time last year and is expected to do so again 2005 .
this time , eu finance ministers may decide to penalize the country .
the conservatives have promised to get germany 's deficit below three percent by 2009 and balance the federal budget by 2013 . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's " dream team " conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel presented her so-called " competence team " on wednesday .

computer games are big business in germany as the games convention in leipzig proves . for the next four days , avid computer fans can feast their insatiable appetites on a stunning array of state-of-the-art entertainment in an event which promises not to disappoint . thursday was the first day of the computer games convention , but even before the gates were thrown open , hundreds of eager fans had gathered outside in a bid to be among the first to size up the latest in computer game technology . bildunterschrift : visitors to the convention it calls itself " europe 's leading trade fair for interactive entertainment , infotainment and edutainment " , and with 280 exhibitors from 15 countries and some 110,000 visitors expected to show up , organisers could just be justified in blowing their event 's own trumpet . but just what is it that drives so many thousands of people into the loud lap of video entertainment when they could be outside creating their own in the sudden burst of summer sunshine ? fact is , there 's more to the event than row upon row of 21st century blow-your-mind , blow-up-the-world type games , which large slices of the general public still believe to be synonymous with computer-generated entertainment .
indeed , the organisers are promising something for everyone . family fair with an unprecedented 189 market premieres , including 52 from germany , 59 from europe and 98 from other parts of the world , it stands to be the most packed show in the trade fair 's short history , and although it will doubtless attract its fair share of die-hard gamers , there 's also a whole arm of the event dedicated to family entertainment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children and computers are no strange sight the convention 's family forum for media literacy , teaching and school software bills itself as a " special experience " for old and young . the convention has teamed up with leipzig university and media experts from academic to provide young computer users and their parents and teachers with invaluable information on how to overcome the choice paralysis brought on by the dazzling gamut of multimedia products available to even very young users . angela schierholz , who is a project director at the convention says manufacturers recognise the benefits of wooing their customers at the youngest possible age .

" welcome to germany , welcome home , " president köhler said . awaiting the 78-year-old pope are an estimated 400,000 young pilgrims gathered in the western german city of cologne . " that so many people have come to meet the successor of peter is a sign of the church 's vitality .
i am happy to be with them , confirm their faith and enliven their hope , " benedict xvi said upon arrival . crowds gathering on the rhine teeming masses of flag-waving young catholics lined the banks of the rhine waiting to catch their first glimpse of pope benedict xvi as he sailed up the river to join a global youth festival . " i will never forget this day , it was an awesome experience .
he seemed so full of joy as he waved to us , " said colleen ackerman , 25 , from cape town . for colleen and most of the crowd , it was their first view of a pope in the flesh and the man greeting them from the upper deck of the river cruiser did not disappoint .

a nato reconnaissance plane is protecting the air space over cologne during the catholic festival . around 4,000 police officers and thousands of private security personnel , 1,900 firefighters and 2,000 emergency medical workers are on duty .

" from 10 pm on , we had to occasionally close all access to the train station , " said a spokesperson for the cologne police .
" the crowds inside were unbelievable . " the traffic jam was caused by numerous pilgrims trying to return from festival events to their lodgings .
standing in long lines caused exhaustion and circulation problems for some pilgrims .
the situation normalized again around 2 am . a group of young french pilgrims who had made the trip to cologne said they were looking forward to seeing the new pope in the flesh . " the media have given us this image of a highly conservative man , but i am waiting to see what he says , " said thomas , 21 , from metz . forgetful pope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his mind was already in cologne , as was his image pope benedict xvi acknowledged wednesday that he was absent-minded after forgetting to bless the hundreds of pilgrims who attended his weekly audience at his castel gandolfo summer residence .
the crowd gathered in the palace courtyard was surprised to see the pope return to his window several moments after leaving after greeting pilgrims in several languages . " i ask for your forgiveness , but i have forgotten the most important greeting , the greeting to the pilgrims in the italian language , " he told them . he went back inside the palace , only to return again shortly . " today , i have forgotten the most important things .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.08.2005 a harder line on suspected extremists ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther beckstein wants zero tolerance for extremists if angela merkel becomes the next chancellor , günther beckstein will probably replace otto schilly as federal interior minister .
that could mean germany takes harsher measures against those deemed islamic militants . it 's the latest in a serious of no-nonsense actions from down south .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein announced thursday that he is expelling three more suspected islamic radicals .
this time , the three are members of a group called tablighi jamaat , which has about 450 members around germany and whose followers want to establish an islamic state , officials said .
german security officials have previously described the group as peaceful but said it could become infiltrated by radicals .
beckstein called them " missionaries " bent on spreading radical islam including the idea of " jihad , " or holy war , which encourages martyrdom through suicide attacks .
he added that bavaria would , with the expulsions , draw a clear and consistent line against " hate preachers " and suspected islamic militants .
" we want to make it clear to islamic extremists that the bavarian government wo n't tolerate anyone who wants to replace our free and democratic order with an islamic state , " he said in a statement .
the three , two bosnians and a moroccan , have until sept .
10 to leave or face deportation .
bavarians most aggressive since a new immigration law took effect in january , making it easier and faster to expel suspected islamic militants , bavaria has been quick to make the most of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber wants more action so far , the wealthy southern state has deported 16 people it suspected of militant activities , began proceedings on 26 more and moving on 10 more .
that is more than any of the other 15 german states so far , officials said .
it comes as little surprise .
a nationwide raid in january that led to the arrest of 22 suspected militants came after an investigation initiated by the bavarians .
soon after , beckstein said in a speech that more than 500 islamic extremists in germany " must be considered extremely dangerous " and that there are several thousand other fanatical muslims in the country .
his boss , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , has gone farther , saying that there are tens of thousands of radical muslims in germany , at least 4,000 of those he wants to deport for extremist activities .
increasing focus germany was forced to increase its efforts to clamp down on islamic radicals after it was discovered that the september 11 hijackers planned their attacks while living as students in hamburg .
last year , schilly said that the fight against islamic militants was a top priority .
as a result , the government established an anti-terror command headquarters in berlin .
on jan .
1 , the new immigration law which eases immigration for skilled workers also requires a detailed background check on every immigrant and eases the deportation of those designated " islamic hate preachers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan , the caliph of cologne , was extradited after a long process since then , the most recent extradition of an islamic militant was of metin kaplan to turkey for disseminating fundamentalist propaganda during his sermons .
kaplan had lived for decades in cologne .
deporting people is especially tricky for germany in light of its nazi legacy .
at the same time , germans worry about harboring extremists and populist sentiments by politicians such as stoiber against muslim immigrants suspected of radicalism appeal to many .
security experts applaud the stepped up efforts by the government to address extremism but still complain that too little has been done .
that will probably change with a new government - merkel has selected beckstein to replace schilly if she wins the election and his fervor for deporting suspected radicals could soon be felt on the federal level . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's arabs struggle to fit in germany is home to an estimated 280,000 people of arab extraction .

that could mean germany takes harsher measures against those deemed islamic militants . it 's the latest in a serious of no-nonsense actions from down south .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein announced thursday that he is expelling three more suspected islamic radicals .
this time , the three are members of a group called tablighi jamaat , which has about 450 members around germany and whose followers want to establish an islamic state , officials said .
german security officials have previously described the group as peaceful but said it could become infiltrated by radicals .
beckstein called them " missionaries " bent on spreading radical islam including the idea of " jihad , " or holy war , which encourages martyrdom through suicide attacks .
he added that bavaria would , with the expulsions , draw a clear and consistent line against " hate preachers " and suspected islamic militants .
" we want to make it clear to islamic extremists that the bavarian government wo n't tolerate anyone who wants to replace our free and democratic order with an islamic state , " he said in a statement .
the three , two bosnians and a moroccan , have until sept .
10 to leave or face deportation .
bavarians most aggressive since a new immigration law took effect in january , making it easier and faster to expel suspected islamic militants , bavaria has been quick to make the most of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber wants more action so far , the wealthy southern state has deported 16 people it suspected of militant activities , began proceedings on 26 more and moving on 10 more .
that is more than any of the other 15 german states so far , officials said .
it comes as little surprise .
a nationwide raid in january that led to the arrest of 22 suspected militants came after an investigation initiated by the bavarians .
soon after , beckstein said in a speech that more than 500 islamic extremists in germany " must be considered extremely dangerous " and that there are several thousand other fanatical muslims in the country .
his boss , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , has gone farther , saying that there are tens of thousands of radical muslims in germany , at least 4,000 of those he wants to deport for extremist activities .
increasing focus germany was forced to increase its efforts to clamp down on islamic radicals after it was discovered that the september 11 hijackers planned their attacks while living as students in hamburg .
last year , schilly said that the fight against islamic militants was a top priority .
as a result , the government established an anti-terror command headquarters in berlin .

deporting people is especially tricky for germany in light of its nazi legacy .
at the same time , germans worry about harboring extremists and populist sentiments by politicians such as stoiber against muslim immigrants suspected of radicalism appeal to many .
security experts applaud the stepped up efforts by the government to address extremism but still complain that too little has been done .

that could mean germany takes harsher measures against those deemed islamic militants . it 's the latest in a serious of no-nonsense actions from down south .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein announced thursday that he is expelling three more suspected islamic radicals .
this time , the three are members of a group called tablighi jamaat , which has about 450 members around germany and whose followers want to establish an islamic state , officials said .
german security officials have previously described the group as peaceful but said it could become infiltrated by radicals .
beckstein called them " missionaries " bent on spreading radical islam including the idea of " jihad , " or holy war , which encourages martyrdom through suicide attacks .
he added that bavaria would , with the expulsions , draw a clear and consistent line against " hate preachers " and suspected islamic militants .
" we want to make it clear to islamic extremists that the bavarian government wo n't tolerate anyone who wants to replace our free and democratic order with an islamic state , " he said in a statement .

that is more than any of the other 15 german states so far , officials said .
it comes as little surprise .
a nationwide raid in january that led to the arrest of 22 suspected militants came after an investigation initiated by the bavarians .
soon after , beckstein said in a speech that more than 500 islamic extremists in germany " must be considered extremely dangerous " and that there are several thousand other fanatical muslims in the country .
his boss , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , has gone farther , saying that there are tens of thousands of radical muslims in germany , at least 4,000 of those he wants to deport for extremist activities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.08.2005 germany , nation of reluctant strikers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " strike " , it says , but that 's easier said than done in germany .
german workers are renowned in industrial world circles for the cushy conditions upon which they luxuriously lounge .
but just how do they get them ?
not , it seems , by downing their tools and screaming injustice . in a study of strike culture in developed countries published last week by the institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- , german workers emerged as some of the most reluctant strikers .
the report , which observed walk-out tendencies in the 30 members of the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , revealed that between 1991 and 2000 , german workers notched up a meager 9.3 annual strike days per 1,000 employees .
only austrian , japanese and swiss employees recorded even greater committment to work , while at the other end of the scale , the number climbed surely and steadily to its canadian peak of 189 annual strike days within the same time frame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picket lines are a relative rarity in germany the discrepancy leaves room for considerable questions .
why is it that german workers , who are generally not afraid of grumbling about anything less than the best , rarely have to erect a picket line in order to get what they want ?
the answers , says jan jurczyk of the service industry trade union , verdi , are manifold .
“ in essence , it is not very easy to strike in germany .
we have a highly developed collective agreement system and strike action can only be taken in connection therewith , ” jurczyk said .
“ political strikes are not allowed and neither is industrial action organized by a small number of employees .
at least not legally . ”
heading the union call on the contrary , strikers can only become such if rallied to do so by their union , and even they have limited power to make that call .
the collective agreements , which cover things like pay , holiday , working hours and pensions , severely limit the opportunities for employees to walk out at all .
“ as long as the agreement is valid , which generally varies between one and two years , there can be no strikes .
and then after the contract between the union and employer has expired , there is still a grace period of several weeks in which there can also be no walk outs , ” jurczyk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no ballot , no strike and even when that period , known as a “ peace obligation ” is over , strike action must be endorsed by at least 75 percent of union members .
a further “ hurdle , ” says jurczyk , is the employers ’ right to enforce a lockout , in which the entire workforce , strikers and non-strikers alike , are barred from the premises .
strike action must be last resort the whole system is designed to discourage escalation of disputes at every turn , and to instead encourage communication between the voice of the employees , the unions , and the employers .
and it is well oiled .
dr. heiner dribbusch works for the institute for economic and social research -lrb- wsi -rrb- in the hans böckler foundation , which is a research institute related to the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- . he says that although when push comes to shove , german workers are willing to exercise their , albeit limited , right to strike , they use it sparingly .
and the same , he says , is true of the unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union-backed demonstrations precede industrial action “ unions are doubtless interested in having as few restrictions as possible , so they can be the ones who make the decisions , ” dribbusch said .
“ but that said , they don ’ t use every opportunity they have to strike , which suggests that they don ’ t want to . ”
and one good reason for that is the generous replacement wages which unions have to pay to their striking members .
“ unions are cautious when it comes to calling for industrial action , not least because of the expense of having to fork out strike money , ” jurczyk said .
“ employees get paid more or less the same by the unions as they receive in their basic pay packet , and in a large workforce , that can add up to huge amounts of money . ”
too good to remain true ?
like so many german systems , the strike prevention one is precisely structured and designed to be of some benefit to everyone concerned .
and for those who do enjoy a right to strike , which public servants in germany incidentally do not , it is a system which has , over the past half decade , proved its worth .
“ take the chemical industry , for example , it has only witnessed one strike since the end of the war .
many employees in germany will go through their working life never having experienced any industrial action , ” dribbusch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taste of things to come ?
but there are signs that things are changing .
in the current economic climate , the demand for employment far outstrips the supply , and jurczyk says that is affecting the way in which collective agreements are negotiated .
“ employers ’ associations have begun to react to employees ’ demands in a more aggressive way , and to respond to them with counter demands .
they 're using the levels of unemployment as a threat to the existing workforce , ” he said .
“ whether such behavior will lead to more strikes , we don ’ t know .
it hasn ’ t been decided yet . ” tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

german workers are renowned in industrial world circles for the cushy conditions upon which they luxuriously lounge .
but just how do they get them ?
not , it seems , by downing their tools and screaming injustice . in a study of strike culture in developed countries published last week by the institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- , german workers emerged as some of the most reluctant strikers .
the report , which observed walk-out tendencies in the 30 members of the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , revealed that between 1991 and 2000 , german workers notched up a meager 9.3 annual strike days per 1,000 employees .
only austrian , japanese and swiss employees recorded even greater committment to work , while at the other end of the scale , the number climbed surely and steadily to its canadian peak of 189 annual strike days within the same time frame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picket lines are a relative rarity in germany the discrepancy leaves room for considerable questions .
why is it that german workers , who are generally not afraid of grumbling about anything less than the best , rarely have to erect a picket line in order to get what they want ?
the answers , says jan jurczyk of the service industry trade union , verdi , are manifold .
“ in essence , it is not very easy to strike in germany .
we have a highly developed collective agreement system and strike action can only be taken in connection therewith , ” jurczyk said .
“ political strikes are not allowed and neither is industrial action organized by a small number of employees .
at least not legally . ”
heading the union call on the contrary , strikers can only become such if rallied to do so by their union , and even they have limited power to make that call .
the collective agreements , which cover things like pay , holiday , working hours and pensions , severely limit the opportunities for employees to walk out at all .
“ as long as the agreement is valid , which generally varies between one and two years , there can be no strikes .
and then after the contract between the union and employer has expired , there is still a grace period of several weeks in which there can also be no walk outs , ” jurczyk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no ballot , no strike and even when that period , known as a “ peace obligation ” is over , strike action must be endorsed by at least 75 percent of union members .
a further “ hurdle , ” says jurczyk , is the employers ’ right to enforce a lockout , in which the entire workforce , strikers and non-strikers alike , are barred from the premises .
strike action must be last resort the whole system is designed to discourage escalation of disputes at every turn , and to instead encourage communication between the voice of the employees , the unions , and the employers .
and it is well oiled .
dr. heiner dribbusch works for the institute for economic and social research -lrb- wsi -rrb- in the hans böckler foundation , which is a research institute related to the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- . he says that although when push comes to shove , german workers are willing to exercise their , albeit limited , right to strike , they use it sparingly .
and the same , he says , is true of the unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union-backed demonstrations precede industrial action “ unions are doubtless interested in having as few restrictions as possible , so they can be the ones who make the decisions , ” dribbusch said .
“ but that said , they don ’ t use every opportunity they have to strike , which suggests that they don ’ t want to . ”
and one good reason for that is the generous replacement wages which unions have to pay to their striking members .
“ unions are cautious when it comes to calling for industrial action , not least because of the expense of having to fork out strike money , ” jurczyk said .
“ employees get paid more or less the same by the unions as they receive in their basic pay packet , and in a large workforce , that can add up to huge amounts of money . ”
too good to remain true ?
like so many german systems , the strike prevention one is precisely structured and designed to be of some benefit to everyone concerned .
and for those who do enjoy a right to strike , which public servants in germany incidentally do not , it is a system which has , over the past half decade , proved its worth .
“ take the chemical industry , for example , it has only witnessed one strike since the end of the war .
many employees in germany will go through their working life never having experienced any industrial action , ” dribbusch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taste of things to come ?
but there are signs that things are changing .
in the current economic climate , the demand for employment far outstrips the supply , and jurczyk says that is affecting the way in which collective agreements are negotiated .
“ employers ’ associations have begun to react to employees ’ demands in a more aggressive way , and to respond to them with counter demands .
they 're using the levels of unemployment as a threat to the existing workforce , ” he said .

german workers are renowned in industrial world circles for the cushy conditions upon which they luxuriously lounge .
but just how do they get them ?
not , it seems , by downing their tools and screaming injustice . in a study of strike culture in developed countries published last week by the institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- , german workers emerged as some of the most reluctant strikers .
the report , which observed walk-out tendencies in the 30 members of the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , revealed that between 1991 and 2000 , german workers notched up a meager 9.3 annual strike days per 1,000 employees .
only austrian , japanese and swiss employees recorded even greater committment to work , while at the other end of the scale , the number climbed surely and steadily to its canadian peak of 189 annual strike days within the same time frame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picket lines are a relative rarity in germany the discrepancy leaves room for considerable questions .
why is it that german workers , who are generally not afraid of grumbling about anything less than the best , rarely have to erect a picket line in order to get what they want ?
the answers , says jan jurczyk of the service industry trade union , verdi , are manifold .
“ in essence , it is not very easy to strike in germany .
we have a highly developed collective agreement system and strike action can only be taken in connection therewith , ” jurczyk said .
“ political strikes are not allowed and neither is industrial action organized by a small number of employees .
at least not legally . ”
heading the union call on the contrary , strikers can only become such if rallied to do so by their union , and even they have limited power to make that call .
the collective agreements , which cover things like pay , holiday , working hours and pensions , severely limit the opportunities for employees to walk out at all .
“ as long as the agreement is valid , which generally varies between one and two years , there can be no strikes .
and then after the contract between the union and employer has expired , there is still a grace period of several weeks in which there can also be no walk outs , ” jurczyk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no ballot , no strike and even when that period , known as a “ peace obligation ” is over , strike action must be endorsed by at least 75 percent of union members .
a further “ hurdle , ” says jurczyk , is the employers ’ right to enforce a lockout , in which the entire workforce , strikers and non-strikers alike , are barred from the premises .
strike action must be last resort the whole system is designed to discourage escalation of disputes at every turn , and to instead encourage communication between the voice of the employees , the unions , and the employers .
and it is well oiled .
dr. heiner dribbusch works for the institute for economic and social research -lrb- wsi -rrb- in the hans böckler foundation , which is a research institute related to the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- . he says that although when push comes to shove , german workers are willing to exercise their , albeit limited , right to strike , they use it sparingly .
and the same , he says , is true of the unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union-backed demonstrations precede industrial action “ unions are doubtless interested in having as few restrictions as possible , so they can be the ones who make the decisions , ” dribbusch said .
“ but that said , they don ’ t use every opportunity they have to strike , which suggests that they don ’ t want to . ”
and one good reason for that is the generous replacement wages which unions have to pay to their striking members .
“ unions are cautious when it comes to calling for industrial action , not least because of the expense of having to fork out strike money , ” jurczyk said .
“ employees get paid more or less the same by the unions as they receive in their basic pay packet , and in a large workforce , that can add up to huge amounts of money . ”
too good to remain true ?
like so many german systems , the strike prevention one is precisely structured and designed to be of some benefit to everyone concerned .
and for those who do enjoy a right to strike , which public servants in germany incidentally do not , it is a system which has , over the past half decade , proved its worth .
“ take the chemical industry , for example , it has only witnessed one strike since the end of the war .
many employees in germany will go through their working life never having experienced any industrial action , ” dribbusch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taste of things to come ?
but there are signs that things are changing .
in the current economic climate , the demand for employment far outstrips the supply , and jurczyk says that is affecting the way in which collective agreements are negotiated .
“ employers ’ associations have begun to react to employees ’ demands in a more aggressive way , and to respond to them with counter demands .
they 're using the levels of unemployment as a threat to the existing workforce , ” he said .

angela merkel has announced she wants to appoint radical tax reform advocate paul kirchhof as finance minister if her party wins on sept .

it could radically remake german fiscal policy , conservative supporters say . when cdu leader and chancellor candidate angela merkel picked paul kirchhof , a heidelberg university professor and former constitutional court judge , as her top finance adviser wednesday , she signaled that she was ready to move towards radical reform .
" if it is up to me and the coalition talks allow it , he will become finance minister , " merkel said during a campaign stop .
kirchhof , 62 , is best known for a tax reform proposal he presented in 2003 which calls for a flat 25 percent tax for corporations and individuals .
but many financial experts and politicians criticize the choice because kirchhof , they say , is a political novice and lacks the cdu party connections to run the finance ministry effectively .
merkel 's plans could be derailed if bavarian premier edmund stoiber or a member of the free democrats , the likely coalition partner , lay claim to the portfolio .
the post is considered critical because of germany 's fight to cut its debt and lower its deficit .
must set good example kirchhof told the mass-circulation newspaper bild that if elected , the conservatives would bring the german budget deficit below the european union 's limit of three percent of gdp in the " near future . "
he also said that germany must again set a good financial example for europe .
bildunterschrift : angela 's a-team " i am convinced that government debt is currently the most dramatic problem we face , " he said .
" it 's simply obscene to pass this fundamental burden on to future generations . "
germany breached the eu stability pact rules for the third time last year and is expected to do so again 2005 .

german workers are renowned in industrial world circles for the cushy conditions upon which they luxuriously lounge .
but just how do they get them ?
not , it seems , by downing their tools and screaming injustice . in a study of strike culture in developed countries published last week by the institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- , german workers emerged as some of the most reluctant strikers .
the report , which observed walk-out tendencies in the 30 members of the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , revealed that between 1991 and 2000 , german workers notched up a meager 9.3 annual strike days per 1,000 employees .
only austrian , japanese and swiss employees recorded even greater committment to work , while at the other end of the scale , the number climbed surely and steadily to its canadian peak of 189 annual strike days within the same time frame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picket lines are a relative rarity in germany the discrepancy leaves room for considerable questions .
why is it that german workers , who are generally not afraid of grumbling about anything less than the best , rarely have to erect a picket line in order to get what they want ?
the answers , says jan jurczyk of the service industry trade union , verdi , are manifold .
“ in essence , it is not very easy to strike in germany .
we have a highly developed collective agreement system and strike action can only be taken in connection therewith , ” jurczyk said .
“ political strikes are not allowed and neither is industrial action organized by a small number of employees .
at least not legally . ”
heading the union call on the contrary , strikers can only become such if rallied to do so by their union , and even they have limited power to make that call .
the collective agreements , which cover things like pay , holiday , working hours and pensions , severely limit the opportunities for employees to walk out at all .
“ as long as the agreement is valid , which generally varies between one and two years , there can be no strikes .
and then after the contract between the union and employer has expired , there is still a grace period of several weeks in which there can also be no walk outs , ” jurczyk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no ballot , no strike and even when that period , known as a “ peace obligation ” is over , strike action must be endorsed by at least 75 percent of union members .
a further “ hurdle , ” says jurczyk , is the employers ’ right to enforce a lockout , in which the entire workforce , strikers and non-strikers alike , are barred from the premises .
strike action must be last resort the whole system is designed to discourage escalation of disputes at every turn , and to instead encourage communication between the voice of the employees , the unions , and the employers .
and it is well oiled .
dr. heiner dribbusch works for the institute for economic and social research -lrb- wsi -rrb- in the hans böckler foundation , which is a research institute related to the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- . he says that although when push comes to shove , german workers are willing to exercise their , albeit limited , right to strike , they use it sparingly .

“ but that said , they don ’ t use every opportunity they have to strike , which suggests that they don ’ t want to . ”
and one good reason for that is the generous replacement wages which unions have to pay to their striking members .
“ unions are cautious when it comes to calling for industrial action , not least because of the expense of having to fork out strike money , ” jurczyk said .
“ employees get paid more or less the same by the unions as they receive in their basic pay packet , and in a large workforce , that can add up to huge amounts of money . ”
too good to remain true ?
like so many german systems , the strike prevention one is precisely structured and designed to be of some benefit to everyone concerned .
and for those who do enjoy a right to strike , which public servants in germany incidentally do not , it is a system which has , over the past half decade , proved its worth .
“ take the chemical industry , for example , it has only witnessed one strike since the end of the war .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taste of things to come ?
but there are signs that things are changing .
in the current economic climate , the demand for employment far outstrips the supply , and jurczyk says that is affecting the way in which collective agreements are negotiated .
“ employers ’ associations have begun to react to employees ’ demands in a more aggressive way , and to respond to them with counter demands .
they 're using the levels of unemployment as a threat to the existing workforce , ” he said .

german workers are renowned in industrial world circles for the cushy conditions upon which they luxuriously lounge .
but just how do they get them ?
not , it seems , by downing their tools and screaming injustice . in a study of strike culture in developed countries published last week by the institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- , german workers emerged as some of the most reluctant strikers .
the report , which observed walk-out tendencies in the 30 members of the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , revealed that between 1991 and 2000 , german workers notched up a meager 9.3 annual strike days per 1,000 employees .
only austrian , japanese and swiss employees recorded even greater committment to work , while at the other end of the scale , the number climbed surely and steadily to its canadian peak of 189 annual strike days within the same time frame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picket lines are a relative rarity in germany the discrepancy leaves room for considerable questions .
why is it that german workers , who are generally not afraid of grumbling about anything less than the best , rarely have to erect a picket line in order to get what they want ?
the answers , says jan jurczyk of the service industry trade union , verdi , are manifold .
“ in essence , it is not very easy to strike in germany .
we have a highly developed collective agreement system and strike action can only be taken in connection therewith , ” jurczyk said .
“ political strikes are not allowed and neither is industrial action organized by a small number of employees .
at least not legally . ”
heading the union call on the contrary , strikers can only become such if rallied to do so by their union , and even they have limited power to make that call .
the collective agreements , which cover things like pay , holiday , working hours and pensions , severely limit the opportunities for employees to walk out at all .
“ as long as the agreement is valid , which generally varies between one and two years , there can be no strikes .
and then after the contract between the union and employer has expired , there is still a grace period of several weeks in which there can also be no walk outs , ” jurczyk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no ballot , no strike and even when that period , known as a “ peace obligation ” is over , strike action must be endorsed by at least 75 percent of union members .
a further “ hurdle , ” says jurczyk , is the employers ’ right to enforce a lockout , in which the entire workforce , strikers and non-strikers alike , are barred from the premises .
strike action must be last resort the whole system is designed to discourage escalation of disputes at every turn , and to instead encourage communication between the voice of the employees , the unions , and the employers .
and it is well oiled .
dr. heiner dribbusch works for the institute for economic and social research -lrb- wsi -rrb- in the hans böckler foundation , which is a research institute related to the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- . he says that although when push comes to shove , german workers are willing to exercise their , albeit limited , right to strike , they use it sparingly .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no ballot , no strike and even when that period , known as a “ peace obligation ” is over , strike action must be endorsed by at least 75 percent of union members .
a further “ hurdle , ” says jurczyk , is the employers ’ right to enforce a lockout , in which the entire workforce , strikers and non-strikers alike , are barred from the premises .
strike action must be last resort the whole system is designed to discourage escalation of disputes at every turn , and to instead encourage communication between the voice of the employees , the unions , and the employers .
and it is well oiled .
dr. heiner dribbusch works for the institute for economic and social research -lrb- wsi -rrb- in the hans böckler foundation , which is a research institute related to the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- . he says that although when push comes to shove , german workers are willing to exercise their , albeit limited , right to strike , they use it sparingly .
and the same , he says , is true of the unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union-backed demonstrations precede industrial action “ unions are doubtless interested in having as few restrictions as possible , so they can be the ones who make the decisions , ” dribbusch said .
“ but that said , they don ’ t use every opportunity they have to strike , which suggests that they don ’ t want to . ”
and one good reason for that is the generous replacement wages which unions have to pay to their striking members .
“ unions are cautious when it comes to calling for industrial action , not least because of the expense of having to fork out strike money , ” jurczyk said .
“ employees get paid more or less the same by the unions as they receive in their basic pay packet , and in a large workforce , that can add up to huge amounts of money . ”
too good to remain true ?
like so many german systems , the strike prevention one is precisely structured and designed to be of some benefit to everyone concerned .
and for those who do enjoy a right to strike , which public servants in germany incidentally do not , it is a system which has , over the past half decade , proved its worth .
“ take the chemical industry , for example , it has only witnessed one strike since the end of the war .
many employees in germany will go through their working life never having experienced any industrial action , ” dribbusch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taste of things to come ?
but there are signs that things are changing .
in the current economic climate , the demand for employment far outstrips the supply , and jurczyk says that is affecting the way in which collective agreements are negotiated .
“ employers ’ associations have begun to react to employees ’ demands in a more aggressive way , and to respond to them with counter demands .
they 're using the levels of unemployment as a threat to the existing workforce , ” he said .
“ whether such behavior will lead to more strikes , we don ’ t know .
it hasn ’ t been decided yet . ” tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

that could mean germany takes harsher measures against those deemed islamic militants . it 's the latest in a serious of no-nonsense actions from down south .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein announced thursday that he is expelling three more suspected islamic radicals .
this time , the three are members of a group called tablighi jamaat , which has about 450 members around germany and whose followers want to establish an islamic state , officials said .

his boss , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , has gone farther , saying that there are tens of thousands of radical muslims in germany , at least 4,000 of those he wants to deport for extremist activities .
increasing focus germany was forced to increase its efforts to clamp down on islamic radicals after it was discovered that the september 11 hijackers planned their attacks while living as students in hamburg .

on wednesday night , coach jürgen klinsmann ’ s side faced their arch rivals the netherlands in rotterdam . with the netherlands currently ranked third in the world and germany ranked 11th german coach jürgen klinsmann knew his side faced a stiff task in the cauldron of rotterdam ’ s de kuip stadium .
the match finished in a 2-2 draw , a rather flattering result for the german side .
the dutch are spoilt for choice when it comes to world-class strikers and could allow themswelves to leave bayern munich ’ s striker roy makaay on the bench in the first half with ruud van nistelroy and arjen robben up front .
veteran defender christian wörns was recalled to the german side along with didi hamann to help sure up germany ’ s weak defense with midfielder bernd schneider playing at left back .
dutch coach van basten is a shrewd man , noticed schneider was playing out of position and switched arjen robben to the right wing to trouble schneider ... this move paid dividends early on as the dutch took a third minute lead through chelsea striker robben .
at half-time germany could count themselves lucky to be only one goal down as the dutch wasted several golden opportunities .
one minute into the second half though germany found themselves two goals down . again the scorer was arjen robben .
the game looked over .
klinsmann ’ s biggest defeat ?
jürgen klinsmann , the striker-turned coach was solely responsible for germany 's last victory over the oranje by converting a penalty for a 1-0 win in 1996 - also in rotterdam .
but on wednesday night , he looked as if he would be suffering his worst defeat as coach .
but michael ballack had other ideas and quickly pulled a goal back for germany with a diving header .
yet it was still the dutch magicians who were playing the beautiful football but who continued to squander chance after chance , hitting the crossbar twice .
suddenly germany broke and after good work by tim borowski , substitute gerald asamoah came in on the right to squeeze the ball over the line from an sharp angle .
2-2 was the final score . a typical german comeback and totally against the run of play .
while germany were delighted to equalise their miserable run against the big nations continues and it is 15 games since they defeated a recognised top team .
on wednesday night jürgen klinsmann can be only proud of one thing - his side ’ s resilience alex sisto send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de can germany break the jinx ?
german-dutch soccer matches , even if they 're just friendlies , are seldom nice .
with a long line of dramatic wins and losses , the arch-rivalry between the two neighbors always guarantees a sensational game .

17 , 2005 -rrb- klinsi : warring keepers to be separated german national coach jürgen klinsmann has decided to keep goalkeeping rivals oliver kahn and jens lehmann apart for the next six warm-up matches to prevent further friction building up ahead of the 2006 world cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.08.2005 germany , nation of reluctant strikers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " strike " , it says , but that 's easier said than done in germany .
german workers are renowned in industrial world circles for the cushy conditions upon which they luxuriously lounge .
but just how do they get them ?
not , it seems , by downing their tools and screaming injustice . in a study of strike culture in developed countries published last week by the institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- , german workers emerged as some of the most reluctant strikers .
the report , which observed walk-out tendencies in the 30 members of the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , revealed that between 1991 and 2000 , german workers notched up a meager 9.3 annual strike days per 1,000 employees .
only austrian , japanese and swiss employees recorded even greater committment to work , while at the other end of the scale , the number climbed surely and steadily to its canadian peak of 189 annual strike days within the same time frame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picket lines are a relative rarity in germany the discrepancy leaves room for considerable questions .
why is it that german workers , who are generally not afraid of grumbling about anything less than the best , rarely have to erect a picket line in order to get what they want ?
the answers , says jan jurczyk of the service industry trade union , verdi , are manifold .
“ in essence , it is not very easy to strike in germany .
we have a highly developed collective agreement system and strike action can only be taken in connection therewith , ” jurczyk said .
“ political strikes are not allowed and neither is industrial action organized by a small number of employees .
at least not legally . ”
heading the union call on the contrary , strikers can only become such if rallied to do so by their union , and even they have limited power to make that call .
the collective agreements , which cover things like pay , holiday , working hours and pensions , severely limit the opportunities for employees to walk out at all .
“ as long as the agreement is valid , which generally varies between one and two years , there can be no strikes .
and then after the contract between the union and employer has expired , there is still a grace period of several weeks in which there can also be no walk outs , ” jurczyk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no ballot , no strike and even when that period , known as a “ peace obligation ” is over , strike action must be endorsed by at least 75 percent of union members .
a further “ hurdle , ” says jurczyk , is the employers ’ right to enforce a lockout , in which the entire workforce , strikers and non-strikers alike , are barred from the premises .
strike action must be last resort the whole system is designed to discourage escalation of disputes at every turn , and to instead encourage communication between the voice of the employees , the unions , and the employers .
and it is well oiled .
dr. heiner dribbusch works for the institute for economic and social research -lrb- wsi -rrb- in the hans böckler foundation , which is a research institute related to the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- . he says that although when push comes to shove , german workers are willing to exercise their , albeit limited , right to strike , they use it sparingly .
and the same , he says , is true of the unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union-backed demonstrations precede industrial action “ unions are doubtless interested in having as few restrictions as possible , so they can be the ones who make the decisions , ” dribbusch said .
“ but that said , they don ’ t use every opportunity they have to strike , which suggests that they don ’ t want to . ”
and one good reason for that is the generous replacement wages which unions have to pay to their striking members .
“ unions are cautious when it comes to calling for industrial action , not least because of the expense of having to fork out strike money , ” jurczyk said .
“ employees get paid more or less the same by the unions as they receive in their basic pay packet , and in a large workforce , that can add up to huge amounts of money . ”
too good to remain true ?
like so many german systems , the strike prevention one is precisely structured and designed to be of some benefit to everyone concerned .
and for those who do enjoy a right to strike , which public servants in germany incidentally do not , it is a system which has , over the past half decade , proved its worth .
“ take the chemical industry , for example , it has only witnessed one strike since the end of the war .
many employees in germany will go through their working life never having experienced any industrial action , ” dribbusch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taste of things to come ?
but there are signs that things are changing .
in the current economic climate , the demand for employment far outstrips the supply , and jurczyk says that is affecting the way in which collective agreements are negotiated .
“ employers ’ associations have begun to react to employees ’ demands in a more aggressive way , and to respond to them with counter demands .
they 're using the levels of unemployment as a threat to the existing workforce , ” he said .
“ whether such behavior will lead to more strikes , we don ’ t know .
it hasn ’ t been decided yet . ” tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

jürgen klinsmann , the striker-turned coach was solely responsible for germany 's last victory over the oranje by converting a penalty for a 1-0 win in 1996 - also in rotterdam .
but on wednesday night , he looked as if he would be suffering his worst defeat as coach .
but michael ballack had other ideas and quickly pulled a goal back for germany with a diving header .
yet it was still the dutch magicians who were playing the beautiful football but who continued to squander chance after chance , hitting the crossbar twice .
suddenly germany broke and after good work by tim borowski , substitute gerald asamoah came in on the right to squeeze the ball over the line from an sharp angle .
2-2 was the final score . a typical german comeback and totally against the run of play .
while germany were delighted to equalise their miserable run against the big nations continues and it is 15 games since they defeated a recognised top team .

many allege that coping with prejudice is a part of their lives , but they also admit that embracing german society does n't come easily to them . ask a random selection of young arabs what brought their families to germany and you 'll get a broad range of replies .
along with political or religious persecution , one of the most common reasons for pulling up roots is a desire to improve their economic situations , with many migrants heading west so they can better provide for their families .
many hope their children will grow up to enjoy opportunities they themselves never had . " you do n't have to pay much to study here , " pointed out one arab student .
but while getting a german education is an obvious advantage , it 's often easier said than done .
integrating with german peers and adjusting to the european mentality can be difficult .
even building up a social life can be tricky . " not all germans are reserved , " conceded one young moroccan .
" some of the people here are quite open , but on the whole , i find most germans very stand-offish . " ignorance others agree that coming to terms with the german way of life is fraught with obstacles .
potential pitfalls range from the practical to the psychological . " i 've never integrated properly here , " admitted one egyptian .
" primarily , the problem is that i never really learnt german properly back home in egypt , but i 've also never really made any friends here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but it 's by no means all their fault .
many arabs complain that germans are unaware of diversity within the arab world and fail to distinguish between different nationalities and cultures .
as far as the average german is concerned , they say , there 's not a whole lot of difference between a moroccan and a saudi arabian . hostility if ignorance were n't bad enough , hostility is another daily challenge for germany 's muslim community .
in the wake of the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states and the more recent events in madrid and london , the western world has made islamic fundamentalism its number one enemy - and across europe , many muslims say they are now treated with widespread suspicion and hostility . even so , others are quick to point out that getting to grips with a country like germany has a lot to do with one 's own attitudes .
many find that being receptive to new ideas and finding the resolve to chart unknown social and cultural ground will make life much easier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm in a non-muslim european country , " stressed one young palestinian .
" that means i 'm speaking a different language , living in a different society and adapting to a new country .

angela merkel has announced she wants to appoint radical tax reform advocate paul kirchhof as finance minister if her party wins on sept .
18 .
it could radically remake german fiscal policy , conservative supporters say . when cdu leader and chancellor candidate angela merkel picked paul kirchhof , a heidelberg university professor and former constitutional court judge , as her top finance adviser wednesday , she signaled that she was ready to move towards radical reform .
" if it is up to me and the coalition talks allow it , he will become finance minister , " merkel said during a campaign stop .
kirchhof , 62 , is best known for a tax reform proposal he presented in 2003 which calls for a flat 25 percent tax for corporations and individuals .
but many financial experts and politicians criticize the choice because kirchhof , they say , is a political novice and lacks the cdu party connections to run the finance ministry effectively .
merkel 's plans could be derailed if bavarian premier edmund stoiber or a member of the free democrats , the likely coalition partner , lay claim to the portfolio .
the post is considered critical because of germany 's fight to cut its debt and lower its deficit .
must set good example kirchhof told the mass-circulation newspaper bild that if elected , the conservatives would bring the german budget deficit below the european union 's limit of three percent of gdp in the " near future . "
he also said that germany must again set a good financial example for europe .
bildunterschrift : angela 's a-team " i am convinced that government debt is currently the most dramatic problem we face , " he said .
" it 's simply obscene to pass this fundamental burden on to future generations . "
germany breached the eu stability pact rules for the third time last year and is expected to do so again 2005 .
this time , eu finance ministers may decide to penalize the country .
the conservatives have promised to get germany 's deficit below three percent by 2009 and balance the federal budget by 2013 . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's " dream team " conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel presented her so-called " competence team " on wednesday .

angela merkel has announced she wants to appoint radical tax reform advocate paul kirchhof as finance minister if her party wins on sept .
18 .
it could radically remake german fiscal policy , conservative supporters say . when cdu leader and chancellor candidate angela merkel picked paul kirchhof , a heidelberg university professor and former constitutional court judge , as her top finance adviser wednesday , she signaled that she was ready to move towards radical reform .
" if it is up to me and the coalition talks allow it , he will become finance minister , " merkel said during a campaign stop .
kirchhof , 62 , is best known for a tax reform proposal he presented in 2003 which calls for a flat 25 percent tax for corporations and individuals .
but many financial experts and politicians criticize the choice because kirchhof , they say , is a political novice and lacks the cdu party connections to run the finance ministry effectively .
merkel 's plans could be derailed if bavarian premier edmund stoiber or a member of the free democrats , the likely coalition partner , lay claim to the portfolio .
the post is considered critical because of germany 's fight to cut its debt and lower its deficit .
must set good example kirchhof told the mass-circulation newspaper bild that if elected , the conservatives would bring the german budget deficit below the european union 's limit of three percent of gdp in the " near future . "
he also said that germany must again set a good financial example for europe .
bildunterschrift : angela 's a-team " i am convinced that government debt is currently the most dramatic problem we face , " he said .
" it 's simply obscene to pass this fundamental burden on to future generations . "
germany breached the eu stability pact rules for the third time last year and is expected to do so again 2005 .
this time , eu finance ministers may decide to penalize the country .
the conservatives have promised to get germany 's deficit below three percent by 2009 and balance the federal budget by 2013 . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's " dream team " conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel presented her so-called " competence team " on wednesday .

mongolia and kazakhstan have also reported outbreaks . deadly strain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : h5n1 is the most deadly strain of the bird flu virus , but so far there have been no reports from russia of humans contracting the disease . dick thompson , communicable diseases spokesman for the world health organization , says the odds of this are low , but that the characteristics of the h5n1 strain increase the danger of a human pandemic . " what we worry about is that it may happen that the virus infects a human , or even a pig , that has a circulating strain of normal influenza , and this normal human influenza will recombine with this avian form , " said thompson , " what will emerge is a strain that the human immune system has never seen before and moves easily from person to person , and that would ignite a pandemic . " minimizing risks although european officials say there is no immediate danger to europe , they are already moving to minimize the risk of local bird populations becoming infected .
russia 's public health chief has warned that as migrating birds leave russia ahead of winter , they will carry the disease westwards , towards europe , africa and the middle east . in response to this threat , the netherlands , which suffered a bird flu outbreak in 2003 , has adopted the toughest measures in europe .
on tuesday , the dutch agriculture ministry issued a directive to farmers to keep all poultry indoors in order to minimize contact with migrating birds from russia .
last friday the eu also banned the import of live birds and feathers from russia and kazakhstan , although in practice no such trade exists . inadequate supplies of anti-virals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the new danger , eu officials said on tuesday that they have no plan to increase vaccine supplies .
because a pandemic may be caused by a new mutation of the virus , dick thompson from the who says that vaccines may not be an effective measure against the disease . " while we do believe that the virus is susceptible to a particular anti-viral , that anti-viral will be in limited supply , " he said .
" countries which are depending on medical approaches , vaccines and anti-virals will find that there are actually inadequate supplies to confront a pandemic . " the best european authorities can do at this stage is to try to keep the disease away from local bird populations . james fletcher -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bird flu heading for europe ?

german workers are renowned in industrial world circles for the cushy conditions upon which they luxuriously lounge .
but just how do they get them ?
not , it seems , by downing their tools and screaming injustice . in a study of strike culture in developed countries published last week by the institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- , german workers emerged as some of the most reluctant strikers .
the report , which observed walk-out tendencies in the 30 members of the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , revealed that between 1991 and 2000 , german workers notched up a meager 9.3 annual strike days per 1,000 employees .
only austrian , japanese and swiss employees recorded even greater committment to work , while at the other end of the scale , the number climbed surely and steadily to its canadian peak of 189 annual strike days within the same time frame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picket lines are a relative rarity in germany the discrepancy leaves room for considerable questions .
why is it that german workers , who are generally not afraid of grumbling about anything less than the best , rarely have to erect a picket line in order to get what they want ?
the answers , says jan jurczyk of the service industry trade union , verdi , are manifold .
“ in essence , it is not very easy to strike in germany .
we have a highly developed collective agreement system and strike action can only be taken in connection therewith , ” jurczyk said .
“ political strikes are not allowed and neither is industrial action organized by a small number of employees .
at least not legally . ”
heading the union call on the contrary , strikers can only become such if rallied to do so by their union , and even they have limited power to make that call .
the collective agreements , which cover things like pay , holiday , working hours and pensions , severely limit the opportunities for employees to walk out at all .
“ as long as the agreement is valid , which generally varies between one and two years , there can be no strikes .
and then after the contract between the union and employer has expired , there is still a grace period of several weeks in which there can also be no walk outs , ” jurczyk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no ballot , no strike and even when that period , known as a “ peace obligation ” is over , strike action must be endorsed by at least 75 percent of union members .
a further “ hurdle , ” says jurczyk , is the employers ’ right to enforce a lockout , in which the entire workforce , strikers and non-strikers alike , are barred from the premises .
strike action must be last resort the whole system is designed to discourage escalation of disputes at every turn , and to instead encourage communication between the voice of the employees , the unions , and the employers .
and it is well oiled .
dr. heiner dribbusch works for the institute for economic and social research -lrb- wsi -rrb- in the hans böckler foundation , which is a research institute related to the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- . he says that although when push comes to shove , german workers are willing to exercise their , albeit limited , right to strike , they use it sparingly .
and the same , he says , is true of the unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union-backed demonstrations precede industrial action “ unions are doubtless interested in having as few restrictions as possible , so they can be the ones who make the decisions , ” dribbusch said .
“ but that said , they don ’ t use every opportunity they have to strike , which suggests that they don ’ t want to . ”
and one good reason for that is the generous replacement wages which unions have to pay to their striking members .
“ unions are cautious when it comes to calling for industrial action , not least because of the expense of having to fork out strike money , ” jurczyk said .
“ employees get paid more or less the same by the unions as they receive in their basic pay packet , and in a large workforce , that can add up to huge amounts of money . ”
too good to remain true ?
like so many german systems , the strike prevention one is precisely structured and designed to be of some benefit to everyone concerned .
and for those who do enjoy a right to strike , which public servants in germany incidentally do not , it is a system which has , over the past half decade , proved its worth .
“ take the chemical industry , for example , it has only witnessed one strike since the end of the war .
many employees in germany will go through their working life never having experienced any industrial action , ” dribbusch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taste of things to come ?
but there are signs that things are changing .
in the current economic climate , the demand for employment far outstrips the supply , and jurczyk says that is affecting the way in which collective agreements are negotiated .
“ employers ’ associations have begun to react to employees ’ demands in a more aggressive way , and to respond to them with counter demands .
they 're using the levels of unemployment as a threat to the existing workforce , ” he said .
“ whether such behavior will lead to more strikes , we don ’ t know .
it hasn ’ t been decided yet . ” tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

it could radically remake german fiscal policy , conservative supporters say . when cdu leader and chancellor candidate angela merkel picked paul kirchhof , a heidelberg university professor and former constitutional court judge , as her top finance adviser wednesday , she signaled that she was ready to move towards radical reform .
" if it is up to me and the coalition talks allow it , he will become finance minister , " merkel said during a campaign stop .
kirchhof , 62 , is best known for a tax reform proposal he presented in 2003 which calls for a flat 25 percent tax for corporations and individuals .
but many financial experts and politicians criticize the choice because kirchhof , they say , is a political novice and lacks the cdu party connections to run the finance ministry effectively .
merkel 's plans could be derailed if bavarian premier edmund stoiber or a member of the free democrats , the likely coalition partner , lay claim to the portfolio .
the post is considered critical because of germany 's fight to cut its debt and lower its deficit .
must set good example kirchhof told the mass-circulation newspaper bild that if elected , the conservatives would bring the german budget deficit below the european union 's limit of three percent of gdp in the " near future . "
he also said that germany must again set a good financial example for europe .

angela merkel has announced she wants to appoint radical tax reform advocate paul kirchhof as finance minister if her party wins on sept .
18 .
it could radically remake german fiscal policy , conservative supporters say . when cdu leader and chancellor candidate angela merkel picked paul kirchhof , a heidelberg university professor and former constitutional court judge , as her top finance adviser wednesday , she signaled that she was ready to move towards radical reform .
" if it is up to me and the coalition talks allow it , he will become finance minister , " merkel said during a campaign stop .
kirchhof , 62 , is best known for a tax reform proposal he presented in 2003 which calls for a flat 25 percent tax for corporations and individuals .
but many financial experts and politicians criticize the choice because kirchhof , they say , is a political novice and lacks the cdu party connections to run the finance ministry effectively .
merkel 's plans could be derailed if bavarian premier edmund stoiber or a member of the free democrats , the likely coalition partner , lay claim to the portfolio .
the post is considered critical because of germany 's fight to cut its debt and lower its deficit .
must set good example kirchhof told the mass-circulation newspaper bild that if elected , the conservatives would bring the german budget deficit below the european union 's limit of three percent of gdp in the " near future . "
he also said that germany must again set a good financial example for europe .
bildunterschrift : angela 's a-team " i am convinced that government debt is currently the most dramatic problem we face , " he said .
" it 's simply obscene to pass this fundamental burden on to future generations . "
germany breached the eu stability pact rules for the third time last year and is expected to do so again 2005 .
this time , eu finance ministers may decide to penalize the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.08.2005 german cars overtaken in eco-race großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not all environmentally sound , but which are the culprits ?
it 's might be hard to believe , but the great master of vorsprung durch technik , the german automobile industry , is no longer in pole position in the race to make modern cars more environmentally friendly . a study published on wednesday by germany 's automobile club , vcd , revealed that japan and france have their feet to the floor when it comes to environmental matters , and have left german car manufacturers spluttering in their wake . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the smart car is too small to do too much damage the vcd have been assessing anti-pollution merits of popular cars since 1989 , and the findings from their most recent review were the worst ever for germany , which only managed to squeeze one model , the opel corsa eco 1.0 into the top ten . and even that only made it into sixth place on the ranking table . it 's bad news for germany , which is currently still ruled in part by the green party , and which has long nurtured its reputation for being environmentally altruistic . bad boy volkswagen the vcd was particularly harsh in its criticism of the peoples ' favorite , volkswagen , for not installing a particle-filter to counter diesel soot in its best-selling model , the golf . " german manufacturers face the prospect of losing touch with environmental technology , " said deputy vcd chairman , hermann-josef vogt .
and the upshot of that , says the report , is that germany could lose credibility as a centre of automobile technology , subsequently become less competitive and having to shed jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can environmental technology keep up with the cars ?
the comments were met with roaring disapproval from the german association of the automotive industry , vda , which delivered a vitriolic response , accusing the automobile club of being a " smorgasbord of smug , self-important people with no substance " and describing the report as being " disproportionately out of touch with reality . " so exactly what is the reality ?
simply that toyota tops the list - which measures cars for both economic virtue and emission levels - with its no frills prius 1 , and that citroen , peugeot and daihatsu are hotter on its wheels than any german make . missed opportunity a spokesman for the vcd said it need not have been that way , and that volkswagen could have pipped toyota to the post had it concentrated less on honing its super-speed luxury limos and simply installed standard-issue filters in its audi 2 and lupo model , which have now been withdrawn from the market . # b # the spokesman , gerd lottsiepen , said that without the filter , diesel cars were " yesterday 's technology " , and a clear statement from the makers that they do n't care about the health of their customers . solicitousness was higher in the compact car category , which featured two appearances each from mercedes and opel and one from audi , but there was again a conspicuous absence of german names on the list of family models .
vw just managed to roll onto the bottom of the table at tenth place with its golf 2.0 variant bifuel . that 's not good enough for lottsiepen , who says it is time for the government , however it may look following the elections , to introduce tax benefits on cars which are equipped with today 's technology . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers move on diesel filters the eu 's new clean air law and hesitant consumers are causing german carmakers to scramble to equip diesel cars with soot filters as several german cities have reached pollution levels that require driving bans .
-lrb- march 30 , 2005 -rrb- german cars still stars ... for now in germany , it used to be that you knew you 'd made it in life when you bought your first mercedes .
but as affordable foreign cars offer consumers an attractive alternative , how long will this still be the case ?

many of the young pilgrims in cologne this week have found new ways of living their religion , which sometimes involve ignoring official church doctrine . katja jarc knows fewer younger people are going to church .
the 18-year-old slovenian can see it every sunday when she single-handedly brings down parish 's average age .
" nearly everyone is at least 60 years old , " she said .
" it 's hard to find anyone my age there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims wait to enter the cologne cathedral finding more young people interested in religion is one of the reasons jarc decided to attend the world youth day event in cologne .
she 's achieved that goal , since there are some 400,000 young faithful who have come to cologne for prayer , song , revivals and some good old-fashioned partying .
the catholic festival also sent her on the pilgrimage of sorts even after she arrived in this city on the rhine .
this second pilgrimage was shorter , however , than the long trip from slovenia .
this one started at the river 's edge and ended at cologne 's famous cathedral .
" here there are so many friendly people who are interested in church and prayer , " she said as groups passed by .
some people were waving national flags ; others whispered the rosary in a handful of different languages .
" i want to meet as many people like me as i can here in cologne . "
covering a distance of about two kilometers -lrb- 1.2 miles -rrb- , the pilgrimage is intended to represent the three wise men 's search for god .

" something is n't right when there are so many devout believers in africa and lots of them end up dying of aids , " said daniela gall , 18 , who lives near munich .
but the church should n't just sway with the mores of the day either , according to bryan brochu of alberta , canada .
" one of the strengths of the church is that it does n't change every time society wants it to , " said brochu , 21 , as speakers played recordings of the hail mary in german , english , french and italian .
" there are people who say the church is too old school , but i think it should stick to its values and traditions . "
admitting that he is not overly religious , tobias straub , 18 , came to the world youth day at the urging of his priest at home in bavaria who told him to look at the church 's teachings as a lighthouse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pilgrimage continues outside the cathedral " there are times you really need some direction and other times you can go on your own , " he said as his group joined the parade snaking its way around the square outside the cathedral .
" people should decide for themselves . "
keeping youth interested catholicism should n't force all of its tenets on people who are looking for guidance since the church has bigger problems it should concentrate on , according to jarc .
" i think the church should concentrate more on finding ways to get more younger people interested in religion , " she said .
young people want to know the church is also taking them into consideration every day , not just when it 's organizing concerts along the rhine .
" i like the times when i can organize something like a mass or other meeting myself , " gall said .
" that and a great priest who helps us do what we want is what keeps me interested in the church 's youth group . "

" if this zest , this joy , to know christ would come alive again and give the church in germany and europe a new dynamic , then i think the aim of world youth day would be achieved . "
according to jarc , the songs , prayers and chants of " hey , hey benito " heard along the pilgrims ' trail show that a spark has already been lit .

many of the young pilgrims in cologne this week have found new ways of living their religion , which sometimes involve ignoring official church doctrine . katja jarc knows fewer younger people are going to church .
the 18-year-old slovenian can see it every sunday when she single-handedly brings down parish 's average age .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims wait to enter the cologne cathedral finding more young people interested in religion is one of the reasons jarc decided to attend the world youth day event in cologne .
she 's achieved that goal , since there are some 400,000 young faithful who have come to cologne for prayer , song , revivals and some good old-fashioned partying .
the catholic festival also sent her on the pilgrimage of sorts even after she arrived in this city on the rhine .
this second pilgrimage was shorter , however , than the long trip from slovenia .
this one started at the river 's edge and ended at cologne 's famous cathedral .

some people were waving national flags ; others whispered the rosary in a handful of different languages .

covering a distance of about two kilometers -lrb- 1.2 miles -rrb- , the pilgrimage is intended to represent the three wise men 's search for god .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.08.2005 germany , nation of reluctant strikers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " strike " , it says , but that 's easier said than done in germany .
german workers are renowned in industrial world circles for the cushy conditions upon which they luxuriously lounge .
but just how do they get them ?
not , it seems , by downing their tools and screaming injustice . in a study of strike culture in developed countries published last week by the institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- , german workers emerged as some of the most reluctant strikers .
the report , which observed walk-out tendencies in the 30 members of the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , revealed that between 1991 and 2000 , german workers notched up a meager 9.3 annual strike days per 1,000 employees .
only austrian , japanese and swiss employees recorded even greater committment to work , while at the other end of the scale , the number climbed surely and steadily to its canadian peak of 189 annual strike days within the same time frame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picket lines are a relative rarity in germany the discrepancy leaves room for considerable questions .
why is it that german workers , who are generally not afraid of grumbling about anything less than the best , rarely have to erect a picket line in order to get what they want ?
the answers , says jan jurczyk of the service industry trade union , verdi , are manifold .
“ in essence , it is not very easy to strike in germany .
we have a highly developed collective agreement system and strike action can only be taken in connection therewith , ” jurczyk said .
“ political strikes are not allowed and neither is industrial action organized by a small number of employees .
at least not legally . ”
heading the union call on the contrary , strikers can only become such if rallied to do so by their union , and even they have limited power to make that call .
the collective agreements , which cover things like pay , holiday , working hours and pensions , severely limit the opportunities for employees to walk out at all .
“ as long as the agreement is valid , which generally varies between one and two years , there can be no strikes .
and then after the contract between the union and employer has expired , there is still a grace period of several weeks in which there can also be no walk outs , ” jurczyk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no ballot , no strike and even when that period , known as a “ peace obligation ” is over , strike action must be endorsed by at least 75 percent of union members .
a further “ hurdle , ” says jurczyk , is the employers ’ right to enforce a lockout , in which the entire workforce , strikers and non-strikers alike , are barred from the premises .
strike action must be last resort the whole system is designed to discourage escalation of disputes at every turn , and to instead encourage communication between the voice of the employees , the unions , and the employers .
and it is well oiled .
dr. heiner dribbusch works for the institute for economic and social research -lrb- wsi -rrb- in the hans böckler foundation , which is a research institute related to the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- . he says that although when push comes to shove , german workers are willing to exercise their , albeit limited , right to strike , they use it sparingly .
and the same , he says , is true of the unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union-backed demonstrations precede industrial action “ unions are doubtless interested in having as few restrictions as possible , so they can be the ones who make the decisions , ” dribbusch said .
“ but that said , they don ’ t use every opportunity they have to strike , which suggests that they don ’ t want to . ”
and one good reason for that is the generous replacement wages which unions have to pay to their striking members .
“ unions are cautious when it comes to calling for industrial action , not least because of the expense of having to fork out strike money , ” jurczyk said .
“ employees get paid more or less the same by the unions as they receive in their basic pay packet , and in a large workforce , that can add up to huge amounts of money . ”
too good to remain true ?
like so many german systems , the strike prevention one is precisely structured and designed to be of some benefit to everyone concerned .
and for those who do enjoy a right to strike , which public servants in germany incidentally do not , it is a system which has , over the past half decade , proved its worth .
“ take the chemical industry , for example , it has only witnessed one strike since the end of the war .
many employees in germany will go through their working life never having experienced any industrial action , ” dribbusch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taste of things to come ?
but there are signs that things are changing .
in the current economic climate , the demand for employment far outstrips the supply , and jurczyk says that is affecting the way in which collective agreements are negotiated .
“ employers ’ associations have begun to react to employees ’ demands in a more aggressive way , and to respond to them with counter demands .
they 're using the levels of unemployment as a threat to the existing workforce , ” he said .
“ whether such behavior will lead to more strikes , we don ’ t know .
it hasn ’ t been decided yet . ” tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

german workers are renowned in industrial world circles for the cushy conditions upon which they luxuriously lounge .
but just how do they get them ?
not , it seems , by downing their tools and screaming injustice . in a study of strike culture in developed countries published last week by the institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- , german workers emerged as some of the most reluctant strikers .
the report , which observed walk-out tendencies in the 30 members of the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , revealed that between 1991 and 2000 , german workers notched up a meager 9.3 annual strike days per 1,000 employees .
only austrian , japanese and swiss employees recorded even greater committment to work , while at the other end of the scale , the number climbed surely and steadily to its canadian peak of 189 annual strike days within the same time frame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picket lines are a relative rarity in germany the discrepancy leaves room for considerable questions .
why is it that german workers , who are generally not afraid of grumbling about anything less than the best , rarely have to erect a picket line in order to get what they want ?
the answers , says jan jurczyk of the service industry trade union , verdi , are manifold .
“ in essence , it is not very easy to strike in germany .
we have a highly developed collective agreement system and strike action can only be taken in connection therewith , ” jurczyk said .
“ political strikes are not allowed and neither is industrial action organized by a small number of employees .
at least not legally . ”
heading the union call on the contrary , strikers can only become such if rallied to do so by their union , and even they have limited power to make that call .
the collective agreements , which cover things like pay , holiday , working hours and pensions , severely limit the opportunities for employees to walk out at all .
“ as long as the agreement is valid , which generally varies between one and two years , there can be no strikes .
and then after the contract between the union and employer has expired , there is still a grace period of several weeks in which there can also be no walk outs , ” jurczyk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no ballot , no strike and even when that period , known as a “ peace obligation ” is over , strike action must be endorsed by at least 75 percent of union members .
a further “ hurdle , ” says jurczyk , is the employers ’ right to enforce a lockout , in which the entire workforce , strikers and non-strikers alike , are barred from the premises .
strike action must be last resort the whole system is designed to discourage escalation of disputes at every turn , and to instead encourage communication between the voice of the employees , the unions , and the employers .
and it is well oiled .
dr. heiner dribbusch works for the institute for economic and social research -lrb- wsi -rrb- in the hans böckler foundation , which is a research institute related to the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- . he says that although when push comes to shove , german workers are willing to exercise their , albeit limited , right to strike , they use it sparingly .
and the same , he says , is true of the unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union-backed demonstrations precede industrial action “ unions are doubtless interested in having as few restrictions as possible , so they can be the ones who make the decisions , ” dribbusch said .
“ but that said , they don ’ t use every opportunity they have to strike , which suggests that they don ’ t want to . ”
and one good reason for that is the generous replacement wages which unions have to pay to their striking members .
“ unions are cautious when it comes to calling for industrial action , not least because of the expense of having to fork out strike money , ” jurczyk said .
“ employees get paid more or less the same by the unions as they receive in their basic pay packet , and in a large workforce , that can add up to huge amounts of money . ”
too good to remain true ?
like so many german systems , the strike prevention one is precisely structured and designed to be of some benefit to everyone concerned .
and for those who do enjoy a right to strike , which public servants in germany incidentally do not , it is a system which has , over the past half decade , proved its worth .
“ take the chemical industry , for example , it has only witnessed one strike since the end of the war .
many employees in germany will go through their working life never having experienced any industrial action , ” dribbusch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taste of things to come ?
but there are signs that things are changing .
in the current economic climate , the demand for employment far outstrips the supply , and jurczyk says that is affecting the way in which collective agreements are negotiated .
“ employers ’ associations have begun to react to employees ’ demands in a more aggressive way , and to respond to them with counter demands .
they 're using the levels of unemployment as a threat to the existing workforce , ” he said .
“ whether such behavior will lead to more strikes , we don ’ t know .

the disaster came only days after a cypriot airplane hit a hillside near athens , taking the lives of 121 passengers , most of whom were cypriots . earlier this month a tunisian-operated charter plane crash landed at sea off the sicilian coast killing 13 people , including 12 italians . in reaction to the crash in venezuela , eu transportation officials have called for tougher safety measures .

the disaster came only days after a cypriot airplane hit a hillside near athens , taking the lives of 121 passengers , most of whom were cypriots . earlier this month a tunisian-operated charter plane crash landed at sea off the sicilian coast killing 13 people , including 12 italians . in reaction to the crash in venezuela , eu transportation officials have called for tougher safety measures .

german regulators are launching an investigation regarding possible insider dealings of daimlerchrysler 's shares .
the german-us company is already being probed on bribery charges in the us . suspecting possible insider trading and stock manipulation following the publicized resignation of daimlerchrysler 's chief executive jürgen schrempp on july 28 , the german federal agency for financial supervision -lrb- bafin -rrb- announced it was launching an official investigation . " we have launched a formal inquiry , " said the the bafin spokesperson sabine reimer on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schrempp 's resignation was announced on july 28 a formal inquiry means that financial institutions are required by law to disclose the names of all those involved in securities transactions .
purchasing or selling shares while privy to information which is not publicly available is considered illegal according to the german law . " we will find out from the credit institution who bought and who sold the shares , " said reimer . " then we 'll try to find cross-links to the people who knew about schrempp 's plans , " she said . the investigation is expected to take several weeks .

that could mean germany takes harsher measures against those deemed islamic militants . it 's the latest in a serious of no-nonsense actions from down south .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein announced thursday that he is expelling three more suspected islamic radicals .
this time , the three are members of a group called tablighi jamaat , which has about 450 members around germany and whose followers want to establish an islamic state , officials said .
german security officials have previously described the group as peaceful but said it could become infiltrated by radicals .
beckstein called them " missionaries " bent on spreading radical islam including the idea of " jihad , " or holy war , which encourages martyrdom through suicide attacks .
he added that bavaria would , with the expulsions , draw a clear and consistent line against " hate preachers " and suspected islamic militants .

a nationwide raid in january that led to the arrest of 22 suspected militants came after an investigation initiated by the bavarians .
soon after , beckstein said in a speech that more than 500 islamic extremists in germany " must be considered extremely dangerous " and that there are several thousand other fanatical muslims in the country .
his boss , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , has gone farther , saying that there are tens of thousands of radical muslims in germany , at least 4,000 of those he wants to deport for extremist activities .
increasing focus germany was forced to increase its efforts to clamp down on islamic radicals after it was discovered that the september 11 hijackers planned their attacks while living as students in hamburg .

computer games are big business in germany as the games convention in leipzig proves . for the next four days , avid computer fans can feast their insatiable appetites on a stunning array of state-of-the-art entertainment in an event which promises not to disappoint . thursday was the first day of the computer games convention , but even before the gates were thrown open , hundreds of eager fans had gathered outside in a bid to be among the first to size up the latest in computer game technology . bildunterschrift : visitors to the convention it calls itself " europe 's leading trade fair for interactive entertainment , infotainment and edutainment " , and with 280 exhibitors from 15 countries and some 110,000 visitors expected to show up , organisers could just be justified in blowing their event 's own trumpet . but just what is it that drives so many thousands of people into the loud lap of video entertainment when they could be outside creating their own in the sudden burst of summer sunshine ? fact is , there 's more to the event than row upon row of 21st century blow-your-mind , blow-up-the-world type games , which large slices of the general public still believe to be synonymous with computer-generated entertainment .
indeed , the organisers are promising something for everyone . family fair with an unprecedented 189 market premieres , including 52 from germany , 59 from europe and 98 from other parts of the world , it stands to be the most packed show in the trade fair 's short history , and although it will doubtless attract its fair share of die-hard gamers , there 's also a whole arm of the event dedicated to family entertainment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children and computers are no strange sight the convention 's family forum for media literacy , teaching and school software bills itself as a " special experience " for old and young . the convention has teamed up with leipzig university and media experts from academic to provide young computer users and their parents and teachers with invaluable information on how to overcome the choice paralysis brought on by the dazzling gamut of multimedia products available to even very young users . angela schierholz , who is a project director at the convention says manufacturers recognise the benefits of wooing their customers at the youngest possible age . " the growth in the number of exhibitors of over 50 percent compared to 2004 in this area , and the doubling of the surface area involved , show that the ability to handle new media competently is achieving increasing significance , " she said . the real thing but let there be no mistake that these four days of bright lights and simulated sound are not about being worthy , but about milking consumer enthusiasm . it 's a huge market , and big name games manufacturers are there in full force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the xbox factor microsoft is touting its new and improved xbox 360 which is to be launched on the european market for at tidy 299 euros -lrb- $ 346 -rrb- in time for st. nicholas to do the decent thing and spread it among all the little children . if they stick to their target , microsoft will be ahead of their main rivals sony and nintendo who are also planning to launch multi-tasking , super-sonic new consoles , but not until next year .
aficionados and addicts will just have to console themselves with some of the other thousands of products while they wait . the games convention runs from august 18th to august 21st and is open wednesday , thursday , friday and sunday from 9.00 to 18.00 , and on saturdays from 09.00 to 20.00 .

computer games are big business in germany as the games convention in leipzig proves . for the next four days , avid computer fans can feast their insatiable appetites on a stunning array of state-of-the-art entertainment in an event which promises not to disappoint . thursday was the first day of the computer games convention , but even before the gates were thrown open , hundreds of eager fans had gathered outside in a bid to be among the first to size up the latest in computer game technology . bildunterschrift : visitors to the convention it calls itself " europe 's leading trade fair for interactive entertainment , infotainment and edutainment " , and with 280 exhibitors from 15 countries and some 110,000 visitors expected to show up , organisers could just be justified in blowing their event 's own trumpet . but just what is it that drives so many thousands of people into the loud lap of video entertainment when they could be outside creating their own in the sudden burst of summer sunshine ? fact is , there 's more to the event than row upon row of 21st century blow-your-mind , blow-up-the-world type games , which large slices of the general public still believe to be synonymous with computer-generated entertainment .
indeed , the organisers are promising something for everyone . family fair with an unprecedented 189 market premieres , including 52 from germany , 59 from europe and 98 from other parts of the world , it stands to be the most packed show in the trade fair 's short history , and although it will doubtless attract its fair share of die-hard gamers , there 's also a whole arm of the event dedicated to family entertainment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children and computers are no strange sight the convention 's family forum for media literacy , teaching and school software bills itself as a " special experience " for old and young . the convention has teamed up with leipzig university and media experts from academic to provide young computer users and their parents and teachers with invaluable information on how to overcome the choice paralysis brought on by the dazzling gamut of multimedia products available to even very young users . angela schierholz , who is a project director at the convention says manufacturers recognise the benefits of wooing their customers at the youngest possible age .

angela merkel has announced she wants to appoint radical tax reform advocate paul kirchhof as finance minister if her party wins on sept .
18 .
it could radically remake german fiscal policy , conservative supporters say . when cdu leader and chancellor candidate angela merkel picked paul kirchhof , a heidelberg university professor and former constitutional court judge , as her top finance adviser wednesday , she signaled that she was ready to move towards radical reform .
" if it is up to me and the coalition talks allow it , he will become finance minister , " merkel said during a campaign stop .
kirchhof , 62 , is best known for a tax reform proposal he presented in 2003 which calls for a flat 25 percent tax for corporations and individuals .
but many financial experts and politicians criticize the choice because kirchhof , they say , is a political novice and lacks the cdu party connections to run the finance ministry effectively .
merkel 's plans could be derailed if bavarian premier edmund stoiber or a member of the free democrats , the likely coalition partner , lay claim to the portfolio .
the post is considered critical because of germany 's fight to cut its debt and lower its deficit .
must set good example kirchhof told the mass-circulation newspaper bild that if elected , the conservatives would bring the german budget deficit below the european union 's limit of three percent of gdp in the " near future . "
he also said that germany must again set a good financial example for europe .
bildunterschrift : angela 's a-team " i am convinced that government debt is currently the most dramatic problem we face , " he said .
" it 's simply obscene to pass this fundamental burden on to future generations . "
germany breached the eu stability pact rules for the third time last year and is expected to do so again 2005 .
this time , eu finance ministers may decide to penalize the country .
the conservatives have promised to get germany 's deficit below three percent by 2009 and balance the federal budget by 2013 . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's " dream team " conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel presented her so-called " competence team " on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.08.2005 germany , nation of reluctant strikers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " strike " , it says , but that 's easier said than done in germany .
german workers are renowned in industrial world circles for the cushy conditions upon which they luxuriously lounge .
but just how do they get them ?
not , it seems , by downing their tools and screaming injustice . in a study of strike culture in developed countries published last week by the institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- , german workers emerged as some of the most reluctant strikers .
the report , which observed walk-out tendencies in the 30 members of the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , revealed that between 1991 and 2000 , german workers notched up a meager 9.3 annual strike days per 1,000 employees .
only austrian , japanese and swiss employees recorded even greater committment to work , while at the other end of the scale , the number climbed surely and steadily to its canadian peak of 189 annual strike days within the same time frame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picket lines are a relative rarity in germany the discrepancy leaves room for considerable questions .
why is it that german workers , who are generally not afraid of grumbling about anything less than the best , rarely have to erect a picket line in order to get what they want ?
the answers , says jan jurczyk of the service industry trade union , verdi , are manifold .
“ in essence , it is not very easy to strike in germany .
we have a highly developed collective agreement system and strike action can only be taken in connection therewith , ” jurczyk said .
“ political strikes are not allowed and neither is industrial action organized by a small number of employees .
at least not legally . ”
heading the union call on the contrary , strikers can only become such if rallied to do so by their union , and even they have limited power to make that call .
the collective agreements , which cover things like pay , holiday , working hours and pensions , severely limit the opportunities for employees to walk out at all .
“ as long as the agreement is valid , which generally varies between one and two years , there can be no strikes .
and then after the contract between the union and employer has expired , there is still a grace period of several weeks in which there can also be no walk outs , ” jurczyk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no ballot , no strike and even when that period , known as a “ peace obligation ” is over , strike action must be endorsed by at least 75 percent of union members .
a further “ hurdle , ” says jurczyk , is the employers ’ right to enforce a lockout , in which the entire workforce , strikers and non-strikers alike , are barred from the premises .
strike action must be last resort the whole system is designed to discourage escalation of disputes at every turn , and to instead encourage communication between the voice of the employees , the unions , and the employers .
and it is well oiled .
dr. heiner dribbusch works for the institute for economic and social research -lrb- wsi -rrb- in the hans böckler foundation , which is a research institute related to the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- . he says that although when push comes to shove , german workers are willing to exercise their , albeit limited , right to strike , they use it sparingly .
and the same , he says , is true of the unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union-backed demonstrations precede industrial action “ unions are doubtless interested in having as few restrictions as possible , so they can be the ones who make the decisions , ” dribbusch said .
“ but that said , they don ’ t use every opportunity they have to strike , which suggests that they don ’ t want to . ”
and one good reason for that is the generous replacement wages which unions have to pay to their striking members .
“ unions are cautious when it comes to calling for industrial action , not least because of the expense of having to fork out strike money , ” jurczyk said .
“ employees get paid more or less the same by the unions as they receive in their basic pay packet , and in a large workforce , that can add up to huge amounts of money . ”
too good to remain true ?
like so many german systems , the strike prevention one is precisely structured and designed to be of some benefit to everyone concerned .
and for those who do enjoy a right to strike , which public servants in germany incidentally do not , it is a system which has , over the past half decade , proved its worth .
“ take the chemical industry , for example , it has only witnessed one strike since the end of the war .
many employees in germany will go through their working life never having experienced any industrial action , ” dribbusch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taste of things to come ?
but there are signs that things are changing .
in the current economic climate , the demand for employment far outstrips the supply , and jurczyk says that is affecting the way in which collective agreements are negotiated .
“ employers ’ associations have begun to react to employees ’ demands in a more aggressive way , and to respond to them with counter demands .
they 're using the levels of unemployment as a threat to the existing workforce , ” he said .
“ whether such behavior will lead to more strikes , we don ’ t know .
it hasn ’ t been decided yet . ” tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : world youth day 2005 german visas for the faithful germany prepares for world youth day prayer , and environmental protection tight security for pope 's youth gathering current affairs -pipe- 18.08.2005 young catholics forge own path in church großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : their views do n't necessarily coincide with the pope 's a lot of young catholics find rome out of touch with their world .
many of the young pilgrims in cologne this week have found new ways of living their religion , which sometimes involve ignoring official church doctrine . katja jarc knows fewer younger people are going to church .
the 18-year-old slovenian can see it every sunday when she single-handedly brings down parish 's average age .
" nearly everyone is at least 60 years old , " she said .
" it 's hard to find anyone my age there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims wait to enter the cologne cathedral finding more young people interested in religion is one of the reasons jarc decided to attend the world youth day event in cologne .
she 's achieved that goal , since there are some 400,000 young faithful who have come to cologne for prayer , song , revivals and some good old-fashioned partying .
the catholic festival also sent her on the pilgrimage of sorts even after she arrived in this city on the rhine .
this second pilgrimage was shorter , however , than the long trip from slovenia .
this one started at the river 's edge and ended at cologne 's famous cathedral .
" here there are so many friendly people who are interested in church and prayer , " she said as groups passed by .
some people were waving national flags ; others whispered the rosary in a handful of different languages .
" i want to meet as many people like me as i can here in cologne . "
covering a distance of about two kilometers -lrb- 1.2 miles -rrb- , the pilgrimage is intended to represent the three wise men 's search for god .
world youth day organizers have recommended all visitors take the walk before visiting the shrine to the biblical kings inside the cathedral .
differing view of church 's teaching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young catholics have their own ideas about faith though the 400,000 pilgrims from some 120 different countries are united by a single faith at the catholic festival , the young people 's interpretation of their religion tends to differ , especially when it comes to personal issues like contraception and abortion .
" something is n't right when there are so many devout believers in africa and lots of them end up dying of aids , " said daniela gall , 18 , who lives near munich .
but the church should n't just sway with the mores of the day either , according to bryan brochu of alberta , canada .
" one of the strengths of the church is that it does n't change every time society wants it to , " said brochu , 21 , as speakers played recordings of the hail mary in german , english , french and italian .
" there are people who say the church is too old school , but i think it should stick to its values and traditions . "
admitting that he is not overly religious , tobias straub , 18 , came to the world youth day at the urging of his priest at home in bavaria who told him to look at the church 's teachings as a lighthouse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pilgrimage continues outside the cathedral " there are times you really need some direction and other times you can go on your own , " he said as his group joined the parade snaking its way around the square outside the cathedral .
" people should decide for themselves . "
keeping youth interested catholicism should n't force all of its tenets on people who are looking for guidance since the church has bigger problems it should concentrate on , according to jarc .
" i think the church should concentrate more on finding ways to get more younger people interested in religion , " she said .
young people want to know the church is also taking them into consideration every day , not just when it 's organizing concerts along the rhine .
" i like the times when i can organize something like a mass or other meeting myself , " gall said .
" that and a great priest who helps us do what we want is what keeps me interested in the church 's youth group . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi will say mass for 800,000 on sunday in an interview with vatican radio , pope benedict xvi -lrb- photo -rrb- agreed that sparking interest in religion among youth is key to the world youth day 's success .
" if this zest , this joy , to know christ would come alive again and give the church in germany and europe a new dynamic , then i think the aim of world youth day would be achieved . "
according to jarc , the songs , prayers and chants of " hey , hey benito " heard along the pilgrims ' trail show that a spark has already been lit .
now it 's up to the church and the pilgrims to keep it from going out , she said .
" the world youth day is great , " she added .
" but it 's only one week . "

" welcome to germany , welcome home , " president köhler said . awaiting the 78-year-old pope are an estimated 400,000 young pilgrims gathered in the western german city of cologne . " that so many people have come to meet the successor of peter is a sign of the church 's vitality .
i am happy to be with them , confirm their faith and enliven their hope , " benedict xvi said upon arrival . crowds gathering on the rhine teeming masses of flag-waving young catholics lined the banks of the rhine waiting to catch their first glimpse of pope benedict xvi as he sailed up the river to join a global youth festival . " i will never forget this day , it was an awesome experience .
he seemed so full of joy as he waved to us , " said colleen ackerman , 25 , from cape town . for colleen and most of the crowd , it was their first view of a pope in the flesh and the man greeting them from the upper deck of the river cruiser did not disappoint . " we feel blessed that we were able to be here to see this , " said her friend teresa lawrence , 26 , also from cape town .
tens of thousands more were arriving in the city by train on thursday ahead of benedict 's first speech to the youth gathering at 5 pm .
organizers expect the crowd will swell to around a million by the time he celebrates an open-air mass in a park outside the city on sunday . the pope spent the early afternoon meeting with cologne archbishop cardinal joachim meisner at the archbishop 's residence , which will also serve as his lodgings during the world youth day . in the early evening , benedict xvi is also expected to visit the cologne cathedral . the pontiff 's visit is accompanied by high security .
a nato reconnaissance plane is protecting the air space over cologne during the catholic festival . around 4,000 police officers and thousands of private security personnel , 1,900 firefighters and 2,000 emergency medical workers are on duty .
25,000 volunteers are helping with the day-to-day functioning of the mega event . bildunterschrift : historic visit in possibly the most significant part of his trip , benedict will become only the second roman catholic leader in modern times to visit a jewish place of worship when he goes to a cologne synagogue on friday , almost two decades after john paul ii made a historic visit to rome 's main synagogue . benedict is also due to hold talks with muslim leaders .
the armenian-orthodox patriarch of istanbul and turkey , mesrob ii mutafayan , and vice-chariman of the german bishops conference , heinrich mussinhof , said on thursday that the interfaith dialogue during the world youth day was a " sign of hope for the church and the world . " the pope will preside at a saturday night vigil at the marienfeld park outside cologne with a crowd expected to be in the hundreds of thousands , followed by a huge open-air mass at the same venue on sunday . prayer and chaos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims from all over the world have gathered in cologne thousands attended a program of events on wednesday in warm sunshine which is expected to last until the end of the pope 's four-day visit on sunday . the flow of festival participants partly blocked the traffic around the cologne train station in the night between wednesday and thursday . " from 10 pm on , we had to occasionally close all access to the train station , " said a spokesperson for the cologne police .
" the crowds inside were unbelievable . " the traffic jam was caused by numerous pilgrims trying to return from festival events to their lodgings .
standing in long lines caused exhaustion and circulation problems for some pilgrims .
the situation normalized again around 2 am . a group of young french pilgrims who had made the trip to cologne said they were looking forward to seeing the new pope in the flesh . " the media have given us this image of a highly conservative man , but i am waiting to see what he says , " said thomas , 21 , from metz . forgetful pope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his mind was already in cologne , as was his image pope benedict xvi acknowledged wednesday that he was absent-minded after forgetting to bless the hundreds of pilgrims who attended his weekly audience at his castel gandolfo summer residence .
the crowd gathered in the palace courtyard was surprised to see the pope return to his window several moments after leaving after greeting pilgrims in several languages . " i ask for your forgiveness , but i have forgotten the most important greeting , the greeting to the pilgrims in the italian language , " he told them . he went back inside the palace , only to return again shortly . " today , i have forgotten the most important things .
one can see that i am already in cologne .

on wednesday night , coach jürgen klinsmann ’ s side faced their arch rivals the netherlands in rotterdam . with the netherlands currently ranked third in the world and germany ranked 11th german coach jürgen klinsmann knew his side faced a stiff task in the cauldron of rotterdam ’ s de kuip stadium .
the match finished in a 2-2 draw , a rather flattering result for the german side .
the dutch are spoilt for choice when it comes to world-class strikers and could allow themswelves to leave bayern munich ’ s striker roy makaay on the bench in the first half with ruud van nistelroy and arjen robben up front .
veteran defender christian wörns was recalled to the german side along with didi hamann to help sure up germany ’ s weak defense with midfielder bernd schneider playing at left back .
dutch coach van basten is a shrewd man , noticed schneider was playing out of position and switched arjen robben to the right wing to trouble schneider ... this move paid dividends early on as the dutch took a third minute lead through chelsea striker robben .
at half-time germany could count themselves lucky to be only one goal down as the dutch wasted several golden opportunities .
one minute into the second half though germany found themselves two goals down . again the scorer was arjen robben .
the game looked over .
klinsmann ’ s biggest defeat ?
jürgen klinsmann , the striker-turned coach was solely responsible for germany 's last victory over the oranje by converting a penalty for a 1-0 win in 1996 - also in rotterdam .
but on wednesday night , he looked as if he would be suffering his worst defeat as coach .
but michael ballack had other ideas and quickly pulled a goal back for germany with a diving header .
yet it was still the dutch magicians who were playing the beautiful football but who continued to squander chance after chance , hitting the crossbar twice .
suddenly germany broke and after good work by tim borowski , substitute gerald asamoah came in on the right to squeeze the ball over the line from an sharp angle .
2-2 was the final score . a typical german comeback and totally against the run of play .
while germany were delighted to equalise their miserable run against the big nations continues and it is 15 games since they defeated a recognised top team .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.08.2005 germany , nation of reluctant strikers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " strike " , it says , but that 's easier said than done in germany .
german workers are renowned in industrial world circles for the cushy conditions upon which they luxuriously lounge .
but just how do they get them ?
not , it seems , by downing their tools and screaming injustice . in a study of strike culture in developed countries published last week by the institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- , german workers emerged as some of the most reluctant strikers .
the report , which observed walk-out tendencies in the 30 members of the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , revealed that between 1991 and 2000 , german workers notched up a meager 9.3 annual strike days per 1,000 employees .
only austrian , japanese and swiss employees recorded even greater committment to work , while at the other end of the scale , the number climbed surely and steadily to its canadian peak of 189 annual strike days within the same time frame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picket lines are a relative rarity in germany the discrepancy leaves room for considerable questions .
why is it that german workers , who are generally not afraid of grumbling about anything less than the best , rarely have to erect a picket line in order to get what they want ?
the answers , says jan jurczyk of the service industry trade union , verdi , are manifold .
“ in essence , it is not very easy to strike in germany .
we have a highly developed collective agreement system and strike action can only be taken in connection therewith , ” jurczyk said .
“ political strikes are not allowed and neither is industrial action organized by a small number of employees .
at least not legally . ”
heading the union call on the contrary , strikers can only become such if rallied to do so by their union , and even they have limited power to make that call .
the collective agreements , which cover things like pay , holiday , working hours and pensions , severely limit the opportunities for employees to walk out at all .
“ as long as the agreement is valid , which generally varies between one and two years , there can be no strikes .
and then after the contract between the union and employer has expired , there is still a grace period of several weeks in which there can also be no walk outs , ” jurczyk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no ballot , no strike and even when that period , known as a “ peace obligation ” is over , strike action must be endorsed by at least 75 percent of union members .
a further “ hurdle , ” says jurczyk , is the employers ’ right to enforce a lockout , in which the entire workforce , strikers and non-strikers alike , are barred from the premises .
strike action must be last resort the whole system is designed to discourage escalation of disputes at every turn , and to instead encourage communication between the voice of the employees , the unions , and the employers .
and it is well oiled .
dr. heiner dribbusch works for the institute for economic and social research -lrb- wsi -rrb- in the hans böckler foundation , which is a research institute related to the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- . he says that although when push comes to shove , german workers are willing to exercise their , albeit limited , right to strike , they use it sparingly .
and the same , he says , is true of the unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union-backed demonstrations precede industrial action “ unions are doubtless interested in having as few restrictions as possible , so they can be the ones who make the decisions , ” dribbusch said .
“ but that said , they don ’ t use every opportunity they have to strike , which suggests that they don ’ t want to . ”
and one good reason for that is the generous replacement wages which unions have to pay to their striking members .
“ unions are cautious when it comes to calling for industrial action , not least because of the expense of having to fork out strike money , ” jurczyk said .
“ employees get paid more or less the same by the unions as they receive in their basic pay packet , and in a large workforce , that can add up to huge amounts of money . ”
too good to remain true ?
like so many german systems , the strike prevention one is precisely structured and designed to be of some benefit to everyone concerned .
and for those who do enjoy a right to strike , which public servants in germany incidentally do not , it is a system which has , over the past half decade , proved its worth .
“ take the chemical industry , for example , it has only witnessed one strike since the end of the war .
many employees in germany will go through their working life never having experienced any industrial action , ” dribbusch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taste of things to come ?
but there are signs that things are changing .
in the current economic climate , the demand for employment far outstrips the supply , and jurczyk says that is affecting the way in which collective agreements are negotiated .
“ employers ’ associations have begun to react to employees ’ demands in a more aggressive way , and to respond to them with counter demands .
they 're using the levels of unemployment as a threat to the existing workforce , ” he said .
“ whether such behavior will lead to more strikes , we don ’ t know .
it hasn ’ t been decided yet . ” tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

german workers are renowned in industrial world circles for the cushy conditions upon which they luxuriously lounge .
but just how do they get them ?
not , it seems , by downing their tools and screaming injustice . in a study of strike culture in developed countries published last week by the institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- , german workers emerged as some of the most reluctant strikers .
the report , which observed walk-out tendencies in the 30 members of the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , revealed that between 1991 and 2000 , german workers notched up a meager 9.3 annual strike days per 1,000 employees .
only austrian , japanese and swiss employees recorded even greater committment to work , while at the other end of the scale , the number climbed surely and steadily to its canadian peak of 189 annual strike days within the same time frame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picket lines are a relative rarity in germany the discrepancy leaves room for considerable questions .
why is it that german workers , who are generally not afraid of grumbling about anything less than the best , rarely have to erect a picket line in order to get what they want ?
the answers , says jan jurczyk of the service industry trade union , verdi , are manifold .
“ in essence , it is not very easy to strike in germany .
we have a highly developed collective agreement system and strike action can only be taken in connection therewith , ” jurczyk said .
“ political strikes are not allowed and neither is industrial action organized by a small number of employees .

heading the union call on the contrary , strikers can only become such if rallied to do so by their union , and even they have limited power to make that call .
the collective agreements , which cover things like pay , holiday , working hours and pensions , severely limit the opportunities for employees to walk out at all .

angela merkel has announced she wants to appoint radical tax reform advocate paul kirchhof as finance minister if her party wins on sept .
18 .
it could radically remake german fiscal policy , conservative supporters say . when cdu leader and chancellor candidate angela merkel picked paul kirchhof , a heidelberg university professor and former constitutional court judge , as her top finance adviser wednesday , she signaled that she was ready to move towards radical reform .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.08.2005 a harder line on suspected extremists ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenther beckstein wants zero tolerance for extremists if angela merkel becomes the next chancellor , günther beckstein will probably replace otto schilly as federal interior minister .
that could mean germany takes harsher measures against those deemed islamic militants . it 's the latest in a serious of no-nonsense actions from down south .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein announced thursday that he is expelling three more suspected islamic radicals .
this time , the three are members of a group called tablighi jamaat , which has about 450 members around germany and whose followers want to establish an islamic state , officials said .
german security officials have previously described the group as peaceful but said it could become infiltrated by radicals .
beckstein called them " missionaries " bent on spreading radical islam including the idea of " jihad , " or holy war , which encourages martyrdom through suicide attacks .
he added that bavaria would , with the expulsions , draw a clear and consistent line against " hate preachers " and suspected islamic militants .
" we want to make it clear to islamic extremists that the bavarian government wo n't tolerate anyone who wants to replace our free and democratic order with an islamic state , " he said in a statement .
the three , two bosnians and a moroccan , have until sept .
10 to leave or face deportation .
bavarians most aggressive since a new immigration law took effect in january , making it easier and faster to expel suspected islamic militants , bavaria has been quick to make the most of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber wants more action so far , the wealthy southern state has deported 16 people it suspected of militant activities , began proceedings on 26 more and moving on 10 more .
that is more than any of the other 15 german states so far , officials said .
it comes as little surprise .
a nationwide raid in january that led to the arrest of 22 suspected militants came after an investigation initiated by the bavarians .
soon after , beckstein said in a speech that more than 500 islamic extremists in germany " must be considered extremely dangerous " and that there are several thousand other fanatical muslims in the country .
his boss , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , has gone farther , saying that there are tens of thousands of radical muslims in germany , at least 4,000 of those he wants to deport for extremist activities .
increasing focus germany was forced to increase its efforts to clamp down on islamic radicals after it was discovered that the september 11 hijackers planned their attacks while living as students in hamburg .
last year , schilly said that the fight against islamic militants was a top priority .

that could mean germany takes harsher measures against those deemed islamic militants . it 's the latest in a serious of no-nonsense actions from down south .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein announced thursday that he is expelling three more suspected islamic radicals .
this time , the three are members of a group called tablighi jamaat , which has about 450 members around germany and whose followers want to establish an islamic state , officials said .
german security officials have previously described the group as peaceful but said it could become infiltrated by radicals .
beckstein called them " missionaries " bent on spreading radical islam including the idea of " jihad , " or holy war , which encourages martyrdom through suicide attacks .
he added that bavaria would , with the expulsions , draw a clear and consistent line against " hate preachers " and suspected islamic militants .
" we want to make it clear to islamic extremists that the bavarian government wo n't tolerate anyone who wants to replace our free and democratic order with an islamic state , " he said in a statement .
the three , two bosnians and a moroccan , have until sept .

bavarians most aggressive since a new immigration law took effect in january , making it easier and faster to expel suspected islamic militants , bavaria has been quick to make the most of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber wants more action so far , the wealthy southern state has deported 16 people it suspected of militant activities , began proceedings on 26 more and moving on 10 more .
that is more than any of the other 15 german states so far , officials said .
it comes as little surprise .
a nationwide raid in january that led to the arrest of 22 suspected militants came after an investigation initiated by the bavarians .
soon after , beckstein said in a speech that more than 500 islamic extremists in germany " must be considered extremely dangerous " and that there are several thousand other fanatical muslims in the country .
his boss , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , has gone farther , saying that there are tens of thousands of radical muslims in germany , at least 4,000 of those he wants to deport for extremist activities .
increasing focus germany was forced to increase its efforts to clamp down on islamic radicals after it was discovered that the september 11 hijackers planned their attacks while living as students in hamburg .
last year , schilly said that the fight against islamic militants was a top priority .
as a result , the government established an anti-terror command headquarters in berlin .

that could mean germany takes harsher measures against those deemed islamic militants . it 's the latest in a serious of no-nonsense actions from down south .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein announced thursday that he is expelling three more suspected islamic radicals .
this time , the three are members of a group called tablighi jamaat , which has about 450 members around germany and whose followers want to establish an islamic state , officials said .
german security officials have previously described the group as peaceful but said it could become infiltrated by radicals .
beckstein called them " missionaries " bent on spreading radical islam including the idea of " jihad , " or holy war , which encourages martyrdom through suicide attacks .
he added that bavaria would , with the expulsions , draw a clear and consistent line against " hate preachers " and suspected islamic militants .
" we want to make it clear to islamic extremists that the bavarian government wo n't tolerate anyone who wants to replace our free and democratic order with an islamic state , " he said in a statement .
the three , two bosnians and a moroccan , have until sept .
10 to leave or face deportation .
bavarians most aggressive since a new immigration law took effect in january , making it easier and faster to expel suspected islamic militants , bavaria has been quick to make the most of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber wants more action so far , the wealthy southern state has deported 16 people it suspected of militant activities , began proceedings on 26 more and moving on 10 more .
that is more than any of the other 15 german states so far , officials said .
it comes as little surprise .
a nationwide raid in january that led to the arrest of 22 suspected militants came after an investigation initiated by the bavarians .
soon after , beckstein said in a speech that more than 500 islamic extremists in germany " must be considered extremely dangerous " and that there are several thousand other fanatical muslims in the country .
his boss , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , has gone farther , saying that there are tens of thousands of radical muslims in germany , at least 4,000 of those he wants to deport for extremist activities .
increasing focus germany was forced to increase its efforts to clamp down on islamic radicals after it was discovered that the september 11 hijackers planned their attacks while living as students in hamburg .
last year , schilly said that the fight against islamic militants was a top priority .
as a result , the government established an anti-terror command headquarters in berlin .

deporting people is especially tricky for germany in light of its nazi legacy .
at the same time , germans worry about harboring extremists and populist sentiments by politicians such as stoiber against muslim immigrants suspected of radicalism appeal to many .
security experts applaud the stepped up efforts by the government to address extremism but still complain that too little has been done .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber wants more action so far , the wealthy southern state has deported 16 people it suspected of militant activities , began proceedings on 26 more and moving on 10 more .
that is more than any of the other 15 german states so far , officials said .
it comes as little surprise .
a nationwide raid in january that led to the arrest of 22 suspected militants came after an investigation initiated by the bavarians .
soon after , beckstein said in a speech that more than 500 islamic extremists in germany " must be considered extremely dangerous " and that there are several thousand other fanatical muslims in the country .
his boss , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , has gone farther , saying that there are tens of thousands of radical muslims in germany , at least 4,000 of those he wants to deport for extremist activities .
increasing focus germany was forced to increase its efforts to clamp down on islamic radicals after it was discovered that the september 11 hijackers planned their attacks while living as students in hamburg .
last year , schilly said that the fight against islamic militants was a top priority .
as a result , the government established an anti-terror command headquarters in berlin .
on jan .
1 , the new immigration law which eases immigration for skilled workers also requires a detailed background check on every immigrant and eases the deportation of those designated " islamic hate preachers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan , the caliph of cologne , was extradited after a long process since then , the most recent extradition of an islamic militant was of metin kaplan to turkey for disseminating fundamentalist propaganda during his sermons .
kaplan had lived for decades in cologne .
deporting people is especially tricky for germany in light of its nazi legacy .
at the same time , germans worry about harboring extremists and populist sentiments by politicians such as stoiber against muslim immigrants suspected of radicalism appeal to many .
security experts applaud the stepped up efforts by the government to address extremism but still complain that too little has been done .
that will probably change with a new government - merkel has selected beckstein to replace schilly if she wins the election and his fervor for deporting suspected radicals could soon be felt on the federal level . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's arabs struggle to fit in germany is home to an estimated 280,000 people of arab extraction .

computer games are big business in germany as the games convention in leipzig proves . for the next four days , avid computer fans can feast their insatiable appetites on a stunning array of state-of-the-art entertainment in an event which promises not to disappoint . thursday was the first day of the computer games convention , but even before the gates were thrown open , hundreds of eager fans had gathered outside in a bid to be among the first to size up the latest in computer game technology . bildunterschrift : visitors to the convention it calls itself " europe 's leading trade fair for interactive entertainment , infotainment and edutainment " , and with 280 exhibitors from 15 countries and some 110,000 visitors expected to show up , organisers could just be justified in blowing their event 's own trumpet . but just what is it that drives so many thousands of people into the loud lap of video entertainment when they could be outside creating their own in the sudden burst of summer sunshine ? fact is , there 's more to the event than row upon row of 21st century blow-your-mind , blow-up-the-world type games , which large slices of the general public still believe to be synonymous with computer-generated entertainment .
indeed , the organisers are promising something for everyone . family fair with an unprecedented 189 market premieres , including 52 from germany , 59 from europe and 98 from other parts of the world , it stands to be the most packed show in the trade fair 's short history , and although it will doubtless attract its fair share of die-hard gamers , there 's also a whole arm of the event dedicated to family entertainment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children and computers are no strange sight the convention 's family forum for media literacy , teaching and school software bills itself as a " special experience " for old and young . the convention has teamed up with leipzig university and media experts from academic to provide young computer users and their parents and teachers with invaluable information on how to overcome the choice paralysis brought on by the dazzling gamut of multimedia products available to even very young users . angela schierholz , who is a project director at the convention says manufacturers recognise the benefits of wooing their customers at the youngest possible age . " the growth in the number of exhibitors of over 50 percent compared to 2004 in this area , and the doubling of the surface area involved , show that the ability to handle new media competently is achieving increasing significance , " she said . the real thing but let there be no mistake that these four days of bright lights and simulated sound are not about being worthy , but about milking consumer enthusiasm . it 's a huge market , and big name games manufacturers are there in full force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the xbox factor microsoft is touting its new and improved xbox 360 which is to be launched on the european market for at tidy 299 euros -lrb- $ 346 -rrb- in time for st. nicholas to do the decent thing and spread it among all the little children . if they stick to their target , microsoft will be ahead of their main rivals sony and nintendo who are also planning to launch multi-tasking , super-sonic new consoles , but not until next year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : world youth day 2005 german visas for the faithful germany prepares for world youth day prayer , and environmental protection tight security for pope 's youth gathering current affairs -pipe- 18.08.2005 young catholics forge own path in church großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : their views do n't necessarily coincide with the pope 's a lot of young catholics find rome out of touch with their world .
many of the young pilgrims in cologne this week have found new ways of living their religion , which sometimes involve ignoring official church doctrine . katja jarc knows fewer younger people are going to church .
the 18-year-old slovenian can see it every sunday when she single-handedly brings down parish 's average age .
" nearly everyone is at least 60 years old , " she said .
" it 's hard to find anyone my age there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims wait to enter the cologne cathedral finding more young people interested in religion is one of the reasons jarc decided to attend the world youth day event in cologne .
she 's achieved that goal , since there are some 400,000 young faithful who have come to cologne for prayer , song , revivals and some good old-fashioned partying .
the catholic festival also sent her on the pilgrimage of sorts even after she arrived in this city on the rhine .
this second pilgrimage was shorter , however , than the long trip from slovenia .
this one started at the river 's edge and ended at cologne 's famous cathedral .
" here there are so many friendly people who are interested in church and prayer , " she said as groups passed by .
some people were waving national flags ; others whispered the rosary in a handful of different languages .
" i want to meet as many people like me as i can here in cologne . "
covering a distance of about two kilometers -lrb- 1.2 miles -rrb- , the pilgrimage is intended to represent the three wise men 's search for god .
world youth day organizers have recommended all visitors take the walk before visiting the shrine to the biblical kings inside the cathedral .
differing view of church 's teaching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young catholics have their own ideas about faith though the 400,000 pilgrims from some 120 different countries are united by a single faith at the catholic festival , the young people 's interpretation of their religion tends to differ , especially when it comes to personal issues like contraception and abortion .
" something is n't right when there are so many devout believers in africa and lots of them end up dying of aids , " said daniela gall , 18 , who lives near munich .
but the church should n't just sway with the mores of the day either , according to bryan brochu of alberta , canada .
" one of the strengths of the church is that it does n't change every time society wants it to , " said brochu , 21 , as speakers played recordings of the hail mary in german , english , french and italian .
" there are people who say the church is too old school , but i think it should stick to its values and traditions . "
admitting that he is not overly religious , tobias straub , 18 , came to the world youth day at the urging of his priest at home in bavaria who told him to look at the church 's teachings as a lighthouse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pilgrimage continues outside the cathedral " there are times you really need some direction and other times you can go on your own , " he said as his group joined the parade snaking its way around the square outside the cathedral .
" people should decide for themselves . "
keeping youth interested catholicism should n't force all of its tenets on people who are looking for guidance since the church has bigger problems it should concentrate on , according to jarc .
" i think the church should concentrate more on finding ways to get more younger people interested in religion , " she said .
young people want to know the church is also taking them into consideration every day , not just when it 's organizing concerts along the rhine .
" i like the times when i can organize something like a mass or other meeting myself , " gall said .
" that and a great priest who helps us do what we want is what keeps me interested in the church 's youth group . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi will say mass for 800,000 on sunday in an interview with vatican radio , pope benedict xvi -lrb- photo -rrb- agreed that sparking interest in religion among youth is key to the world youth day 's success .
" if this zest , this joy , to know christ would come alive again and give the church in germany and europe a new dynamic , then i think the aim of world youth day would be achieved . "
according to jarc , the songs , prayers and chants of " hey , hey benito " heard along the pilgrims ' trail show that a spark has already been lit .
now it 's up to the church and the pilgrims to keep it from going out , she said .

many of the young pilgrims in cologne this week have found new ways of living their religion , which sometimes involve ignoring official church doctrine . katja jarc knows fewer younger people are going to church .
the 18-year-old slovenian can see it every sunday when she single-handedly brings down parish 's average age .
" nearly everyone is at least 60 years old , " she said .
" it 's hard to find anyone my age there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims wait to enter the cologne cathedral finding more young people interested in religion is one of the reasons jarc decided to attend the world youth day event in cologne .
she 's achieved that goal , since there are some 400,000 young faithful who have come to cologne for prayer , song , revivals and some good old-fashioned partying .
the catholic festival also sent her on the pilgrimage of sorts even after she arrived in this city on the rhine .
this second pilgrimage was shorter , however , than the long trip from slovenia .
this one started at the river 's edge and ended at cologne 's famous cathedral .
" here there are so many friendly people who are interested in church and prayer , " she said as groups passed by .
some people were waving national flags ; others whispered the rosary in a handful of different languages .
" i want to meet as many people like me as i can here in cologne . "
covering a distance of about two kilometers -lrb- 1.2 miles -rrb- , the pilgrimage is intended to represent the three wise men 's search for god .
world youth day organizers have recommended all visitors take the walk before visiting the shrine to the biblical kings inside the cathedral .
differing view of church 's teaching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young catholics have their own ideas about faith though the 400,000 pilgrims from some 120 different countries are united by a single faith at the catholic festival , the young people 's interpretation of their religion tends to differ , especially when it comes to personal issues like contraception and abortion .
" something is n't right when there are so many devout believers in africa and lots of them end up dying of aids , " said daniela gall , 18 , who lives near munich .
but the church should n't just sway with the mores of the day either , according to bryan brochu of alberta , canada .
" one of the strengths of the church is that it does n't change every time society wants it to , " said brochu , 21 , as speakers played recordings of the hail mary in german , english , french and italian .
" there are people who say the church is too old school , but i think it should stick to its values and traditions . "
admitting that he is not overly religious , tobias straub , 18 , came to the world youth day at the urging of his priest at home in bavaria who told him to look at the church 's teachings as a lighthouse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pilgrimage continues outside the cathedral " there are times you really need some direction and other times you can go on your own , " he said as his group joined the parade snaking its way around the square outside the cathedral .
" people should decide for themselves . "
keeping youth interested catholicism should n't force all of its tenets on people who are looking for guidance since the church has bigger problems it should concentrate on , according to jarc .
" i think the church should concentrate more on finding ways to get more younger people interested in religion , " she said .
young people want to know the church is also taking them into consideration every day , not just when it 's organizing concerts along the rhine .
" i like the times when i can organize something like a mass or other meeting myself , " gall said .
" that and a great priest who helps us do what we want is what keeps me interested in the church 's youth group . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi will say mass for 800,000 on sunday in an interview with vatican radio , pope benedict xvi -lrb- photo -rrb- agreed that sparking interest in religion among youth is key to the world youth day 's success .
" if this zest , this joy , to know christ would come alive again and give the church in germany and europe a new dynamic , then i think the aim of world youth day would be achieved . "
according to jarc , the songs , prayers and chants of " hey , hey benito " heard along the pilgrims ' trail show that a spark has already been lit .
now it 's up to the church and the pilgrims to keep it from going out , she said .
" the world youth day is great , " she added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : world youth day 2005 german visas for the faithful germany prepares for world youth day prayer , and environmental protection tight security for pope 's youth gathering current affairs -pipe- 18.08.2005 young catholics forge own path in church großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : their views do n't necessarily coincide with the pope 's a lot of young catholics find rome out of touch with their world .
many of the young pilgrims in cologne this week have found new ways of living their religion , which sometimes involve ignoring official church doctrine . katja jarc knows fewer younger people are going to church .
the 18-year-old slovenian can see it every sunday when she single-handedly brings down parish 's average age .
" nearly everyone is at least 60 years old , " she said .
" it 's hard to find anyone my age there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims wait to enter the cologne cathedral finding more young people interested in religion is one of the reasons jarc decided to attend the world youth day event in cologne .
she 's achieved that goal , since there are some 400,000 young faithful who have come to cologne for prayer , song , revivals and some good old-fashioned partying .
the catholic festival also sent her on the pilgrimage of sorts even after she arrived in this city on the rhine .
this second pilgrimage was shorter , however , than the long trip from slovenia .
this one started at the river 's edge and ended at cologne 's famous cathedral .
" here there are so many friendly people who are interested in church and prayer , " she said as groups passed by .
some people were waving national flags ; others whispered the rosary in a handful of different languages .
" i want to meet as many people like me as i can here in cologne . "
covering a distance of about two kilometers -lrb- 1.2 miles -rrb- , the pilgrimage is intended to represent the three wise men 's search for god .
world youth day organizers have recommended all visitors take the walk before visiting the shrine to the biblical kings inside the cathedral .
differing view of church 's teaching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young catholics have their own ideas about faith though the 400,000 pilgrims from some 120 different countries are united by a single faith at the catholic festival , the young people 's interpretation of their religion tends to differ , especially when it comes to personal issues like contraception and abortion .
" something is n't right when there are so many devout believers in africa and lots of them end up dying of aids , " said daniela gall , 18 , who lives near munich .
but the church should n't just sway with the mores of the day either , according to bryan brochu of alberta , canada .
" one of the strengths of the church is that it does n't change every time society wants it to , " said brochu , 21 , as speakers played recordings of the hail mary in german , english , french and italian .
" there are people who say the church is too old school , but i think it should stick to its values and traditions . "
admitting that he is not overly religious , tobias straub , 18 , came to the world youth day at the urging of his priest at home in bavaria who told him to look at the church 's teachings as a lighthouse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pilgrimage continues outside the cathedral " there are times you really need some direction and other times you can go on your own , " he said as his group joined the parade snaking its way around the square outside the cathedral .
" people should decide for themselves . "
keeping youth interested catholicism should n't force all of its tenets on people who are looking for guidance since the church has bigger problems it should concentrate on , according to jarc .
" i think the church should concentrate more on finding ways to get more younger people interested in religion , " she said .
young people want to know the church is also taking them into consideration every day , not just when it 's organizing concerts along the rhine .
" i like the times when i can organize something like a mass or other meeting myself , " gall said .
" that and a great priest who helps us do what we want is what keeps me interested in the church 's youth group . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi will say mass for 800,000 on sunday in an interview with vatican radio , pope benedict xvi -lrb- photo -rrb- agreed that sparking interest in religion among youth is key to the world youth day 's success .
" if this zest , this joy , to know christ would come alive again and give the church in germany and europe a new dynamic , then i think the aim of world youth day would be achieved . "
according to jarc , the songs , prayers and chants of " hey , hey benito " heard along the pilgrims ' trail show that a spark has already been lit .
now it 's up to the church and the pilgrims to keep it from going out , she said .
" the world youth day is great , " she added .
" but it 's only one week . "

the disaster came only days after a cypriot airplane hit a hillside near athens , taking the lives of 121 passengers , most of whom were cypriots . earlier this month a tunisian-operated charter plane crash landed at sea off the sicilian coast killing 13 people , including 12 italians . in reaction to the crash in venezuela , eu transportation officials have called for tougher safety measures . " this accident … shows that we must collectively step up efforts to ensure the highest level of air transport security in europe and shelter all of the -lrb- european -rrb- union 's passengers and crew from such dramas , " said eu transport commissioner jacques barrot . beefing up checks in january 2004 , the crash in egypt of a boeing airliner operated by flash airlines , which killed 148 people , spurred the eu into action after years of negotiations and led to a beefing-up of safety checks on non-eu airplanes at airports in member states . the transport commissioner at the time , loyola de palacio , was quick to say that the flash airlines accident probably would never have happened had the rules been in place before the crash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent air disasters are spurring a new look at air safety in 1994 , the eu made it a requirement after air accidents that a technical probe be carried out by a body independent of the national civil aviation authorities . but like many eu rules , this one has not always been followed by all member states .

" the commissioner aims to extend in the coming months the responsibilities of the european aviation safety agency -lrb- easa -rrb- , which currently issues airworthiness certificates for aeronautical products , parts and equipment . in particular , barrot wants to see the easa play a greater role in monitoring flight safety and the security of non-eu airlines , and in certifying crew members . bildunterschrift : before the crash in venezuela keeping passengers in the loop plans for regulations on keeping passengers informed about flights are also in the works . ahead of a first reading of the regulations by the european parliament , eu members agreed in principle in april that passengers be informed as soon as possible and , in any case , before take-off of changes in the airline operating a flight . the new rules also propose improved information exchange about grounded airlines , although belgium , france , germany and spain want more coordination on the criteria used to designate such carriers . new legislation a 2004 regulation on the safety of airplanes from non-eu members , which members have until may 2006 to adopt into their national legislation , opens the way for an eu-wide flight ban if such a ban has been declared by a single member state . however , an extension of the regulation would have to be proposed by the european commission and backed by a qualified majority of member states , which tend to jealously hold on to their authority to authorize flights . the lack of eu-wide coordination sparked chaos in may when thousands of passengers were left stranded after a ban on turkish carrier onur air - by france , germany , the netherlands and switzerland - until their flights were finally rerouted via belgium . blacklist possible the european commission is considering publishing a blacklist of airlines and aircraft subject to bans or restrictions in eu member states on the internet , barrot said wednesday . the european union blacklist idea is similar to a mechanism already operational in the united states , where would-be passengers can consult a website publishing the names of airlines with relatively poor safety records .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.08.2005 german cars overtaken in eco-race großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not all environmentally sound , but which are the culprits ?
it 's might be hard to believe , but the great master of vorsprung durch technik , the german automobile industry , is no longer in pole position in the race to make modern cars more environmentally friendly . a study published on wednesday by germany 's automobile club , vcd , revealed that japan and france have their feet to the floor when it comes to environmental matters , and have left german car manufacturers spluttering in their wake . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the smart car is too small to do too much damage the vcd have been assessing anti-pollution merits of popular cars since 1989 , and the findings from their most recent review were the worst ever for germany , which only managed to squeeze one model , the opel corsa eco 1.0 into the top ten . and even that only made it into sixth place on the ranking table . it 's bad news for germany , which is currently still ruled in part by the green party , and which has long nurtured its reputation for being environmentally altruistic . bad boy volkswagen the vcd was particularly harsh in its criticism of the peoples ' favorite , volkswagen , for not installing a particle-filter to counter diesel soot in its best-selling model , the golf . " german manufacturers face the prospect of losing touch with environmental technology , " said deputy vcd chairman , hermann-josef vogt .
and the upshot of that , says the report , is that germany could lose credibility as a centre of automobile technology , subsequently become less competitive and having to shed jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can environmental technology keep up with the cars ?
the comments were met with roaring disapproval from the german association of the automotive industry , vda , which delivered a vitriolic response , accusing the automobile club of being a " smorgasbord of smug , self-important people with no substance " and describing the report as being " disproportionately out of touch with reality . " so exactly what is the reality ?
simply that toyota tops the list - which measures cars for both economic virtue and emission levels - with its no frills prius 1 , and that citroen , peugeot and daihatsu are hotter on its wheels than any german make . missed opportunity a spokesman for the vcd said it need not have been that way , and that volkswagen could have pipped toyota to the post had it concentrated less on honing its super-speed luxury limos and simply installed standard-issue filters in its audi 2 and lupo model , which have now been withdrawn from the market . # b # the spokesman , gerd lottsiepen , said that without the filter , diesel cars were " yesterday 's technology " , and a clear statement from the makers that they do n't care about the health of their customers . solicitousness was higher in the compact car category , which featured two appearances each from mercedes and opel and one from audi , but there was again a conspicuous absence of german names on the list of family models .
vw just managed to roll onto the bottom of the table at tenth place with its golf 2.0 variant bifuel . that 's not good enough for lottsiepen , who says it is time for the government , however it may look following the elections , to introduce tax benefits on cars which are equipped with today 's technology . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers move on diesel filters the eu 's new clean air law and hesitant consumers are causing german carmakers to scramble to equip diesel cars with soot filters as several german cities have reached pollution levels that require driving bans .
-lrb- march 30 , 2005 -rrb- german cars still stars ... for now in germany , it used to be that you knew you 'd made it in life when you bought your first mercedes .
but as affordable foreign cars offer consumers an attractive alternative , how long will this still be the case ?

it will be the end of a lengthy , costly legal odyssey that could end in an acquittal .
mounir el motassadeq of morocco was the first man to go on trial over the atrocities in new york and washington that killed more than 3,000 people and was sentenced to the maximum 15 years in prison in february 2003 .
but a german federal tribunal overturned the verdict last year and sent the case back to the court in the northern city of hamburg , where three of the 19 suicide hijackers lived and studied for several years .
motassadeq 's attorney ladislav anisic said there was no evidence that directly linked his client to the plot and argued that motassadeq was being tried simply on guilt by association .
german observers say the prosecution 's case has been weakened by the failure of the united states to hand over more information on two top al qaeda operatives in its custody . dw-world.de 9/11 suspect trial resumes after delay a moroccan student being retried over involvement in the september 11 , 2001 attacks in new york and washington , provided " active support " to the suicide pilots , the federal prosecutor told a german court on monday .

computer games are big business in germany as the games convention in leipzig proves . for the next four days , avid computer fans can feast their insatiable appetites on a stunning array of state-of-the-art entertainment in an event which promises not to disappoint . thursday was the first day of the computer games convention , but even before the gates were thrown open , hundreds of eager fans had gathered outside in a bid to be among the first to size up the latest in computer game technology . bildunterschrift : visitors to the convention it calls itself " europe 's leading trade fair for interactive entertainment , infotainment and edutainment " , and with 280 exhibitors from 15 countries and some 110,000 visitors expected to show up , organisers could just be justified in blowing their event 's own trumpet . but just what is it that drives so many thousands of people into the loud lap of video entertainment when they could be outside creating their own in the sudden burst of summer sunshine ? fact is , there 's more to the event than row upon row of 21st century blow-your-mind , blow-up-the-world type games , which large slices of the general public still believe to be synonymous with computer-generated entertainment .
indeed , the organisers are promising something for everyone . family fair with an unprecedented 189 market premieres , including 52 from germany , 59 from europe and 98 from other parts of the world , it stands to be the most packed show in the trade fair 's short history , and although it will doubtless attract its fair share of die-hard gamers , there 's also a whole arm of the event dedicated to family entertainment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children and computers are no strange sight the convention 's family forum for media literacy , teaching and school software bills itself as a " special experience " for old and young . the convention has teamed up with leipzig university and media experts from academic to provide young computer users and their parents and teachers with invaluable information on how to overcome the choice paralysis brought on by the dazzling gamut of multimedia products available to even very young users . angela schierholz , who is a project director at the convention says manufacturers recognise the benefits of wooing their customers at the youngest possible age . " the growth in the number of exhibitors of over 50 percent compared to 2004 in this area , and the doubling of the surface area involved , show that the ability to handle new media competently is achieving increasing significance , " she said . the real thing but let there be no mistake that these four days of bright lights and simulated sound are not about being worthy , but about milking consumer enthusiasm . it 's a huge market , and big name games manufacturers are there in full force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the xbox factor microsoft is touting its new and improved xbox 360 which is to be launched on the european market for at tidy 299 euros -lrb- $ 346 -rrb- in time for st. nicholas to do the decent thing and spread it among all the little children . if they stick to their target , microsoft will be ahead of their main rivals sony and nintendo who are also planning to launch multi-tasking , super-sonic new consoles , but not until next year .
aficionados and addicts will just have to console themselves with some of the other thousands of products while they wait . the games convention runs from august 18th to august 21st and is open wednesday , thursday , friday and sunday from 9.00 to 18.00 , and on saturdays from 09.00 to 20.00 .
entrance costs from 3.50 euros -lrb- $ 4.27 -rrb- for children to 10 euros for adults .

many allege that coping with prejudice is a part of their lives , but they also admit that embracing german society does n't come easily to them . ask a random selection of young arabs what brought their families to germany and you 'll get a broad range of replies .

many hope their children will grow up to enjoy opportunities they themselves never had . " you do n't have to pay much to study here , " pointed out one arab student .
but while getting a german education is an obvious advantage , it 's often easier said than done .
integrating with german peers and adjusting to the european mentality can be difficult .
even building up a social life can be tricky . " not all germans are reserved , " conceded one young moroccan .
" some of the people here are quite open , but on the whole , i find most germans very stand-offish . " ignorance others agree that coming to terms with the german way of life is fraught with obstacles .
potential pitfalls range from the practical to the psychological . " i 've never integrated properly here , " admitted one egyptian .
" primarily , the problem is that i never really learnt german properly back home in egypt , but i 've also never really made any friends here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but it 's by no means all their fault .
many arabs complain that germans are unaware of diversity within the arab world and fail to distinguish between different nationalities and cultures .
as far as the average german is concerned , they say , there 's not a whole lot of difference between a moroccan and a saudi arabian . hostility if ignorance were n't bad enough , hostility is another daily challenge for germany 's muslim community .
in the wake of the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states and the more recent events in madrid and london , the western world has made islamic fundamentalism its number one enemy - and across europe , many muslims say they are now treated with widespread suspicion and hostility . even so , others are quick to point out that getting to grips with a country like germany has a lot to do with one 's own attitudes .
many find that being receptive to new ideas and finding the resolve to chart unknown social and cultural ground will make life much easier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm in a non-muslim european country , " stressed one young palestinian .

and today i feel well integrated . " he also stresses that assimilating does n't have to mean relinquishing one 's one identity .
" i 'm still very tied to my own culture and my palestinian roots , " he pointed out . being able to adapt to new societies is probably not so different from being able to learn new languages - very easy for the young , more difficult as one gets older . samar hienen , hebtallah ismail , eyad hamideh -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de developing a euro-arab literature ahdaf soueif is an egyptian writer who made it big in great britain .

many allege that coping with prejudice is a part of their lives , but they also admit that embracing german society does n't come easily to them . ask a random selection of young arabs what brought their families to germany and you 'll get a broad range of replies .
along with political or religious persecution , one of the most common reasons for pulling up roots is a desire to improve their economic situations , with many migrants heading west so they can better provide for their families .
many hope their children will grow up to enjoy opportunities they themselves never had . " you do n't have to pay much to study here , " pointed out one arab student .
but while getting a german education is an obvious advantage , it 's often easier said than done .
integrating with german peers and adjusting to the european mentality can be difficult .
even building up a social life can be tricky . " not all germans are reserved , " conceded one young moroccan .
" some of the people here are quite open , but on the whole , i find most germans very stand-offish . " ignorance others agree that coming to terms with the german way of life is fraught with obstacles .
potential pitfalls range from the practical to the psychological . " i 've never integrated properly here , " admitted one egyptian .
" primarily , the problem is that i never really learnt german properly back home in egypt , but i 've also never really made any friends here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but it 's by no means all their fault .
many arabs complain that germans are unaware of diversity within the arab world and fail to distinguish between different nationalities and cultures .
as far as the average german is concerned , they say , there 's not a whole lot of difference between a moroccan and a saudi arabian . hostility if ignorance were n't bad enough , hostility is another daily challenge for germany 's muslim community .
in the wake of the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states and the more recent events in madrid and london , the western world has made islamic fundamentalism its number one enemy - and across europe , many muslims say they are now treated with widespread suspicion and hostility . even so , others are quick to point out that getting to grips with a country like germany has a lot to do with one 's own attitudes .
many find that being receptive to new ideas and finding the resolve to chart unknown social and cultural ground will make life much easier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm in a non-muslim european country , " stressed one young palestinian .
" that means i 'm speaking a different language , living in a different society and adapting to a new country .
but that does n't mean i have to cocoon myself away .
from day one , i 've always made sure i went out a lot .
and today i feel well integrated . " he also stresses that assimilating does n't have to mean relinquishing one 's one identity .
" i 'm still very tied to my own culture and my palestinian roots , " he pointed out . being able to adapt to new societies is probably not so different from being able to learn new languages - very easy for the young , more difficult as one gets older . samar hienen , hebtallah ismail , eyad hamideh -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de developing a euro-arab literature ahdaf soueif is an egyptian writer who made it big in great britain .

" welcome to germany , welcome home , " president köhler said . awaiting the 78-year-old pope are an estimated 400,000 young pilgrims gathered in the western german city of cologne . " that so many people have come to meet the successor of peter is a sign of the church 's vitality .
i am happy to be with them , confirm their faith and enliven their hope , " benedict xvi said upon arrival . crowds gathering on the rhine teeming masses of flag-waving young catholics lined the banks of the rhine waiting to catch their first glimpse of pope benedict xvi as he sailed up the river to join a global youth festival . " i will never forget this day , it was an awesome experience .
he seemed so full of joy as he waved to us , " said colleen ackerman , 25 , from cape town . for colleen and most of the crowd , it was their first view of a pope in the flesh and the man greeting them from the upper deck of the river cruiser did not disappoint . " we feel blessed that we were able to be here to see this , " said her friend teresa lawrence , 26 , also from cape town .
tens of thousands more were arriving in the city by train on thursday ahead of benedict 's first speech to the youth gathering at 5 pm .
organizers expect the crowd will swell to around a million by the time he celebrates an open-air mass in a park outside the city on sunday . the pope spent the early afternoon meeting with cologne archbishop cardinal joachim meisner at the archbishop 's residence , which will also serve as his lodgings during the world youth day . in the early evening , benedict xvi is also expected to visit the cologne cathedral . the pontiff 's visit is accompanied by high security .
a nato reconnaissance plane is protecting the air space over cologne during the catholic festival . around 4,000 police officers and thousands of private security personnel , 1,900 firefighters and 2,000 emergency medical workers are on duty .
25,000 volunteers are helping with the day-to-day functioning of the mega event . bildunterschrift : historic visit in possibly the most significant part of his trip , benedict will become only the second roman catholic leader in modern times to visit a jewish place of worship when he goes to a cologne synagogue on friday , almost two decades after john paul ii made a historic visit to rome 's main synagogue . benedict is also due to hold talks with muslim leaders .
the armenian-orthodox patriarch of istanbul and turkey , mesrob ii mutafayan , and vice-chariman of the german bishops conference , heinrich mussinhof , said on thursday that the interfaith dialogue during the world youth day was a " sign of hope for the church and the world . " the pope will preside at a saturday night vigil at the marienfeld park outside cologne with a crowd expected to be in the hundreds of thousands , followed by a huge open-air mass at the same venue on sunday . prayer and chaos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims from all over the world have gathered in cologne thousands attended a program of events on wednesday in warm sunshine which is expected to last until the end of the pope 's four-day visit on sunday . the flow of festival participants partly blocked the traffic around the cologne train station in the night between wednesday and thursday . " from 10 pm on , we had to occasionally close all access to the train station , " said a spokesperson for the cologne police .
" the crowds inside were unbelievable . " the traffic jam was caused by numerous pilgrims trying to return from festival events to their lodgings .
standing in long lines caused exhaustion and circulation problems for some pilgrims .
the situation normalized again around 2 am . a group of young french pilgrims who had made the trip to cologne said they were looking forward to seeing the new pope in the flesh . " the media have given us this image of a highly conservative man , but i am waiting to see what he says , " said thomas , 21 , from metz . forgetful pope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his mind was already in cologne , as was his image pope benedict xvi acknowledged wednesday that he was absent-minded after forgetting to bless the hundreds of pilgrims who attended his weekly audience at his castel gandolfo summer residence .
the crowd gathered in the palace courtyard was surprised to see the pope return to his window several moments after leaving after greeting pilgrims in several languages . " i ask for your forgiveness , but i have forgotten the most important greeting , the greeting to the pilgrims in the italian language , " he told them . he went back inside the palace , only to return again shortly . " today , i have forgotten the most important things .
one can see that i am already in cologne .
i omitted the most important thing : the benediction , " he said while smiling before giving his blessing . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young catholics forge own path in church a lot of young catholics find rome out of touch with their world .

" welcome to germany , welcome home , " president köhler said . awaiting the 78-year-old pope are an estimated 400,000 young pilgrims gathered in the western german city of cologne . " that so many people have come to meet the successor of peter is a sign of the church 's vitality .
i am happy to be with them , confirm their faith and enliven their hope , " benedict xvi said upon arrival . crowds gathering on the rhine teeming masses of flag-waving young catholics lined the banks of the rhine waiting to catch their first glimpse of pope benedict xvi as he sailed up the river to join a global youth festival . " i will never forget this day , it was an awesome experience .
he seemed so full of joy as he waved to us , " said colleen ackerman , 25 , from cape town . for colleen and most of the crowd , it was their first view of a pope in the flesh and the man greeting them from the upper deck of the river cruiser did not disappoint . " we feel blessed that we were able to be here to see this , " said her friend teresa lawrence , 26 , also from cape town .
tens of thousands more were arriving in the city by train on thursday ahead of benedict 's first speech to the youth gathering at 5 pm .
organizers expect the crowd will swell to around a million by the time he celebrates an open-air mass in a park outside the city on sunday . the pope spent the early afternoon meeting with cologne archbishop cardinal joachim meisner at the archbishop 's residence , which will also serve as his lodgings during the world youth day . in the early evening , benedict xvi is also expected to visit the cologne cathedral . the pontiff 's visit is accompanied by high security .
a nato reconnaissance plane is protecting the air space over cologne during the catholic festival . around 4,000 police officers and thousands of private security personnel , 1,900 firefighters and 2,000 emergency medical workers are on duty .
25,000 volunteers are helping with the day-to-day functioning of the mega event . bildunterschrift : historic visit in possibly the most significant part of his trip , benedict will become only the second roman catholic leader in modern times to visit a jewish place of worship when he goes to a cologne synagogue on friday , almost two decades after john paul ii made a historic visit to rome 's main synagogue . benedict is also due to hold talks with muslim leaders .
the armenian-orthodox patriarch of istanbul and turkey , mesrob ii mutafayan , and vice-chariman of the german bishops conference , heinrich mussinhof , said on thursday that the interfaith dialogue during the world youth day was a " sign of hope for the church and the world . " the pope will preside at a saturday night vigil at the marienfeld park outside cologne with a crowd expected to be in the hundreds of thousands , followed by a huge open-air mass at the same venue on sunday . prayer and chaos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims from all over the world have gathered in cologne thousands attended a program of events on wednesday in warm sunshine which is expected to last until the end of the pope 's four-day visit on sunday . the flow of festival participants partly blocked the traffic around the cologne train station in the night between wednesday and thursday . " from 10 pm on , we had to occasionally close all access to the train station , " said a spokesperson for the cologne police .
" the crowds inside were unbelievable . " the traffic jam was caused by numerous pilgrims trying to return from festival events to their lodgings .
standing in long lines caused exhaustion and circulation problems for some pilgrims .
the situation normalized again around 2 am . a group of young french pilgrims who had made the trip to cologne said they were looking forward to seeing the new pope in the flesh . " the media have given us this image of a highly conservative man , but i am waiting to see what he says , " said thomas , 21 , from metz . forgetful pope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his mind was already in cologne , as was his image pope benedict xvi acknowledged wednesday that he was absent-minded after forgetting to bless the hundreds of pilgrims who attended his weekly audience at his castel gandolfo summer residence .
the crowd gathered in the palace courtyard was surprised to see the pope return to his window several moments after leaving after greeting pilgrims in several languages . " i ask for your forgiveness , but i have forgotten the most important greeting , the greeting to the pilgrims in the italian language , " he told them . he went back inside the palace , only to return again shortly . " today , i have forgotten the most important things .
one can see that i am already in cologne .
i omitted the most important thing : the benediction , " he said while smiling before giving his blessing . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young catholics forge own path in church a lot of young catholics find rome out of touch with their world .

it 's might be hard to believe , but the great master of vorsprung durch technik , the german automobile industry , is no longer in pole position in the race to make modern cars more environmentally friendly . a study published on wednesday by germany 's automobile club , vcd , revealed that japan and france have their feet to the floor when it comes to environmental matters , and have left german car manufacturers spluttering in their wake . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the smart car is too small to do too much damage the vcd have been assessing anti-pollution merits of popular cars since 1989 , and the findings from their most recent review were the worst ever for germany , which only managed to squeeze one model , the opel corsa eco 1.0 into the top ten . and even that only made it into sixth place on the ranking table . it 's bad news for germany , which is currently still ruled in part by the green party , and which has long nurtured its reputation for being environmentally altruistic . bad boy volkswagen the vcd was particularly harsh in its criticism of the peoples ' favorite , volkswagen , for not installing a particle-filter to counter diesel soot in its best-selling model , the golf .

on wednesday night , coach jürgen klinsmann ’ s side faced their arch rivals the netherlands in rotterdam . with the netherlands currently ranked third in the world and germany ranked 11th german coach jürgen klinsmann knew his side faced a stiff task in the cauldron of rotterdam ’ s de kuip stadium .
the match finished in a 2-2 draw , a rather flattering result for the german side .
the dutch are spoilt for choice when it comes to world-class strikers and could allow themswelves to leave bayern munich ’ s striker roy makaay on the bench in the first half with ruud van nistelroy and arjen robben up front .
veteran defender christian wörns was recalled to the german side along with didi hamann to help sure up germany ’ s weak defense with midfielder bernd schneider playing at left back .
dutch coach van basten is a shrewd man , noticed schneider was playing out of position and switched arjen robben to the right wing to trouble schneider ... this move paid dividends early on as the dutch took a third minute lead through chelsea striker robben .
at half-time germany could count themselves lucky to be only one goal down as the dutch wasted several golden opportunities .
one minute into the second half though germany found themselves two goals down . again the scorer was arjen robben .
the game looked over .
klinsmann ’ s biggest defeat ?
jürgen klinsmann , the striker-turned coach was solely responsible for germany 's last victory over the oranje by converting a penalty for a 1-0 win in 1996 - also in rotterdam .
but on wednesday night , he looked as if he would be suffering his worst defeat as coach .
but michael ballack had other ideas and quickly pulled a goal back for germany with a diving header .
yet it was still the dutch magicians who were playing the beautiful football but who continued to squander chance after chance , hitting the crossbar twice .
suddenly germany broke and after good work by tim borowski , substitute gerald asamoah came in on the right to squeeze the ball over the line from an sharp angle .
2-2 was the final score . a typical german comeback and totally against the run of play .
while germany were delighted to equalise their miserable run against the big nations continues and it is 15 games since they defeated a recognised top team .

on wednesday night , coach jürgen klinsmann ’ s side faced their arch rivals the netherlands in rotterdam . with the netherlands currently ranked third in the world and germany ranked 11th german coach jürgen klinsmann knew his side faced a stiff task in the cauldron of rotterdam ’ s de kuip stadium .
the match finished in a 2-2 draw , a rather flattering result for the german side .
the dutch are spoilt for choice when it comes to world-class strikers and could allow themswelves to leave bayern munich ’ s striker roy makaay on the bench in the first half with ruud van nistelroy and arjen robben up front .
veteran defender christian wörns was recalled to the german side along with didi hamann to help sure up germany ’ s weak defense with midfielder bernd schneider playing at left back .
dutch coach van basten is a shrewd man , noticed schneider was playing out of position and switched arjen robben to the right wing to trouble schneider ... this move paid dividends early on as the dutch took a third minute lead through chelsea striker robben .
at half-time germany could count themselves lucky to be only one goal down as the dutch wasted several golden opportunities .
one minute into the second half though germany found themselves two goals down . again the scorer was arjen robben .
the game looked over .
klinsmann ’ s biggest defeat ?
jürgen klinsmann , the striker-turned coach was solely responsible for germany 's last victory over the oranje by converting a penalty for a 1-0 win in 1996 - also in rotterdam .
but on wednesday night , he looked as if he would be suffering his worst defeat as coach .
but michael ballack had other ideas and quickly pulled a goal back for germany with a diving header .
yet it was still the dutch magicians who were playing the beautiful football but who continued to squander chance after chance , hitting the crossbar twice .
suddenly germany broke and after good work by tim borowski , substitute gerald asamoah came in on the right to squeeze the ball over the line from an sharp angle .
2-2 was the final score . a typical german comeback and totally against the run of play .
while germany were delighted to equalise their miserable run against the big nations continues and it is 15 games since they defeated a recognised top team .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.08.2005 german cars overtaken in eco-race großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not all environmentally sound , but which are the culprits ?
it 's might be hard to believe , but the great master of vorsprung durch technik , the german automobile industry , is no longer in pole position in the race to make modern cars more environmentally friendly . a study published on wednesday by germany 's automobile club , vcd , revealed that japan and france have their feet to the floor when it comes to environmental matters , and have left german car manufacturers spluttering in their wake . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the smart car is too small to do too much damage the vcd have been assessing anti-pollution merits of popular cars since 1989 , and the findings from their most recent review were the worst ever for germany , which only managed to squeeze one model , the opel corsa eco 1.0 into the top ten . and even that only made it into sixth place on the ranking table . it 's bad news for germany , which is currently still ruled in part by the green party , and which has long nurtured its reputation for being environmentally altruistic . bad boy volkswagen the vcd was particularly harsh in its criticism of the peoples ' favorite , volkswagen , for not installing a particle-filter to counter diesel soot in its best-selling model , the golf . " german manufacturers face the prospect of losing touch with environmental technology , " said deputy vcd chairman , hermann-josef vogt .
and the upshot of that , says the report , is that germany could lose credibility as a centre of automobile technology , subsequently become less competitive and having to shed jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can environmental technology keep up with the cars ?
the comments were met with roaring disapproval from the german association of the automotive industry , vda , which delivered a vitriolic response , accusing the automobile club of being a " smorgasbord of smug , self-important people with no substance " and describing the report as being " disproportionately out of touch with reality . " so exactly what is the reality ?
simply that toyota tops the list - which measures cars for both economic virtue and emission levels - with its no frills prius 1 , and that citroen , peugeot and daihatsu are hotter on its wheels than any german make . missed opportunity a spokesman for the vcd said it need not have been that way , and that volkswagen could have pipped toyota to the post had it concentrated less on honing its super-speed luxury limos and simply installed standard-issue filters in its audi 2 and lupo model , which have now been withdrawn from the market . # b # the spokesman , gerd lottsiepen , said that without the filter , diesel cars were " yesterday 's technology " , and a clear statement from the makers that they do n't care about the health of their customers . solicitousness was higher in the compact car category , which featured two appearances each from mercedes and opel and one from audi , but there was again a conspicuous absence of german names on the list of family models .
vw just managed to roll onto the bottom of the table at tenth place with its golf 2.0 variant bifuel . that 's not good enough for lottsiepen , who says it is time for the government , however it may look following the elections , to introduce tax benefits on cars which are equipped with today 's technology . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers move on diesel filters the eu 's new clean air law and hesitant consumers are causing german carmakers to scramble to equip diesel cars with soot filters as several german cities have reached pollution levels that require driving bans .

" welcome to germany , welcome home , " president köhler said . awaiting the 78-year-old pope are an estimated 400,000 young pilgrims gathered in the western german city of cologne . " that so many people have come to meet the successor of peter is a sign of the church 's vitality .
i am happy to be with them , confirm their faith and enliven their hope , " benedict xvi said upon arrival . crowds gathering on the rhine teeming masses of flag-waving young catholics lined the banks of the rhine waiting to catch their first glimpse of pope benedict xvi as he sailed up the river to join a global youth festival . " i will never forget this day , it was an awesome experience .
he seemed so full of joy as he waved to us , " said colleen ackerman , 25 , from cape town . for colleen and most of the crowd , it was their first view of a pope in the flesh and the man greeting them from the upper deck of the river cruiser did not disappoint . " we feel blessed that we were able to be here to see this , " said her friend teresa lawrence , 26 , also from cape town .
tens of thousands more were arriving in the city by train on thursday ahead of benedict 's first speech to the youth gathering at 5 pm .
organizers expect the crowd will swell to around a million by the time he celebrates an open-air mass in a park outside the city on sunday . the pope spent the early afternoon meeting with cologne archbishop cardinal joachim meisner at the archbishop 's residence , which will also serve as his lodgings during the world youth day . in the early evening , benedict xvi is also expected to visit the cologne cathedral . the pontiff 's visit is accompanied by high security .
a nato reconnaissance plane is protecting the air space over cologne during the catholic festival . around 4,000 police officers and thousands of private security personnel , 1,900 firefighters and 2,000 emergency medical workers are on duty .

" from 10 pm on , we had to occasionally close all access to the train station , " said a spokesperson for the cologne police .
" the crowds inside were unbelievable . " the traffic jam was caused by numerous pilgrims trying to return from festival events to their lodgings .
standing in long lines caused exhaustion and circulation problems for some pilgrims .
the situation normalized again around 2 am . a group of young french pilgrims who had made the trip to cologne said they were looking forward to seeing the new pope in the flesh . " the media have given us this image of a highly conservative man , but i am waiting to see what he says , " said thomas , 21 , from metz . forgetful pope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his mind was already in cologne , as was his image pope benedict xvi acknowledged wednesday that he was absent-minded after forgetting to bless the hundreds of pilgrims who attended his weekly audience at his castel gandolfo summer residence .
the crowd gathered in the palace courtyard was surprised to see the pope return to his window several moments after leaving after greeting pilgrims in several languages . " i ask for your forgiveness , but i have forgotten the most important greeting , the greeting to the pilgrims in the italian language , " he told them . he went back inside the palace , only to return again shortly . " today , i have forgotten the most important things .
one can see that i am already in cologne .
i omitted the most important thing : the benediction , " he said while smiling before giving his blessing . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de young catholics forge own path in church a lot of young catholics find rome out of touch with their world .

angela merkel has announced she wants to appoint radical tax reform advocate paul kirchhof as finance minister if her party wins on sept .
18 .
it could radically remake german fiscal policy , conservative supporters say . when cdu leader and chancellor candidate angela merkel picked paul kirchhof , a heidelberg university professor and former constitutional court judge , as her top finance adviser wednesday , she signaled that she was ready to move towards radical reform .
" if it is up to me and the coalition talks allow it , he will become finance minister , " merkel said during a campaign stop .
kirchhof , 62 , is best known for a tax reform proposal he presented in 2003 which calls for a flat 25 percent tax for corporations and individuals .
but many financial experts and politicians criticize the choice because kirchhof , they say , is a political novice and lacks the cdu party connections to run the finance ministry effectively .
merkel 's plans could be derailed if bavarian premier edmund stoiber or a member of the free democrats , the likely coalition partner , lay claim to the portfolio .
the post is considered critical because of germany 's fight to cut its debt and lower its deficit .
must set good example kirchhof told the mass-circulation newspaper bild that if elected , the conservatives would bring the german budget deficit below the european union 's limit of three percent of gdp in the " near future . "
he also said that germany must again set a good financial example for europe .
bildunterschrift : angela 's a-team " i am convinced that government debt is currently the most dramatic problem we face , " he said .
" it 's simply obscene to pass this fundamental burden on to future generations . "
germany breached the eu stability pact rules for the third time last year and is expected to do so again 2005 .
this time , eu finance ministers may decide to penalize the country .
the conservatives have promised to get germany 's deficit below three percent by 2009 and balance the federal budget by 2013 . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's " dream team " conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel presented her so-called " competence team " on wednesday .

" welcome to germany , welcome home , " president köhler said . awaiting the 78-year-old pope are an estimated 400,000 young pilgrims gathered in the western german city of cologne . " that so many people have come to meet the successor of peter is a sign of the church 's vitality .
i am happy to be with them , confirm their faith and enliven their hope , " benedict xvi said upon arrival . crowds gathering on the rhine teeming masses of flag-waving young catholics lined the banks of the rhine waiting to catch their first glimpse of pope benedict xvi as he sailed up the river to join a global youth festival . " i will never forget this day , it was an awesome experience .
he seemed so full of joy as he waved to us , " said colleen ackerman , 25 , from cape town . for colleen and most of the crowd , it was their first view of a pope in the flesh and the man greeting them from the upper deck of the river cruiser did not disappoint . " we feel blessed that we were able to be here to see this , " said her friend teresa lawrence , 26 , also from cape town .
tens of thousands more were arriving in the city by train on thursday ahead of benedict 's first speech to the youth gathering at 5 pm .
organizers expect the crowd will swell to around a million by the time he celebrates an open-air mass in a park outside the city on sunday . the pope spent the early afternoon meeting with cologne archbishop cardinal joachim meisner at the archbishop 's residence , which will also serve as his lodgings during the world youth day . in the early evening , benedict xvi is also expected to visit the cologne cathedral . the pontiff 's visit is accompanied by high security .
a nato reconnaissance plane is protecting the air space over cologne during the catholic festival . around 4,000 police officers and thousands of private security personnel , 1,900 firefighters and 2,000 emergency medical workers are on duty .

" from 10 pm on , we had to occasionally close all access to the train station , " said a spokesperson for the cologne police .
" the crowds inside were unbelievable . " the traffic jam was caused by numerous pilgrims trying to return from festival events to their lodgings .
standing in long lines caused exhaustion and circulation problems for some pilgrims .
the situation normalized again around 2 am . a group of young french pilgrims who had made the trip to cologne said they were looking forward to seeing the new pope in the flesh . " the media have given us this image of a highly conservative man , but i am waiting to see what he says , " said thomas , 21 , from metz . forgetful pope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his mind was already in cologne , as was his image pope benedict xvi acknowledged wednesday that he was absent-minded after forgetting to bless the hundreds of pilgrims who attended his weekly audience at his castel gandolfo summer residence .
the crowd gathered in the palace courtyard was surprised to see the pope return to his window several moments after leaving after greeting pilgrims in several languages . " i ask for your forgiveness , but i have forgotten the most important greeting , the greeting to the pilgrims in the italian language , " he told them . he went back inside the palace , only to return again shortly . " today , i have forgotten the most important things .

many of the young pilgrims in cologne this week have found new ways of living their religion , which sometimes involve ignoring official church doctrine . katja jarc knows fewer younger people are going to church .
the 18-year-old slovenian can see it every sunday when she single-handedly brings down parish 's average age .
" nearly everyone is at least 60 years old , " she said .
" it 's hard to find anyone my age there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims wait to enter the cologne cathedral finding more young people interested in religion is one of the reasons jarc decided to attend the world youth day event in cologne .
she 's achieved that goal , since there are some 400,000 young faithful who have come to cologne for prayer , song , revivals and some good old-fashioned partying .
the catholic festival also sent her on the pilgrimage of sorts even after she arrived in this city on the rhine .
this second pilgrimage was shorter , however , than the long trip from slovenia .
this one started at the river 's edge and ended at cologne 's famous cathedral .
" here there are so many friendly people who are interested in church and prayer , " she said as groups passed by .
some people were waving national flags ; others whispered the rosary in a handful of different languages .
" i want to meet as many people like me as i can here in cologne . "
covering a distance of about two kilometers -lrb- 1.2 miles -rrb- , the pilgrimage is intended to represent the three wise men 's search for god .
world youth day organizers have recommended all visitors take the walk before visiting the shrine to the biblical kings inside the cathedral .
differing view of church 's teaching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young catholics have their own ideas about faith though the 400,000 pilgrims from some 120 different countries are united by a single faith at the catholic festival , the young people 's interpretation of their religion tends to differ , especially when it comes to personal issues like contraception and abortion .
" something is n't right when there are so many devout believers in africa and lots of them end up dying of aids , " said daniela gall , 18 , who lives near munich .
but the church should n't just sway with the mores of the day either , according to bryan brochu of alberta , canada .
" one of the strengths of the church is that it does n't change every time society wants it to , " said brochu , 21 , as speakers played recordings of the hail mary in german , english , french and italian .
" there are people who say the church is too old school , but i think it should stick to its values and traditions . "
admitting that he is not overly religious , tobias straub , 18 , came to the world youth day at the urging of his priest at home in bavaria who told him to look at the church 's teachings as a lighthouse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pilgrimage continues outside the cathedral " there are times you really need some direction and other times you can go on your own , " he said as his group joined the parade snaking its way around the square outside the cathedral .
" people should decide for themselves . "
keeping youth interested catholicism should n't force all of its tenets on people who are looking for guidance since the church has bigger problems it should concentrate on , according to jarc .
" i think the church should concentrate more on finding ways to get more younger people interested in religion , " she said .
young people want to know the church is also taking them into consideration every day , not just when it 's organizing concerts along the rhine .
" i like the times when i can organize something like a mass or other meeting myself , " gall said .
" that and a great priest who helps us do what we want is what keeps me interested in the church 's youth group . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi will say mass for 800,000 on sunday in an interview with vatican radio , pope benedict xvi -lrb- photo -rrb- agreed that sparking interest in religion among youth is key to the world youth day 's success .
" if this zest , this joy , to know christ would come alive again and give the church in germany and europe a new dynamic , then i think the aim of world youth day would be achieved . "
according to jarc , the songs , prayers and chants of " hey , hey benito " heard along the pilgrims ' trail show that a spark has already been lit .
now it 's up to the church and the pilgrims to keep it from going out , she said .

many of the young pilgrims in cologne this week have found new ways of living their religion , which sometimes involve ignoring official church doctrine . katja jarc knows fewer younger people are going to church .
the 18-year-old slovenian can see it every sunday when she single-handedly brings down parish 's average age .
" nearly everyone is at least 60 years old , " she said .
" it 's hard to find anyone my age there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims wait to enter the cologne cathedral finding more young people interested in religion is one of the reasons jarc decided to attend the world youth day event in cologne .
she 's achieved that goal , since there are some 400,000 young faithful who have come to cologne for prayer , song , revivals and some good old-fashioned partying .
the catholic festival also sent her on the pilgrimage of sorts even after she arrived in this city on the rhine .
this second pilgrimage was shorter , however , than the long trip from slovenia .
this one started at the river 's edge and ended at cologne 's famous cathedral .
" here there are so many friendly people who are interested in church and prayer , " she said as groups passed by .
some people were waving national flags ; others whispered the rosary in a handful of different languages .
" i want to meet as many people like me as i can here in cologne . "
covering a distance of about two kilometers -lrb- 1.2 miles -rrb- , the pilgrimage is intended to represent the three wise men 's search for god .
world youth day organizers have recommended all visitors take the walk before visiting the shrine to the biblical kings inside the cathedral .
differing view of church 's teaching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young catholics have their own ideas about faith though the 400,000 pilgrims from some 120 different countries are united by a single faith at the catholic festival , the young people 's interpretation of their religion tends to differ , especially when it comes to personal issues like contraception and abortion .
" something is n't right when there are so many devout believers in africa and lots of them end up dying of aids , " said daniela gall , 18 , who lives near munich .
but the church should n't just sway with the mores of the day either , according to bryan brochu of alberta , canada .
" one of the strengths of the church is that it does n't change every time society wants it to , " said brochu , 21 , as speakers played recordings of the hail mary in german , english , french and italian .
" there are people who say the church is too old school , but i think it should stick to its values and traditions . "
admitting that he is not overly religious , tobias straub , 18 , came to the world youth day at the urging of his priest at home in bavaria who told him to look at the church 's teachings as a lighthouse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pilgrimage continues outside the cathedral " there are times you really need some direction and other times you can go on your own , " he said as his group joined the parade snaking its way around the square outside the cathedral .
" people should decide for themselves . "
keeping youth interested catholicism should n't force all of its tenets on people who are looking for guidance since the church has bigger problems it should concentrate on , according to jarc .
" i think the church should concentrate more on finding ways to get more younger people interested in religion , " she said .
young people want to know the church is also taking them into consideration every day , not just when it 's organizing concerts along the rhine .
" i like the times when i can organize something like a mass or other meeting myself , " gall said .
" that and a great priest who helps us do what we want is what keeps me interested in the church 's youth group . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi will say mass for 800,000 on sunday in an interview with vatican radio , pope benedict xvi -lrb- photo -rrb- agreed that sparking interest in religion among youth is key to the world youth day 's success .
" if this zest , this joy , to know christ would come alive again and give the church in germany and europe a new dynamic , then i think the aim of world youth day would be achieved . "
according to jarc , the songs , prayers and chants of " hey , hey benito " heard along the pilgrims ' trail show that a spark has already been lit .
now it 's up to the church and the pilgrims to keep it from going out , she said .
" the world youth day is great , " she added .

angela merkel has announced she wants to appoint radical tax reform advocate paul kirchhof as finance minister if her party wins on sept .
18 .
it could radically remake german fiscal policy , conservative supporters say . when cdu leader and chancellor candidate angela merkel picked paul kirchhof , a heidelberg university professor and former constitutional court judge , as her top finance adviser wednesday , she signaled that she was ready to move towards radical reform .
" if it is up to me and the coalition talks allow it , he will become finance minister , " merkel said during a campaign stop .
kirchhof , 62 , is best known for a tax reform proposal he presented in 2003 which calls for a flat 25 percent tax for corporations and individuals .
but many financial experts and politicians criticize the choice because kirchhof , they say , is a political novice and lacks the cdu party connections to run the finance ministry effectively .
merkel 's plans could be derailed if bavarian premier edmund stoiber or a member of the free democrats , the likely coalition partner , lay claim to the portfolio .
the post is considered critical because of germany 's fight to cut its debt and lower its deficit .
must set good example kirchhof told the mass-circulation newspaper bild that if elected , the conservatives would bring the german budget deficit below the european union 's limit of three percent of gdp in the " near future . "
he also said that germany must again set a good financial example for europe .
bildunterschrift : angela 's a-team " i am convinced that government debt is currently the most dramatic problem we face , " he said .
" it 's simply obscene to pass this fundamental burden on to future generations . "
germany breached the eu stability pact rules for the third time last year and is expected to do so again 2005 .
this time , eu finance ministers may decide to penalize the country .

" that so many people have come to meet the successor of peter is a sign of the church 's vitality .
i am happy to be with them , confirm their faith and enliven their hope , " benedict xvi said upon arrival . crowds gathering on the rhine teeming masses of flag-waving young catholics lined the banks of the rhine waiting to catch their first glimpse of pope benedict xvi as he sailed up the river to join a global youth festival . " i will never forget this day , it was an awesome experience .
he seemed so full of joy as he waved to us , " said colleen ackerman , 25 , from cape town . for colleen and most of the crowd , it was their first view of a pope in the flesh and the man greeting them from the upper deck of the river cruiser did not disappoint . " we feel blessed that we were able to be here to see this , " said her friend teresa lawrence , 26 , also from cape town .
tens of thousands more were arriving in the city by train on thursday ahead of benedict 's first speech to the youth gathering at 5 pm .
organizers expect the crowd will swell to around a million by the time he celebrates an open-air mass in a park outside the city on sunday . the pope spent the early afternoon meeting with cologne archbishop cardinal joachim meisner at the archbishop 's residence , which will also serve as his lodgings during the world youth day . in the early evening , benedict xvi is also expected to visit the cologne cathedral . the pontiff 's visit is accompanied by high security .
a nato reconnaissance plane is protecting the air space over cologne during the catholic festival . around 4,000 police officers and thousands of private security personnel , 1,900 firefighters and 2,000 emergency medical workers are on duty .

" from 10 pm on , we had to occasionally close all access to the train station , " said a spokesperson for the cologne police .
" the crowds inside were unbelievable . " the traffic jam was caused by numerous pilgrims trying to return from festival events to their lodgings .
standing in long lines caused exhaustion and circulation problems for some pilgrims .
the situation normalized again around 2 am . a group of young french pilgrims who had made the trip to cologne said they were looking forward to seeing the new pope in the flesh . " the media have given us this image of a highly conservative man , but i am waiting to see what he says , " said thomas , 21 , from metz . forgetful pope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his mind was already in cologne , as was his image pope benedict xvi acknowledged wednesday that he was absent-minded after forgetting to bless the hundreds of pilgrims who attended his weekly audience at his castel gandolfo summer residence .
the crowd gathered in the palace courtyard was surprised to see the pope return to his window several moments after leaving after greeting pilgrims in several languages . " i ask for your forgiveness , but i have forgotten the most important greeting , the greeting to the pilgrims in the italian language , " he told them . he went back inside the palace , only to return again shortly . " today , i have forgotten the most important things .

he seemed so full of joy as he waved to us , " said colleen ackerman , 25 , from cape town . for colleen and most of the crowd , it was their first view of a pope in the flesh and the man greeting them from the upper deck of the river cruiser did not disappoint .

the disaster came only days after a cypriot airplane hit a hillside near athens , taking the lives of 121 passengers , most of whom were cypriots . earlier this month a tunisian-operated charter plane crash landed at sea off the sicilian coast killing 13 people , including 12 italians . in reaction to the crash in venezuela , eu transportation officials have called for tougher safety measures . " this accident … shows that we must collectively step up efforts to ensure the highest level of air transport security in europe and shelter all of the -lrb- european -rrb- union 's passengers and crew from such dramas , " said eu transport commissioner jacques barrot . beefing up checks in january 2004 , the crash in egypt of a boeing airliner operated by flash airlines , which killed 148 people , spurred the eu into action after years of negotiations and led to a beefing-up of safety checks on non-eu airplanes at airports in member states . the transport commissioner at the time , loyola de palacio , was quick to say that the flash airlines accident probably would never have happened had the rules been in place before the crash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent air disasters are spurring a new look at air safety in 1994 , the eu made it a requirement after air accidents that a technical probe be carried out by a body independent of the national civil aviation authorities . but like many eu rules , this one has not always been followed by all member states .

" the commissioner aims to extend in the coming months the responsibilities of the european aviation safety agency -lrb- easa -rrb- , which currently issues airworthiness certificates for aeronautical products , parts and equipment . in particular , barrot wants to see the easa play a greater role in monitoring flight safety and the security of non-eu airlines , and in certifying crew members . bildunterschrift : before the crash in venezuela keeping passengers in the loop plans for regulations on keeping passengers informed about flights are also in the works . ahead of a first reading of the regulations by the european parliament , eu members agreed in principle in april that passengers be informed as soon as possible and , in any case , before take-off of changes in the airline operating a flight . the new rules also propose improved information exchange about grounded airlines , although belgium , france , germany and spain want more coordination on the criteria used to designate such carriers . new legislation a 2004 regulation on the safety of airplanes from non-eu members , which members have until may 2006 to adopt into their national legislation , opens the way for an eu-wide flight ban if such a ban has been declared by a single member state . however , an extension of the regulation would have to be proposed by the european commission and backed by a qualified majority of member states , which tend to jealously hold on to their authority to authorize flights . the lack of eu-wide coordination sparked chaos in may when thousands of passengers were left stranded after a ban on turkish carrier onur air - by france , germany , the netherlands and switzerland - until their flights were finally rerouted via belgium . blacklist possible the european commission is considering publishing a blacklist of airlines and aircraft subject to bans or restrictions in eu member states on the internet , barrot said wednesday . the european union blacklist idea is similar to a mechanism already operational in the united states , where would-be passengers can consult a website publishing the names of airlines with relatively poor safety records . " we hope that with the information that will be communicated to the commission we will be able to publish a sort of blacklist , " barrot said , adding that the proposal could become reality by the end of the year if it is passed by the european parliament . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greece and cyprus in mourning after plane crash the bodies of 119 of the 121 people on board the cypriot airliner which crashed northeast of athens as well as the plane 's second flight recorder have been recovered , greek national television reported monday .

" the commissioner aims to extend in the coming months the responsibilities of the european aviation safety agency -lrb- easa -rrb- , which currently issues airworthiness certificates for aeronautical products , parts and equipment . in particular , barrot wants to see the easa play a greater role in monitoring flight safety and the security of non-eu airlines , and in certifying crew members . bildunterschrift : before the crash in venezuela keeping passengers in the loop plans for regulations on keeping passengers informed about flights are also in the works . ahead of a first reading of the regulations by the european parliament , eu members agreed in principle in april that passengers be informed as soon as possible and , in any case , before take-off of changes in the airline operating a flight . the new rules also propose improved information exchange about grounded airlines , although belgium , france , germany and spain want more coordination on the criteria used to designate such carriers . new legislation a 2004 regulation on the safety of airplanes from non-eu members , which members have until may 2006 to adopt into their national legislation , opens the way for an eu-wide flight ban if such a ban has been declared by a single member state . however , an extension of the regulation would have to be proposed by the european commission and backed by a qualified majority of member states , which tend to jealously hold on to their authority to authorize flights . the lack of eu-wide coordination sparked chaos in may when thousands of passengers were left stranded after a ban on turkish carrier onur air - by france , germany , the netherlands and switzerland - until their flights were finally rerouted via belgium . blacklist possible the european commission is considering publishing a blacklist of airlines and aircraft subject to bans or restrictions in eu member states on the internet , barrot said wednesday . the european union blacklist idea is similar to a mechanism already operational in the united states , where would-be passengers can consult a website publishing the names of airlines with relatively poor safety records . " we hope that with the information that will be communicated to the commission we will be able to publish a sort of blacklist , " barrot said , adding that the proposal could become reality by the end of the year if it is passed by the european parliament . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greece and cyprus in mourning after plane crash the bodies of 119 of the 121 people on board the cypriot airliner which crashed northeast of athens as well as the plane 's second flight recorder have been recovered , greek national television reported monday .

that could mean germany takes harsher measures against those deemed islamic militants . it 's the latest in a serious of no-nonsense actions from down south .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein announced thursday that he is expelling three more suspected islamic radicals .
this time , the three are members of a group called tablighi jamaat , which has about 450 members around germany and whose followers want to establish an islamic state , officials said .
german security officials have previously described the group as peaceful but said it could become infiltrated by radicals .
beckstein called them " missionaries " bent on spreading radical islam including the idea of " jihad , " or holy war , which encourages martyrdom through suicide attacks .
he added that bavaria would , with the expulsions , draw a clear and consistent line against " hate preachers " and suspected islamic militants .
" we want to make it clear to islamic extremists that the bavarian government wo n't tolerate anyone who wants to replace our free and democratic order with an islamic state , " he said in a statement .
the three , two bosnians and a moroccan , have until sept .

that is more than any of the other 15 german states so far , officials said .
it comes as little surprise .
a nationwide raid in january that led to the arrest of 22 suspected militants came after an investigation initiated by the bavarians .
soon after , beckstein said in a speech that more than 500 islamic extremists in germany " must be considered extremely dangerous " and that there are several thousand other fanatical muslims in the country .
his boss , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , has gone farther , saying that there are tens of thousands of radical muslims in germany , at least 4,000 of those he wants to deport for extremist activities .
increasing focus germany was forced to increase its efforts to clamp down on islamic radicals after it was discovered that the september 11 hijackers planned their attacks while living as students in hamburg .
last year , schilly said that the fight against islamic militants was a top priority .
as a result , the government established an anti-terror command headquarters in berlin .

at the same time , germans worry about harboring extremists and populist sentiments by politicians such as stoiber against muslim immigrants suspected of radicalism appeal to many .

that could mean germany takes harsher measures against those deemed islamic militants . it 's the latest in a serious of no-nonsense actions from down south .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein announced thursday that he is expelling three more suspected islamic radicals .
this time , the three are members of a group called tablighi jamaat , which has about 450 members around germany and whose followers want to establish an islamic state , officials said .
german security officials have previously described the group as peaceful but said it could become infiltrated by radicals .
beckstein called them " missionaries " bent on spreading radical islam including the idea of " jihad , " or holy war , which encourages martyrdom through suicide attacks .
he added that bavaria would , with the expulsions , draw a clear and consistent line against " hate preachers " and suspected islamic militants .
" we want to make it clear to islamic extremists that the bavarian government wo n't tolerate anyone who wants to replace our free and democratic order with an islamic state , " he said in a statement .
the three , two bosnians and a moroccan , have until sept .

that is more than any of the other 15 german states so far , officials said .
it comes as little surprise .
a nationwide raid in january that led to the arrest of 22 suspected militants came after an investigation initiated by the bavarians .
soon after , beckstein said in a speech that more than 500 islamic extremists in germany " must be considered extremely dangerous " and that there are several thousand other fanatical muslims in the country .
his boss , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , has gone farther , saying that there are tens of thousands of radical muslims in germany , at least 4,000 of those he wants to deport for extremist activities .
increasing focus germany was forced to increase its efforts to clamp down on islamic radicals after it was discovered that the september 11 hijackers planned their attacks while living as students in hamburg .
last year , schilly said that the fight against islamic militants was a top priority .
as a result , the government established an anti-terror command headquarters in berlin .

deporting people is especially tricky for germany in light of its nazi legacy .
at the same time , germans worry about harboring extremists and populist sentiments by politicians such as stoiber against muslim immigrants suspected of radicalism appeal to many .
security experts applaud the stepped up efforts by the government to address extremism but still complain that too little has been done .

a spokesman for the hanover-based german group said the move affected four flights scheduled in the autumn by tui switzerland , as well as twice-a-week flights by tui poland through the end of the peak travel season .
tui , based in hanover , cited " strong demand for information by clients " for the cancellations .

the spokesman 's remarks confirmed information to be reported in thursday 's edition of the german business daily handelsblatt .
the customers affected will fly on alternative airlines , he added .
the spokesman said he did not know whether the only other tui unit using helios flights , tui scandinavia , would continue to do so .
in berne , a spokesman for tui switzerland , roland smith , said the cancellations were made because of uncertainties surrounding the investigation of the accident and for the well being of the company 's clients . dw-world.de greece and cyprus in mourning after plane crash the bodies of 119 of the 121 people on board the cypriot airliner which crashed northeast of athens as well as the plane 's second flight recorder have been recovered , greek national television reported monday .

computer games are big business in germany as the games convention in leipzig proves . for the next four days , avid computer fans can feast their insatiable appetites on a stunning array of state-of-the-art entertainment in an event which promises not to disappoint . thursday was the first day of the computer games convention , but even before the gates were thrown open , hundreds of eager fans had gathered outside in a bid to be among the first to size up the latest in computer game technology . bildunterschrift : visitors to the convention it calls itself " europe 's leading trade fair for interactive entertainment , infotainment and edutainment " , and with 280 exhibitors from 15 countries and some 110,000 visitors expected to show up , organisers could just be justified in blowing their event 's own trumpet . but just what is it that drives so many thousands of people into the loud lap of video entertainment when they could be outside creating their own in the sudden burst of summer sunshine ? fact is , there 's more to the event than row upon row of 21st century blow-your-mind , blow-up-the-world type games , which large slices of the general public still believe to be synonymous with computer-generated entertainment .
indeed , the organisers are promising something for everyone . family fair with an unprecedented 189 market premieres , including 52 from germany , 59 from europe and 98 from other parts of the world , it stands to be the most packed show in the trade fair 's short history , and although it will doubtless attract its fair share of die-hard gamers , there 's also a whole arm of the event dedicated to family entertainment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children and computers are no strange sight the convention 's family forum for media literacy , teaching and school software bills itself as a " special experience " for old and young . the convention has teamed up with leipzig university and media experts from academic to provide young computer users and their parents and teachers with invaluable information on how to overcome the choice paralysis brought on by the dazzling gamut of multimedia products available to even very young users . angela schierholz , who is a project director at the convention says manufacturers recognise the benefits of wooing their customers at the youngest possible age . " the growth in the number of exhibitors of over 50 percent compared to 2004 in this area , and the doubling of the surface area involved , show that the ability to handle new media competently is achieving increasing significance , " she said . the real thing but let there be no mistake that these four days of bright lights and simulated sound are not about being worthy , but about milking consumer enthusiasm . it 's a huge market , and big name games manufacturers are there in full force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the xbox factor microsoft is touting its new and improved xbox 360 which is to be launched on the european market for at tidy 299 euros -lrb- $ 346 -rrb- in time for st. nicholas to do the decent thing and spread it among all the little children . if they stick to their target , microsoft will be ahead of their main rivals sony and nintendo who are also planning to launch multi-tasking , super-sonic new consoles , but not until next year .

angela merkel has announced she wants to appoint radical tax reform advocate paul kirchhof as finance minister if her party wins on sept .
18 .
it could radically remake german fiscal policy , conservative supporters say . when cdu leader and chancellor candidate angela merkel picked paul kirchhof , a heidelberg university professor and former constitutional court judge , as her top finance adviser wednesday , she signaled that she was ready to move towards radical reform .
" if it is up to me and the coalition talks allow it , he will become finance minister , " merkel said during a campaign stop .
kirchhof , 62 , is best known for a tax reform proposal he presented in 2003 which calls for a flat 25 percent tax for corporations and individuals .
but many financial experts and politicians criticize the choice because kirchhof , they say , is a political novice and lacks the cdu party connections to run the finance ministry effectively .
merkel 's plans could be derailed if bavarian premier edmund stoiber or a member of the free democrats , the likely coalition partner , lay claim to the portfolio .
the post is considered critical because of germany 's fight to cut its debt and lower its deficit .
must set good example kirchhof told the mass-circulation newspaper bild that if elected , the conservatives would bring the german budget deficit below the european union 's limit of three percent of gdp in the " near future . "
he also said that germany must again set a good financial example for europe .
bildunterschrift : angela 's a-team " i am convinced that government debt is currently the most dramatic problem we face , " he said .
" it 's simply obscene to pass this fundamental burden on to future generations . "
germany breached the eu stability pact rules for the third time last year and is expected to do so again 2005 .
this time , eu finance ministers may decide to penalize the country .

angela merkel has announced she wants to appoint radical tax reform advocate paul kirchhof as finance minister if her party wins on sept .
18 .
it could radically remake german fiscal policy , conservative supporters say . when cdu leader and chancellor candidate angela merkel picked paul kirchhof , a heidelberg university professor and former constitutional court judge , as her top finance adviser wednesday , she signaled that she was ready to move towards radical reform .
" if it is up to me and the coalition talks allow it , he will become finance minister , " merkel said during a campaign stop .
kirchhof , 62 , is best known for a tax reform proposal he presented in 2003 which calls for a flat 25 percent tax for corporations and individuals .
but many financial experts and politicians criticize the choice because kirchhof , they say , is a political novice and lacks the cdu party connections to run the finance ministry effectively .
merkel 's plans could be derailed if bavarian premier edmund stoiber or a member of the free democrats , the likely coalition partner , lay claim to the portfolio .
the post is considered critical because of germany 's fight to cut its debt and lower its deficit .
must set good example kirchhof told the mass-circulation newspaper bild that if elected , the conservatives would bring the german budget deficit below the european union 's limit of three percent of gdp in the " near future . "
he also said that germany must again set a good financial example for europe .
bildunterschrift : angela 's a-team " i am convinced that government debt is currently the most dramatic problem we face , " he said .
" it 's simply obscene to pass this fundamental burden on to future generations . "
germany breached the eu stability pact rules for the third time last year and is expected to do so again 2005 .
this time , eu finance ministers may decide to penalize the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.08.2005 germany , nation of reluctant strikers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " strike " , it says , but that 's easier said than done in germany .
german workers are renowned in industrial world circles for the cushy conditions upon which they luxuriously lounge .
but just how do they get them ?
not , it seems , by downing their tools and screaming injustice . in a study of strike culture in developed countries published last week by the institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- , german workers emerged as some of the most reluctant strikers .
the report , which observed walk-out tendencies in the 30 members of the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , revealed that between 1991 and 2000 , german workers notched up a meager 9.3 annual strike days per 1,000 employees .
only austrian , japanese and swiss employees recorded even greater committment to work , while at the other end of the scale , the number climbed surely and steadily to its canadian peak of 189 annual strike days within the same time frame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picket lines are a relative rarity in germany the discrepancy leaves room for considerable questions .
why is it that german workers , who are generally not afraid of grumbling about anything less than the best , rarely have to erect a picket line in order to get what they want ?
the answers , says jan jurczyk of the service industry trade union , verdi , are manifold .
“ in essence , it is not very easy to strike in germany .
we have a highly developed collective agreement system and strike action can only be taken in connection therewith , ” jurczyk said .
“ political strikes are not allowed and neither is industrial action organized by a small number of employees .
at least not legally . ”
heading the union call on the contrary , strikers can only become such if rallied to do so by their union , and even they have limited power to make that call .
the collective agreements , which cover things like pay , holiday , working hours and pensions , severely limit the opportunities for employees to walk out at all .
“ as long as the agreement is valid , which generally varies between one and two years , there can be no strikes .
and then after the contract between the union and employer has expired , there is still a grace period of several weeks in which there can also be no walk outs , ” jurczyk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no ballot , no strike and even when that period , known as a “ peace obligation ” is over , strike action must be endorsed by at least 75 percent of union members .
a further “ hurdle , ” says jurczyk , is the employers ’ right to enforce a lockout , in which the entire workforce , strikers and non-strikers alike , are barred from the premises .
strike action must be last resort the whole system is designed to discourage escalation of disputes at every turn , and to instead encourage communication between the voice of the employees , the unions , and the employers .
and it is well oiled .
dr. heiner dribbusch works for the institute for economic and social research -lrb- wsi -rrb- in the hans böckler foundation , which is a research institute related to the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- . he says that although when push comes to shove , german workers are willing to exercise their , albeit limited , right to strike , they use it sparingly .
and the same , he says , is true of the unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union-backed demonstrations precede industrial action “ unions are doubtless interested in having as few restrictions as possible , so they can be the ones who make the decisions , ” dribbusch said .
“ but that said , they don ’ t use every opportunity they have to strike , which suggests that they don ’ t want to . ”
and one good reason for that is the generous replacement wages which unions have to pay to their striking members .
“ unions are cautious when it comes to calling for industrial action , not least because of the expense of having to fork out strike money , ” jurczyk said .
“ employees get paid more or less the same by the unions as they receive in their basic pay packet , and in a large workforce , that can add up to huge amounts of money . ”
too good to remain true ?
like so many german systems , the strike prevention one is precisely structured and designed to be of some benefit to everyone concerned .
and for those who do enjoy a right to strike , which public servants in germany incidentally do not , it is a system which has , over the past half decade , proved its worth .
“ take the chemical industry , for example , it has only witnessed one strike since the end of the war .
many employees in germany will go through their working life never having experienced any industrial action , ” dribbusch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taste of things to come ?
but there are signs that things are changing .
in the current economic climate , the demand for employment far outstrips the supply , and jurczyk says that is affecting the way in which collective agreements are negotiated .
“ employers ’ associations have begun to react to employees ’ demands in a more aggressive way , and to respond to them with counter demands .
they 're using the levels of unemployment as a threat to the existing workforce , ” he said .
“ whether such behavior will lead to more strikes , we don ’ t know .
it hasn ’ t been decided yet . ” tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

the new hard-left grouping in germany , the left party , is sending tremors across the political landscape .
but , the party 's economic program has industry groups and economists shaking their heads , and worrying .

german workers are renowned in industrial world circles for the cushy conditions upon which they luxuriously lounge .
but just how do they get them ?
not , it seems , by downing their tools and screaming injustice . in a study of strike culture in developed countries published last week by the institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- , german workers emerged as some of the most reluctant strikers .
the report , which observed walk-out tendencies in the 30 members of the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , revealed that between 1991 and 2000 , german workers notched up a meager 9.3 annual strike days per 1,000 employees .
only austrian , japanese and swiss employees recorded even greater committment to work , while at the other end of the scale , the number climbed surely and steadily to its canadian peak of 189 annual strike days within the same time frame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picket lines are a relative rarity in germany the discrepancy leaves room for considerable questions .
why is it that german workers , who are generally not afraid of grumbling about anything less than the best , rarely have to erect a picket line in order to get what they want ?
the answers , says jan jurczyk of the service industry trade union , verdi , are manifold .
“ in essence , it is not very easy to strike in germany .
we have a highly developed collective agreement system and strike action can only be taken in connection therewith , ” jurczyk said .
“ political strikes are not allowed and neither is industrial action organized by a small number of employees .
at least not legally . ”
heading the union call on the contrary , strikers can only become such if rallied to do so by their union , and even they have limited power to make that call .
the collective agreements , which cover things like pay , holiday , working hours and pensions , severely limit the opportunities for employees to walk out at all .
“ as long as the agreement is valid , which generally varies between one and two years , there can be no strikes .
and then after the contract between the union and employer has expired , there is still a grace period of several weeks in which there can also be no walk outs , ” jurczyk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no ballot , no strike and even when that period , known as a “ peace obligation ” is over , strike action must be endorsed by at least 75 percent of union members .
a further “ hurdle , ” says jurczyk , is the employers ’ right to enforce a lockout , in which the entire workforce , strikers and non-strikers alike , are barred from the premises .
strike action must be last resort the whole system is designed to discourage escalation of disputes at every turn , and to instead encourage communication between the voice of the employees , the unions , and the employers .
and it is well oiled .
dr. heiner dribbusch works for the institute for economic and social research -lrb- wsi -rrb- in the hans böckler foundation , which is a research institute related to the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- . he says that although when push comes to shove , german workers are willing to exercise their , albeit limited , right to strike , they use it sparingly .

“ but that said , they don ’ t use every opportunity they have to strike , which suggests that they don ’ t want to . ”
and one good reason for that is the generous replacement wages which unions have to pay to their striking members .
“ unions are cautious when it comes to calling for industrial action , not least because of the expense of having to fork out strike money , ” jurczyk said .
“ employees get paid more or less the same by the unions as they receive in their basic pay packet , and in a large workforce , that can add up to huge amounts of money . ”
too good to remain true ?
like so many german systems , the strike prevention one is precisely structured and designed to be of some benefit to everyone concerned .
and for those who do enjoy a right to strike , which public servants in germany incidentally do not , it is a system which has , over the past half decade , proved its worth .

but there are signs that things are changing .
in the current economic climate , the demand for employment far outstrips the supply , and jurczyk says that is affecting the way in which collective agreements are negotiated .
“ employers ’ associations have begun to react to employees ’ demands in a more aggressive way , and to respond to them with counter demands .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.08.2005 germany , nation of reluctant strikers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " strike " , it says , but that 's easier said than done in germany .
german workers are renowned in industrial world circles for the cushy conditions upon which they luxuriously lounge .
but just how do they get them ?
not , it seems , by downing their tools and screaming injustice . in a study of strike culture in developed countries published last week by the institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- , german workers emerged as some of the most reluctant strikers .
the report , which observed walk-out tendencies in the 30 members of the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , revealed that between 1991 and 2000 , german workers notched up a meager 9.3 annual strike days per 1,000 employees .
only austrian , japanese and swiss employees recorded even greater committment to work , while at the other end of the scale , the number climbed surely and steadily to its canadian peak of 189 annual strike days within the same time frame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picket lines are a relative rarity in germany the discrepancy leaves room for considerable questions .
why is it that german workers , who are generally not afraid of grumbling about anything less than the best , rarely have to erect a picket line in order to get what they want ?
the answers , says jan jurczyk of the service industry trade union , verdi , are manifold .
“ in essence , it is not very easy to strike in germany .
we have a highly developed collective agreement system and strike action can only be taken in connection therewith , ” jurczyk said .
“ political strikes are not allowed and neither is industrial action organized by a small number of employees .
at least not legally . ”
heading the union call on the contrary , strikers can only become such if rallied to do so by their union , and even they have limited power to make that call .
the collective agreements , which cover things like pay , holiday , working hours and pensions , severely limit the opportunities for employees to walk out at all .
“ as long as the agreement is valid , which generally varies between one and two years , there can be no strikes .
and then after the contract between the union and employer has expired , there is still a grace period of several weeks in which there can also be no walk outs , ” jurczyk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no ballot , no strike and even when that period , known as a “ peace obligation ” is over , strike action must be endorsed by at least 75 percent of union members .
a further “ hurdle , ” says jurczyk , is the employers ’ right to enforce a lockout , in which the entire workforce , strikers and non-strikers alike , are barred from the premises .
strike action must be last resort the whole system is designed to discourage escalation of disputes at every turn , and to instead encourage communication between the voice of the employees , the unions , and the employers .
and it is well oiled .
dr. heiner dribbusch works for the institute for economic and social research -lrb- wsi -rrb- in the hans böckler foundation , which is a research institute related to the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- . he says that although when push comes to shove , german workers are willing to exercise their , albeit limited , right to strike , they use it sparingly .
and the same , he says , is true of the unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union-backed demonstrations precede industrial action “ unions are doubtless interested in having as few restrictions as possible , so they can be the ones who make the decisions , ” dribbusch said .
“ but that said , they don ’ t use every opportunity they have to strike , which suggests that they don ’ t want to . ”
and one good reason for that is the generous replacement wages which unions have to pay to their striking members .
“ unions are cautious when it comes to calling for industrial action , not least because of the expense of having to fork out strike money , ” jurczyk said .
“ employees get paid more or less the same by the unions as they receive in their basic pay packet , and in a large workforce , that can add up to huge amounts of money . ”
too good to remain true ?
like so many german systems , the strike prevention one is precisely structured and designed to be of some benefit to everyone concerned .
and for those who do enjoy a right to strike , which public servants in germany incidentally do not , it is a system which has , over the past half decade , proved its worth .
“ take the chemical industry , for example , it has only witnessed one strike since the end of the war .
many employees in germany will go through their working life never having experienced any industrial action , ” dribbusch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taste of things to come ?
but there are signs that things are changing .
in the current economic climate , the demand for employment far outstrips the supply , and jurczyk says that is affecting the way in which collective agreements are negotiated .
“ employers ’ associations have begun to react to employees ’ demands in a more aggressive way , and to respond to them with counter demands .
they 're using the levels of unemployment as a threat to the existing workforce , ” he said .
“ whether such behavior will lead to more strikes , we don ’ t know .
it hasn ’ t been decided yet . ” tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

many hope their children will grow up to enjoy opportunities they themselves never had . " you do n't have to pay much to study here , " pointed out one arab student .
but while getting a german education is an obvious advantage , it 's often easier said than done .
integrating with german peers and adjusting to the european mentality can be difficult .
even building up a social life can be tricky . " not all germans are reserved , " conceded one young moroccan .
" some of the people here are quite open , but on the whole , i find most germans very stand-offish . " ignorance others agree that coming to terms with the german way of life is fraught with obstacles .
potential pitfalls range from the practical to the psychological . " i 've never integrated properly here , " admitted one egyptian .

in the wake of the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states and the more recent events in madrid and london , the western world has made islamic fundamentalism its number one enemy - and across europe , many muslims say they are now treated with widespread suspicion and hostility . even so , others are quick to point out that getting to grips with a country like germany has a lot to do with one 's own attitudes .

many allege that coping with prejudice is a part of their lives , but they also admit that embracing german society does n't come easily to them . ask a random selection of young arabs what brought their families to germany and you 'll get a broad range of replies .

but while getting a german education is an obvious advantage , it 's often easier said than done .
integrating with german peers and adjusting to the european mentality can be difficult .

many of the young pilgrims in cologne this week have found new ways of living their religion , which sometimes involve ignoring official church doctrine . katja jarc knows fewer younger people are going to church .
the 18-year-old slovenian can see it every sunday when she single-handedly brings down parish 's average age .
" nearly everyone is at least 60 years old , " she said .
" it 's hard to find anyone my age there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims wait to enter the cologne cathedral finding more young people interested in religion is one of the reasons jarc decided to attend the world youth day event in cologne .
she 's achieved that goal , since there are some 400,000 young faithful who have come to cologne for prayer , song , revivals and some good old-fashioned partying .
the catholic festival also sent her on the pilgrimage of sorts even after she arrived in this city on the rhine .
this second pilgrimage was shorter , however , than the long trip from slovenia .
this one started at the river 's edge and ended at cologne 's famous cathedral .
" here there are so many friendly people who are interested in church and prayer , " she said as groups passed by .
some people were waving national flags ; others whispered the rosary in a handful of different languages .
" i want to meet as many people like me as i can here in cologne . "
covering a distance of about two kilometers -lrb- 1.2 miles -rrb- , the pilgrimage is intended to represent the three wise men 's search for god .
world youth day organizers have recommended all visitors take the walk before visiting the shrine to the biblical kings inside the cathedral .
differing view of church 's teaching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young catholics have their own ideas about faith though the 400,000 pilgrims from some 120 different countries are united by a single faith at the catholic festival , the young people 's interpretation of their religion tends to differ , especially when it comes to personal issues like contraception and abortion .
" something is n't right when there are so many devout believers in africa and lots of them end up dying of aids , " said daniela gall , 18 , who lives near munich .
but the church should n't just sway with the mores of the day either , according to bryan brochu of alberta , canada .
" one of the strengths of the church is that it does n't change every time society wants it to , " said brochu , 21 , as speakers played recordings of the hail mary in german , english , french and italian .
" there are people who say the church is too old school , but i think it should stick to its values and traditions . "
admitting that he is not overly religious , tobias straub , 18 , came to the world youth day at the urging of his priest at home in bavaria who told him to look at the church 's teachings as a lighthouse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pilgrimage continues outside the cathedral " there are times you really need some direction and other times you can go on your own , " he said as his group joined the parade snaking its way around the square outside the cathedral .
" people should decide for themselves . "
keeping youth interested catholicism should n't force all of its tenets on people who are looking for guidance since the church has bigger problems it should concentrate on , according to jarc .
" i think the church should concentrate more on finding ways to get more younger people interested in religion , " she said .
young people want to know the church is also taking them into consideration every day , not just when it 's organizing concerts along the rhine .
" i like the times when i can organize something like a mass or other meeting myself , " gall said .
" that and a great priest who helps us do what we want is what keeps me interested in the church 's youth group . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi will say mass for 800,000 on sunday in an interview with vatican radio , pope benedict xvi -lrb- photo -rrb- agreed that sparking interest in religion among youth is key to the world youth day 's success .
" if this zest , this joy , to know christ would come alive again and give the church in germany and europe a new dynamic , then i think the aim of world youth day would be achieved . "
according to jarc , the songs , prayers and chants of " hey , hey benito " heard along the pilgrims ' trail show that a spark has already been lit .
now it 's up to the church and the pilgrims to keep it from going out , she said .
" the world youth day is great , " she added .

many of the young pilgrims in cologne this week have found new ways of living their religion , which sometimes involve ignoring official church doctrine . katja jarc knows fewer younger people are going to church .
the 18-year-old slovenian can see it every sunday when she single-handedly brings down parish 's average age .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims wait to enter the cologne cathedral finding more young people interested in religion is one of the reasons jarc decided to attend the world youth day event in cologne .
she 's achieved that goal , since there are some 400,000 young faithful who have come to cologne for prayer , song , revivals and some good old-fashioned partying .
the catholic festival also sent her on the pilgrimage of sorts even after she arrived in this city on the rhine .
this second pilgrimage was shorter , however , than the long trip from slovenia .
this one started at the river 's edge and ended at cologne 's famous cathedral .
" here there are so many friendly people who are interested in church and prayer , " she said as groups passed by .
some people were waving national flags ; others whispered the rosary in a handful of different languages .
" i want to meet as many people like me as i can here in cologne . "
covering a distance of about two kilometers -lrb- 1.2 miles -rrb- , the pilgrimage is intended to represent the three wise men 's search for god .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.08.2005 eu air safety rules fall short großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu skies must become safer , officials say although the european union has stepped up safety rules for the air transport sector in recent years , the bloc is still dogged by a lack of coordination and sometimes patchy application of existing regulations . a recent string of crashes claiming the lives of eu citizens has refocused attention on measures to improve european air safety , including a possible blacklist of airlines . in the latest incident , a colombian airplane crashed in venezuela on tuesday , killing all 160 people on board , including 152 french passengers .
the disaster came only days after a cypriot airplane hit a hillside near athens , taking the lives of 121 passengers , most of whom were cypriots . earlier this month a tunisian-operated charter plane crash landed at sea off the sicilian coast killing 13 people , including 12 italians . in reaction to the crash in venezuela , eu transportation officials have called for tougher safety measures . " this accident … shows that we must collectively step up efforts to ensure the highest level of air transport security in europe and shelter all of the -lrb- european -rrb- union 's passengers and crew from such dramas , " said eu transport commissioner jacques barrot . beefing up checks in january 2004 , the crash in egypt of a boeing airliner operated by flash airlines , which killed 148 people , spurred the eu into action after years of negotiations and led to a beefing-up of safety checks on non-eu airplanes at airports in member states . the transport commissioner at the time , loyola de palacio , was quick to say that the flash airlines accident probably would never have happened had the rules been in place before the crash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent air disasters are spurring a new look at air safety in 1994 , the eu made it a requirement after air accidents that a technical probe be carried out by a body independent of the national civil aviation authorities . but like many eu rules , this one has not always been followed by all member states .

the match finished in a 2-2 draw , a rather flattering result for the german side .
the dutch are spoilt for choice when it comes to world-class strikers and could allow themswelves to leave bayern munich ’ s striker roy makaay on the bench in the first half with ruud van nistelroy and arjen robben up front .
veteran defender christian wörns was recalled to the german side along with didi hamann to help sure up germany ’ s weak defense with midfielder bernd schneider playing at left back .

at half-time germany could count themselves lucky to be only one goal down as the dutch wasted several golden opportunities .

suddenly germany broke and after good work by tim borowski , substitute gerald asamoah came in on the right to squeeze the ball over the line from an sharp angle .
2-2 was the final score . a typical german comeback and totally against the run of play .
while germany were delighted to equalise their miserable run against the big nations continues and it is 15 games since they defeated a recognised top team .

" that so many people have come to meet the successor of peter is a sign of the church 's vitality .
i am happy to be with them , confirm their faith and enliven their hope , " benedict xvi said upon arrival . crowds gathering on the rhine teeming masses of flag-waving young catholics lined the banks of the rhine waiting to catch their first glimpse of pope benedict xvi as he sailed up the river to join a global youth festival . " i will never forget this day , it was an awesome experience .
he seemed so full of joy as he waved to us , " said colleen ackerman , 25 , from cape town . for colleen and most of the crowd , it was their first view of a pope in the flesh and the man greeting them from the upper deck of the river cruiser did not disappoint .

it 's might be hard to believe , but the great master of vorsprung durch technik , the german automobile industry , is no longer in pole position in the race to make modern cars more environmentally friendly . a study published on wednesday by germany 's automobile club , vcd , revealed that japan and france have their feet to the floor when it comes to environmental matters , and have left german car manufacturers spluttering in their wake . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the smart car is too small to do too much damage the vcd have been assessing anti-pollution merits of popular cars since 1989 , and the findings from their most recent review were the worst ever for germany , which only managed to squeeze one model , the opel corsa eco 1.0 into the top ten . and even that only made it into sixth place on the ranking table . it 's bad news for germany , which is currently still ruled in part by the green party , and which has long nurtured its reputation for being environmentally altruistic . bad boy volkswagen the vcd was particularly harsh in its criticism of the peoples ' favorite , volkswagen , for not installing a particle-filter to counter diesel soot in its best-selling model , the golf .

it could radically remake german fiscal policy , conservative supporters say . when cdu leader and chancellor candidate angela merkel picked paul kirchhof , a heidelberg university professor and former constitutional court judge , as her top finance adviser wednesday , she signaled that she was ready to move towards radical reform .
" if it is up to me and the coalition talks allow it , he will become finance minister , " merkel said during a campaign stop .
kirchhof , 62 , is best known for a tax reform proposal he presented in 2003 which calls for a flat 25 percent tax for corporations and individuals .

merkel 's plans could be derailed if bavarian premier edmund stoiber or a member of the free democrats , the likely coalition partner , lay claim to the portfolio .
the post is considered critical because of germany 's fight to cut its debt and lower its deficit .

that could mean germany takes harsher measures against those deemed islamic militants . it 's the latest in a serious of no-nonsense actions from down south .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein announced thursday that he is expelling three more suspected islamic radicals .
this time , the three are members of a group called tablighi jamaat , which has about 450 members around germany and whose followers want to establish an islamic state , officials said .
german security officials have previously described the group as peaceful but said it could become infiltrated by radicals .
beckstein called them " missionaries " bent on spreading radical islam including the idea of " jihad , " or holy war , which encourages martyrdom through suicide attacks .
he added that bavaria would , with the expulsions , draw a clear and consistent line against " hate preachers " and suspected islamic militants .
" we want to make it clear to islamic extremists that the bavarian government wo n't tolerate anyone who wants to replace our free and democratic order with an islamic state , " he said in a statement .
the three , two bosnians and a moroccan , have until sept .
10 to leave or face deportation .
bavarians most aggressive since a new immigration law took effect in january , making it easier and faster to expel suspected islamic militants , bavaria has been quick to make the most of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber wants more action so far , the wealthy southern state has deported 16 people it suspected of militant activities , began proceedings on 26 more and moving on 10 more .
that is more than any of the other 15 german states so far , officials said .
it comes as little surprise .
a nationwide raid in january that led to the arrest of 22 suspected militants came after an investigation initiated by the bavarians .
soon after , beckstein said in a speech that more than 500 islamic extremists in germany " must be considered extremely dangerous " and that there are several thousand other fanatical muslims in the country .
his boss , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , has gone farther , saying that there are tens of thousands of radical muslims in germany , at least 4,000 of those he wants to deport for extremist activities .
increasing focus germany was forced to increase its efforts to clamp down on islamic radicals after it was discovered that the september 11 hijackers planned their attacks while living as students in hamburg .
last year , schilly said that the fight against islamic militants was a top priority .
as a result , the government established an anti-terror command headquarters in berlin .
on jan .
1 , the new immigration law which eases immigration for skilled workers also requires a detailed background check on every immigrant and eases the deportation of those designated " islamic hate preachers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan , the caliph of cologne , was extradited after a long process since then , the most recent extradition of an islamic militant was of metin kaplan to turkey for disseminating fundamentalist propaganda during his sermons .
kaplan had lived for decades in cologne .
deporting people is especially tricky for germany in light of its nazi legacy .
at the same time , germans worry about harboring extremists and populist sentiments by politicians such as stoiber against muslim immigrants suspected of radicalism appeal to many .
security experts applaud the stepped up efforts by the government to address extremism but still complain that too little has been done .
that will probably change with a new government - merkel has selected beckstein to replace schilly if she wins the election and his fervor for deporting suspected radicals could soon be felt on the federal level . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's arabs struggle to fit in germany is home to an estimated 280,000 people of arab extraction .

on wednesday night , coach jürgen klinsmann ’ s side faced their arch rivals the netherlands in rotterdam . with the netherlands currently ranked third in the world and germany ranked 11th german coach jürgen klinsmann knew his side faced a stiff task in the cauldron of rotterdam ’ s de kuip stadium .
the match finished in a 2-2 draw , a rather flattering result for the german side .
the dutch are spoilt for choice when it comes to world-class strikers and could allow themswelves to leave bayern munich ’ s striker roy makaay on the bench in the first half with ruud van nistelroy and arjen robben up front .
veteran defender christian wörns was recalled to the german side along with didi hamann to help sure up germany ’ s weak defense with midfielder bernd schneider playing at left back .
dutch coach van basten is a shrewd man , noticed schneider was playing out of position and switched arjen robben to the right wing to trouble schneider ... this move paid dividends early on as the dutch took a third minute lead through chelsea striker robben .
at half-time germany could count themselves lucky to be only one goal down as the dutch wasted several golden opportunities .
one minute into the second half though germany found themselves two goals down . again the scorer was arjen robben .
the game looked over .
klinsmann ’ s biggest defeat ?
jürgen klinsmann , the striker-turned coach was solely responsible for germany 's last victory over the oranje by converting a penalty for a 1-0 win in 1996 - also in rotterdam .
but on wednesday night , he looked as if he would be suffering his worst defeat as coach .
but michael ballack had other ideas and quickly pulled a goal back for germany with a diving header .
yet it was still the dutch magicians who were playing the beautiful football but who continued to squander chance after chance , hitting the crossbar twice .
suddenly germany broke and after good work by tim borowski , substitute gerald asamoah came in on the right to squeeze the ball over the line from an sharp angle .
2-2 was the final score . a typical german comeback and totally against the run of play .
while germany were delighted to equalise their miserable run against the big nations continues and it is 15 games since they defeated a recognised top team .

" what we worry about is that it may happen that the virus infects a human , or even a pig , that has a circulating strain of normal influenza , and this normal human influenza will recombine with this avian form , " said thompson , " what will emerge is a strain that the human immune system has never seen before and moves easily from person to person , and that would ignite a pandemic .

" while we do believe that the virus is susceptible to a particular anti-viral , that anti-viral will be in limited supply , " he said .

it 's might be hard to believe , but the great master of vorsprung durch technik , the german automobile industry , is no longer in pole position in the race to make modern cars more environmentally friendly . a study published on wednesday by germany 's automobile club , vcd , revealed that japan and france have their feet to the floor when it comes to environmental matters , and have left german car manufacturers spluttering in their wake . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the smart car is too small to do too much damage the vcd have been assessing anti-pollution merits of popular cars since 1989 , and the findings from their most recent review were the worst ever for germany , which only managed to squeeze one model , the opel corsa eco 1.0 into the top ten . and even that only made it into sixth place on the ranking table . it 's bad news for germany , which is currently still ruled in part by the green party , and which has long nurtured its reputation for being environmentally altruistic . bad boy volkswagen the vcd was particularly harsh in its criticism of the peoples ' favorite , volkswagen , for not installing a particle-filter to counter diesel soot in its best-selling model , the golf . " german manufacturers face the prospect of losing touch with environmental technology , " said deputy vcd chairman , hermann-josef vogt .
and the upshot of that , says the report , is that germany could lose credibility as a centre of automobile technology , subsequently become less competitive and having to shed jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can environmental technology keep up with the cars ?
the comments were met with roaring disapproval from the german association of the automotive industry , vda , which delivered a vitriolic response , accusing the automobile club of being a " smorgasbord of smug , self-important people with no substance " and describing the report as being " disproportionately out of touch with reality . " so exactly what is the reality ?
simply that toyota tops the list - which measures cars for both economic virtue and emission levels - with its no frills prius 1 , and that citroen , peugeot and daihatsu are hotter on its wheels than any german make . missed opportunity a spokesman for the vcd said it need not have been that way , and that volkswagen could have pipped toyota to the post had it concentrated less on honing its super-speed luxury limos and simply installed standard-issue filters in its audi 2 and lupo model , which have now been withdrawn from the market . # b # the spokesman , gerd lottsiepen , said that without the filter , diesel cars were " yesterday 's technology " , and a clear statement from the makers that they do n't care about the health of their customers . solicitousness was higher in the compact car category , which featured two appearances each from mercedes and opel and one from audi , but there was again a conspicuous absence of german names on the list of family models .
vw just managed to roll onto the bottom of the table at tenth place with its golf 2.0 variant bifuel . that 's not good enough for lottsiepen , who says it is time for the government , however it may look following the elections , to introduce tax benefits on cars which are equipped with today 's technology . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german carmakers move on diesel filters the eu 's new clean air law and hesitant consumers are causing german carmakers to scramble to equip diesel cars with soot filters as several german cities have reached pollution levels that require driving bans .
-lrb- march 30 , 2005 -rrb- german cars still stars ... for now in germany , it used to be that you knew you 'd made it in life when you bought your first mercedes .
but as affordable foreign cars offer consumers an attractive alternative , how long will this still be the case ?

it 's might be hard to believe , but the great master of vorsprung durch technik , the german automobile industry , is no longer in pole position in the race to make modern cars more environmentally friendly . a study published on wednesday by germany 's automobile club , vcd , revealed that japan and france have their feet to the floor when it comes to environmental matters , and have left german car manufacturers spluttering in their wake . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the smart car is too small to do too much damage the vcd have been assessing anti-pollution merits of popular cars since 1989 , and the findings from their most recent review were the worst ever for germany , which only managed to squeeze one model , the opel corsa eco 1.0 into the top ten . and even that only made it into sixth place on the ranking table . it 's bad news for germany , which is currently still ruled in part by the green party , and which has long nurtured its reputation for being environmentally altruistic . bad boy volkswagen the vcd was particularly harsh in its criticism of the peoples ' favorite , volkswagen , for not installing a particle-filter to counter diesel soot in its best-selling model , the golf . " german manufacturers face the prospect of losing touch with environmental technology , " said deputy vcd chairman , hermann-josef vogt .

simply that toyota tops the list - which measures cars for both economic virtue and emission levels - with its no frills prius 1 , and that citroen , peugeot and daihatsu are hotter on its wheels than any german make . missed opportunity a spokesman for the vcd said it need not have been that way , and that volkswagen could have pipped toyota to the post had it concentrated less on honing its super-speed luxury limos and simply installed standard-issue filters in its audi 2 and lupo model , which have now been withdrawn from the market . # b # the spokesman , gerd lottsiepen , said that without the filter , diesel cars were " yesterday 's technology " , and a clear statement from the makers that they do n't care about the health of their customers . solicitousness was higher in the compact car category , which featured two appearances each from mercedes and opel and one from audi , but there was again a conspicuous absence of german names on the list of family models .

the disaster came only days after a cypriot airplane hit a hillside near athens , taking the lives of 121 passengers , most of whom were cypriots . earlier this month a tunisian-operated charter plane crash landed at sea off the sicilian coast killing 13 people , including 12 italians . in reaction to the crash in venezuela , eu transportation officials have called for tougher safety measures . " this accident … shows that we must collectively step up efforts to ensure the highest level of air transport security in europe and shelter all of the -lrb- european -rrb- union 's passengers and crew from such dramas , " said eu transport commissioner jacques barrot . beefing up checks in january 2004 , the crash in egypt of a boeing airliner operated by flash airlines , which killed 148 people , spurred the eu into action after years of negotiations and led to a beefing-up of safety checks on non-eu airplanes at airports in member states . the transport commissioner at the time , loyola de palacio , was quick to say that the flash airlines accident probably would never have happened had the rules been in place before the crash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent air disasters are spurring a new look at air safety in 1994 , the eu made it a requirement after air accidents that a technical probe be carried out by a body independent of the national civil aviation authorities . but like many eu rules , this one has not always been followed by all member states .

" the commissioner aims to extend in the coming months the responsibilities of the european aviation safety agency -lrb- easa -rrb- , which currently issues airworthiness certificates for aeronautical products , parts and equipment . in particular , barrot wants to see the easa play a greater role in monitoring flight safety and the security of non-eu airlines , and in certifying crew members . bildunterschrift : before the crash in venezuela keeping passengers in the loop plans for regulations on keeping passengers informed about flights are also in the works . ahead of a first reading of the regulations by the european parliament , eu members agreed in principle in april that passengers be informed as soon as possible and , in any case , before take-off of changes in the airline operating a flight . the new rules also propose improved information exchange about grounded airlines , although belgium , france , germany and spain want more coordination on the criteria used to designate such carriers . new legislation a 2004 regulation on the safety of airplanes from non-eu members , which members have until may 2006 to adopt into their national legislation , opens the way for an eu-wide flight ban if such a ban has been declared by a single member state . however , an extension of the regulation would have to be proposed by the european commission and backed by a qualified majority of member states , which tend to jealously hold on to their authority to authorize flights . the lack of eu-wide coordination sparked chaos in may when thousands of passengers were left stranded after a ban on turkish carrier onur air - by france , germany , the netherlands and switzerland - until their flights were finally rerouted via belgium . blacklist possible the european commission is considering publishing a blacklist of airlines and aircraft subject to bans or restrictions in eu member states on the internet , barrot said wednesday . the european union blacklist idea is similar to a mechanism already operational in the united states , where would-be passengers can consult a website publishing the names of airlines with relatively poor safety records . " we hope that with the information that will be communicated to the commission we will be able to publish a sort of blacklist , " barrot said , adding that the proposal could become reality by the end of the year if it is passed by the european parliament . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greece and cyprus in mourning after plane crash the bodies of 119 of the 121 people on board the cypriot airliner which crashed northeast of athens as well as the plane 's second flight recorder have been recovered , greek national television reported monday .

angela merkel has announced she wants to appoint radical tax reform advocate paul kirchhof as finance minister if her party wins on sept .
18 .
it could radically remake german fiscal policy , conservative supporters say . when cdu leader and chancellor candidate angela merkel picked paul kirchhof , a heidelberg university professor and former constitutional court judge , as her top finance adviser wednesday , she signaled that she was ready to move towards radical reform .
" if it is up to me and the coalition talks allow it , he will become finance minister , " merkel said during a campaign stop .
kirchhof , 62 , is best known for a tax reform proposal he presented in 2003 which calls for a flat 25 percent tax for corporations and individuals .
but many financial experts and politicians criticize the choice because kirchhof , they say , is a political novice and lacks the cdu party connections to run the finance ministry effectively .
merkel 's plans could be derailed if bavarian premier edmund stoiber or a member of the free democrats , the likely coalition partner , lay claim to the portfolio .
the post is considered critical because of germany 's fight to cut its debt and lower its deficit .
must set good example kirchhof told the mass-circulation newspaper bild that if elected , the conservatives would bring the german budget deficit below the european union 's limit of three percent of gdp in the " near future . "
he also said that germany must again set a good financial example for europe .
bildunterschrift : angela 's a-team " i am convinced that government debt is currently the most dramatic problem we face , " he said .
" it 's simply obscene to pass this fundamental burden on to future generations . "
germany breached the eu stability pact rules for the third time last year and is expected to do so again 2005 .
this time , eu finance ministers may decide to penalize the country .
the conservatives have promised to get germany 's deficit below three percent by 2009 and balance the federal budget by 2013 . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel 's " dream team " conservative chancellor candidate angela merkel presented her so-called " competence team " on wednesday .

angela merkel has announced she wants to appoint radical tax reform advocate paul kirchhof as finance minister if her party wins on sept .
18 .
it could radically remake german fiscal policy , conservative supporters say . when cdu leader and chancellor candidate angela merkel picked paul kirchhof , a heidelberg university professor and former constitutional court judge , as her top finance adviser wednesday , she signaled that she was ready to move towards radical reform .
" if it is up to me and the coalition talks allow it , he will become finance minister , " merkel said during a campaign stop .
kirchhof , 62 , is best known for a tax reform proposal he presented in 2003 which calls for a flat 25 percent tax for corporations and individuals .
but many financial experts and politicians criticize the choice because kirchhof , they say , is a political novice and lacks the cdu party connections to run the finance ministry effectively .
merkel 's plans could be derailed if bavarian premier edmund stoiber or a member of the free democrats , the likely coalition partner , lay claim to the portfolio .
the post is considered critical because of germany 's fight to cut its debt and lower its deficit .
must set good example kirchhof told the mass-circulation newspaper bild that if elected , the conservatives would bring the german budget deficit below the european union 's limit of three percent of gdp in the " near future . "
he also said that germany must again set a good financial example for europe .
bildunterschrift : angela 's a-team " i am convinced that government debt is currently the most dramatic problem we face , " he said .
" it 's simply obscene to pass this fundamental burden on to future generations . "
germany breached the eu stability pact rules for the third time last year and is expected to do so again 2005 .
this time , eu finance ministers may decide to penalize the country .

many of the young pilgrims in cologne this week have found new ways of living their religion , which sometimes involve ignoring official church doctrine . katja jarc knows fewer younger people are going to church .
the 18-year-old slovenian can see it every sunday when she single-handedly brings down parish 's average age .
" nearly everyone is at least 60 years old , " she said .
" it 's hard to find anyone my age there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims wait to enter the cologne cathedral finding more young people interested in religion is one of the reasons jarc decided to attend the world youth day event in cologne .
she 's achieved that goal , since there are some 400,000 young faithful who have come to cologne for prayer , song , revivals and some good old-fashioned partying .
the catholic festival also sent her on the pilgrimage of sorts even after she arrived in this city on the rhine .
this second pilgrimage was shorter , however , than the long trip from slovenia .
this one started at the river 's edge and ended at cologne 's famous cathedral .
" here there are so many friendly people who are interested in church and prayer , " she said as groups passed by .
some people were waving national flags ; others whispered the rosary in a handful of different languages .
" i want to meet as many people like me as i can here in cologne . "
covering a distance of about two kilometers -lrb- 1.2 miles -rrb- , the pilgrimage is intended to represent the three wise men 's search for god .
world youth day organizers have recommended all visitors take the walk before visiting the shrine to the biblical kings inside the cathedral .
differing view of church 's teaching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young catholics have their own ideas about faith though the 400,000 pilgrims from some 120 different countries are united by a single faith at the catholic festival , the young people 's interpretation of their religion tends to differ , especially when it comes to personal issues like contraception and abortion .
" something is n't right when there are so many devout believers in africa and lots of them end up dying of aids , " said daniela gall , 18 , who lives near munich .
but the church should n't just sway with the mores of the day either , according to bryan brochu of alberta , canada .
" one of the strengths of the church is that it does n't change every time society wants it to , " said brochu , 21 , as speakers played recordings of the hail mary in german , english , french and italian .
" there are people who say the church is too old school , but i think it should stick to its values and traditions . "
admitting that he is not overly religious , tobias straub , 18 , came to the world youth day at the urging of his priest at home in bavaria who told him to look at the church 's teachings as a lighthouse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pilgrimage continues outside the cathedral " there are times you really need some direction and other times you can go on your own , " he said as his group joined the parade snaking its way around the square outside the cathedral .
" people should decide for themselves . "
keeping youth interested catholicism should n't force all of its tenets on people who are looking for guidance since the church has bigger problems it should concentrate on , according to jarc .
" i think the church should concentrate more on finding ways to get more younger people interested in religion , " she said .
young people want to know the church is also taking them into consideration every day , not just when it 's organizing concerts along the rhine .
" i like the times when i can organize something like a mass or other meeting myself , " gall said .
" that and a great priest who helps us do what we want is what keeps me interested in the church 's youth group . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi will say mass for 800,000 on sunday in an interview with vatican radio , pope benedict xvi -lrb- photo -rrb- agreed that sparking interest in religion among youth is key to the world youth day 's success .
" if this zest , this joy , to know christ would come alive again and give the church in germany and europe a new dynamic , then i think the aim of world youth day would be achieved . "
according to jarc , the songs , prayers and chants of " hey , hey benito " heard along the pilgrims ' trail show that a spark has already been lit .
now it 's up to the church and the pilgrims to keep it from going out , she said .
" the world youth day is great , " she added .

" what we worry about is that it may happen that the virus infects a human , or even a pig , that has a circulating strain of normal influenza , and this normal human influenza will recombine with this avian form , " said thompson , " what will emerge is a strain that the human immune system has never seen before and moves easily from person to person , and that would ignite a pandemic .

" while we do believe that the virus is susceptible to a particular anti-viral , that anti-viral will be in limited supply , " he said .
" countries which are depending on medical approaches , vaccines and anti-virals will find that there are actually inadequate supplies to confront a pandemic .

computer games are big business in germany as the games convention in leipzig proves . for the next four days , avid computer fans can feast their insatiable appetites on a stunning array of state-of-the-art entertainment in an event which promises not to disappoint . thursday was the first day of the computer games convention , but even before the gates were thrown open , hundreds of eager fans had gathered outside in a bid to be among the first to size up the latest in computer game technology . bildunterschrift : visitors to the convention it calls itself " europe 's leading trade fair for interactive entertainment , infotainment and edutainment " , and with 280 exhibitors from 15 countries and some 110,000 visitors expected to show up , organisers could just be justified in blowing their event 's own trumpet . but just what is it that drives so many thousands of people into the loud lap of video entertainment when they could be outside creating their own in the sudden burst of summer sunshine ? fact is , there 's more to the event than row upon row of 21st century blow-your-mind , blow-up-the-world type games , which large slices of the general public still believe to be synonymous with computer-generated entertainment .
indeed , the organisers are promising something for everyone . family fair with an unprecedented 189 market premieres , including 52 from germany , 59 from europe and 98 from other parts of the world , it stands to be the most packed show in the trade fair 's short history , and although it will doubtless attract its fair share of die-hard gamers , there 's also a whole arm of the event dedicated to family entertainment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children and computers are no strange sight the convention 's family forum for media literacy , teaching and school software bills itself as a " special experience " for old and young . the convention has teamed up with leipzig university and media experts from academic to provide young computer users and their parents and teachers with invaluable information on how to overcome the choice paralysis brought on by the dazzling gamut of multimedia products available to even very young users . angela schierholz , who is a project director at the convention says manufacturers recognise the benefits of wooing their customers at the youngest possible age . " the growth in the number of exhibitors of over 50 percent compared to 2004 in this area , and the doubling of the surface area involved , show that the ability to handle new media competently is achieving increasing significance , " she said . the real thing but let there be no mistake that these four days of bright lights and simulated sound are not about being worthy , but about milking consumer enthusiasm . it 's a huge market , and big name games manufacturers are there in full force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the xbox factor microsoft is touting its new and improved xbox 360 which is to be launched on the european market for at tidy 299 euros -lrb- $ 346 -rrb- in time for st. nicholas to do the decent thing and spread it among all the little children . if they stick to their target , microsoft will be ahead of their main rivals sony and nintendo who are also planning to launch multi-tasking , super-sonic new consoles , but not until next year .
aficionados and addicts will just have to console themselves with some of the other thousands of products while they wait . the games convention runs from august 18th to august 21st and is open wednesday , thursday , friday and sunday from 9.00 to 18.00 , and on saturdays from 09.00 to 20.00 .

many of the young pilgrims in cologne this week have found new ways of living their religion , which sometimes involve ignoring official church doctrine . katja jarc knows fewer younger people are going to church .
the 18-year-old slovenian can see it every sunday when she single-handedly brings down parish 's average age .
" nearly everyone is at least 60 years old , " she said .
" it 's hard to find anyone my age there . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims wait to enter the cologne cathedral finding more young people interested in religion is one of the reasons jarc decided to attend the world youth day event in cologne .
she 's achieved that goal , since there are some 400,000 young faithful who have come to cologne for prayer , song , revivals and some good old-fashioned partying .
the catholic festival also sent her on the pilgrimage of sorts even after she arrived in this city on the rhine .
this second pilgrimage was shorter , however , than the long trip from slovenia .
this one started at the river 's edge and ended at cologne 's famous cathedral .
" here there are so many friendly people who are interested in church and prayer , " she said as groups passed by .
some people were waving national flags ; others whispered the rosary in a handful of different languages .
" i want to meet as many people like me as i can here in cologne . "
covering a distance of about two kilometers -lrb- 1.2 miles -rrb- , the pilgrimage is intended to represent the three wise men 's search for god .
world youth day organizers have recommended all visitors take the walk before visiting the shrine to the biblical kings inside the cathedral .
differing view of church 's teaching bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many young catholics have their own ideas about faith though the 400,000 pilgrims from some 120 different countries are united by a single faith at the catholic festival , the young people 's interpretation of their religion tends to differ , especially when it comes to personal issues like contraception and abortion .
" something is n't right when there are so many devout believers in africa and lots of them end up dying of aids , " said daniela gall , 18 , who lives near munich .
but the church should n't just sway with the mores of the day either , according to bryan brochu of alberta , canada .
" one of the strengths of the church is that it does n't change every time society wants it to , " said brochu , 21 , as speakers played recordings of the hail mary in german , english , french and italian .
" there are people who say the church is too old school , but i think it should stick to its values and traditions . "
admitting that he is not overly religious , tobias straub , 18 , came to the world youth day at the urging of his priest at home in bavaria who told him to look at the church 's teachings as a lighthouse .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pilgrimage continues outside the cathedral " there are times you really need some direction and other times you can go on your own , " he said as his group joined the parade snaking its way around the square outside the cathedral .
" people should decide for themselves . "
keeping youth interested catholicism should n't force all of its tenets on people who are looking for guidance since the church has bigger problems it should concentrate on , according to jarc .
" i think the church should concentrate more on finding ways to get more younger people interested in religion , " she said .
young people want to know the church is also taking them into consideration every day , not just when it 's organizing concerts along the rhine .
" i like the times when i can organize something like a mass or other meeting myself , " gall said .
" that and a great priest who helps us do what we want is what keeps me interested in the church 's youth group . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict xvi will say mass for 800,000 on sunday in an interview with vatican radio , pope benedict xvi -lrb- photo -rrb- agreed that sparking interest in religion among youth is key to the world youth day 's success .
" if this zest , this joy , to know christ would come alive again and give the church in germany and europe a new dynamic , then i think the aim of world youth day would be achieved . "
according to jarc , the songs , prayers and chants of " hey , hey benito " heard along the pilgrims ' trail show that a spark has already been lit .
now it 's up to the church and the pilgrims to keep it from going out , she said .
" the world youth day is great , " she added .

german workers are renowned in industrial world circles for the cushy conditions upon which they luxuriously lounge .
but just how do they get them ?
not , it seems , by downing their tools and screaming injustice . in a study of strike culture in developed countries published last week by the institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- , german workers emerged as some of the most reluctant strikers .
the report , which observed walk-out tendencies in the 30 members of the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , revealed that between 1991 and 2000 , german workers notched up a meager 9.3 annual strike days per 1,000 employees .
only austrian , japanese and swiss employees recorded even greater committment to work , while at the other end of the scale , the number climbed surely and steadily to its canadian peak of 189 annual strike days within the same time frame .

why is it that german workers , who are generally not afraid of grumbling about anything less than the best , rarely have to erect a picket line in order to get what they want ?
the answers , says jan jurczyk of the service industry trade union , verdi , are manifold .
“ in essence , it is not very easy to strike in germany .
we have a highly developed collective agreement system and strike action can only be taken in connection therewith , ” jurczyk said .
“ political strikes are not allowed and neither is industrial action organized by a small number of employees .
at least not legally . ”
heading the union call on the contrary , strikers can only become such if rallied to do so by their union , and even they have limited power to make that call .
the collective agreements , which cover things like pay , holiday , working hours and pensions , severely limit the opportunities for employees to walk out at all .
“ as long as the agreement is valid , which generally varies between one and two years , there can be no strikes .
and then after the contract between the union and employer has expired , there is still a grace period of several weeks in which there can also be no walk outs , ” jurczyk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no ballot , no strike and even when that period , known as a “ peace obligation ” is over , strike action must be endorsed by at least 75 percent of union members .
a further “ hurdle , ” says jurczyk , is the employers ’ right to enforce a lockout , in which the entire workforce , strikers and non-strikers alike , are barred from the premises .
strike action must be last resort the whole system is designed to discourage escalation of disputes at every turn , and to instead encourage communication between the voice of the employees , the unions , and the employers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.08.2005 eu air safety rules fall short großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu skies must become safer , officials say although the european union has stepped up safety rules for the air transport sector in recent years , the bloc is still dogged by a lack of coordination and sometimes patchy application of existing regulations . a recent string of crashes claiming the lives of eu citizens has refocused attention on measures to improve european air safety , including a possible blacklist of airlines . in the latest incident , a colombian airplane crashed in venezuela on tuesday , killing all 160 people on board , including 152 french passengers .
the disaster came only days after a cypriot airplane hit a hillside near athens , taking the lives of 121 passengers , most of whom were cypriots . earlier this month a tunisian-operated charter plane crash landed at sea off the sicilian coast killing 13 people , including 12 italians . in reaction to the crash in venezuela , eu transportation officials have called for tougher safety measures . " this accident … shows that we must collectively step up efforts to ensure the highest level of air transport security in europe and shelter all of the -lrb- european -rrb- union 's passengers and crew from such dramas , " said eu transport commissioner jacques barrot . beefing up checks in january 2004 , the crash in egypt of a boeing airliner operated by flash airlines , which killed 148 people , spurred the eu into action after years of negotiations and led to a beefing-up of safety checks on non-eu airplanes at airports in member states . the transport commissioner at the time , loyola de palacio , was quick to say that the flash airlines accident probably would never have happened had the rules been in place before the crash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent air disasters are spurring a new look at air safety in 1994 , the eu made it a requirement after air accidents that a technical probe be carried out by a body independent of the national civil aviation authorities . but like many eu rules , this one has not always been followed by all member states .
in july , the european commission scolded cyprus for not having adopted the regulation when it joined the bloc on may 1 of last year . expanding duties on tuesday , transport commissioner barrot called for more monitoring : " the european commission will strictly watch over the full application of existing measures and -lrb- those -rrb- under preparation to ensure ... the security of all european flights , including from third countries at departure or to destinations in member states . " the commissioner aims to extend in the coming months the responsibilities of the european aviation safety agency -lrb- easa -rrb- , which currently issues airworthiness certificates for aeronautical products , parts and equipment . in particular , barrot wants to see the easa play a greater role in monitoring flight safety and the security of non-eu airlines , and in certifying crew members . bildunterschrift : before the crash in venezuela keeping passengers in the loop plans for regulations on keeping passengers informed about flights are also in the works . ahead of a first reading of the regulations by the european parliament , eu members agreed in principle in april that passengers be informed as soon as possible and , in any case , before take-off of changes in the airline operating a flight . the new rules also propose improved information exchange about grounded airlines , although belgium , france , germany and spain want more coordination on the criteria used to designate such carriers . new legislation a 2004 regulation on the safety of airplanes from non-eu members , which members have until may 2006 to adopt into their national legislation , opens the way for an eu-wide flight ban if such a ban has been declared by a single member state . however , an extension of the regulation would have to be proposed by the european commission and backed by a qualified majority of member states , which tend to jealously hold on to their authority to authorize flights . the lack of eu-wide coordination sparked chaos in may when thousands of passengers were left stranded after a ban on turkish carrier onur air - by france , germany , the netherlands and switzerland - until their flights were finally rerouted via belgium . blacklist possible the european commission is considering publishing a blacklist of airlines and aircraft subject to bans or restrictions in eu member states on the internet , barrot said wednesday . the european union blacklist idea is similar to a mechanism already operational in the united states , where would-be passengers can consult a website publishing the names of airlines with relatively poor safety records . " we hope that with the information that will be communicated to the commission we will be able to publish a sort of blacklist , " barrot said , adding that the proposal could become reality by the end of the year if it is passed by the european parliament . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greece and cyprus in mourning after plane crash the bodies of 119 of the 121 people on board the cypriot airliner which crashed northeast of athens as well as the plane 's second flight recorder have been recovered , greek national television reported monday .

it 's might be hard to believe , but the great master of vorsprung durch technik , the german automobile industry , is no longer in pole position in the race to make modern cars more environmentally friendly . a study published on wednesday by germany 's automobile club , vcd , revealed that japan and france have their feet to the floor when it comes to environmental matters , and have left german car manufacturers spluttering in their wake . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the smart car is too small to do too much damage the vcd have been assessing anti-pollution merits of popular cars since 1989 , and the findings from their most recent review were the worst ever for germany , which only managed to squeeze one model , the opel corsa eco 1.0 into the top ten . and even that only made it into sixth place on the ranking table . it 's bad news for germany , which is currently still ruled in part by the green party , and which has long nurtured its reputation for being environmentally altruistic . bad boy volkswagen the vcd was particularly harsh in its criticism of the peoples ' favorite , volkswagen , for not installing a particle-filter to counter diesel soot in its best-selling model , the golf .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.08.2005 eu air safety rules fall short großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu skies must become safer , officials say although the european union has stepped up safety rules for the air transport sector in recent years , the bloc is still dogged by a lack of coordination and sometimes patchy application of existing regulations . a recent string of crashes claiming the lives of eu citizens has refocused attention on measures to improve european air safety , including a possible blacklist of airlines . in the latest incident , a colombian airplane crashed in venezuela on tuesday , killing all 160 people on board , including 152 french passengers .
the disaster came only days after a cypriot airplane hit a hillside near athens , taking the lives of 121 passengers , most of whom were cypriots . earlier this month a tunisian-operated charter plane crash landed at sea off the sicilian coast killing 13 people , including 12 italians . in reaction to the crash in venezuela , eu transportation officials have called for tougher safety measures . " this accident … shows that we must collectively step up efforts to ensure the highest level of air transport security in europe and shelter all of the -lrb- european -rrb- union 's passengers and crew from such dramas , " said eu transport commissioner jacques barrot . beefing up checks in january 2004 , the crash in egypt of a boeing airliner operated by flash airlines , which killed 148 people , spurred the eu into action after years of negotiations and led to a beefing-up of safety checks on non-eu airplanes at airports in member states . the transport commissioner at the time , loyola de palacio , was quick to say that the flash airlines accident probably would never have happened had the rules been in place before the crash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent air disasters are spurring a new look at air safety in 1994 , the eu made it a requirement after air accidents that a technical probe be carried out by a body independent of the national civil aviation authorities . but like many eu rules , this one has not always been followed by all member states .
in july , the european commission scolded cyprus for not having adopted the regulation when it joined the bloc on may 1 of last year . expanding duties on tuesday , transport commissioner barrot called for more monitoring : " the european commission will strictly watch over the full application of existing measures and -lrb- those -rrb- under preparation to ensure ... the security of all european flights , including from third countries at departure or to destinations in member states . " the commissioner aims to extend in the coming months the responsibilities of the european aviation safety agency -lrb- easa -rrb- , which currently issues airworthiness certificates for aeronautical products , parts and equipment . in particular , barrot wants to see the easa play a greater role in monitoring flight safety and the security of non-eu airlines , and in certifying crew members . bildunterschrift : before the crash in venezuela keeping passengers in the loop plans for regulations on keeping passengers informed about flights are also in the works . ahead of a first reading of the regulations by the european parliament , eu members agreed in principle in april that passengers be informed as soon as possible and , in any case , before take-off of changes in the airline operating a flight . the new rules also propose improved information exchange about grounded airlines , although belgium , france , germany and spain want more coordination on the criteria used to designate such carriers . new legislation a 2004 regulation on the safety of airplanes from non-eu members , which members have until may 2006 to adopt into their national legislation , opens the way for an eu-wide flight ban if such a ban has been declared by a single member state . however , an extension of the regulation would have to be proposed by the european commission and backed by a qualified majority of member states , which tend to jealously hold on to their authority to authorize flights . the lack of eu-wide coordination sparked chaos in may when thousands of passengers were left stranded after a ban on turkish carrier onur air - by france , germany , the netherlands and switzerland - until their flights were finally rerouted via belgium . blacklist possible the european commission is considering publishing a blacklist of airlines and aircraft subject to bans or restrictions in eu member states on the internet , barrot said wednesday . the european union blacklist idea is similar to a mechanism already operational in the united states , where would-be passengers can consult a website publishing the names of airlines with relatively poor safety records . " we hope that with the information that will be communicated to the commission we will be able to publish a sort of blacklist , " barrot said , adding that the proposal could become reality by the end of the year if it is passed by the european parliament . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greece and cyprus in mourning after plane crash the bodies of 119 of the 121 people on board the cypriot airliner which crashed northeast of athens as well as the plane 's second flight recorder have been recovered , greek national television reported monday .

german regulators are launching an investigation regarding possible insider dealings of daimlerchrysler 's shares .
the german-us company is already being probed on bribery charges in the us . suspecting possible insider trading and stock manipulation following the publicized resignation of daimlerchrysler 's chief executive jürgen schrempp on july 28 , the german federal agency for financial supervision -lrb- bafin -rrb- announced it was launching an official investigation . " we have launched a formal inquiry , " said the the bafin spokesperson sabine reimer on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schrempp 's resignation was announced on july 28 a formal inquiry means that financial institutions are required by law to disclose the names of all those involved in securities transactions .
purchasing or selling shares while privy to information which is not publicly available is considered illegal according to the german law . " we will find out from the credit institution who bought and who sold the shares , " said reimer . " then we 'll try to find cross-links to the people who knew about schrempp 's plans , " she said . the investigation is expected to take several weeks .
a spokesperson for daimlerchrysler , the world 's second largest producer of luxury vehicles , offered no comments . more than a coincidence ? after jürgen schrempp 's resignation was announced , daimlerchrysler shares rose dramatically - by nine percent in frankfurt and almost ten percent in new york .
the rise was the steepest intraday gain posted in the company 's history .
more than 61 million shares were traded on that day , 10 times the average volume . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schrempp 's successor , dieter zetsche schrempp , who was responsible for the $ 36 billion takeover of chrysler corp. in 1998 , had been severely criticized for eroding more than 30 percent of the company value since the merger .
he will succeeded by head of chrysler , dieter zetsche . jürgen grässlin , president of a minority shareholders group that owns 1.5 % of daimlerchrysler , said shortly after schrempp 's resignation that " insider trade has opened the floodgates . "
grässlin claims to have known of the forthcoming resignation twelve days before it was officially announced . " if we , the shareholders , had invested into daimlerchrysler at that point , we would 've made ourselves rich , " said grässlin . parallel investigations daimlerchrysler is currently pursuing legal action against grässlin for spreading false information .
grässlin has denied the charges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark clouds over daimlerchrysler yet several daimlerchrysler executives have indeed sold their shares since schrempp 's resignation was made public .
eckhard hordes , who heads the mercedes division , acquired 92,500 shares at 34.40 euros on july 29 , only to sell them at 39.58 euros on the same day . the german-us concern is currently under investigation by the us regulators and department of justice over alleged bribery of foreign officials .

" what we worry about is that it may happen that the virus infects a human , or even a pig , that has a circulating strain of normal influenza , and this normal human influenza will recombine with this avian form , " said thompson , " what will emerge is a strain that the human immune system has never seen before and moves easily from person to person , and that would ignite a pandemic .

" while we do believe that the virus is susceptible to a particular anti-viral , that anti-viral will be in limited supply , " he said .
" countries which are depending on medical approaches , vaccines and anti-virals will find that there are actually inadequate supplies to confront a pandemic .

computer games are big business in germany as the games convention in leipzig proves . for the next four days , avid computer fans can feast their insatiable appetites on a stunning array of state-of-the-art entertainment in an event which promises not to disappoint . thursday was the first day of the computer games convention , but even before the gates were thrown open , hundreds of eager fans had gathered outside in a bid to be among the first to size up the latest in computer game technology . bildunterschrift : visitors to the convention it calls itself " europe 's leading trade fair for interactive entertainment , infotainment and edutainment " , and with 280 exhibitors from 15 countries and some 110,000 visitors expected to show up , organisers could just be justified in blowing their event 's own trumpet . but just what is it that drives so many thousands of people into the loud lap of video entertainment when they could be outside creating their own in the sudden burst of summer sunshine ? fact is , there 's more to the event than row upon row of 21st century blow-your-mind , blow-up-the-world type games , which large slices of the general public still believe to be synonymous with computer-generated entertainment .
indeed , the organisers are promising something for everyone . family fair with an unprecedented 189 market premieres , including 52 from germany , 59 from europe and 98 from other parts of the world , it stands to be the most packed show in the trade fair 's short history , and although it will doubtless attract its fair share of die-hard gamers , there 's also a whole arm of the event dedicated to family entertainment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children and computers are no strange sight the convention 's family forum for media literacy , teaching and school software bills itself as a " special experience " for old and young . the convention has teamed up with leipzig university and media experts from academic to provide young computer users and their parents and teachers with invaluable information on how to overcome the choice paralysis brought on by the dazzling gamut of multimedia products available to even very young users . angela schierholz , who is a project director at the convention says manufacturers recognise the benefits of wooing their customers at the youngest possible age . " the growth in the number of exhibitors of over 50 percent compared to 2004 in this area , and the doubling of the surface area involved , show that the ability to handle new media competently is achieving increasing significance , " she said . the real thing but let there be no mistake that these four days of bright lights and simulated sound are not about being worthy , but about milking consumer enthusiasm . it 's a huge market , and big name games manufacturers are there in full force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the xbox factor microsoft is touting its new and improved xbox 360 which is to be launched on the european market for at tidy 299 euros -lrb- $ 346 -rrb- in time for st. nicholas to do the decent thing and spread it among all the little children . if they stick to their target , microsoft will be ahead of their main rivals sony and nintendo who are also planning to launch multi-tasking , super-sonic new consoles , but not until next year .

that could mean germany takes harsher measures against those deemed islamic militants . it 's the latest in a serious of no-nonsense actions from down south .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein announced thursday that he is expelling three more suspected islamic radicals .
this time , the three are members of a group called tablighi jamaat , which has about 450 members around germany and whose followers want to establish an islamic state , officials said .
german security officials have previously described the group as peaceful but said it could become infiltrated by radicals .
beckstein called them " missionaries " bent on spreading radical islam including the idea of " jihad , " or holy war , which encourages martyrdom through suicide attacks .
he added that bavaria would , with the expulsions , draw a clear and consistent line against " hate preachers " and suspected islamic militants .
" we want to make it clear to islamic extremists that the bavarian government wo n't tolerate anyone who wants to replace our free and democratic order with an islamic state , " he said in a statement .
the three , two bosnians and a moroccan , have until sept .

bavarians most aggressive since a new immigration law took effect in january , making it easier and faster to expel suspected islamic militants , bavaria has been quick to make the most of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber wants more action so far , the wealthy southern state has deported 16 people it suspected of militant activities , began proceedings on 26 more and moving on 10 more .
that is more than any of the other 15 german states so far , officials said .
it comes as little surprise .
a nationwide raid in january that led to the arrest of 22 suspected militants came after an investigation initiated by the bavarians .
soon after , beckstein said in a speech that more than 500 islamic extremists in germany " must be considered extremely dangerous " and that there are several thousand other fanatical muslims in the country .
his boss , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , has gone farther , saying that there are tens of thousands of radical muslims in germany , at least 4,000 of those he wants to deport for extremist activities .
increasing focus germany was forced to increase its efforts to clamp down on islamic radicals after it was discovered that the september 11 hijackers planned their attacks while living as students in hamburg .
last year , schilly said that the fight against islamic militants was a top priority .
as a result , the government established an anti-terror command headquarters in berlin .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan , the caliph of cologne , was extradited after a long process since then , the most recent extradition of an islamic militant was of metin kaplan to turkey for disseminating fundamentalist propaganda during his sermons .

deporting people is especially tricky for germany in light of its nazi legacy .
at the same time , germans worry about harboring extremists and populist sentiments by politicians such as stoiber against muslim immigrants suspected of radicalism appeal to many .
security experts applaud the stepped up efforts by the government to address extremism but still complain that too little has been done .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.08.2005 eu air safety rules fall short großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu skies must become safer , officials say although the european union has stepped up safety rules for the air transport sector in recent years , the bloc is still dogged by a lack of coordination and sometimes patchy application of existing regulations . a recent string of crashes claiming the lives of eu citizens has refocused attention on measures to improve european air safety , including a possible blacklist of airlines . in the latest incident , a colombian airplane crashed in venezuela on tuesday , killing all 160 people on board , including 152 french passengers .
the disaster came only days after a cypriot airplane hit a hillside near athens , taking the lives of 121 passengers , most of whom were cypriots . earlier this month a tunisian-operated charter plane crash landed at sea off the sicilian coast killing 13 people , including 12 italians . in reaction to the crash in venezuela , eu transportation officials have called for tougher safety measures . " this accident … shows that we must collectively step up efforts to ensure the highest level of air transport security in europe and shelter all of the -lrb- european -rrb- union 's passengers and crew from such dramas , " said eu transport commissioner jacques barrot . beefing up checks in january 2004 , the crash in egypt of a boeing airliner operated by flash airlines , which killed 148 people , spurred the eu into action after years of negotiations and led to a beefing-up of safety checks on non-eu airplanes at airports in member states . the transport commissioner at the time , loyola de palacio , was quick to say that the flash airlines accident probably would never have happened had the rules been in place before the crash . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : recent air disasters are spurring a new look at air safety in 1994 , the eu made it a requirement after air accidents that a technical probe be carried out by a body independent of the national civil aviation authorities . but like many eu rules , this one has not always been followed by all member states .
in july , the european commission scolded cyprus for not having adopted the regulation when it joined the bloc on may 1 of last year . expanding duties on tuesday , transport commissioner barrot called for more monitoring : " the european commission will strictly watch over the full application of existing measures and -lrb- those -rrb- under preparation to ensure ... the security of all european flights , including from third countries at departure or to destinations in member states . " the commissioner aims to extend in the coming months the responsibilities of the european aviation safety agency -lrb- easa -rrb- , which currently issues airworthiness certificates for aeronautical products , parts and equipment . in particular , barrot wants to see the easa play a greater role in monitoring flight safety and the security of non-eu airlines , and in certifying crew members . bildunterschrift : before the crash in venezuela keeping passengers in the loop plans for regulations on keeping passengers informed about flights are also in the works . ahead of a first reading of the regulations by the european parliament , eu members agreed in principle in april that passengers be informed as soon as possible and , in any case , before take-off of changes in the airline operating a flight . the new rules also propose improved information exchange about grounded airlines , although belgium , france , germany and spain want more coordination on the criteria used to designate such carriers . new legislation a 2004 regulation on the safety of airplanes from non-eu members , which members have until may 2006 to adopt into their national legislation , opens the way for an eu-wide flight ban if such a ban has been declared by a single member state . however , an extension of the regulation would have to be proposed by the european commission and backed by a qualified majority of member states , which tend to jealously hold on to their authority to authorize flights . the lack of eu-wide coordination sparked chaos in may when thousands of passengers were left stranded after a ban on turkish carrier onur air - by france , germany , the netherlands and switzerland - until their flights were finally rerouted via belgium . blacklist possible the european commission is considering publishing a blacklist of airlines and aircraft subject to bans or restrictions in eu member states on the internet , barrot said wednesday . the european union blacklist idea is similar to a mechanism already operational in the united states , where would-be passengers can consult a website publishing the names of airlines with relatively poor safety records . " we hope that with the information that will be communicated to the commission we will be able to publish a sort of blacklist , " barrot said , adding that the proposal could become reality by the end of the year if it is passed by the european parliament . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greece and cyprus in mourning after plane crash the bodies of 119 of the 121 people on board the cypriot airliner which crashed northeast of athens as well as the plane 's second flight recorder have been recovered , greek national television reported monday .

many allege that coping with prejudice is a part of their lives , but they also admit that embracing german society does n't come easily to them . ask a random selection of young arabs what brought their families to germany and you 'll get a broad range of replies .
along with political or religious persecution , one of the most common reasons for pulling up roots is a desire to improve their economic situations , with many migrants heading west so they can better provide for their families .
many hope their children will grow up to enjoy opportunities they themselves never had . " you do n't have to pay much to study here , " pointed out one arab student .
but while getting a german education is an obvious advantage , it 's often easier said than done .
integrating with german peers and adjusting to the european mentality can be difficult .
even building up a social life can be tricky . " not all germans are reserved , " conceded one young moroccan .
" some of the people here are quite open , but on the whole , i find most germans very stand-offish . " ignorance others agree that coming to terms with the german way of life is fraught with obstacles .
potential pitfalls range from the practical to the psychological . " i 've never integrated properly here , " admitted one egyptian .
" primarily , the problem is that i never really learnt german properly back home in egypt , but i 've also never really made any friends here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but it 's by no means all their fault .
many arabs complain that germans are unaware of diversity within the arab world and fail to distinguish between different nationalities and cultures .
as far as the average german is concerned , they say , there 's not a whole lot of difference between a moroccan and a saudi arabian . hostility if ignorance were n't bad enough , hostility is another daily challenge for germany 's muslim community .
in the wake of the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states and the more recent events in madrid and london , the western world has made islamic fundamentalism its number one enemy - and across europe , many muslims say they are now treated with widespread suspicion and hostility . even so , others are quick to point out that getting to grips with a country like germany has a lot to do with one 's own attitudes .
many find that being receptive to new ideas and finding the resolve to chart unknown social and cultural ground will make life much easier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm in a non-muslim european country , " stressed one young palestinian .
" that means i 'm speaking a different language , living in a different society and adapting to a new country .
but that does n't mean i have to cocoon myself away .
from day one , i 've always made sure i went out a lot .
and today i feel well integrated . " he also stresses that assimilating does n't have to mean relinquishing one 's one identity .
" i 'm still very tied to my own culture and my palestinian roots , " he pointed out . being able to adapt to new societies is probably not so different from being able to learn new languages - very easy for the young , more difficult as one gets older . samar hienen , hebtallah ismail , eyad hamideh -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de developing a euro-arab literature ahdaf soueif is an egyptian writer who made it big in great britain .

computer games are big business in germany as the games convention in leipzig proves . for the next four days , avid computer fans can feast their insatiable appetites on a stunning array of state-of-the-art entertainment in an event which promises not to disappoint . thursday was the first day of the computer games convention , but even before the gates were thrown open , hundreds of eager fans had gathered outside in a bid to be among the first to size up the latest in computer game technology . bildunterschrift : visitors to the convention it calls itself " europe 's leading trade fair for interactive entertainment , infotainment and edutainment " , and with 280 exhibitors from 15 countries and some 110,000 visitors expected to show up , organisers could just be justified in blowing their event 's own trumpet . but just what is it that drives so many thousands of people into the loud lap of video entertainment when they could be outside creating their own in the sudden burst of summer sunshine ? fact is , there 's more to the event than row upon row of 21st century blow-your-mind , blow-up-the-world type games , which large slices of the general public still believe to be synonymous with computer-generated entertainment .
indeed , the organisers are promising something for everyone . family fair with an unprecedented 189 market premieres , including 52 from germany , 59 from europe and 98 from other parts of the world , it stands to be the most packed show in the trade fair 's short history , and although it will doubtless attract its fair share of die-hard gamers , there 's also a whole arm of the event dedicated to family entertainment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children and computers are no strange sight the convention 's family forum for media literacy , teaching and school software bills itself as a " special experience " for old and young . the convention has teamed up with leipzig university and media experts from academic to provide young computer users and their parents and teachers with invaluable information on how to overcome the choice paralysis brought on by the dazzling gamut of multimedia products available to even very young users . angela schierholz , who is a project director at the convention says manufacturers recognise the benefits of wooing their customers at the youngest possible age . " the growth in the number of exhibitors of over 50 percent compared to 2004 in this area , and the doubling of the surface area involved , show that the ability to handle new media competently is achieving increasing significance , " she said . the real thing but let there be no mistake that these four days of bright lights and simulated sound are not about being worthy , but about milking consumer enthusiasm . it 's a huge market , and big name games manufacturers are there in full force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the xbox factor microsoft is touting its new and improved xbox 360 which is to be launched on the european market for at tidy 299 euros -lrb- $ 346 -rrb- in time for st. nicholas to do the decent thing and spread it among all the little children . if they stick to their target , microsoft will be ahead of their main rivals sony and nintendo who are also planning to launch multi-tasking , super-sonic new consoles , but not until next year .

computer games are big business in germany as the games convention in leipzig proves . for the next four days , avid computer fans can feast their insatiable appetites on a stunning array of state-of-the-art entertainment in an event which promises not to disappoint . thursday was the first day of the computer games convention , but even before the gates were thrown open , hundreds of eager fans had gathered outside in a bid to be among the first to size up the latest in computer game technology . bildunterschrift : visitors to the convention it calls itself " europe 's leading trade fair for interactive entertainment , infotainment and edutainment " , and with 280 exhibitors from 15 countries and some 110,000 visitors expected to show up , organisers could just be justified in blowing their event 's own trumpet . but just what is it that drives so many thousands of people into the loud lap of video entertainment when they could be outside creating their own in the sudden burst of summer sunshine ? fact is , there 's more to the event than row upon row of 21st century blow-your-mind , blow-up-the-world type games , which large slices of the general public still believe to be synonymous with computer-generated entertainment .
indeed , the organisers are promising something for everyone . family fair with an unprecedented 189 market premieres , including 52 from germany , 59 from europe and 98 from other parts of the world , it stands to be the most packed show in the trade fair 's short history , and although it will doubtless attract its fair share of die-hard gamers , there 's also a whole arm of the event dedicated to family entertainment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children and computers are no strange sight the convention 's family forum for media literacy , teaching and school software bills itself as a " special experience " for old and young . the convention has teamed up with leipzig university and media experts from academic to provide young computer users and their parents and teachers with invaluable information on how to overcome the choice paralysis brought on by the dazzling gamut of multimedia products available to even very young users . angela schierholz , who is a project director at the convention says manufacturers recognise the benefits of wooing their customers at the youngest possible age . " the growth in the number of exhibitors of over 50 percent compared to 2004 in this area , and the doubling of the surface area involved , show that the ability to handle new media competently is achieving increasing significance , " she said . the real thing but let there be no mistake that these four days of bright lights and simulated sound are not about being worthy , but about milking consumer enthusiasm . it 's a huge market , and big name games manufacturers are there in full force . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the xbox factor microsoft is touting its new and improved xbox 360 which is to be launched on the european market for at tidy 299 euros -lrb- $ 346 -rrb- in time for st. nicholas to do the decent thing and spread it among all the little children . if they stick to their target , microsoft will be ahead of their main rivals sony and nintendo who are also planning to launch multi-tasking , super-sonic new consoles , but not until next year .
aficionados and addicts will just have to console themselves with some of the other thousands of products while they wait . the games convention runs from august 18th to august 21st and is open wednesday , thursday , friday and sunday from 9.00 to 18.00 , and on saturdays from 09.00 to 20.00 .

" what we worry about is that it may happen that the virus infects a human , or even a pig , that has a circulating strain of normal influenza , and this normal human influenza will recombine with this avian form , " said thompson , " what will emerge is a strain that the human immune system has never seen before and moves easily from person to person , and that would ignite a pandemic .

angela merkel has announced she wants to appoint radical tax reform advocate paul kirchhof as finance minister if her party wins on sept .
18 .
it could radically remake german fiscal policy , conservative supporters say . when cdu leader and chancellor candidate angela merkel picked paul kirchhof , a heidelberg university professor and former constitutional court judge , as her top finance adviser wednesday , she signaled that she was ready to move towards radical reform .
" if it is up to me and the coalition talks allow it , he will become finance minister , " merkel said during a campaign stop .
kirchhof , 62 , is best known for a tax reform proposal he presented in 2003 which calls for a flat 25 percent tax for corporations and individuals .
but many financial experts and politicians criticize the choice because kirchhof , they say , is a political novice and lacks the cdu party connections to run the finance ministry effectively .
merkel 's plans could be derailed if bavarian premier edmund stoiber or a member of the free democrats , the likely coalition partner , lay claim to the portfolio .
the post is considered critical because of germany 's fight to cut its debt and lower its deficit .
must set good example kirchhof told the mass-circulation newspaper bild that if elected , the conservatives would bring the german budget deficit below the european union 's limit of three percent of gdp in the " near future . "
he also said that germany must again set a good financial example for europe .

grässlin claims to have known of the forthcoming resignation twelve days before it was officially announced . " if we , the shareholders , had invested into daimlerchrysler at that point , we would 've made ourselves rich , " said grässlin . parallel investigations daimlerchrysler is currently pursuing legal action against grässlin for spreading false information .
grässlin has denied the charges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark clouds over daimlerchrysler yet several daimlerchrysler executives have indeed sold their shares since schrempp 's resignation was made public .

that could mean germany takes harsher measures against those deemed islamic militants . it 's the latest in a serious of no-nonsense actions from down south .
bavarian interior minister günther beckstein announced thursday that he is expelling three more suspected islamic radicals .
this time , the three are members of a group called tablighi jamaat , which has about 450 members around germany and whose followers want to establish an islamic state , officials said .
german security officials have previously described the group as peaceful but said it could become infiltrated by radicals .
beckstein called them " missionaries " bent on spreading radical islam including the idea of " jihad , " or holy war , which encourages martyrdom through suicide attacks .
he added that bavaria would , with the expulsions , draw a clear and consistent line against " hate preachers " and suspected islamic militants .
" we want to make it clear to islamic extremists that the bavarian government wo n't tolerate anyone who wants to replace our free and democratic order with an islamic state , " he said in a statement .
the three , two bosnians and a moroccan , have until sept .
10 to leave or face deportation .
bavarians most aggressive since a new immigration law took effect in january , making it easier and faster to expel suspected islamic militants , bavaria has been quick to make the most of it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber wants more action so far , the wealthy southern state has deported 16 people it suspected of militant activities , began proceedings on 26 more and moving on 10 more .
that is more than any of the other 15 german states so far , officials said .
it comes as little surprise .
a nationwide raid in january that led to the arrest of 22 suspected militants came after an investigation initiated by the bavarians .
soon after , beckstein said in a speech that more than 500 islamic extremists in germany " must be considered extremely dangerous " and that there are several thousand other fanatical muslims in the country .
his boss , bavarian premier edmund stoiber , has gone farther , saying that there are tens of thousands of radical muslims in germany , at least 4,000 of those he wants to deport for extremist activities .
increasing focus germany was forced to increase its efforts to clamp down on islamic radicals after it was discovered that the september 11 hijackers planned their attacks while living as students in hamburg .
last year , schilly said that the fight against islamic militants was a top priority .
as a result , the government established an anti-terror command headquarters in berlin .
on jan .
1 , the new immigration law which eases immigration for skilled workers also requires a detailed background check on every immigrant and eases the deportation of those designated " islamic hate preachers . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : metin kaplan , the caliph of cologne , was extradited after a long process since then , the most recent extradition of an islamic militant was of metin kaplan to turkey for disseminating fundamentalist propaganda during his sermons .
kaplan had lived for decades in cologne .
deporting people is especially tricky for germany in light of its nazi legacy .
at the same time , germans worry about harboring extremists and populist sentiments by politicians such as stoiber against muslim immigrants suspected of radicalism appeal to many .
security experts applaud the stepped up efforts by the government to address extremism but still complain that too little has been done .
that will probably change with a new government - merkel has selected beckstein to replace schilly if she wins the election and his fervor for deporting suspected radicals could soon be felt on the federal level . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's arabs struggle to fit in germany is home to an estimated 280,000 people of arab extraction .

many allege that coping with prejudice is a part of their lives , but they also admit that embracing german society does n't come easily to them . ask a random selection of young arabs what brought their families to germany and you 'll get a broad range of replies .
along with political or religious persecution , one of the most common reasons for pulling up roots is a desire to improve their economic situations , with many migrants heading west so they can better provide for their families .
many hope their children will grow up to enjoy opportunities they themselves never had . " you do n't have to pay much to study here , " pointed out one arab student .
but while getting a german education is an obvious advantage , it 's often easier said than done .
integrating with german peers and adjusting to the european mentality can be difficult .
even building up a social life can be tricky . " not all germans are reserved , " conceded one young moroccan .
" some of the people here are quite open , but on the whole , i find most germans very stand-offish . " ignorance others agree that coming to terms with the german way of life is fraught with obstacles .
potential pitfalls range from the practical to the psychological . " i 've never integrated properly here , " admitted one egyptian .
" primarily , the problem is that i never really learnt german properly back home in egypt , but i 've also never really made any friends here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but it 's by no means all their fault .
many arabs complain that germans are unaware of diversity within the arab world and fail to distinguish between different nationalities and cultures .
as far as the average german is concerned , they say , there 's not a whole lot of difference between a moroccan and a saudi arabian . hostility if ignorance were n't bad enough , hostility is another daily challenge for germany 's muslim community .
in the wake of the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states and the more recent events in madrid and london , the western world has made islamic fundamentalism its number one enemy - and across europe , many muslims say they are now treated with widespread suspicion and hostility . even so , others are quick to point out that getting to grips with a country like germany has a lot to do with one 's own attitudes .
many find that being receptive to new ideas and finding the resolve to chart unknown social and cultural ground will make life much easier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm in a non-muslim european country , " stressed one young palestinian .
" that means i 'm speaking a different language , living in a different society and adapting to a new country .
but that does n't mean i have to cocoon myself away .
from day one , i 've always made sure i went out a lot .
and today i feel well integrated . " he also stresses that assimilating does n't have to mean relinquishing one 's one identity .
" i 'm still very tied to my own culture and my palestinian roots , " he pointed out . being able to adapt to new societies is probably not so different from being able to learn new languages - very easy for the young , more difficult as one gets older . samar hienen , hebtallah ismail , eyad hamideh -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de developing a euro-arab literature ahdaf soueif is an egyptian writer who made it big in great britain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.08.2005 germany , nation of reluctant strikers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " strike " , it says , but that 's easier said than done in germany .
german workers are renowned in industrial world circles for the cushy conditions upon which they luxuriously lounge .
but just how do they get them ?
not , it seems , by downing their tools and screaming injustice . in a study of strike culture in developed countries published last week by the institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- , german workers emerged as some of the most reluctant strikers .
the report , which observed walk-out tendencies in the 30 members of the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , revealed that between 1991 and 2000 , german workers notched up a meager 9.3 annual strike days per 1,000 employees .
only austrian , japanese and swiss employees recorded even greater committment to work , while at the other end of the scale , the number climbed surely and steadily to its canadian peak of 189 annual strike days within the same time frame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picket lines are a relative rarity in germany the discrepancy leaves room for considerable questions .
why is it that german workers , who are generally not afraid of grumbling about anything less than the best , rarely have to erect a picket line in order to get what they want ?
the answers , says jan jurczyk of the service industry trade union , verdi , are manifold .
“ in essence , it is not very easy to strike in germany .
we have a highly developed collective agreement system and strike action can only be taken in connection therewith , ” jurczyk said .
“ political strikes are not allowed and neither is industrial action organized by a small number of employees .
at least not legally . ”
heading the union call on the contrary , strikers can only become such if rallied to do so by their union , and even they have limited power to make that call .
the collective agreements , which cover things like pay , holiday , working hours and pensions , severely limit the opportunities for employees to walk out at all .
“ as long as the agreement is valid , which generally varies between one and two years , there can be no strikes .
and then after the contract between the union and employer has expired , there is still a grace period of several weeks in which there can also be no walk outs , ” jurczyk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no ballot , no strike and even when that period , known as a “ peace obligation ” is over , strike action must be endorsed by at least 75 percent of union members .
a further “ hurdle , ” says jurczyk , is the employers ’ right to enforce a lockout , in which the entire workforce , strikers and non-strikers alike , are barred from the premises .
strike action must be last resort the whole system is designed to discourage escalation of disputes at every turn , and to instead encourage communication between the voice of the employees , the unions , and the employers .
and it is well oiled .
dr. heiner dribbusch works for the institute for economic and social research -lrb- wsi -rrb- in the hans böckler foundation , which is a research institute related to the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- . he says that although when push comes to shove , german workers are willing to exercise their , albeit limited , right to strike , they use it sparingly .
and the same , he says , is true of the unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union-backed demonstrations precede industrial action “ unions are doubtless interested in having as few restrictions as possible , so they can be the ones who make the decisions , ” dribbusch said .
“ but that said , they don ’ t use every opportunity they have to strike , which suggests that they don ’ t want to . ”
and one good reason for that is the generous replacement wages which unions have to pay to their striking members .
“ unions are cautious when it comes to calling for industrial action , not least because of the expense of having to fork out strike money , ” jurczyk said .
“ employees get paid more or less the same by the unions as they receive in their basic pay packet , and in a large workforce , that can add up to huge amounts of money . ”
too good to remain true ?
like so many german systems , the strike prevention one is precisely structured and designed to be of some benefit to everyone concerned .
and for those who do enjoy a right to strike , which public servants in germany incidentally do not , it is a system which has , over the past half decade , proved its worth .
“ take the chemical industry , for example , it has only witnessed one strike since the end of the war .
many employees in germany will go through their working life never having experienced any industrial action , ” dribbusch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taste of things to come ?
but there are signs that things are changing .
in the current economic climate , the demand for employment far outstrips the supply , and jurczyk says that is affecting the way in which collective agreements are negotiated .
“ employers ’ associations have begun to react to employees ’ demands in a more aggressive way , and to respond to them with counter demands .
they 're using the levels of unemployment as a threat to the existing workforce , ” he said .
“ whether such behavior will lead to more strikes , we don ’ t know .
it hasn ’ t been decided yet . ” tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .

german regulators are launching an investigation regarding possible insider dealings of daimlerchrysler 's shares .
the german-us company is already being probed on bribery charges in the us . suspecting possible insider trading and stock manipulation following the publicized resignation of daimlerchrysler 's chief executive jürgen schrempp on july 28 , the german federal agency for financial supervision -lrb- bafin -rrb- announced it was launching an official investigation . " we have launched a formal inquiry , " said the the bafin spokesperson sabine reimer on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schrempp 's resignation was announced on july 28 a formal inquiry means that financial institutions are required by law to disclose the names of all those involved in securities transactions .
purchasing or selling shares while privy to information which is not publicly available is considered illegal according to the german law . " we will find out from the credit institution who bought and who sold the shares , " said reimer . " then we 'll try to find cross-links to the people who knew about schrempp 's plans , " she said . the investigation is expected to take several weeks .
a spokesperson for daimlerchrysler , the world 's second largest producer of luxury vehicles , offered no comments . more than a coincidence ? after jürgen schrempp 's resignation was announced , daimlerchrysler shares rose dramatically - by nine percent in frankfurt and almost ten percent in new york .
the rise was the steepest intraday gain posted in the company 's history .
more than 61 million shares were traded on that day , 10 times the average volume . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schrempp 's successor , dieter zetsche schrempp , who was responsible for the $ 36 billion takeover of chrysler corp. in 1998 , had been severely criticized for eroding more than 30 percent of the company value since the merger .
he will succeeded by head of chrysler , dieter zetsche . jürgen grässlin , president of a minority shareholders group that owns 1.5 % of daimlerchrysler , said shortly after schrempp 's resignation that " insider trade has opened the floodgates . "
grässlin claims to have known of the forthcoming resignation twelve days before it was officially announced . " if we , the shareholders , had invested into daimlerchrysler at that point , we would 've made ourselves rich , " said grässlin . parallel investigations daimlerchrysler is currently pursuing legal action against grässlin for spreading false information .
grässlin has denied the charges . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dark clouds over daimlerchrysler yet several daimlerchrysler executives have indeed sold their shares since schrempp 's resignation was made public .
eckhard hordes , who heads the mercedes division , acquired 92,500 shares at 34.40 euros on july 29 , only to sell them at 39.58 euros on the same day . the german-us concern is currently under investigation by the us regulators and department of justice over alleged bribery of foreign officials .

many allege that coping with prejudice is a part of their lives , but they also admit that embracing german society does n't come easily to them . ask a random selection of young arabs what brought their families to germany and you 'll get a broad range of replies .
along with political or religious persecution , one of the most common reasons for pulling up roots is a desire to improve their economic situations , with many migrants heading west so they can better provide for their families .
many hope their children will grow up to enjoy opportunities they themselves never had . " you do n't have to pay much to study here , " pointed out one arab student .
but while getting a german education is an obvious advantage , it 's often easier said than done .
integrating with german peers and adjusting to the european mentality can be difficult .
even building up a social life can be tricky . " not all germans are reserved , " conceded one young moroccan .
" some of the people here are quite open , but on the whole , i find most germans very stand-offish . " ignorance others agree that coming to terms with the german way of life is fraught with obstacles .
potential pitfalls range from the practical to the psychological . " i 've never integrated properly here , " admitted one egyptian .
" primarily , the problem is that i never really learnt german properly back home in egypt , but i 've also never really made any friends here . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but it 's by no means all their fault .
many arabs complain that germans are unaware of diversity within the arab world and fail to distinguish between different nationalities and cultures .
as far as the average german is concerned , they say , there 's not a whole lot of difference between a moroccan and a saudi arabian . hostility if ignorance were n't bad enough , hostility is another daily challenge for germany 's muslim community .
in the wake of the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states and the more recent events in madrid and london , the western world has made islamic fundamentalism its number one enemy - and across europe , many muslims say they are now treated with widespread suspicion and hostility . even so , others are quick to point out that getting to grips with a country like germany has a lot to do with one 's own attitudes .
many find that being receptive to new ideas and finding the resolve to chart unknown social and cultural ground will make life much easier . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i 'm in a non-muslim european country , " stressed one young palestinian .
" that means i 'm speaking a different language , living in a different society and adapting to a new country .
but that does n't mean i have to cocoon myself away .
from day one , i 've always made sure i went out a lot .
and today i feel well integrated . " he also stresses that assimilating does n't have to mean relinquishing one 's one identity .
" i 'm still very tied to my own culture and my palestinian roots , " he pointed out . being able to adapt to new societies is probably not so different from being able to learn new languages - very easy for the young , more difficult as one gets older . samar hienen , hebtallah ismail , eyad hamideh -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de developing a euro-arab literature ahdaf soueif is an egyptian writer who made it big in great britain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 18.08.2005 germany , nation of reluctant strikers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " strike " , it says , but that 's easier said than done in germany .
german workers are renowned in industrial world circles for the cushy conditions upon which they luxuriously lounge .
but just how do they get them ?
not , it seems , by downing their tools and screaming injustice . in a study of strike culture in developed countries published last week by the institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- , german workers emerged as some of the most reluctant strikers .
the report , which observed walk-out tendencies in the 30 members of the organization of economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , revealed that between 1991 and 2000 , german workers notched up a meager 9.3 annual strike days per 1,000 employees .
only austrian , japanese and swiss employees recorded even greater committment to work , while at the other end of the scale , the number climbed surely and steadily to its canadian peak of 189 annual strike days within the same time frame .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : picket lines are a relative rarity in germany the discrepancy leaves room for considerable questions .
why is it that german workers , who are generally not afraid of grumbling about anything less than the best , rarely have to erect a picket line in order to get what they want ?
the answers , says jan jurczyk of the service industry trade union , verdi , are manifold .
“ in essence , it is not very easy to strike in germany .
we have a highly developed collective agreement system and strike action can only be taken in connection therewith , ” jurczyk said .
“ political strikes are not allowed and neither is industrial action organized by a small number of employees .
at least not legally . ”
heading the union call on the contrary , strikers can only become such if rallied to do so by their union , and even they have limited power to make that call .
the collective agreements , which cover things like pay , holiday , working hours and pensions , severely limit the opportunities for employees to walk out at all .
“ as long as the agreement is valid , which generally varies between one and two years , there can be no strikes .
and then after the contract between the union and employer has expired , there is still a grace period of several weeks in which there can also be no walk outs , ” jurczyk said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no ballot , no strike and even when that period , known as a “ peace obligation ” is over , strike action must be endorsed by at least 75 percent of union members .
a further “ hurdle , ” says jurczyk , is the employers ’ right to enforce a lockout , in which the entire workforce , strikers and non-strikers alike , are barred from the premises .
strike action must be last resort the whole system is designed to discourage escalation of disputes at every turn , and to instead encourage communication between the voice of the employees , the unions , and the employers .
and it is well oiled .
dr. heiner dribbusch works for the institute for economic and social research -lrb- wsi -rrb- in the hans böckler foundation , which is a research institute related to the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- . he says that although when push comes to shove , german workers are willing to exercise their , albeit limited , right to strike , they use it sparingly .
and the same , he says , is true of the unions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : union-backed demonstrations precede industrial action “ unions are doubtless interested in having as few restrictions as possible , so they can be the ones who make the decisions , ” dribbusch said .
“ but that said , they don ’ t use every opportunity they have to strike , which suggests that they don ’ t want to . ”
and one good reason for that is the generous replacement wages which unions have to pay to their striking members .
“ unions are cautious when it comes to calling for industrial action , not least because of the expense of having to fork out strike money , ” jurczyk said .
“ employees get paid more or less the same by the unions as they receive in their basic pay packet , and in a large workforce , that can add up to huge amounts of money . ”
too good to remain true ?
like so many german systems , the strike prevention one is precisely structured and designed to be of some benefit to everyone concerned .
and for those who do enjoy a right to strike , which public servants in germany incidentally do not , it is a system which has , over the past half decade , proved its worth .
“ take the chemical industry , for example , it has only witnessed one strike since the end of the war .
many employees in germany will go through their working life never having experienced any industrial action , ” dribbusch said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a taste of things to come ?
but there are signs that things are changing .
in the current economic climate , the demand for employment far outstrips the supply , and jurczyk says that is affecting the way in which collective agreements are negotiated .
“ employers ’ associations have begun to react to employees ’ demands in a more aggressive way , and to respond to them with counter demands .
they 're using the levels of unemployment as a threat to the existing workforce , ” he said .
“ whether such behavior will lead to more strikes , we don ’ t know .
it hasn ’ t been decided yet . ” tamsin walker , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de debate flares up over minimum wages with the eu 's eastward expansion and subsequent downward pressure on wages in germany , opposition conservatives have stoked debate over the introduction of minimum wages , saying they 're ready to support such a move .
-lrb- april 9 , 2005 -rrb- social justice or economic folly ?
the new hard-left grouping in germany , the left party , is sending tremors across the political landscape .

" it is a back-up , if someone can be there within a few minutes , the chances of surviving a heart attack are greatly increased , which can save lives , especially in rural communities .
" the machines are foolproof , you ca n't give a shock with the pads unless it is required . "
as for beach lifeguards of the type glamorised in baywatch , mr archibald said it would be great to see the cover they provide extended to as many beaches as possible .
" there are a few coastal ones on beaches , but not as many as we would like , " he said .
" most of the beach lifeguard units operating around the scottish coast do it on a voluntary basis .
" we would like to see them on every beach . "
and , he emphasised , the more people with the skills , the more chance a passer-by or relative may be able to act to save lives .

alison smith reports on efforts to make the process more bearable .
many call centre staff understand the caller 's anxiety many of the 40 students manning kingston university 's clearing hotline have felt the trauma and disappointment of going through clearing .
jayesh dudhia managed to secure a place to read biochemistry at kingston after falling short of the grades he needed for his first choice university , king 's college london .
" i felt like a leftover having to go through the clearing system and was disappointed with my grades , " he said .
now happy on his course , he will be speaking to anxious callers to the clearing hotline this year .
he said he wanted to " give something back " to the university and help other students who may feel they are in a hopeless position .
" but i 'm not here to try to help people decide if a particular course is right for them .
i can only tell them if they meet the requirements .
" i think universities should be careful who they offer places to , and i know that kingston is , " he said .
" but i have friends elsewhere who are studying with people who have far lower grades than they obtained , and it makes them question the value of their course .
" but clearing is a good system - it means you do n't have to wait a year because you did n't get the grades . "
' i was in shock ' the caller 's grades are first compared to a database of course vacancies .
jayesh says callers to clearing have to be decisive if an applicant meets the requirements of a particular course and wishes to apply , a relevant member of the academic staff will speak to them to check their suitability .
but staff are also trained to deal with " worst case scenarios " , such as aggressive students or timewasters .
stephanie mcaulay , 23 , said she was so daunted by the prospect of going through clearing that she asked her husband to ring kingston for her .
after leaving school at 16 she later studied for two a-levels in one year while working full-time .
but despite predictions of two as she achieved only d and e grades .
" i was in shock - i thought i had my life planned out .
it was traumatic , " she said .
but she said the tutor she spoke to was encouraging and sympathetic to her situation .
her six years ' work experience was taken into account by kingston 's department of history , which offered her a place .
the complete list of degree course vacancies available through clearing are listed on the universities , colleges and admissions service -lrb- ucas -rrb- website .
you are eligible for clearing if : you are not holding any offers from universities or colleges your offers were not confirmed when your exam results were announced you have declined , or not responded to , a changed course , a changed date of entry or a changed point of entry offer you have applied too late for your application to be considered before clearing source : ucas website ucas also offers a telephone support line for students worried about their grades who would like independent advice .
it estimates it assists around 35,000 people to find a higher education place every year .
kingston university 's marketing manager , anthony allen , oversees the clearing hotline and says it is helpful for callers to hear on the end of the telephone from someone who has been there .
" some students may be panicking because they have n't got their grades , and a part of what our staff do is putting their minds at ease . "
right decision ?
but are some students tempted to take the wrong course because they feel any place at university is better than none ?
ian ferguson from the learning and skills council says it is important for young people to access information about other options .
" i absolutely believe in the university system , " he said .
" but students going through clearing are under pressure and need to be able to consider doing something different . "
" a young person who has done a-levels may think they will not be able to find a job and they must go to university . "
stephanie says she found her place at kingston within hours " they could take a gap year to gain work experience , or take another qualification such as the foundation degree . "
he added that higher national certificates and diplomas -lrb- hncs and hnds -rrb- and foundation degrees were as academically demanding as degrees , though they are shorter courses .
" universities do find that students who have done these courses are well-suited to the kinds of degrees they are offering , " he added .
apprenticeships also accrue ucas points and count towards university entry .
but mr ferguson admits there is a job to do to publicise these other options while students are told that a-levels and university are the best route to a good job .
with the introduction of variable top-up fees in 2006 , universities believe competition for places could be tougher than ever this year .
applications to kingston have increased by 30 % from last year .
students working on the hotline have been told to brace themselves for a busy few days .

for some of those in the spotlight , it became a summer to forget .
in the weeks before the blur vs oasis chart battle , one song seemed to be drifting out of every speaker in the land - the boo radleys ' wake up boo !
it was a sudden flush of success for the liverpool band , already seven years into their career , who had become critical darlings without ever quite making it into the pop mainstream .
but thanks to wake up boo ! , the band - led by singer sice and featuring guitarist martin carr , bassist timothy brown and drummer rob cieka - the boo radleys found themselves , unwillingly as it turned out , at the epicentre of britpop .
a decade on , carr , the band 's principal songwriter , looks back on britpop 's legacy with mixed feelings .
" i tried to have nothing to do with what was being called britpop .
our whole career was spent trying not to ' fit in ' .
we just carried on doing what we had been doing .
ambitious records " i did n't like most of the new bands or the flag-waving .
i did n't like new labour or idolise paul weller and i hated media-generated movements within music . "
the boo radleys had already released three albums before wake up boo - ichabod and i , everything 's alright forever and 1993 's giant steps , which had been proclaimed album of the year by music weekly melody maker .
giant steps - which spawned the alternative hit lazarus - was an ambitious , stylistically varied record which had elements of dub and trip-hop alongside the fuzzy guitars and distorted vocals which had become something of a hallmark .
the band , led by sice -lrb- centre -rrb- became chart-toppers in 1995 released on creation records - also home to oasis - wake up boo ! featured a much clearer , pared-back pop sound more in keeping with the kind of guitar rock suddenly in sway .
it went all the way to number one .
but despite suddenly being lumped in with the likes of oasis , blur and pulp , carr did not feel any particular camaraderie .
the britpop scene had originally been dubbed " the scene that celebrated itself " , and carr was often featured in the music press gossip columns as something of a staple in the bars and clubs .
bands were n't given a chance to learn and grow , it was all about having hits martin carr " we had been partying since the late 1980s , " he says .
" i went to a couple of the big oasis concerts , primarily to take drugs and hang out .
" we did n't sell masses of records ; we sold relatively little compared to others .
we were never ones for going to the right clubs or hanging out with the rich and stupid . "
carr himself is not one to stick on oasis ' definitely maybe or blur 's parklife to relive the mid-90s .
" i never give it a moment 's thought .
i certainly do n't play any records from around that time except for hip-hop records . "
i really ca n't see that very much good came out of this period short of ' lad ' culture and the willingness to accept average music alex delarge , oxfordshire your britpop memories the britpop years saw the british music industry celebrating home-spun success more conspicuously than any time since the late 1960s - many bands enjoyed spectacular success in the uk without bothering with the rest of the world .
but carr disagrees with the notion that the british music scene was celebrating a sense of britishness .
" it was about record companies trying to make money .
bands were n't given a chance to learn and grow ; it was all about having hits , " he says .
' everyone had given up ' " i was gutted when creation signed to sony , i 'd never wanted to be on a major label and we were under much more pressure after that .
it was also a chance for everyone to get away with more jingoism than usual .
" american music was great then , i loved all the wu-tang stuff and pavement and richie hawtin . "
little more than a year after wake up ! was released , the boo radleys released a denser follow-up , c 'mon kids , which harked back to their more experimental roots .
the band folded after the 1998 album kingsize at the time they were accused of trying to ditch fair-weather fans .
" i 'm not even going to answer that , " carr says .
