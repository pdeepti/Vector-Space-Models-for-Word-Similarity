confirming , yet again , that teenagers have an exceedingly short attention span , the young man took several photos , including some of himself .
then he simply tossed away the camera without erasing the photos from its memory . " we do n't know if it -lrb- what happened -rrb- was a series of unfortunate events or whether the thief could n't get to grips with the technology , " a police spokesperson said in a statement on monday . the evidence was compelling enough that the offender had no choice but to come clean . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " click here for a selection dw-world 's " and finally ...

he argued that distance and time are not absolute , leading to his most famous formula , e = mc2 , essential for the development of the atomic bombs dropped on japan by the united states . the hiroshima bombing killed around 140,000 people - almost half the city population at the time - immediately or in the months afterward from radiation injuries or horrific burns . more than 70,000 more people died three days later in the bombing of nagasaki .
after six days emperor hirohito went on the radio for the first time to announce the surrender of japan , which since the war has campaigned to abolish nuclear weapons .

that means there are circumstances in which in my opinion it is necessary to use force , " he wrote .

" therefore the use of force against nazi germany was in my opinion justified and necessary . " shinohara , who studied philosophy in germany before returning to tokyo in 1947 , died of a stroke in 2001 at age 89 .
his letters have since been kept in private by his widow , nobuko shinohara . the correspondence ended in july 1954 , a year before einstein died , dashing shinohara 's dream to meet the physicist face to face . " my husband first sent the letter with anger and i guess dr. einstein replied with annoyance , " said shinohara , 80 .

german chancellor gerhard schröder is bringing along a few other topics as well . the g8 meeting at the gleneagles luxury resort in the scottish highlands could well be schröder 's last as he likely faces a tough reelection battle in september .
the three-day summit , which begins wednesday , is expected to cost about 140 million euros -lrb- $ 167 million -rrb- and will largely focus on debt relief and development aid for the world 's poorest nations if british premier tony blair gets his way . " on africa i think there is a real and common desire to help that troubled continent come out of the poverty and deprivation which so many millions of its people suffer , " blair said during a recent meeting with us president george w. bush to prepare the summit .
" in a situation where literally thousands of children die from preventable diseases every day , it is our duty to act and we will . " g8 finance ministers recently agreed to scrap about $ 55 million in debt owed by 40 of the world 's poorest nations .

" our countries are developing a proposal for the g8 that will eliminate 100 percent of that debt and that , by providing additional resources , will preserve the financial integrity of the world bank and the african development bank . "
no new marshall plan ? but bush is less willing to back a second proposal by blair to set up a " marshall plan for africa , " which would double aid to the continent to $ 50 billion a year .
saying that many countries are simply not able to handle additional aid , germany 's government also opposes the increase while hailing the debt relief as a visionary step . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphaned children write on a blackboard in a school at the sos childrens village in bakoteh , gambia " i think that 's a seminal development , " said german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul .

nevertheless , a paper on climate control goals developed by multinational companies at blair 's request will be interesting .
deutsche bank , british petroleum , canadian aluminum giant alcan , ford , hewlett packard , cisco systems , lukoil as well as firms from south africa , brazil and india participated . schröder 's own agenda despite this , the global economy is likely to play a small role at the meeting .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.07.2005 new topics pile up on g8 agenda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " gerhard , forget about hedge funds , let 's talk about africa " leaders of the wealthiest countries gather in scotland this week and britain 's tony blair has put debt relief high on the program .
german chancellor gerhard schröder is bringing along a few other topics as well . the g8 meeting at the gleneagles luxury resort in the scottish highlands could well be schröder 's last as he likely faces a tough reelection battle in september .
the three-day summit , which begins wednesday , is expected to cost about 140 million euros -lrb- $ 167 million -rrb- and will largely focus on debt relief and development aid for the world 's poorest nations if british premier tony blair gets his way . " on africa i think there is a real and common desire to help that troubled continent come out of the poverty and deprivation which so many millions of its people suffer , " blair said during a recent meeting with us president george w. bush to prepare the summit .
" in a situation where literally thousands of children die from preventable diseases every day , it is our duty to act and we will . " g8 finance ministers recently agreed to scrap about $ 55 million in debt owed by 40 of the world 's poorest nations .
it 's a step backed by bush . bildunterschrift : a child stands outside squatter shacks watching the rising waters of the jukskei river in the alexandra township north of johannesburg , south africa " we ... agree that highly indebted developing countries that are on the path to reform should not be burdened by mountains of debt , " bush said at a joint news conference with blair .
" our countries are developing a proposal for the g8 that will eliminate 100 percent of that debt and that , by providing additional resources , will preserve the financial integrity of the world bank and the african development bank . "
no new marshall plan ? but bush is less willing to back a second proposal by blair to set up a " marshall plan for africa , " which would double aid to the continent to $ 50 billion a year .
saying that many countries are simply not able to handle additional aid , germany 's government also opposes the increase while hailing the debt relief as a visionary step . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphaned children write on a blackboard in a school at the sos childrens village in bakoteh , gambia " i think that 's a seminal development , " said german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul .
" it 's a sign of g8 leadership .
debt relief has already helped developing countries to increase their spending on education and fighting diseases such as aids ... it shows what 's possible . " clashing over climate control protecting global climate is a second topic where blair and bush are likely to clash .
the american still sees no relation between global warming and air pollution .
it 's unlikely that leaders will reach a consensus at the summit - or present a document that will lack bush 's signature . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no connection between air pollution and global warming ?
nevertheless , a paper on climate control goals developed by multinational companies at blair 's request will be interesting .
deutsche bank , british petroleum , canadian aluminum giant alcan , ford , hewlett packard , cisco systems , lukoil as well as firms from south africa , brazil and india participated . schröder 's own agenda despite this , the global economy is likely to play a small role at the meeting .
but in light of the recent record prices for oil , germany 's chancellor gerhard schröder plans to push for a g8 initiative for more transparency on the oil markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stock trader at frankfurt 's stock market this way , he hopes to limit price speculation - one of the main reasons for the swift rise .
schröder also wants to bring about global standards for hedge funds . " the short-term interest of some hedge funds in germany has recently raised some questions , " he said .

the volkswagen beetle managed to shed its dark childhood and went on to become the world 's best-selling car . nearly 22 million beetles were produced between 1945 and 2003 , making it a global icon of affordable mobility after world war ii . but the story of the the car with the hump , the divided rear window and the characteristic sound of its air-cooled engine began much earlier : the first prototype of the " volkswagen " or " people 's car " was unveiled on july 3 , 1935 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beetle suspended as part of an art exhibition in sao paolo it became more than just a car : born during the nazi period in germany , later a symbol of the german economic miracle , a cult object of the hippie generation , a star in hollywood films and above all : the foundation stone for the vw company - today europe 's biggest carmaker . hitler 's car for the masses the story began in 1934 , a year after adolf hitler came to power , when the association of the german automobile industry commissioned car designer ferdinand porsche to construct a car for the masses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler spoke at the opening ceremony of the volkswagen car factory on may 26 , 1938 .
it was meant to be a car that was simple to build , cheap to buy and economical to maintain .
on july 3 , 1935 , after a year of development work , porsche presented the first prototype .

then , on may 28 , 1938 , near the town of fallersleben , adolf hitler laid the foundation stone for the volkswagen factory and with it for the town of wolfsburg . " today we are standing on the huge site of the volkswagen works , " a radio reporter said .

at the end of the war , the volkswagen factory , like most other german factories , was in ruins .
but it was saved from the fate of dismantlement by the allies .
on the contrary - the britons developed a soft spot for the beetle . " at the former volkswagen plant at fallersleben , cars are again being mass-produced , " went a news report .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.07.2005 -pipe- 12:00 utc vw postpones expansion due to scandal the bribery scandal at german auto giant volkswagen has led chairman bernd pischetsrieder to postpone making a decision on the planned construction of a new factory in india , the business daily handelsblatt reported on monday .
pischetsrieder has put the building plans on ice until the allegations of bribes in connection with the construction of the plant have been cleared up , the newspaper said , quoting sources close to suppliers . berlin daily tagesspiegel reported that the planned construction of an assembly plant in angola had also been put on hold in the wake of the scandal .
both papers said vw had declined to comment on the information .
the scandal , triggered by the shock resignation last month of the personnel chief at vw 's czech arm skoda , helmuth schuster , looks set to snowball in what threatens to deal a fresh blow to the image of europe 's biggest car maker just as it is beginning to steer itself out a long crisis .
vw is hiring independent auditors kpmg to review the situation .
schuster last month quit amid allegations he took bribes from potential suppliers and claims in magazine reports that he used camouflage companies to secure lucrative vw contracts abroad , notably india and angola .
but the scandal looked set to widen last week when the long-serving head of vw 's general works council , klaus volkert , also announced he was stepping down nine months earlier than planned .
the online version of der spiegel magazine alleged that volkert was also involved in schuster 's dubious dealings .
wirtschaftswoche weekly claimed volkert was simply the " tip of the iceberg " and more resignations would follow , including that of vw 's head of personnel , peter hartz . dw-world.de vw faces bribery scandal the head of the general works council at german car giant volkswagen has stepped down in the midst of an alleged bribery scandal , while rumors about the larger scope of the affair begin to circulate .

the quirkiest and loudest of all iconic designers , vivienne westwood , has left berlin , where she taught for the past 12 years . after 12 years of teaching at berlin 's university of the arts , educating new generations of fashion designers and raising general hell , the uk-born star designer and germany 's other famous vw , vivienne westwood , bid farewell to the german capital . while continuing her design work , westwood is planning to devote more of her time to political engagements and literary projects . appearing at a press-conference in berlin on friday , the 64- year-old , with her trademark carrot orange hair and enough spunk to put some of her younger colleagues to shame , wore a t-shirt with the word " liberty " scrawled above the drawing of a heart behind bars . " there is no culture without justice before the law , " said westwood in a public display of support for the independent human rights organization " liberty , " whose mission is to protect civil liberties and promote human rights across the globe . when asked about fashion today , she attacked the predominant mass-consumerist style that leaves little space for innovation and creativity . " the world has become so americanized that people look uglier than before .
the more you consume , the less you think .
people should buy less , " she said . bildunterschrift : blabla end of an era westwood has been provoking the fashion world since the 70s , when she designed outfits for british rock punk band , the sex pistols . when she moved to berlin in 1993 , she quickly immersed herself in the post-wall , urban renewal of the city 's artistic scene and is responsible for strengthening berlin 's growing reputation as a fashion metropolis . with its annual b-in-berlin and bread and butter fashion shows , the german capital is now providing serious competition to cities like düsseldorf .
low rents and a vibrant , colorful arts scene has attracted lots of fashion talent in recent years to berlin . " it is easy to get things going in berlin , " westwood said , praising both the creative atmosphere of the german capital as well as her students ' intellectual and artistic curiosity . " whenever i went to a museum , i would run into one of them -lrb- the students -rrb- , " she said .
but , westwood is also said to be a hard taskmaster , with reports of students breaking into tears at some of her fashion classes . westwood marked the end of her berlin years with a glamorous fashion show displaying her students ' work .
the event called " copying and transforming old masters , " which was held on saturday at berlin 's nazi-era tempelhof airport , confirmed that westwood 's approach to fashion design as a contemporary re-reading of fashion history , has left a significant impression on her students . bildunterschrift : the students got a chance to display their designs in front of 1,500 guests in a snazzy , flashlight-illuminated happening that ended with standing ovations . an international panel of designers awarded prizes for the best student work .

pischetsrieder has put the building plans on ice until the allegations of bribes in connection with the construction of the plant have been cleared up , the newspaper said , quoting sources close to suppliers . berlin daily tagesspiegel reported that the planned construction of an assembly plant in angola had also been put on hold in the wake of the scandal .
both papers said vw had declined to comment on the information .
the scandal , triggered by the shock resignation last month of the personnel chief at vw 's czech arm skoda , helmuth schuster , looks set to snowball in what threatens to deal a fresh blow to the image of europe 's biggest car maker just as it is beginning to steer itself out a long crisis .
vw is hiring independent auditors kpmg to review the situation .
schuster last month quit amid allegations he took bribes from potential suppliers and claims in magazine reports that he used camouflage companies to secure lucrative vw contracts abroad , notably india and angola .
but the scandal looked set to widen last week when the long-serving head of vw 's general works council , klaus volkert , also announced he was stepping down nine months earlier than planned .
the online version of der spiegel magazine alleged that volkert was also involved in schuster 's dubious dealings .
wirtschaftswoche weekly claimed volkert was simply the " tip of the iceberg " and more resignations would follow , including that of vw 's head of personnel , peter hartz . dw-world.de vw faces bribery scandal the head of the general works council at german car giant volkswagen has stepped down in the midst of an alleged bribery scandal , while rumors about the larger scope of the affair begin to circulate .

pischetsrieder has put the building plans on ice until the allegations of bribes in connection with the construction of the plant have been cleared up , the newspaper said , quoting sources close to suppliers . berlin daily tagesspiegel reported that the planned construction of an assembly plant in angola had also been put on hold in the wake of the scandal .
both papers said vw had declined to comment on the information .
the scandal , triggered by the shock resignation last month of the personnel chief at vw 's czech arm skoda , helmuth schuster , looks set to snowball in what threatens to deal a fresh blow to the image of europe 's biggest car maker just as it is beginning to steer itself out a long crisis .
vw is hiring independent auditors kpmg to review the situation .
schuster last month quit amid allegations he took bribes from potential suppliers and claims in magazine reports that he used camouflage companies to secure lucrative vw contracts abroad , notably india and angola .
but the scandal looked set to widen last week when the long-serving head of vw 's general works council , klaus volkert , also announced he was stepping down nine months earlier than planned .
the online version of der spiegel magazine alleged that volkert was also involved in schuster 's dubious dealings .
wirtschaftswoche weekly claimed volkert was simply the " tip of the iceberg " and more resignations would follow , including that of vw 's head of personnel , peter hartz . dw-world.de vw faces bribery scandal the head of the general works council at german car giant volkswagen has stepped down in the midst of an alleged bribery scandal , while rumors about the larger scope of the affair begin to circulate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.07.2005 beetle races to another milestone großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : born in 1935 , first built in 1938 seventy years ago , the nazis unveiled a " people 's car " that would make driving affordable for the masses .
the volkswagen beetle managed to shed its dark childhood and went on to become the world 's best-selling car . nearly 22 million beetles were produced between 1945 and 2003 , making it a global icon of affordable mobility after world war ii . but the story of the the car with the hump , the divided rear window and the characteristic sound of its air-cooled engine began much earlier : the first prototype of the " volkswagen " or " people 's car " was unveiled on july 3 , 1935 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beetle suspended as part of an art exhibition in sao paolo it became more than just a car : born during the nazi period in germany , later a symbol of the german economic miracle , a cult object of the hippie generation , a star in hollywood films and above all : the foundation stone for the vw company - today europe 's biggest carmaker . hitler 's car for the masses the story began in 1934 , a year after adolf hitler came to power , when the association of the german automobile industry commissioned car designer ferdinand porsche to construct a car for the masses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler spoke at the opening ceremony of the volkswagen car factory on may 26 , 1938 .
it was meant to be a car that was simple to build , cheap to buy and economical to maintain .
on july 3 , 1935 , after a year of development work , porsche presented the first prototype . " porsche has constructed a saloon car , an open car and a convertible that uses six to seven liters of fuel every 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- at a speed of 100 kph and costs only 990 marks , " the weekly news show at the movie theater reported at the time . another three years passed before the car was ready for production .
then , on may 28 , 1938 , near the town of fallersleben , adolf hitler laid the foundation stone for the volkswagen factory and with it for the town of wolfsburg . " today we are standing on the huge site of the volkswagen works , " a radio reporter said .
here , in accordance with the führer 's will , a gigantic factory that the world will talk about one day is to be built . " saved by the allies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the replica of herbie the love bug , the star of the wacky 1970s movie of the same name but it was not volkswagen cars but small military vehicles for hitler 's campaign of destruction that were assembled in the highly modern factory .
at the end of the war , the volkswagen factory , like most other german factories , was in ruins .
but it was saved from the fate of dismantlement by the allies .
on the contrary - the britons developed a soft spot for the beetle . " at the former volkswagen plant at fallersleben , cars are again being mass-produced , " went a news report .
" some 18,000 workers are in the factory and its subsidiary plants .
orders and raw materials have been secured for a long time .
the cars will at first be distributed by the military authorities to the departments of the occupying powers and to vital german companies . " a global icon bildunterschrift : beetle at the beach only then did the success story of the vw beetle begin in earnest .
in a matter of 10 years - between 1945 and 1955 - one million vehicles were produced .
in 1972 , the 15-million mark was reached , making the vw beetle the world 's biggest-selling car . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the very last vw beetle is decorated with a wreath of roses and a message on its windscreen which reads " volkswagen of mexico last sedan in the world , july 30 , 2003 " as it rolls off the production line at vw 's puebla plant .

the volkswagen beetle managed to shed its dark childhood and went on to become the world 's best-selling car . nearly 22 million beetles were produced between 1945 and 2003 , making it a global icon of affordable mobility after world war ii . but the story of the the car with the hump , the divided rear window and the characteristic sound of its air-cooled engine began much earlier : the first prototype of the " volkswagen " or " people 's car " was unveiled on july 3 , 1935 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beetle suspended as part of an art exhibition in sao paolo it became more than just a car : born during the nazi period in germany , later a symbol of the german economic miracle , a cult object of the hippie generation , a star in hollywood films and above all : the foundation stone for the vw company - today europe 's biggest carmaker . hitler 's car for the masses the story began in 1934 , a year after adolf hitler came to power , when the association of the german automobile industry commissioned car designer ferdinand porsche to construct a car for the masses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler spoke at the opening ceremony of the volkswagen car factory on may 26 , 1938 .
it was meant to be a car that was simple to build , cheap to buy and economical to maintain .
on july 3 , 1935 , after a year of development work , porsche presented the first prototype . " porsche has constructed a saloon car , an open car and a convertible that uses six to seven liters of fuel every 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- at a speed of 100 kph and costs only 990 marks , " the weekly news show at the movie theater reported at the time . another three years passed before the car was ready for production .
then , on may 28 , 1938 , near the town of fallersleben , adolf hitler laid the foundation stone for the volkswagen factory and with it for the town of wolfsburg . " today we are standing on the huge site of the volkswagen works , " a radio reporter said .
here , in accordance with the führer 's will , a gigantic factory that the world will talk about one day is to be built . " saved by the allies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the replica of herbie the love bug , the star of the wacky 1970s movie of the same name but it was not volkswagen cars but small military vehicles for hitler 's campaign of destruction that were assembled in the highly modern factory .
at the end of the war , the volkswagen factory , like most other german factories , was in ruins .
but it was saved from the fate of dismantlement by the allies .
on the contrary - the britons developed a soft spot for the beetle . " at the former volkswagen plant at fallersleben , cars are again being mass-produced , " went a news report .
" some 18,000 workers are in the factory and its subsidiary plants .
orders and raw materials have been secured for a long time .
the cars will at first be distributed by the military authorities to the departments of the occupying powers and to vital german companies . " a global icon bildunterschrift : beetle at the beach only then did the success story of the vw beetle begin in earnest .
in a matter of 10 years - between 1945 and 1955 - one million vehicles were produced .
in 1972 , the 15-million mark was reached , making the vw beetle the world 's biggest-selling car . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the very last vw beetle is decorated with a wreath of roses and a message on its windscreen which reads " volkswagen of mexico last sedan in the world , july 30 , 2003 " as it rolls off the production line at vw 's puebla plant .
but just a few years later , the beginning of the end had started for the global icon of affordable mobility after world war ii .
no more beetles were manufactured in germany after 1978 and vw gradually also halted production in factories abroad .
everywhere except puebla in mexico , where the cars rolled off the production line until the year 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new beetle : less noisy , more stylish the last 2,000 beetles paid tribute to their ancestors : they again had chrome parts , white-walled tyres and were painted light blue or cream-white – just like the successful models of the 1950s .

pischetsrieder has put the building plans on ice until the allegations of bribes in connection with the construction of the plant have been cleared up , the newspaper said , quoting sources close to suppliers . berlin daily tagesspiegel reported that the planned construction of an assembly plant in angola had also been put on hold in the wake of the scandal .
both papers said vw had declined to comment on the information .
the scandal , triggered by the shock resignation last month of the personnel chief at vw 's czech arm skoda , helmuth schuster , looks set to snowball in what threatens to deal a fresh blow to the image of europe 's biggest car maker just as it is beginning to steer itself out a long crisis .
vw is hiring independent auditors kpmg to review the situation .
schuster last month quit amid allegations he took bribes from potential suppliers and claims in magazine reports that he used camouflage companies to secure lucrative vw contracts abroad , notably india and angola .
but the scandal looked set to widen last week when the long-serving head of vw 's general works council , klaus volkert , also announced he was stepping down nine months earlier than planned .
the online version of der spiegel magazine alleged that volkert was also involved in schuster 's dubious dealings .
wirtschaftswoche weekly claimed volkert was simply the " tip of the iceberg " and more resignations would follow , including that of vw 's head of personnel , peter hartz . dw-world.de vw faces bribery scandal the head of the general works council at german car giant volkswagen has stepped down in the midst of an alleged bribery scandal , while rumors about the larger scope of the affair begin to circulate .

pischetsrieder has put the building plans on ice until the allegations of bribes in connection with the construction of the plant have been cleared up , the newspaper said , quoting sources close to suppliers . berlin daily tagesspiegel reported that the planned construction of an assembly plant in angola had also been put on hold in the wake of the scandal .
both papers said vw had declined to comment on the information .
the scandal , triggered by the shock resignation last month of the personnel chief at vw 's czech arm skoda , helmuth schuster , looks set to snowball in what threatens to deal a fresh blow to the image of europe 's biggest car maker just as it is beginning to steer itself out a long crisis .
vw is hiring independent auditors kpmg to review the situation .
schuster last month quit amid allegations he took bribes from potential suppliers and claims in magazine reports that he used camouflage companies to secure lucrative vw contracts abroad , notably india and angola .
but the scandal looked set to widen last week when the long-serving head of vw 's general works council , klaus volkert , also announced he was stepping down nine months earlier than planned .
the online version of der spiegel magazine alleged that volkert was also involved in schuster 's dubious dealings .
wirtschaftswoche weekly claimed volkert was simply the " tip of the iceberg " and more resignations would follow , including that of vw 's head of personnel , peter hartz . dw-world.de vw faces bribery scandal the head of the general works council at german car giant volkswagen has stepped down in the midst of an alleged bribery scandal , while rumors about the larger scope of the affair begin to circulate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.07.2005 new topics pile up on g8 agenda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " gerhard , forget about hedge funds , let 's talk about africa " leaders of the wealthiest countries gather in scotland this week and britain 's tony blair has put debt relief high on the program .
german chancellor gerhard schröder is bringing along a few other topics as well . the g8 meeting at the gleneagles luxury resort in the scottish highlands could well be schröder 's last as he likely faces a tough reelection battle in september .
the three-day summit , which begins wednesday , is expected to cost about 140 million euros -lrb- $ 167 million -rrb- and will largely focus on debt relief and development aid for the world 's poorest nations if british premier tony blair gets his way . " on africa i think there is a real and common desire to help that troubled continent come out of the poverty and deprivation which so many millions of its people suffer , " blair said during a recent meeting with us president george w. bush to prepare the summit .
" in a situation where literally thousands of children die from preventable diseases every day , it is our duty to act and we will . " g8 finance ministers recently agreed to scrap about $ 55 million in debt owed by 40 of the world 's poorest nations .
it 's a step backed by bush . bildunterschrift : a child stands outside squatter shacks watching the rising waters of the jukskei river in the alexandra township north of johannesburg , south africa " we ... agree that highly indebted developing countries that are on the path to reform should not be burdened by mountains of debt , " bush said at a joint news conference with blair .
" our countries are developing a proposal for the g8 that will eliminate 100 percent of that debt and that , by providing additional resources , will preserve the financial integrity of the world bank and the african development bank . "
no new marshall plan ? but bush is less willing to back a second proposal by blair to set up a " marshall plan for africa , " which would double aid to the continent to $ 50 billion a year .
saying that many countries are simply not able to handle additional aid , germany 's government also opposes the increase while hailing the debt relief as a visionary step . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphaned children write on a blackboard in a school at the sos childrens village in bakoteh , gambia " i think that 's a seminal development , " said german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul .
" it 's a sign of g8 leadership .
debt relief has already helped developing countries to increase their spending on education and fighting diseases such as aids ... it shows what 's possible . " clashing over climate control protecting global climate is a second topic where blair and bush are likely to clash .
the american still sees no relation between global warming and air pollution .
it 's unlikely that leaders will reach a consensus at the summit - or present a document that will lack bush 's signature . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no connection between air pollution and global warming ?
nevertheless , a paper on climate control goals developed by multinational companies at blair 's request will be interesting .
deutsche bank , british petroleum , canadian aluminum giant alcan , ford , hewlett packard , cisco systems , lukoil as well as firms from south africa , brazil and india participated . schröder 's own agenda despite this , the global economy is likely to play a small role at the meeting .
but in light of the recent record prices for oil , germany 's chancellor gerhard schröder plans to push for a g8 initiative for more transparency on the oil markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stock trader at frankfurt 's stock market this way , he hopes to limit price speculation - one of the main reasons for the swift rise .
schröder also wants to bring about global standards for hedge funds . " the short-term interest of some hedge funds in germany has recently raised some questions , " he said .
" that 's why we 're currently looking at the criteria that allow these funds to operate in our country .

the volkswagen beetle managed to shed its dark childhood and went on to become the world 's best-selling car . nearly 22 million beetles were produced between 1945 and 2003 , making it a global icon of affordable mobility after world war ii . but the story of the the car with the hump , the divided rear window and the characteristic sound of its air-cooled engine began much earlier : the first prototype of the " volkswagen " or " people 's car " was unveiled on july 3 , 1935 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beetle suspended as part of an art exhibition in sao paolo it became more than just a car : born during the nazi period in germany , later a symbol of the german economic miracle , a cult object of the hippie generation , a star in hollywood films and above all : the foundation stone for the vw company - today europe 's biggest carmaker . hitler 's car for the masses the story began in 1934 , a year after adolf hitler came to power , when the association of the german automobile industry commissioned car designer ferdinand porsche to construct a car for the masses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler spoke at the opening ceremony of the volkswagen car factory on may 26 , 1938 .
it was meant to be a car that was simple to build , cheap to buy and economical to maintain .
on july 3 , 1935 , after a year of development work , porsche presented the first prototype . " porsche has constructed a saloon car , an open car and a convertible that uses six to seven liters of fuel every 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- at a speed of 100 kph and costs only 990 marks , " the weekly news show at the movie theater reported at the time . another three years passed before the car was ready for production .
then , on may 28 , 1938 , near the town of fallersleben , adolf hitler laid the foundation stone for the volkswagen factory and with it for the town of wolfsburg . " today we are standing on the huge site of the volkswagen works , " a radio reporter said .
here , in accordance with the führer 's will , a gigantic factory that the world will talk about one day is to be built . " saved by the allies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the replica of herbie the love bug , the star of the wacky 1970s movie of the same name but it was not volkswagen cars but small military vehicles for hitler 's campaign of destruction that were assembled in the highly modern factory .
at the end of the war , the volkswagen factory , like most other german factories , was in ruins .
but it was saved from the fate of dismantlement by the allies .
on the contrary - the britons developed a soft spot for the beetle . " at the former volkswagen plant at fallersleben , cars are again being mass-produced , " went a news report .
" some 18,000 workers are in the factory and its subsidiary plants .
orders and raw materials have been secured for a long time .
the cars will at first be distributed by the military authorities to the departments of the occupying powers and to vital german companies . " a global icon bildunterschrift : beetle at the beach only then did the success story of the vw beetle begin in earnest .
in a matter of 10 years - between 1945 and 1955 - one million vehicles were produced .
in 1972 , the 15-million mark was reached , making the vw beetle the world 's biggest-selling car . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the very last vw beetle is decorated with a wreath of roses and a message on its windscreen which reads " volkswagen of mexico last sedan in the world , july 30 , 2003 " as it rolls off the production line at vw 's puebla plant .
but just a few years later , the beginning of the end had started for the global icon of affordable mobility after world war ii .
no more beetles were manufactured in germany after 1978 and vw gradually also halted production in factories abroad .
everywhere except puebla in mexico , where the cars rolled off the production line until the year 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new beetle : less noisy , more stylish the last 2,000 beetles paid tribute to their ancestors : they again had chrome parts , white-walled tyres and were painted light blue or cream-white – just like the successful models of the 1950s .

german chancellor gerhard schröder is bringing along a few other topics as well . the g8 meeting at the gleneagles luxury resort in the scottish highlands could well be schröder 's last as he likely faces a tough reelection battle in september .
the three-day summit , which begins wednesday , is expected to cost about 140 million euros -lrb- $ 167 million -rrb- and will largely focus on debt relief and development aid for the world 's poorest nations if british premier tony blair gets his way . " on africa i think there is a real and common desire to help that troubled continent come out of the poverty and deprivation which so many millions of its people suffer , " blair said during a recent meeting with us president george w. bush to prepare the summit .
" in a situation where literally thousands of children die from preventable diseases every day , it is our duty to act and we will . " g8 finance ministers recently agreed to scrap about $ 55 million in debt owed by 40 of the world 's poorest nations .

" our countries are developing a proposal for the g8 that will eliminate 100 percent of that debt and that , by providing additional resources , will preserve the financial integrity of the world bank and the african development bank . "
no new marshall plan ? but bush is less willing to back a second proposal by blair to set up a " marshall plan for africa , " which would double aid to the continent to $ 50 billion a year .
saying that many countries are simply not able to handle additional aid , germany 's government also opposes the increase while hailing the debt relief as a visionary step . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphaned children write on a blackboard in a school at the sos childrens village in bakoteh , gambia " i think that 's a seminal development , " said german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul .

it 's a step backed by bush . bildunterschrift : a child stands outside squatter shacks watching the rising waters of the jukskei river in the alexandra township north of johannesburg , south africa " we ... agree that highly indebted developing countries that are on the path to reform should not be burdened by mountains of debt , " bush said at a joint news conference with blair .
" our countries are developing a proposal for the g8 that will eliminate 100 percent of that debt and that , by providing additional resources , will preserve the financial integrity of the world bank and the african development bank . "
no new marshall plan ? but bush is less willing to back a second proposal by blair to set up a " marshall plan for africa , " which would double aid to the continent to $ 50 billion a year .
saying that many countries are simply not able to handle additional aid , germany 's government also opposes the increase while hailing the debt relief as a visionary step . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphaned children write on a blackboard in a school at the sos childrens village in bakoteh , gambia " i think that 's a seminal development , " said german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul .
" it 's a sign of g8 leadership .
debt relief has already helped developing countries to increase their spending on education and fighting diseases such as aids ... it shows what 's possible . " clashing over climate control protecting global climate is a second topic where blair and bush are likely to clash .
the american still sees no relation between global warming and air pollution .
it 's unlikely that leaders will reach a consensus at the summit - or present a document that will lack bush 's signature . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no connection between air pollution and global warming ?
nevertheless , a paper on climate control goals developed by multinational companies at blair 's request will be interesting .
deutsche bank , british petroleum , canadian aluminum giant alcan , ford , hewlett packard , cisco systems , lukoil as well as firms from south africa , brazil and india participated . schröder 's own agenda despite this , the global economy is likely to play a small role at the meeting .
but in light of the recent record prices for oil , germany 's chancellor gerhard schröder plans to push for a g8 initiative for more transparency on the oil markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stock trader at frankfurt 's stock market this way , he hopes to limit price speculation - one of the main reasons for the swift rise .
schröder also wants to bring about global standards for hedge funds . " the short-term interest of some hedge funds in germany has recently raised some questions , " he said .
" that 's why we 're currently looking at the criteria that allow these funds to operate in our country .

the quirkiest and loudest of all iconic designers , vivienne westwood , has left berlin , where she taught for the past 12 years . after 12 years of teaching at berlin 's university of the arts , educating new generations of fashion designers and raising general hell , the uk-born star designer and germany 's other famous vw , vivienne westwood , bid farewell to the german capital . while continuing her design work , westwood is planning to devote more of her time to political engagements and literary projects . appearing at a press-conference in berlin on friday , the 64- year-old , with her trademark carrot orange hair and enough spunk to put some of her younger colleagues to shame , wore a t-shirt with the word " liberty " scrawled above the drawing of a heart behind bars . " there is no culture without justice before the law , " said westwood in a public display of support for the independent human rights organization " liberty , " whose mission is to protect civil liberties and promote human rights across the globe . when asked about fashion today , she attacked the predominant mass-consumerist style that leaves little space for innovation and creativity . " the world has become so americanized that people look uglier than before .

low rents and a vibrant , colorful arts scene has attracted lots of fashion talent in recent years to berlin . " it is easy to get things going in berlin , " westwood said , praising both the creative atmosphere of the german capital as well as her students ' intellectual and artistic curiosity . " whenever i went to a museum , i would run into one of them -lrb- the students -rrb- , " she said .
but , westwood is also said to be a hard taskmaster , with reports of students breaking into tears at some of her fashion classes . westwood marked the end of her berlin years with a glamorous fashion show displaying her students ' work .
the event called " copying and transforming old masters , " which was held on saturday at berlin 's nazi-era tempelhof airport , confirmed that westwood 's approach to fashion design as a contemporary re-reading of fashion history , has left a significant impression on her students . bildunterschrift : the students got a chance to display their designs in front of 1,500 guests in a snazzy , flashlight-illuminated happening that ended with standing ovations . an international panel of designers awarded prizes for the best student work .

then , on may 28 , 1938 , near the town of fallersleben , adolf hitler laid the foundation stone for the volkswagen factory and with it for the town of wolfsburg . " today we are standing on the huge site of the volkswagen works , " a radio reporter said .
here , in accordance with the führer 's will , a gigantic factory that the world will talk about one day is to be built .

at the end of the war , the volkswagen factory , like most other german factories , was in ruins .
but it was saved from the fate of dismantlement by the allies .
on the contrary - the britons developed a soft spot for the beetle . " at the former volkswagen plant at fallersleben , cars are again being mass-produced , " went a news report .
" some 18,000 workers are in the factory and its subsidiary plants .
orders and raw materials have been secured for a long time .
the cars will at first be distributed by the military authorities to the departments of the occupying powers and to vital german companies . " a global icon bildunterschrift : beetle at the beach only then did the success story of the vw beetle begin in earnest .
in a matter of 10 years - between 1945 and 1955 - one million vehicles were produced .
in 1972 , the 15-million mark was reached , making the vw beetle the world 's biggest-selling car . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the very last vw beetle is decorated with a wreath of roses and a message on its windscreen which reads " volkswagen of mexico last sedan in the world , july 30 , 2003 " as it rolls off the production line at vw 's puebla plant .
but just a few years later , the beginning of the end had started for the global icon of affordable mobility after world war ii .
no more beetles were manufactured in germany after 1978 and vw gradually also halted production in factories abroad .
everywhere except puebla in mexico , where the cars rolled off the production line until the year 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new beetle : less noisy , more stylish the last 2,000 beetles paid tribute to their ancestors : they again had chrome parts , white-walled tyres and were painted light blue or cream-white – just like the successful models of the 1950s .

german chancellor gerhard schröder is bringing along a few other topics as well . the g8 meeting at the gleneagles luxury resort in the scottish highlands could well be schröder 's last as he likely faces a tough reelection battle in september .
the three-day summit , which begins wednesday , is expected to cost about 140 million euros -lrb- $ 167 million -rrb- and will largely focus on debt relief and development aid for the world 's poorest nations if british premier tony blair gets his way . " on africa i think there is a real and common desire to help that troubled continent come out of the poverty and deprivation which so many millions of its people suffer , " blair said during a recent meeting with us president george w. bush to prepare the summit .
" in a situation where literally thousands of children die from preventable diseases every day , it is our duty to act and we will . " g8 finance ministers recently agreed to scrap about $ 55 million in debt owed by 40 of the world 's poorest nations .
it 's a step backed by bush . bildunterschrift : a child stands outside squatter shacks watching the rising waters of the jukskei river in the alexandra township north of johannesburg , south africa " we ... agree that highly indebted developing countries that are on the path to reform should not be burdened by mountains of debt , " bush said at a joint news conference with blair .
" our countries are developing a proposal for the g8 that will eliminate 100 percent of that debt and that , by providing additional resources , will preserve the financial integrity of the world bank and the african development bank . "
no new marshall plan ? but bush is less willing to back a second proposal by blair to set up a " marshall plan for africa , " which would double aid to the continent to $ 50 billion a year .
saying that many countries are simply not able to handle additional aid , germany 's government also opposes the increase while hailing the debt relief as a visionary step . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphaned children write on a blackboard in a school at the sos childrens village in bakoteh , gambia " i think that 's a seminal development , " said german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul .

nevertheless , a paper on climate control goals developed by multinational companies at blair 's request will be interesting .
deutsche bank , british petroleum , canadian aluminum giant alcan , ford , hewlett packard , cisco systems , lukoil as well as firms from south africa , brazil and india participated . schröder 's own agenda despite this , the global economy is likely to play a small role at the meeting .

he argued that distance and time are not absolute , leading to his most famous formula , e = mc2 , essential for the development of the atomic bombs dropped on japan by the united states . the hiroshima bombing killed around 140,000 people - almost half the city population at the time - immediately or in the months afterward from radiation injuries or horrific burns . more than 70,000 more people died three days later in the bombing of nagasaki .
after six days emperor hirohito went on the radio for the first time to announce the surrender of japan , which since the war has campaigned to abolish nuclear weapons .

that means there are circumstances in which in my opinion it is necessary to use force , " he wrote . " such a case would be when i face an opponent whose unconditional aim is to destroy me and my people , " he said . " therefore the use of force against nazi germany was in my opinion justified and necessary . " shinohara , who studied philosophy in germany before returning to tokyo in 1947 , died of a stroke in 2001 at age 89 .
his letters have since been kept in private by his widow , nobuko shinohara . the correspondence ended in july 1954 , a year before einstein died , dashing shinohara 's dream to meet the physicist face to face . " my husband first sent the letter with anger and i guess dr. einstein replied with annoyance , " said shinohara , 80 .

some criminals actually serve themselves up to investigators on a silver platter . imagine you were a thief who really wanted to get caught .
what would you do after a successful robbery ? as a traditionalist , you could always return to the scene , reinforcing the old stereotype that criminals are magically drawn to the place where they committed their crime . but in the age of digital media and mobile technologies , that would n't be necessary .
you could , for instance , make a wanted poster with your picture on it . that is pretty much what a 17-year old did after stealing a digital camera and some money from a construction site in the northern german town of rendsburg .
confirming , yet again , that teenagers have an exceedingly short attention span , the young man took several photos , including some of himself .
then he simply tossed away the camera without erasing the photos from its memory . " we do n't know if it -lrb- what happened -rrb- was a series of unfortunate events or whether the thief could n't get to grips with the technology , " a police spokesperson said in a statement on monday . the evidence was compelling enough that the offender had no choice but to come clean . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " click here for a selection dw-world 's " and finally ...

pischetsrieder has put the building plans on ice until the allegations of bribes in connection with the construction of the plant have been cleared up , the newspaper said , quoting sources close to suppliers . berlin daily tagesspiegel reported that the planned construction of an assembly plant in angola had also been put on hold in the wake of the scandal .
both papers said vw had declined to comment on the information .
the scandal , triggered by the shock resignation last month of the personnel chief at vw 's czech arm skoda , helmuth schuster , looks set to snowball in what threatens to deal a fresh blow to the image of europe 's biggest car maker just as it is beginning to steer itself out a long crisis .
vw is hiring independent auditors kpmg to review the situation .
schuster last month quit amid allegations he took bribes from potential suppliers and claims in magazine reports that he used camouflage companies to secure lucrative vw contracts abroad , notably india and angola .
but the scandal looked set to widen last week when the long-serving head of vw 's general works council , klaus volkert , also announced he was stepping down nine months earlier than planned .
the online version of der spiegel magazine alleged that volkert was also involved in schuster 's dubious dealings .
wirtschaftswoche weekly claimed volkert was simply the " tip of the iceberg " and more resignations would follow , including that of vw 's head of personnel , peter hartz . dw-world.de vw faces bribery scandal the head of the general works council at german car giant volkswagen has stepped down in the midst of an alleged bribery scandal , while rumors about the larger scope of the affair begin to circulate .

german chancellor gerhard schröder is bringing along a few other topics as well . the g8 meeting at the gleneagles luxury resort in the scottish highlands could well be schröder 's last as he likely faces a tough reelection battle in september .
the three-day summit , which begins wednesday , is expected to cost about 140 million euros -lrb- $ 167 million -rrb- and will largely focus on debt relief and development aid for the world 's poorest nations if british premier tony blair gets his way .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.07.2005 -pipe- 12:00 utc vw postpones expansion due to scandal the bribery scandal at german auto giant volkswagen has led chairman bernd pischetsrieder to postpone making a decision on the planned construction of a new factory in india , the business daily handelsblatt reported on monday .
pischetsrieder has put the building plans on ice until the allegations of bribes in connection with the construction of the plant have been cleared up , the newspaper said , quoting sources close to suppliers . berlin daily tagesspiegel reported that the planned construction of an assembly plant in angola had also been put on hold in the wake of the scandal .
both papers said vw had declined to comment on the information .
the scandal , triggered by the shock resignation last month of the personnel chief at vw 's czech arm skoda , helmuth schuster , looks set to snowball in what threatens to deal a fresh blow to the image of europe 's biggest car maker just as it is beginning to steer itself out a long crisis .
vw is hiring independent auditors kpmg to review the situation .
schuster last month quit amid allegations he took bribes from potential suppliers and claims in magazine reports that he used camouflage companies to secure lucrative vw contracts abroad , notably india and angola .

the quirkiest and loudest of all iconic designers , vivienne westwood , has left berlin , where she taught for the past 12 years . after 12 years of teaching at berlin 's university of the arts , educating new generations of fashion designers and raising general hell , the uk-born star designer and germany 's other famous vw , vivienne westwood , bid farewell to the german capital . while continuing her design work , westwood is planning to devote more of her time to political engagements and literary projects . appearing at a press-conference in berlin on friday , the 64- year-old , with her trademark carrot orange hair and enough spunk to put some of her younger colleagues to shame , wore a t-shirt with the word " liberty " scrawled above the drawing of a heart behind bars . " there is no culture without justice before the law , " said westwood in a public display of support for the independent human rights organization " liberty , " whose mission is to protect civil liberties and promote human rights across the globe . when asked about fashion today , she attacked the predominant mass-consumerist style that leaves little space for innovation and creativity . " the world has become so americanized that people look uglier than before .
the more you consume , the less you think .
people should buy less , " she said . bildunterschrift : blabla end of an era westwood has been provoking the fashion world since the 70s , when she designed outfits for british rock punk band , the sex pistols . when she moved to berlin in 1993 , she quickly immersed herself in the post-wall , urban renewal of the city 's artistic scene and is responsible for strengthening berlin 's growing reputation as a fashion metropolis . with its annual b-in-berlin and bread and butter fashion shows , the german capital is now providing serious competition to cities like düsseldorf .
low rents and a vibrant , colorful arts scene has attracted lots of fashion talent in recent years to berlin . " it is easy to get things going in berlin , " westwood said , praising both the creative atmosphere of the german capital as well as her students ' intellectual and artistic curiosity . " whenever i went to a museum , i would run into one of them -lrb- the students -rrb- , " she said .
but , westwood is also said to be a hard taskmaster , with reports of students breaking into tears at some of her fashion classes . westwood marked the end of her berlin years with a glamorous fashion show displaying her students ' work .
the event called " copying and transforming old masters , " which was held on saturday at berlin 's nazi-era tempelhof airport , confirmed that westwood 's approach to fashion design as a contemporary re-reading of fashion history , has left a significant impression on her students . bildunterschrift : the students got a chance to display their designs in front of 1,500 guests in a snazzy , flashlight-illuminated happening that ended with standing ovations . an international panel of designers awarded prizes for the best student work .
making sure it would not all be " strictly business , " the evening ended with a farewell party in honor of the " queen of punk , " which lasted into the wee hours of the morning . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de proving that punk 's not dead it was a movement that was destined to live fast , die young .

the volkswagen beetle managed to shed its dark childhood and went on to become the world 's best-selling car . nearly 22 million beetles were produced between 1945 and 2003 , making it a global icon of affordable mobility after world war ii . but the story of the the car with the hump , the divided rear window and the characteristic sound of its air-cooled engine began much earlier : the first prototype of the " volkswagen " or " people 's car " was unveiled on july 3 , 1935 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beetle suspended as part of an art exhibition in sao paolo it became more than just a car : born during the nazi period in germany , later a symbol of the german economic miracle , a cult object of the hippie generation , a star in hollywood films and above all : the foundation stone for the vw company - today europe 's biggest carmaker . hitler 's car for the masses the story began in 1934 , a year after adolf hitler came to power , when the association of the german automobile industry commissioned car designer ferdinand porsche to construct a car for the masses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler spoke at the opening ceremony of the volkswagen car factory on may 26 , 1938 .
it was meant to be a car that was simple to build , cheap to buy and economical to maintain .
on july 3 , 1935 , after a year of development work , porsche presented the first prototype . " porsche has constructed a saloon car , an open car and a convertible that uses six to seven liters of fuel every 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- at a speed of 100 kph and costs only 990 marks , " the weekly news show at the movie theater reported at the time . another three years passed before the car was ready for production .
then , on may 28 , 1938 , near the town of fallersleben , adolf hitler laid the foundation stone for the volkswagen factory and with it for the town of wolfsburg . " today we are standing on the huge site of the volkswagen works , " a radio reporter said .
here , in accordance with the führer 's will , a gigantic factory that the world will talk about one day is to be built . " saved by the allies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the replica of herbie the love bug , the star of the wacky 1970s movie of the same name but it was not volkswagen cars but small military vehicles for hitler 's campaign of destruction that were assembled in the highly modern factory .
at the end of the war , the volkswagen factory , like most other german factories , was in ruins .
but it was saved from the fate of dismantlement by the allies .
on the contrary - the britons developed a soft spot for the beetle . " at the former volkswagen plant at fallersleben , cars are again being mass-produced , " went a news report .
" some 18,000 workers are in the factory and its subsidiary plants .
orders and raw materials have been secured for a long time .
the cars will at first be distributed by the military authorities to the departments of the occupying powers and to vital german companies . " a global icon bildunterschrift : beetle at the beach only then did the success story of the vw beetle begin in earnest .
in a matter of 10 years - between 1945 and 1955 - one million vehicles were produced .
in 1972 , the 15-million mark was reached , making the vw beetle the world 's biggest-selling car . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the very last vw beetle is decorated with a wreath of roses and a message on its windscreen which reads " volkswagen of mexico last sedan in the world , july 30 , 2003 " as it rolls off the production line at vw 's puebla plant .
but just a few years later , the beginning of the end had started for the global icon of affordable mobility after world war ii .
no more beetles were manufactured in germany after 1978 and vw gradually also halted production in factories abroad .
everywhere except puebla in mexico , where the cars rolled off the production line until the year 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new beetle : less noisy , more stylish the last 2,000 beetles paid tribute to their ancestors : they again had chrome parts , white-walled tyres and were painted light blue or cream-white – just like the successful models of the 1950s .

pischetsrieder has put the building plans on ice until the allegations of bribes in connection with the construction of the plant have been cleared up , the newspaper said , quoting sources close to suppliers . berlin daily tagesspiegel reported that the planned construction of an assembly plant in angola had also been put on hold in the wake of the scandal .
both papers said vw had declined to comment on the information .
the scandal , triggered by the shock resignation last month of the personnel chief at vw 's czech arm skoda , helmuth schuster , looks set to snowball in what threatens to deal a fresh blow to the image of europe 's biggest car maker just as it is beginning to steer itself out a long crisis .
vw is hiring independent auditors kpmg to review the situation .
schuster last month quit amid allegations he took bribes from potential suppliers and claims in magazine reports that he used camouflage companies to secure lucrative vw contracts abroad , notably india and angola .

some criminals actually serve themselves up to investigators on a silver platter . imagine you were a thief who really wanted to get caught .
what would you do after a successful robbery ? as a traditionalist , you could always return to the scene , reinforcing the old stereotype that criminals are magically drawn to the place where they committed their crime . but in the age of digital media and mobile technologies , that would n't be necessary .
you could , for instance , make a wanted poster with your picture on it . that is pretty much what a 17-year old did after stealing a digital camera and some money from a construction site in the northern german town of rendsburg .
confirming , yet again , that teenagers have an exceedingly short attention span , the young man took several photos , including some of himself .
then he simply tossed away the camera without erasing the photos from its memory . " we do n't know if it -lrb- what happened -rrb- was a series of unfortunate events or whether the thief could n't get to grips with the technology , " a police spokesperson said in a statement on monday . the evidence was compelling enough that the offender had no choice but to come clean . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " click here for a selection dw-world 's " and finally ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 04.07.2005 star designer leaves berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the queen of punk bids adieu sometimes she made her students cry , but she also inspired them to be bold and inventive .
the quirkiest and loudest of all iconic designers , vivienne westwood , has left berlin , where she taught for the past 12 years . after 12 years of teaching at berlin 's university of the arts , educating new generations of fashion designers and raising general hell , the uk-born star designer and germany 's other famous vw , vivienne westwood , bid farewell to the german capital . while continuing her design work , westwood is planning to devote more of her time to political engagements and literary projects . appearing at a press-conference in berlin on friday , the 64- year-old , with her trademark carrot orange hair and enough spunk to put some of her younger colleagues to shame , wore a t-shirt with the word " liberty " scrawled above the drawing of a heart behind bars . " there is no culture without justice before the law , " said westwood in a public display of support for the independent human rights organization " liberty , " whose mission is to protect civil liberties and promote human rights across the globe . when asked about fashion today , she attacked the predominant mass-consumerist style that leaves little space for innovation and creativity . " the world has become so americanized that people look uglier than before .
the more you consume , the less you think .
people should buy less , " she said . bildunterschrift : blabla end of an era westwood has been provoking the fashion world since the 70s , when she designed outfits for british rock punk band , the sex pistols . when she moved to berlin in 1993 , she quickly immersed herself in the post-wall , urban renewal of the city 's artistic scene and is responsible for strengthening berlin 's growing reputation as a fashion metropolis . with its annual b-in-berlin and bread and butter fashion shows , the german capital is now providing serious competition to cities like düsseldorf .
low rents and a vibrant , colorful arts scene has attracted lots of fashion talent in recent years to berlin . " it is easy to get things going in berlin , " westwood said , praising both the creative atmosphere of the german capital as well as her students ' intellectual and artistic curiosity . " whenever i went to a museum , i would run into one of them -lrb- the students -rrb- , " she said .
but , westwood is also said to be a hard taskmaster , with reports of students breaking into tears at some of her fashion classes . westwood marked the end of her berlin years with a glamorous fashion show displaying her students ' work .
the event called " copying and transforming old masters , " which was held on saturday at berlin 's nazi-era tempelhof airport , confirmed that westwood 's approach to fashion design as a contemporary re-reading of fashion history , has left a significant impression on her students . bildunterschrift : the students got a chance to display their designs in front of 1,500 guests in a snazzy , flashlight-illuminated happening that ended with standing ovations . an international panel of designers awarded prizes for the best student work .
making sure it would not all be " strictly business , " the evening ended with a farewell party in honor of the " queen of punk , " which lasted into the wee hours of the morning . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de proving that punk 's not dead it was a movement that was destined to live fast , die young .

the volkswagen beetle managed to shed its dark childhood and went on to become the world 's best-selling car . nearly 22 million beetles were produced between 1945 and 2003 , making it a global icon of affordable mobility after world war ii . but the story of the the car with the hump , the divided rear window and the characteristic sound of its air-cooled engine began much earlier : the first prototype of the " volkswagen " or " people 's car " was unveiled on july 3 , 1935 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beetle suspended as part of an art exhibition in sao paolo it became more than just a car : born during the nazi period in germany , later a symbol of the german economic miracle , a cult object of the hippie generation , a star in hollywood films and above all : the foundation stone for the vw company - today europe 's biggest carmaker . hitler 's car for the masses the story began in 1934 , a year after adolf hitler came to power , when the association of the german automobile industry commissioned car designer ferdinand porsche to construct a car for the masses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler spoke at the opening ceremony of the volkswagen car factory on may 26 , 1938 .
it was meant to be a car that was simple to build , cheap to buy and economical to maintain .
on july 3 , 1935 , after a year of development work , porsche presented the first prototype . " porsche has constructed a saloon car , an open car and a convertible that uses six to seven liters of fuel every 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- at a speed of 100 kph and costs only 990 marks , " the weekly news show at the movie theater reported at the time . another three years passed before the car was ready for production .
then , on may 28 , 1938 , near the town of fallersleben , adolf hitler laid the foundation stone for the volkswagen factory and with it for the town of wolfsburg . " today we are standing on the huge site of the volkswagen works , " a radio reporter said .
here , in accordance with the führer 's will , a gigantic factory that the world will talk about one day is to be built . " saved by the allies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the replica of herbie the love bug , the star of the wacky 1970s movie of the same name but it was not volkswagen cars but small military vehicles for hitler 's campaign of destruction that were assembled in the highly modern factory .
at the end of the war , the volkswagen factory , like most other german factories , was in ruins .
but it was saved from the fate of dismantlement by the allies .
on the contrary - the britons developed a soft spot for the beetle . " at the former volkswagen plant at fallersleben , cars are again being mass-produced , " went a news report .
" some 18,000 workers are in the factory and its subsidiary plants .
orders and raw materials have been secured for a long time .
the cars will at first be distributed by the military authorities to the departments of the occupying powers and to vital german companies . " a global icon bildunterschrift : beetle at the beach only then did the success story of the vw beetle begin in earnest .
in a matter of 10 years - between 1945 and 1955 - one million vehicles were produced .
in 1972 , the 15-million mark was reached , making the vw beetle the world 's biggest-selling car . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the very last vw beetle is decorated with a wreath of roses and a message on its windscreen which reads " volkswagen of mexico last sedan in the world , july 30 , 2003 " as it rolls off the production line at vw 's puebla plant .
but just a few years later , the beginning of the end had started for the global icon of affordable mobility after world war ii .
no more beetles were manufactured in germany after 1978 and vw gradually also halted production in factories abroad .
everywhere except puebla in mexico , where the cars rolled off the production line until the year 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new beetle : less noisy , more stylish the last 2,000 beetles paid tribute to their ancestors : they again had chrome parts , white-walled tyres and were painted light blue or cream-white – just like the successful models of the 1950s .

german chancellor gerhard schröder is bringing along a few other topics as well . the g8 meeting at the gleneagles luxury resort in the scottish highlands could well be schröder 's last as he likely faces a tough reelection battle in september .
the three-day summit , which begins wednesday , is expected to cost about 140 million euros -lrb- $ 167 million -rrb- and will largely focus on debt relief and development aid for the world 's poorest nations if british premier tony blair gets his way . " on africa i think there is a real and common desire to help that troubled continent come out of the poverty and deprivation which so many millions of its people suffer , " blair said during a recent meeting with us president george w. bush to prepare the summit .
" in a situation where literally thousands of children die from preventable diseases every day , it is our duty to act and we will . " g8 finance ministers recently agreed to scrap about $ 55 million in debt owed by 40 of the world 's poorest nations .
it 's a step backed by bush . bildunterschrift : a child stands outside squatter shacks watching the rising waters of the jukskei river in the alexandra township north of johannesburg , south africa " we ... agree that highly indebted developing countries that are on the path to reform should not be burdened by mountains of debt , " bush said at a joint news conference with blair .
" our countries are developing a proposal for the g8 that will eliminate 100 percent of that debt and that , by providing additional resources , will preserve the financial integrity of the world bank and the african development bank . "
no new marshall plan ? but bush is less willing to back a second proposal by blair to set up a " marshall plan for africa , " which would double aid to the continent to $ 50 billion a year .
saying that many countries are simply not able to handle additional aid , germany 's government also opposes the increase while hailing the debt relief as a visionary step . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphaned children write on a blackboard in a school at the sos childrens village in bakoteh , gambia " i think that 's a seminal development , " said german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul .
" it 's a sign of g8 leadership .
debt relief has already helped developing countries to increase their spending on education and fighting diseases such as aids ... it shows what 's possible . " clashing over climate control protecting global climate is a second topic where blair and bush are likely to clash .
the american still sees no relation between global warming and air pollution .
it 's unlikely that leaders will reach a consensus at the summit - or present a document that will lack bush 's signature . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no connection between air pollution and global warming ?
nevertheless , a paper on climate control goals developed by multinational companies at blair 's request will be interesting .
deutsche bank , british petroleum , canadian aluminum giant alcan , ford , hewlett packard , cisco systems , lukoil as well as firms from south africa , brazil and india participated . schröder 's own agenda despite this , the global economy is likely to play a small role at the meeting .
but in light of the recent record prices for oil , germany 's chancellor gerhard schröder plans to push for a g8 initiative for more transparency on the oil markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stock trader at frankfurt 's stock market this way , he hopes to limit price speculation - one of the main reasons for the swift rise .
schröder also wants to bring about global standards for hedge funds . " the short-term interest of some hedge funds in germany has recently raised some questions , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 04.07.2005 new topics pile up on g8 agenda großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " gerhard , forget about hedge funds , let 's talk about africa " leaders of the wealthiest countries gather in scotland this week and britain 's tony blair has put debt relief high on the program .
german chancellor gerhard schröder is bringing along a few other topics as well . the g8 meeting at the gleneagles luxury resort in the scottish highlands could well be schröder 's last as he likely faces a tough reelection battle in september .
the three-day summit , which begins wednesday , is expected to cost about 140 million euros -lrb- $ 167 million -rrb- and will largely focus on debt relief and development aid for the world 's poorest nations if british premier tony blair gets his way . " on africa i think there is a real and common desire to help that troubled continent come out of the poverty and deprivation which so many millions of its people suffer , " blair said during a recent meeting with us president george w. bush to prepare the summit .
" in a situation where literally thousands of children die from preventable diseases every day , it is our duty to act and we will . " g8 finance ministers recently agreed to scrap about $ 55 million in debt owed by 40 of the world 's poorest nations .
it 's a step backed by bush . bildunterschrift : a child stands outside squatter shacks watching the rising waters of the jukskei river in the alexandra township north of johannesburg , south africa " we ... agree that highly indebted developing countries that are on the path to reform should not be burdened by mountains of debt , " bush said at a joint news conference with blair .
" our countries are developing a proposal for the g8 that will eliminate 100 percent of that debt and that , by providing additional resources , will preserve the financial integrity of the world bank and the african development bank . "
no new marshall plan ? but bush is less willing to back a second proposal by blair to set up a " marshall plan for africa , " which would double aid to the continent to $ 50 billion a year .
saying that many countries are simply not able to handle additional aid , germany 's government also opposes the increase while hailing the debt relief as a visionary step . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphaned children write on a blackboard in a school at the sos childrens village in bakoteh , gambia " i think that 's a seminal development , " said german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul .
" it 's a sign of g8 leadership .
debt relief has already helped developing countries to increase their spending on education and fighting diseases such as aids ... it shows what 's possible . " clashing over climate control protecting global climate is a second topic where blair and bush are likely to clash .
the american still sees no relation between global warming and air pollution .
it 's unlikely that leaders will reach a consensus at the summit - or present a document that will lack bush 's signature . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no connection between air pollution and global warming ?
nevertheless , a paper on climate control goals developed by multinational companies at blair 's request will be interesting .
deutsche bank , british petroleum , canadian aluminum giant alcan , ford , hewlett packard , cisco systems , lukoil as well as firms from south africa , brazil and india participated . schröder 's own agenda despite this , the global economy is likely to play a small role at the meeting .
but in light of the recent record prices for oil , germany 's chancellor gerhard schröder plans to push for a g8 initiative for more transparency on the oil markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stock trader at frankfurt 's stock market this way , he hopes to limit price speculation - one of the main reasons for the swift rise .
schröder also wants to bring about global standards for hedge funds . " the short-term interest of some hedge funds in germany has recently raised some questions , " he said .
" that 's why we 're currently looking at the criteria that allow these funds to operate in our country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.07.2005 einstein ambiguous about the bomb großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : einstein smoking his peace pipe , although not without reservations previously unpublished letters by albert einstein to a japanese pen pal show the physicist to be torn and defensive over the atomic bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki which became possible partly through his genius . the widow of seiei shinohara , a philosopher and german-japanese translator who corresponded with einstein in the last years of the famed german scientist 's life , has chosen to go public with the letters on the 60th anniversary of the world 's only nuclear attacks . einstein 's opposition to nuclear warfare has already been documented , but his letters to shinohara also show him defending himself on a personal level and trying to reconcile his pacifism . the correspondence began in 1953 when shinohara sent a letter to einstein criticizing the physicist over his role in developing nuclear weapons . einstein responded by hand on the back of the typed letter , beginning his rebuttal without bothering to offer greetings . a defensive genius " i have always condemned the use of the atomic bomb against japan but i could not do anything at all to prevent that fateful decision , " einstein wrote in german to shinohara in a letter dated june 23 , 1953 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theory of relativity ?
a piece of cake -lrb- for einstein , that is -rrb- 2005 has been designated as the " einstein year " to mark the centennial of einstein 's theory of relativity and his overall contribution to physics .
he argued that distance and time are not absolute , leading to his most famous formula , e = mc2 , essential for the development of the atomic bombs dropped on japan by the united states . the hiroshima bombing killed around 140,000 people - almost half the city population at the time - immediately or in the months afterward from radiation injuries or horrific burns . more than 70,000 more people died three days later in the bombing of nagasaki .
after six days emperor hirohito went on the radio for the first time to announce the surrender of japan , which since the war has campaigned to abolish nuclear weapons . " the only consolation , it seems to me , in the development of nuclear bombs is that this time the deterrent effect will prevail and the development of international security will accelerate , " einstein wrote in another letter . a pacifist who believed in the just war but einstein , whose jewish origins led him to flee germany in 1933 for the united states , after adolf hitler came to power , also said that war was sometimes acceptable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the force of nuclear destruction : hiroshima , 1945 " i did n't write that i was an absolute pacifist but that i have always been a convinced pacifist .
that means there are circumstances in which in my opinion it is necessary to use force , " he wrote . " such a case would be when i face an opponent whose unconditional aim is to destroy me and my people , " he said . " therefore the use of force against nazi germany was in my opinion justified and necessary . " shinohara , who studied philosophy in germany before returning to tokyo in 1947 , died of a stroke in 2001 at age 89 .
his letters have since been kept in private by his widow , nobuko shinohara . the correspondence ended in july 1954 , a year before einstein died , dashing shinohara 's dream to meet the physicist face to face .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.07.2005 -pipe- 12:00 utc vw postpones expansion due to scandal the bribery scandal at german auto giant volkswagen has led chairman bernd pischetsrieder to postpone making a decision on the planned construction of a new factory in india , the business daily handelsblatt reported on monday .
pischetsrieder has put the building plans on ice until the allegations of bribes in connection with the construction of the plant have been cleared up , the newspaper said , quoting sources close to suppliers . berlin daily tagesspiegel reported that the planned construction of an assembly plant in angola had also been put on hold in the wake of the scandal .
both papers said vw had declined to comment on the information .
the scandal , triggered by the shock resignation last month of the personnel chief at vw 's czech arm skoda , helmuth schuster , looks set to snowball in what threatens to deal a fresh blow to the image of europe 's biggest car maker just as it is beginning to steer itself out a long crisis .
vw is hiring independent auditors kpmg to review the situation .
schuster last month quit amid allegations he took bribes from potential suppliers and claims in magazine reports that he used camouflage companies to secure lucrative vw contracts abroad , notably india and angola .
but the scandal looked set to widen last week when the long-serving head of vw 's general works council , klaus volkert , also announced he was stepping down nine months earlier than planned .
the online version of der spiegel magazine alleged that volkert was also involved in schuster 's dubious dealings .
wirtschaftswoche weekly claimed volkert was simply the " tip of the iceberg " and more resignations would follow , including that of vw 's head of personnel , peter hartz . dw-world.de vw faces bribery scandal the head of the general works council at german car giant volkswagen has stepped down in the midst of an alleged bribery scandal , while rumors about the larger scope of the affair begin to circulate .

the scandal , triggered by the shock resignation last month of the personnel chief at vw 's czech arm skoda , helmuth schuster , looks set to snowball in what threatens to deal a fresh blow to the image of europe 's biggest car maker just as it is beginning to steer itself out a long crisis .
vw is hiring independent auditors kpmg to review the situation .
schuster last month quit amid allegations he took bribes from potential suppliers and claims in magazine reports that he used camouflage companies to secure lucrative vw contracts abroad , notably india and angola .
but the scandal looked set to widen last week when the long-serving head of vw 's general works council , klaus volkert , also announced he was stepping down nine months earlier than planned .
the online version of der spiegel magazine alleged that volkert was also involved in schuster 's dubious dealings .
wirtschaftswoche weekly claimed volkert was simply the " tip of the iceberg " and more resignations would follow , including that of vw 's head of personnel , peter hartz . dw-world.de vw faces bribery scandal the head of the general works council at german car giant volkswagen has stepped down in the midst of an alleged bribery scandal , while rumors about the larger scope of the affair begin to circulate .

a country needs to maintain a rate of 2.1 to maintain its population . dw-world.de " having children is n't sexy in germany " dwindling pensions and falling birth rates in germany means the country needs more children .

the quirkiest and loudest of all iconic designers , vivienne westwood , has left berlin , where she taught for the past 12 years . after 12 years of teaching at berlin 's university of the arts , educating new generations of fashion designers and raising general hell , the uk-born star designer and germany 's other famous vw , vivienne westwood , bid farewell to the german capital . while continuing her design work , westwood is planning to devote more of her time to political engagements and literary projects . appearing at a press-conference in berlin on friday , the 64- year-old , with her trademark carrot orange hair and enough spunk to put some of her younger colleagues to shame , wore a t-shirt with the word " liberty " scrawled above the drawing of a heart behind bars . " there is no culture without justice before the law , " said westwood in a public display of support for the independent human rights organization " liberty , " whose mission is to protect civil liberties and promote human rights across the globe . when asked about fashion today , she attacked the predominant mass-consumerist style that leaves little space for innovation and creativity . " the world has become so americanized that people look uglier than before .
the more you consume , the less you think .
people should buy less , " she said . bildunterschrift : blabla end of an era westwood has been provoking the fashion world since the 70s , when she designed outfits for british rock punk band , the sex pistols . when she moved to berlin in 1993 , she quickly immersed herself in the post-wall , urban renewal of the city 's artistic scene and is responsible for strengthening berlin 's growing reputation as a fashion metropolis . with its annual b-in-berlin and bread and butter fashion shows , the german capital is now providing serious competition to cities like düsseldorf .
low rents and a vibrant , colorful arts scene has attracted lots of fashion talent in recent years to berlin . " it is easy to get things going in berlin , " westwood said , praising both the creative atmosphere of the german capital as well as her students ' intellectual and artistic curiosity . " whenever i went to a museum , i would run into one of them -lrb- the students -rrb- , " she said .
but , westwood is also said to be a hard taskmaster , with reports of students breaking into tears at some of her fashion classes . westwood marked the end of her berlin years with a glamorous fashion show displaying her students ' work .
the event called " copying and transforming old masters , " which was held on saturday at berlin 's nazi-era tempelhof airport , confirmed that westwood 's approach to fashion design as a contemporary re-reading of fashion history , has left a significant impression on her students . bildunterschrift : the students got a chance to display their designs in front of 1,500 guests in a snazzy , flashlight-illuminated happening that ended with standing ovations . an international panel of designers awarded prizes for the best student work .
making sure it would not all be " strictly business , " the evening ended with a farewell party in honor of the " queen of punk , " which lasted into the wee hours of the morning . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de proving that punk 's not dead it was a movement that was destined to live fast , die young .

the volkswagen beetle managed to shed its dark childhood and went on to become the world 's best-selling car . nearly 22 million beetles were produced between 1945 and 2003 , making it a global icon of affordable mobility after world war ii . but the story of the the car with the hump , the divided rear window and the characteristic sound of its air-cooled engine began much earlier : the first prototype of the " volkswagen " or " people 's car " was unveiled on july 3 , 1935 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beetle suspended as part of an art exhibition in sao paolo it became more than just a car : born during the nazi period in germany , later a symbol of the german economic miracle , a cult object of the hippie generation , a star in hollywood films and above all : the foundation stone for the vw company - today europe 's biggest carmaker . hitler 's car for the masses the story began in 1934 , a year after adolf hitler came to power , when the association of the german automobile industry commissioned car designer ferdinand porsche to construct a car for the masses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler spoke at the opening ceremony of the volkswagen car factory on may 26 , 1938 .
it was meant to be a car that was simple to build , cheap to buy and economical to maintain .

then , on may 28 , 1938 , near the town of fallersleben , adolf hitler laid the foundation stone for the volkswagen factory and with it for the town of wolfsburg . " today we are standing on the huge site of the volkswagen works , " a radio reporter said .

in a matter of 10 years - between 1945 and 1955 - one million vehicles were produced .
in 1972 , the 15-million mark was reached , making the vw beetle the world 's biggest-selling car . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the very last vw beetle is decorated with a wreath of roses and a message on its windscreen which reads " volkswagen of mexico last sedan in the world , july 30 , 2003 " as it rolls off the production line at vw 's puebla plant .
but just a few years later , the beginning of the end had started for the global icon of affordable mobility after world war ii .
no more beetles were manufactured in germany after 1978 and vw gradually also halted production in factories abroad .
everywhere except puebla in mexico , where the cars rolled off the production line until the year 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new beetle : less noisy , more stylish the last 2,000 beetles paid tribute to their ancestors : they again had chrome parts , white-walled tyres and were painted light blue or cream-white – just like the successful models of the 1950s .

the quirkiest and loudest of all iconic designers , vivienne westwood , has left berlin , where she taught for the past 12 years . after 12 years of teaching at berlin 's university of the arts , educating new generations of fashion designers and raising general hell , the uk-born star designer and germany 's other famous vw , vivienne westwood , bid farewell to the german capital . while continuing her design work , westwood is planning to devote more of her time to political engagements and literary projects . appearing at a press-conference in berlin on friday , the 64- year-old , with her trademark carrot orange hair and enough spunk to put some of her younger colleagues to shame , wore a t-shirt with the word " liberty " scrawled above the drawing of a heart behind bars . " there is no culture without justice before the law , " said westwood in a public display of support for the independent human rights organization " liberty , " whose mission is to protect civil liberties and promote human rights across the globe . when asked about fashion today , she attacked the predominant mass-consumerist style that leaves little space for innovation and creativity . " the world has become so americanized that people look uglier than before .

" whenever i went to a museum , i would run into one of them -lrb- the students -rrb- , " she said .

the event called " copying and transforming old masters , " which was held on saturday at berlin 's nazi-era tempelhof airport , confirmed that westwood 's approach to fashion design as a contemporary re-reading of fashion history , has left a significant impression on her students . bildunterschrift : the students got a chance to display their designs in front of 1,500 guests in a snazzy , flashlight-illuminated happening that ended with standing ovations . an international panel of designers awarded prizes for the best student work .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.07.2005 -pipe- 12:00 utc vw postpones expansion due to scandal the bribery scandal at german auto giant volkswagen has led chairman bernd pischetsrieder to postpone making a decision on the planned construction of a new factory in india , the business daily handelsblatt reported on monday .
pischetsrieder has put the building plans on ice until the allegations of bribes in connection with the construction of the plant have been cleared up , the newspaper said , quoting sources close to suppliers . berlin daily tagesspiegel reported that the planned construction of an assembly plant in angola had also been put on hold in the wake of the scandal .
both papers said vw had declined to comment on the information .
the scandal , triggered by the shock resignation last month of the personnel chief at vw 's czech arm skoda , helmuth schuster , looks set to snowball in what threatens to deal a fresh blow to the image of europe 's biggest car maker just as it is beginning to steer itself out a long crisis .
vw is hiring independent auditors kpmg to review the situation .
schuster last month quit amid allegations he took bribes from potential suppliers and claims in magazine reports that he used camouflage companies to secure lucrative vw contracts abroad , notably india and angola .
but the scandal looked set to widen last week when the long-serving head of vw 's general works council , klaus volkert , also announced he was stepping down nine months earlier than planned .
the online version of der spiegel magazine alleged that volkert was also involved in schuster 's dubious dealings .

german chancellor gerhard schröder is bringing along a few other topics as well . the g8 meeting at the gleneagles luxury resort in the scottish highlands could well be schröder 's last as he likely faces a tough reelection battle in september .
the three-day summit , which begins wednesday , is expected to cost about 140 million euros -lrb- $ 167 million -rrb- and will largely focus on debt relief and development aid for the world 's poorest nations if british premier tony blair gets his way . " on africa i think there is a real and common desire to help that troubled continent come out of the poverty and deprivation which so many millions of its people suffer , " blair said during a recent meeting with us president george w. bush to prepare the summit .
" in a situation where literally thousands of children die from preventable diseases every day , it is our duty to act and we will . " g8 finance ministers recently agreed to scrap about $ 55 million in debt owed by 40 of the world 's poorest nations .
it 's a step backed by bush . bildunterschrift : a child stands outside squatter shacks watching the rising waters of the jukskei river in the alexandra township north of johannesburg , south africa " we ... agree that highly indebted developing countries that are on the path to reform should not be burdened by mountains of debt , " bush said at a joint news conference with blair .
" our countries are developing a proposal for the g8 that will eliminate 100 percent of that debt and that , by providing additional resources , will preserve the financial integrity of the world bank and the african development bank . "
no new marshall plan ? but bush is less willing to back a second proposal by blair to set up a " marshall plan for africa , " which would double aid to the continent to $ 50 billion a year .
saying that many countries are simply not able to handle additional aid , germany 's government also opposes the increase while hailing the debt relief as a visionary step . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphaned children write on a blackboard in a school at the sos childrens village in bakoteh , gambia " i think that 's a seminal development , " said german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul .
" it 's a sign of g8 leadership .
debt relief has already helped developing countries to increase their spending on education and fighting diseases such as aids ... it shows what 's possible . " clashing over climate control protecting global climate is a second topic where blair and bush are likely to clash .
the american still sees no relation between global warming and air pollution .
it 's unlikely that leaders will reach a consensus at the summit - or present a document that will lack bush 's signature . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no connection between air pollution and global warming ?
nevertheless , a paper on climate control goals developed by multinational companies at blair 's request will be interesting .
deutsche bank , british petroleum , canadian aluminum giant alcan , ford , hewlett packard , cisco systems , lukoil as well as firms from south africa , brazil and india participated . schröder 's own agenda despite this , the global economy is likely to play a small role at the meeting .
but in light of the recent record prices for oil , germany 's chancellor gerhard schröder plans to push for a g8 initiative for more transparency on the oil markets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stock trader at frankfurt 's stock market this way , he hopes to limit price speculation - one of the main reasons for the swift rise .
schröder also wants to bring about global standards for hedge funds . " the short-term interest of some hedge funds in germany has recently raised some questions , " he said .
" that 's why we 're currently looking at the criteria that allow these funds to operate in our country .

-lrb- july 3 , 2005 -rrb- g8 scrap debt of poorest nations the finance ministers of the world 's eight wealthiest nations agreed saturday on a deal for immediate 100 percent multilateral debt relief totaling $ 40 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- for 18 of the world 's poorest countries .

the quirkiest and loudest of all iconic designers , vivienne westwood , has left berlin , where she taught for the past 12 years . after 12 years of teaching at berlin 's university of the arts , educating new generations of fashion designers and raising general hell , the uk-born star designer and germany 's other famous vw , vivienne westwood , bid farewell to the german capital . while continuing her design work , westwood is planning to devote more of her time to political engagements and literary projects . appearing at a press-conference in berlin on friday , the 64- year-old , with her trademark carrot orange hair and enough spunk to put some of her younger colleagues to shame , wore a t-shirt with the word " liberty " scrawled above the drawing of a heart behind bars . " there is no culture without justice before the law , " said westwood in a public display of support for the independent human rights organization " liberty , " whose mission is to protect civil liberties and promote human rights across the globe . when asked about fashion today , she attacked the predominant mass-consumerist style that leaves little space for innovation and creativity . " the world has become so americanized that people look uglier than before .
the more you consume , the less you think .
people should buy less , " she said . bildunterschrift : blabla end of an era westwood has been provoking the fashion world since the 70s , when she designed outfits for british rock punk band , the sex pistols . when she moved to berlin in 1993 , she quickly immersed herself in the post-wall , urban renewal of the city 's artistic scene and is responsible for strengthening berlin 's growing reputation as a fashion metropolis . with its annual b-in-berlin and bread and butter fashion shows , the german capital is now providing serious competition to cities like düsseldorf .

german chancellor gerhard schröder is bringing along a few other topics as well . the g8 meeting at the gleneagles luxury resort in the scottish highlands could well be schröder 's last as he likely faces a tough reelection battle in september .
the three-day summit , which begins wednesday , is expected to cost about 140 million euros -lrb- $ 167 million -rrb- and will largely focus on debt relief and development aid for the world 's poorest nations if british premier tony blair gets his way . " on africa i think there is a real and common desire to help that troubled continent come out of the poverty and deprivation which so many millions of its people suffer , " blair said during a recent meeting with us president george w. bush to prepare the summit .
" in a situation where literally thousands of children die from preventable diseases every day , it is our duty to act and we will . " g8 finance ministers recently agreed to scrap about $ 55 million in debt owed by 40 of the world 's poorest nations .
it 's a step backed by bush . bildunterschrift : a child stands outside squatter shacks watching the rising waters of the jukskei river in the alexandra township north of johannesburg , south africa " we ... agree that highly indebted developing countries that are on the path to reform should not be burdened by mountains of debt , " bush said at a joint news conference with blair .
" our countries are developing a proposal for the g8 that will eliminate 100 percent of that debt and that , by providing additional resources , will preserve the financial integrity of the world bank and the african development bank . "
no new marshall plan ? but bush is less willing to back a second proposal by blair to set up a " marshall plan for africa , " which would double aid to the continent to $ 50 billion a year .
saying that many countries are simply not able to handle additional aid , germany 's government also opposes the increase while hailing the debt relief as a visionary step . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphaned children write on a blackboard in a school at the sos childrens village in bakoteh , gambia " i think that 's a seminal development , " said german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul .

it 's unlikely that leaders will reach a consensus at the summit - or present a document that will lack bush 's signature . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no connection between air pollution and global warming ?
nevertheless , a paper on climate control goals developed by multinational companies at blair 's request will be interesting .
deutsche bank , british petroleum , canadian aluminum giant alcan , ford , hewlett packard , cisco systems , lukoil as well as firms from south africa , brazil and india participated . schröder 's own agenda despite this , the global economy is likely to play a small role at the meeting .

a piece of cake -lrb- for einstein , that is -rrb- 2005 has been designated as the " einstein year " to mark the centennial of einstein 's theory of relativity and his overall contribution to physics .
he argued that distance and time are not absolute , leading to his most famous formula , e = mc2 , essential for the development of the atomic bombs dropped on japan by the united states . the hiroshima bombing killed around 140,000 people - almost half the city population at the time - immediately or in the months afterward from radiation injuries or horrific burns . more than 70,000 more people died three days later in the bombing of nagasaki .
after six days emperor hirohito went on the radio for the first time to announce the surrender of japan , which since the war has campaigned to abolish nuclear weapons . " the only consolation , it seems to me , in the development of nuclear bombs is that this time the deterrent effect will prevail and the development of international security will accelerate , " einstein wrote in another letter . a pacifist who believed in the just war but einstein , whose jewish origins led him to flee germany in 1933 for the united states , after adolf hitler came to power , also said that war was sometimes acceptable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the force of nuclear destruction : hiroshima , 1945 " i did n't write that i was an absolute pacifist but that i have always been a convinced pacifist .
that means there are circumstances in which in my opinion it is necessary to use force , " he wrote . " such a case would be when i face an opponent whose unconditional aim is to destroy me and my people , " he said . " therefore the use of force against nazi germany was in my opinion justified and necessary . " shinohara , who studied philosophy in germany before returning to tokyo in 1947 , died of a stroke in 2001 at age 89 .
his letters have since been kept in private by his widow , nobuko shinohara . the correspondence ended in july 1954 , a year before einstein died , dashing shinohara 's dream to meet the physicist face to face . " my husband first sent the letter with anger and i guess dr. einstein replied with annoyance , " said shinohara , 80 . " but later dr. einstein and my husband formed a friendship through exchanging letters , " she said . several museums have already made requests seeking the letters for their collections , according to yutaka sakuma , a lawyer handling the papers . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de exploring einstein 's laboratory an exhibition organized by the max planck institute in berlin pays tribute to the scientist 100 years after he published his theory of relativity and 50 years since his death .
but the show goes much further than that .
-lrb- june 3 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : celebrating einstein everyone is familiar with his outstretched tongue , but when it comes to grasping the complexity of his ground-breaking theories in physics , einstein has most people tongue-tied .

some criminals actually serve themselves up to investigators on a silver platter . imagine you were a thief who really wanted to get caught .
what would you do after a successful robbery ? as a traditionalist , you could always return to the scene , reinforcing the old stereotype that criminals are magically drawn to the place where they committed their crime . but in the age of digital media and mobile technologies , that would n't be necessary .
you could , for instance , make a wanted poster with your picture on it . that is pretty much what a 17-year old did after stealing a digital camera and some money from a construction site in the northern german town of rendsburg .
confirming , yet again , that teenagers have an exceedingly short attention span , the young man took several photos , including some of himself .
then he simply tossed away the camera without erasing the photos from its memory . " we do n't know if it -lrb- what happened -rrb- was a series of unfortunate events or whether the thief could n't get to grips with the technology , " a police spokesperson said in a statement on monday . the evidence was compelling enough that the offender had no choice but to come clean . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " click here for a selection dw-world 's " and finally ...

pischetsrieder has put the building plans on ice until the allegations of bribes in connection with the construction of the plant have been cleared up , the newspaper said , quoting sources close to suppliers . berlin daily tagesspiegel reported that the planned construction of an assembly plant in angola had also been put on hold in the wake of the scandal .
both papers said vw had declined to comment on the information .
the scandal , triggered by the shock resignation last month of the personnel chief at vw 's czech arm skoda , helmuth schuster , looks set to snowball in what threatens to deal a fresh blow to the image of europe 's biggest car maker just as it is beginning to steer itself out a long crisis .
vw is hiring independent auditors kpmg to review the situation .
schuster last month quit amid allegations he took bribes from potential suppliers and claims in magazine reports that he used camouflage companies to secure lucrative vw contracts abroad , notably india and angola .
but the scandal looked set to widen last week when the long-serving head of vw 's general works council , klaus volkert , also announced he was stepping down nine months earlier than planned .
the online version of der spiegel magazine alleged that volkert was also involved in schuster 's dubious dealings .
wirtschaftswoche weekly claimed volkert was simply the " tip of the iceberg " and more resignations would follow , including that of vw 's head of personnel , peter hartz . dw-world.de vw faces bribery scandal the head of the general works council at german car giant volkswagen has stepped down in the midst of an alleged bribery scandal , while rumors about the larger scope of the affair begin to circulate .

the scandal , triggered by the shock resignation last month of the personnel chief at vw 's czech arm skoda , helmuth schuster , looks set to snowball in what threatens to deal a fresh blow to the image of europe 's biggest car maker just as it is beginning to steer itself out a long crisis .

the quirkiest and loudest of all iconic designers , vivienne westwood , has left berlin , where she taught for the past 12 years . after 12 years of teaching at berlin 's university of the arts , educating new generations of fashion designers and raising general hell , the uk-born star designer and germany 's other famous vw , vivienne westwood , bid farewell to the german capital . while continuing her design work , westwood is planning to devote more of her time to political engagements and literary projects . appearing at a press-conference in berlin on friday , the 64- year-old , with her trademark carrot orange hair and enough spunk to put some of her younger colleagues to shame , wore a t-shirt with the word " liberty " scrawled above the drawing of a heart behind bars . " there is no culture without justice before the law , " said westwood in a public display of support for the independent human rights organization " liberty , " whose mission is to protect civil liberties and promote human rights across the globe . when asked about fashion today , she attacked the predominant mass-consumerist style that leaves little space for innovation and creativity . " the world has become so americanized that people look uglier than before .
the more you consume , the less you think .
people should buy less , " she said . bildunterschrift : blabla end of an era westwood has been provoking the fashion world since the 70s , when she designed outfits for british rock punk band , the sex pistols . when she moved to berlin in 1993 , she quickly immersed herself in the post-wall , urban renewal of the city 's artistic scene and is responsible for strengthening berlin 's growing reputation as a fashion metropolis . with its annual b-in-berlin and bread and butter fashion shows , the german capital is now providing serious competition to cities like düsseldorf .
low rents and a vibrant , colorful arts scene has attracted lots of fashion talent in recent years to berlin . " it is easy to get things going in berlin , " westwood said , praising both the creative atmosphere of the german capital as well as her students ' intellectual and artistic curiosity . " whenever i went to a museum , i would run into one of them -lrb- the students -rrb- , " she said .
but , westwood is also said to be a hard taskmaster , with reports of students breaking into tears at some of her fashion classes . westwood marked the end of her berlin years with a glamorous fashion show displaying her students ' work .
the event called " copying and transforming old masters , " which was held on saturday at berlin 's nazi-era tempelhof airport , confirmed that westwood 's approach to fashion design as a contemporary re-reading of fashion history , has left a significant impression on her students . bildunterschrift : the students got a chance to display their designs in front of 1,500 guests in a snazzy , flashlight-illuminated happening that ended with standing ovations . an international panel of designers awarded prizes for the best student work .
making sure it would not all be " strictly business , " the evening ended with a farewell party in honor of the " queen of punk , " which lasted into the wee hours of the morning . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de proving that punk 's not dead it was a movement that was destined to live fast , die young .

he argued that distance and time are not absolute , leading to his most famous formula , e = mc2 , essential for the development of the atomic bombs dropped on japan by the united states . the hiroshima bombing killed around 140,000 people - almost half the city population at the time - immediately or in the months afterward from radiation injuries or horrific burns . more than 70,000 more people died three days later in the bombing of nagasaki .
after six days emperor hirohito went on the radio for the first time to announce the surrender of japan , which since the war has campaigned to abolish nuclear weapons . " the only consolation , it seems to me , in the development of nuclear bombs is that this time the deterrent effect will prevail and the development of international security will accelerate , " einstein wrote in another letter . a pacifist who believed in the just war but einstein , whose jewish origins led him to flee germany in 1933 for the united states , after adolf hitler came to power , also said that war was sometimes acceptable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the force of nuclear destruction : hiroshima , 1945 " i did n't write that i was an absolute pacifist but that i have always been a convinced pacifist .

" such a case would be when i face an opponent whose unconditional aim is to destroy me and my people , " he said . " therefore the use of force against nazi germany was in my opinion justified and necessary . " shinohara , who studied philosophy in germany before returning to tokyo in 1947 , died of a stroke in 2001 at age 89 .
his letters have since been kept in private by his widow , nobuko shinohara . the correspondence ended in july 1954 , a year before einstein died , dashing shinohara 's dream to meet the physicist face to face . " my husband first sent the letter with anger and i guess dr. einstein replied with annoyance , " said shinohara , 80 .

a piece of cake -lrb- for einstein , that is -rrb- 2005 has been designated as the " einstein year " to mark the centennial of einstein 's theory of relativity and his overall contribution to physics .
he argued that distance and time are not absolute , leading to his most famous formula , e = mc2 , essential for the development of the atomic bombs dropped on japan by the united states . the hiroshima bombing killed around 140,000 people - almost half the city population at the time - immediately or in the months afterward from radiation injuries or horrific burns . more than 70,000 more people died three days later in the bombing of nagasaki .
after six days emperor hirohito went on the radio for the first time to announce the surrender of japan , which since the war has campaigned to abolish nuclear weapons . " the only consolation , it seems to me , in the development of nuclear bombs is that this time the deterrent effect will prevail and the development of international security will accelerate , " einstein wrote in another letter . a pacifist who believed in the just war but einstein , whose jewish origins led him to flee germany in 1933 for the united states , after adolf hitler came to power , also said that war was sometimes acceptable . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the force of nuclear destruction : hiroshima , 1945 " i did n't write that i was an absolute pacifist but that i have always been a convinced pacifist .

german chancellor gerhard schröder is bringing along a few other topics as well . the g8 meeting at the gleneagles luxury resort in the scottish highlands could well be schröder 's last as he likely faces a tough reelection battle in september .
the three-day summit , which begins wednesday , is expected to cost about 140 million euros -lrb- $ 167 million -rrb- and will largely focus on debt relief and development aid for the world 's poorest nations if british premier tony blair gets his way . " on africa i think there is a real and common desire to help that troubled continent come out of the poverty and deprivation which so many millions of its people suffer , " blair said during a recent meeting with us president george w. bush to prepare the summit .
" in a situation where literally thousands of children die from preventable diseases every day , it is our duty to act and we will . " g8 finance ministers recently agreed to scrap about $ 55 million in debt owed by 40 of the world 's poorest nations .
it 's a step backed by bush . bildunterschrift : a child stands outside squatter shacks watching the rising waters of the jukskei river in the alexandra township north of johannesburg , south africa " we ... agree that highly indebted developing countries that are on the path to reform should not be burdened by mountains of debt , " bush said at a joint news conference with blair .
" our countries are developing a proposal for the g8 that will eliminate 100 percent of that debt and that , by providing additional resources , will preserve the financial integrity of the world bank and the african development bank . "
no new marshall plan ? but bush is less willing to back a second proposal by blair to set up a " marshall plan for africa , " which would double aid to the continent to $ 50 billion a year .
saying that many countries are simply not able to handle additional aid , germany 's government also opposes the increase while hailing the debt relief as a visionary step . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphaned children write on a blackboard in a school at the sos childrens village in bakoteh , gambia " i think that 's a seminal development , " said german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul .
" it 's a sign of g8 leadership .
debt relief has already helped developing countries to increase their spending on education and fighting diseases such as aids ... it shows what 's possible . " clashing over climate control protecting global climate is a second topic where blair and bush are likely to clash .

it 's unlikely that leaders will reach a consensus at the summit - or present a document that will lack bush 's signature . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no connection between air pollution and global warming ?
nevertheless , a paper on climate control goals developed by multinational companies at blair 's request will be interesting .
deutsche bank , british petroleum , canadian aluminum giant alcan , ford , hewlett packard , cisco systems , lukoil as well as firms from south africa , brazil and india participated . schröder 's own agenda despite this , the global economy is likely to play a small role at the meeting .

the volkswagen beetle managed to shed its dark childhood and went on to become the world 's best-selling car . nearly 22 million beetles were produced between 1945 and 2003 , making it a global icon of affordable mobility after world war ii . but the story of the the car with the hump , the divided rear window and the characteristic sound of its air-cooled engine began much earlier : the first prototype of the " volkswagen " or " people 's car " was unveiled on july 3 , 1935 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beetle suspended as part of an art exhibition in sao paolo it became more than just a car : born during the nazi period in germany , later a symbol of the german economic miracle , a cult object of the hippie generation , a star in hollywood films and above all : the foundation stone for the vw company - today europe 's biggest carmaker . hitler 's car for the masses the story began in 1934 , a year after adolf hitler came to power , when the association of the german automobile industry commissioned car designer ferdinand porsche to construct a car for the masses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitler spoke at the opening ceremony of the volkswagen car factory on may 26 , 1938 .
it was meant to be a car that was simple to build , cheap to buy and economical to maintain .
on july 3 , 1935 , after a year of development work , porsche presented the first prototype . " porsche has constructed a saloon car , an open car and a convertible that uses six to seven liters of fuel every 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- at a speed of 100 kph and costs only 990 marks , " the weekly news show at the movie theater reported at the time . another three years passed before the car was ready for production .
then , on may 28 , 1938 , near the town of fallersleben , adolf hitler laid the foundation stone for the volkswagen factory and with it for the town of wolfsburg . " today we are standing on the huge site of the volkswagen works , " a radio reporter said .
here , in accordance with the führer 's will , a gigantic factory that the world will talk about one day is to be built . " saved by the allies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the replica of herbie the love bug , the star of the wacky 1970s movie of the same name but it was not volkswagen cars but small military vehicles for hitler 's campaign of destruction that were assembled in the highly modern factory .
at the end of the war , the volkswagen factory , like most other german factories , was in ruins .
but it was saved from the fate of dismantlement by the allies .
on the contrary - the britons developed a soft spot for the beetle . " at the former volkswagen plant at fallersleben , cars are again being mass-produced , " went a news report .
" some 18,000 workers are in the factory and its subsidiary plants .
orders and raw materials have been secured for a long time .
the cars will at first be distributed by the military authorities to the departments of the occupying powers and to vital german companies . " a global icon bildunterschrift : beetle at the beach only then did the success story of the vw beetle begin in earnest .
in a matter of 10 years - between 1945 and 1955 - one million vehicles were produced .
in 1972 , the 15-million mark was reached , making the vw beetle the world 's biggest-selling car . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the very last vw beetle is decorated with a wreath of roses and a message on its windscreen which reads " volkswagen of mexico last sedan in the world , july 30 , 2003 " as it rolls off the production line at vw 's puebla plant .
but just a few years later , the beginning of the end had started for the global icon of affordable mobility after world war ii .
no more beetles were manufactured in germany after 1978 and vw gradually also halted production in factories abroad .
everywhere except puebla in mexico , where the cars rolled off the production line until the year 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new beetle : less noisy , more stylish the last 2,000 beetles paid tribute to their ancestors : they again had chrome parts , white-walled tyres and were painted light blue or cream-white – just like the successful models of the 1950s .
today , the iconic car lives on in its successor model , the new beetle . henrik böhme -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw postpones expansion due to scandal the bribery scandal at german auto giant volkswagen has led chairman bernd pischetsrieder to postpone making a decision on the planned construction of a new factory in india .

it was meant to be a car that was simple to build , cheap to buy and economical to maintain .
on july 3 , 1935 , after a year of development work , porsche presented the first prototype . " porsche has constructed a saloon car , an open car and a convertible that uses six to seven liters of fuel every 100 kilometers -lrb- 60 miles -rrb- at a speed of 100 kph and costs only 990 marks , " the weekly news show at the movie theater reported at the time . another three years passed before the car was ready for production .
then , on may 28 , 1938 , near the town of fallersleben , adolf hitler laid the foundation stone for the volkswagen factory and with it for the town of wolfsburg . " today we are standing on the huge site of the volkswagen works , " a radio reporter said .
here , in accordance with the führer 's will , a gigantic factory that the world will talk about one day is to be built . " saved by the allies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the replica of herbie the love bug , the star of the wacky 1970s movie of the same name but it was not volkswagen cars but small military vehicles for hitler 's campaign of destruction that were assembled in the highly modern factory .
at the end of the war , the volkswagen factory , like most other german factories , was in ruins .
but it was saved from the fate of dismantlement by the allies .
on the contrary - the britons developed a soft spot for the beetle . " at the former volkswagen plant at fallersleben , cars are again being mass-produced , " went a news report .
" some 18,000 workers are in the factory and its subsidiary plants .
orders and raw materials have been secured for a long time .
the cars will at first be distributed by the military authorities to the departments of the occupying powers and to vital german companies . " a global icon bildunterschrift : beetle at the beach only then did the success story of the vw beetle begin in earnest .
in a matter of 10 years - between 1945 and 1955 - one million vehicles were produced .
in 1972 , the 15-million mark was reached , making the vw beetle the world 's biggest-selling car . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the very last vw beetle is decorated with a wreath of roses and a message on its windscreen which reads " volkswagen of mexico last sedan in the world , july 30 , 2003 " as it rolls off the production line at vw 's puebla plant .
but just a few years later , the beginning of the end had started for the global icon of affordable mobility after world war ii .
no more beetles were manufactured in germany after 1978 and vw gradually also halted production in factories abroad .
everywhere except puebla in mexico , where the cars rolled off the production line until the year 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new beetle : less noisy , more stylish the last 2,000 beetles paid tribute to their ancestors : they again had chrome parts , white-walled tyres and were painted light blue or cream-white – just like the successful models of the 1950s .
today , the iconic car lives on in its successor model , the new beetle . henrik böhme -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de vw postpones expansion due to scandal the bribery scandal at german auto giant volkswagen has led chairman bernd pischetsrieder to postpone making a decision on the planned construction of a new factory in india .

pischetsrieder has put the building plans on ice until the allegations of bribes in connection with the construction of the plant have been cleared up , the newspaper said , quoting sources close to suppliers . berlin daily tagesspiegel reported that the planned construction of an assembly plant in angola had also been put on hold in the wake of the scandal .
both papers said vw had declined to comment on the information .
the scandal , triggered by the shock resignation last month of the personnel chief at vw 's czech arm skoda , helmuth schuster , looks set to snowball in what threatens to deal a fresh blow to the image of europe 's biggest car maker just as it is beginning to steer itself out a long crisis .
vw is hiring independent auditors kpmg to review the situation .
schuster last month quit amid allegations he took bribes from potential suppliers and claims in magazine reports that he used camouflage companies to secure lucrative vw contracts abroad , notably india and angola .
but the scandal looked set to widen last week when the long-serving head of vw 's general works council , klaus volkert , also announced he was stepping down nine months earlier than planned .
the online version of der spiegel magazine alleged that volkert was also involved in schuster 's dubious dealings .
wirtschaftswoche weekly claimed volkert was simply the " tip of the iceberg " and more resignations would follow , including that of vw 's head of personnel , peter hartz . dw-world.de vw faces bribery scandal the head of the general works council at german car giant volkswagen has stepped down in the midst of an alleged bribery scandal , while rumors about the larger scope of the affair begin to circulate .

in the south wales police area , thefts of this type account for up to 12 % of crimes and figures were on the rise .
in 2004 , more than 18,000 mobile phones were reported stolen , lost or taken in robberies in south wales alone .
police said that represented an estimated loss of more than £ 1m and thousands of phones are never returned .
many of those recovered by the force can not be returned to their rightful owners because no-one knows who they are .
they are either destroyed , donated to charities , or stored away .
database south wales police has now started subscribing to a uk-wide data base designed to match phones with their rightful owners .
in areas like london and greater manchester , which have been subscribing to the database for some time , the detection rate for mobile phone crime has increased by 30 % .
south wales police are now urging phone users to register their numbers with the database to give themselves greater protection .
users can register their details on the national mobile phone register free of charge .
about 328 mobile phones are stolen in london every day earlier this year , it was revealed that legislation to prevent mobile phones from being doctored would be introduced under the government 's forthcoming violent crime bill .
the home office said the new law would make it easier to arrest people for reprogramming stolen mobiles so they can be used again .
an average of 328 mobile phones are stolen in london alone every day - half of them from under-18s .
the violent crime bill also has measures to tackle yob behaviour and knife crime , which are aim to reduce the numbers of street robberies and mobile phone thefts .
the bill will make it illegal to offer or agree to reprogramme a phone , rather than the act of doing it .
the new law will be similar to those preventing ticket touts offering tickets for resale .

the new law will be similar to those preventing ticket touts offering tickets for resale .
a home office spokeswoman said : " we want to tighten up the legislation on it to try to prevent the doctoring of stolen mobiles . "

the washing machine-sized " impactor " collided with comet tempel 1 at a relative speed of 37,000km / h , throwing up a huge plume of icy debris .
the probe 's mothership , the deep impact spacecraft , watched the event from a safe distance , sending images to earth .
" we hit it just exactly where we wanted to , " said an ecstatic dr don yeomans , a nasa mission scientist .
" the impact was bigger than i expected , and bigger than most of us expected .
we 've got all the data we could possibly ask for . "
comets - giant " dirty snowballs " , as some have called them - are believed to contain materials that have remained largely unchanged since the formation of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago .
scientists hope that by getting " under the skin " of comet tempel 1 , they can gain new information on the solar system 's original composition and perhaps even how life emerged in our corner of the universe .
waiting for the crash agency staff working on the $ 333m mission cheered , clapped and hugged when the first pictures of the impact came through to the control room at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory -lrb- jpl -rrb- in california .
animated guide : deep impact dr charles elachi , director of jpl , said : " from the beginning , i said this was one of the most daring missions and now we have success . "
" we are in the business of opening new frontiers in the exploration of space .
when we analyse the data , we will have a whole new insight into the universe . "
the collision occurred at just after 0550 gmt at a distance of about 133 million km from earth .
heading for impact : the comet 's surface was seen by the probe to within seconds of the crash the 370kg probe was released from the deep impact spacecraft on sunday , and essentially waited to be runover by the comet , as the mothership stood back at some 500km with its cameras rolling .
in the moments before impact , the probe itself relayed pictures of the looming 14km-wide mass of ice , dust and rock .
large circular craters could be seen on the comet 's surface .
the impactor 's last image was sent just three seconds before impact .
it will take a few days for all the data from deep impact 's observations to download , and scientists will then spend several months interpreting it .
all vantage points researchers were uncertain as to the size of scar their impactor would leave on the comet .
it was conjectured to be anywhere from the size of a large house to a football stadium and between two and 14 storeys deep .
delight at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory their studies will have the benefit of pictures taken by a range of different telescopes around earth .
some of the biggest and most expensive instruments were deployed , including the hubble space observatory in its orbit above the planet , and the world 's largest optical telescope facility , the vlt in chile .
uk planetary scientist dr monica grady , from the open university , watched a feed of the deep impact images sent down to earth .
" it 's absolutely fantastic to see this , " she said .
" before we knew so little about the comet nucleus ; we had little idea of what the surface looked like .

we 're going to get so much out of this . "
and professor iwan williams , from queen mary , university of london , who is working on europe 's rosetta mission to a comet , was also taken aback by the scale of the event .

it was conjectured to be anywhere from the size of a large house to a football stadium and between two and 14 storeys deep .
their studies will have the benefit of pictures taken by a range of different telescopes around earth .
some of the biggest and most expensive instruments were deployed , including the hubble space observatory in its orbit above the planet , and the world 's largest optical telescope facility , the vlt in chile .
uk planetary scientist dr monica grady , from the open university , watched a feed of the deep impact images sent down to earth .
" it 's absolutely fantastic to see this , " she said .
" before we knew so little about the comet nucleus ; we had little idea of what the surface looked like .
have your say " i 'm not so sure of the benefits that this expensive line of research will prove / disprove " colin grant , manchester , uk send us your comments " we now have these high-resolution images and can compare this crater against natural ones .
we 're going to get so much out of this . "
and professor iwan williams , from queen mary , university of london , who is working on europe 's rosetta mission to a comet , was also taken aback by the scale of the event .
" it was like a mosquito hitting a 747 .
what we 've found is that the mosquito did n't splat on the surface ; it 's actually gone through the windscreen . "

supplies of water are being drawn from a contingency reserve for the first time in eight years because of low levels of rainfall .
the below-average rainfall over the past eight months has equated to the driest period since 1976 .
thames water said it had replaced 140 miles of mains pipes in an attempt to preserve what water there was .
the company plans to replace a further 850 miles between now and 2009 to stop leaks .
richard aylard , of thames water , told bbc news : " we have n't had a hosepipe ban in the thames area for the past 15 years .
a lot of people have worked hard to make and maintain that situation and we hope we can prevent one this time but i have to say it 's looking more and more likely .

" it depends how much rainfall we get and it depends how much water we can draw from elsewhere , but we think there 's a realistic possibility of a hosepipe ban by august . "

armando valdez , a 27-year-old air force sergeant , was detained on sunday , local police said .
he denied the allegations .
incidents involving us troops and islanders are particularly sensitive because of a 1995 case when three us servicemen raped a schoolgirl .
us forces are to be realigned in japan , and some okinawans hope the us presence on their island will be reduced .
but other islanders say the us bases provide welcome jobs and income in what is japan 's poorest prefecture .
according to an official at okinawa police department , mr valdez was arrested on " charges of indecent assault on a 10 year-old girl " .
" the suspect allegedly forced the victim to roll her upper clothes up and fondled her breasts , " a police spokesman told the french news agency afp .
a spokesman for the japanese government , chief cabinet secretary hiroyuki hosoda , said he was holding discussions with us officials to ensure such an incident was not repeated .
okinawa 's governor keiichi inamine , who has previously campaigned for a reduction in the number of us troops in the region , said he " ca n't help concluding there is a problem in the us military 's discipline " .
colonel victor warzinski , a spokesman for us forces in japan , said : " we believe this type of alleged behaviour is completely unacceptable . "
the united states stations approximately 45,000 troops in japan , more than half of whom are based on the small island of okinawa .
the us sees the okinawa bases , located within striking distance of china and the korean peninsula , as essential for its security strategy in asia and the pacific region .
but some local residents resent what they see as an unfair burden which the long-standing us-japan military alliance places on the island .

the event , in st james 's park , is intended to give visitors a flavour of what life was like in wartime britain .
this week has been nominated veterans awareness week as it falls midway between ve day and vj day .
defence secretary john reid told bbc news it was vital the sacrifices made by wartime veterans were not forgotten .
heroism the museum in st james 's park is particularly aimed at young people , in the hope memories from the past can be kept alive .
visitors will learn about some of the experiences of the wartime generation - such as air raids , black-outs and code breaking .
the royal mail is celebrating veterans awareness week on tuesday by issuing a new first class stamp showing st paul 's cathedral during the blitz .
it is about learning ... just why it is necessary to take a stand and the terrible consequences if we do not do that soon enough john reid veterans week events next sunday -lrb- 10 july -rrb- has been nominated national commemoration day .
events will include a service of thanksgiving and a flypast of second world war vintage aircraft .
at the end of the day , with the queen standing on the buckingham palace balcony , a lancaster bomber will drop a million poppies onto the mall in memory of those who died .
mr reid said the aim of veterans awareness week was for people across the country to participate and learn about the events of 60 years ago .
he said : " this is not just a commemoration - although it is - for the glory and heroism of all the men and women who lived through some of the hardest times imaginable .
" it is the passing on of remembrance , it is about learning so that we can truly understand , as the next generation , just why it is necessary to take a stand and the terrible consequences if we do not do that soon enough . "
commando raid the week 's celebrations follow a re-enactment of a 1941 raid by veteran british commandos on the island of vaagso , western norway , on sunday .
the raid followed winston churchill 's vow the previous year to take the war to german-occupied europe .
there was an emotional reunion when one commando gave a pair of gloves to a family he " borrowed " a pair of mittens from 64 years ago .
sniper charles stacey was suffering in the bitter cold of the norwegian winter in the december raid .
he said : " as a sniper , i had problems keeping my fingers warm .
then i spotted on the christmas tree a pair of mittens .
they saved the day .
" i kept those mittens with me through the war but i always felt guilty that i had stolen some innocent person 's christmas present . "
veteran 's amazement he bought a new pair of gloves in case he was able to track down the family whose house he had passed through .
but he was amazed when he knocked at the house to find the family still lived there .
anne osmundsvaag and her brother andreas wept as they recalled the raid .
" suddenly the house was invaded by soldiers and the mark on the windowsill where charles rested his sniper rifle is still there , " said anne , now 67 .
andreas added : " when the soldiers left they formed two careful lines to escort us out to safety .
we are very , very appreciative for what they did and we are deeply honoured that charles has returned to us the little gift he took for all the right reasons 64 years ago . "

events will include a service of thanksgiving and a flypast of second world war vintage aircraft .
at the end of the day , with the queen standing on the buckingham palace balcony , a lancaster bomber will drop a million poppies onto the mall in memory of those who died .
mr reid said the aim of veterans awareness week was for people across the country to participate and learn about the events of 60 years ago .
he said : " this is not just a commemoration - although it is - for the glory and heroism of all the men and women who lived through some of the hardest times imaginable .
" it is the passing on of remembrance , it is about learning so that we can truly understand , as the next generation , just why it is necessary to take a stand and the terrible consequences if we do not do that soon enough . "
commando raid the week 's celebrations follow a re-enactment of a 1941 raid by veteran british commandos on the island of vaagso , western norway , on sunday .
the raid followed winston churchill 's vow the previous year to take the war to german-occupied europe .
there was an emotional reunion when one commando gave a pair of gloves to a family he " borrowed " a pair of mittens from 64 years ago .
sniper charles stacey was suffering in the bitter cold of the norwegian winter in the december raid .
he said : " as a sniper , i had problems keeping my fingers warm .
then i spotted on the christmas tree a pair of mittens .
they saved the day .
" i kept those mittens with me through the war but i always felt guilty that i had stolen some innocent person 's christmas present . "
veteran 's amazement he bought a new pair of gloves in case he was able to track down the family whose house he had passed through .
but he was amazed when he knocked at the house to find the family still lived there .
anne osmundsvaag and her brother andreas wept as they recalled the raid .
" suddenly the house was invaded by soldiers and the mark on the windowsill where charles rested his sniper rifle is still there , " said anne , now 67 .
andreas added : " when the soldiers left they formed two careful lines to escort us out to safety .
we are very , very appreciative for what they did and we are deeply honoured that charles has returned to us the little gift he took for all the right reasons 64 years ago . "

the event , in st james 's park , is intended to give visitors a flavour of what life was like in wartime britain .
this week has been nominated veterans awareness week as it falls midway between ve day and vj day .
defence secretary john reid told bbc news it was vital the sacrifices made by wartime veterans were not forgotten .
heroism the museum in st james 's park is particularly aimed at young people , in the hope memories from the past can be kept alive .
visitors will learn about some of the experiences of the wartime generation - such as air raids , black-outs and code breaking .
the royal mail is celebrating veterans awareness week on tuesday by issuing a new first class stamp showing st paul 's cathedral during the blitz . "
it is about learning ... just why it is necessary to take a stand and the terrible consequences if we do not do that soon enough " john reid veterans week events next sunday -lrb- 10 july -rrb- has been nominated national commemoration day .
events will include a service of thanksgiving and a flypast of second world war vintage aircraft .
at the end of the day , with the queen standing on the buckingham palace balcony , a lancaster bomber will drop a million poppies onto the mall in memory of those who died .
mr reid said the aim of veterans awareness week was for people across the country to participate and learn about the events of 60 years ago .
he said : " this is not just a commemoration - although it is - for the glory and heroism of all the men and women who lived through some of the hardest times imaginable .
" it is the passing on of remembrance , it is about learning so that we can truly understand , as the next generation , just why it is necessary to take a stand and the terrible consequences if we do not do that soon enough . "
commando raid the week 's celebrations follow a re-enactment of a 1941 raid by veteran british commandos on the island of vaagso , western norway , on sunday .
the raid followed winston churchill 's vow the previous year to take the war to german-occupied europe .
there was an emotional reunion when one commando gave a pair of gloves to a family he " borrowed " a pair of mittens from 64 years ago .

and why should there , you may ask ?
compared to the impact and influence groups such as the irish , italians and spanish , the welsh appear to fade into insignificance .
well , you only have to scratch the surface of us history to discover why the welsh-american links are something far stronger and worthy of some celebration .
for starters , the welsh were by far the largest ethnic group involved in the drawing up of the american constitution , and it was welsh descendant thomas jefferson who wrote the declaration of independence .
little wonder then that george washington declared " good welshman make good americans " .
anthony hopkins and catherine zeta jones are leading the welsh in the us so as american wakes up to independence day on monday , the bbc wales news website sets out the reasons for this and examines if there is a welsh influence in modern-day usa .
you only have to glance at a map of the us to spot umpteen towns and villages called wales , stretching across alaska , utah , maine , michigan and new york .
alternatively , you could visit swansea , pembroke , penrhyn , flint or neath , or even bryn mawr , cambria , barry , bala or cardiff by the sea .
bill jones from cardiff university said it was impossible to put a precise figure on how many welsh people emigrated to the us as no official records were kept .
but he said a census at the end of the 19th century , which claimed 100,000 people in america were born in wales , was probably wrong , and the real figure could be closer to 200,000 .
wales in wisconsin celebrates its roots on its roadsigns why then , is there so little awareness of what welsh settlers achieved in the us .
in 1971 , thomas m rees addressed the house of representatives in an attempt to redress the balance .
" mr speaker , very little has been written of what the welsh have contributed in all walks of life in the shaping of american history , " he said .
" twenty percent of the pilgrim fathers were welsh , as was the captain of the mayflower .
" how many know that nine welsh presidents were welsh or of welsh descent ? "
and it does not stop there .
in industry , miners from south wales set up the tredegar ironworks in richmond , virginia , which played a key role in the civil war , while david thomas - from neath - became known as the iron master of america and joshua humphreys founded the us navy .
welsh soldiers were also at the front , quite literally , in the civil war , with prominent generals of welsh descent on both sides of the conflict .
so why do the welsh struggle for recognition in the us ?
' low visibility ' one of the main differences is simple maths - the numbers of irish and italian settlers far outweighed the numbers of welsh quakers or miners who crossed the atlantic .
dr arturo roberts , editor of the north american welsh newspaper ninnau , explained why the numbers were against them .
" there are 20 people of irish descent for every one with welsh descent - that makes a big difference , " he said .
places called wales in the us nome , alaska montgomery , iowa pike , kentucky hampden , massachusetts sanpete , utah lake , minnesota cavalier , north dakota giles , tennessee waukesha , wisconsin st clair county , michigan androscoggin , maine erie , new york " most people do n't know about wales - it is not as important as the irish .
on 17 march -lsb- st patrick 's day -rsb- , everyone is irish , but it is not the same on 1 march -lsb- st david 's day -rsb- .
" the welsh have low visibility . "
another reason for this " low visibility " seems to be the way that welsh people integrated themselves into their new society , with george washington himself saying : " good welshmen make good americans " .
howard stringer , who was born in barry , headed sony in america before taking over as the firm 's chief executive .
he told the bbc wales programme star spangled dragon that the welsh disappeared as part of the " immigrant experience " .
" the welsh slipped very easily into the us , " he said .
" you can find welsh people all over the place , but the welsh have never tried to sell themselves on the international stage like the irish . "
american dream professor john roper , from the american studies department at the university of wales , swansea , agreed .
" the welsh went over and spread out -the language was lost pretty soon - they seemed keen to lose themselves rather that assert their culture , " he said .
sony ceo howard stringer said the welsh slipped easily into the us " they bought into the american dream . "
philip davies , president of the north welsh american foundation , said that welsh communities were getting further and further away from their roots .
" it is truly amazing as to how many places across the us have welsh names , " he said .
" they were given 100-200 years ago , but the communities have evolved to have little or no link with when they were named .
the welshness of places is being diluted . "
they may be diluted , but some are less diluted than others .
one of the strongest communities still going is in a place called bangor in pennsylvania , which was established by slate miners from north wales .
pennsylvania itself is one of the areas with the biggest links to wales , when william penn started bringing welsh quakers across the atlantic with the promise of a new life , free from persecution .
welsh influence can still be seen in some communities john reinhart , the president of the st david 's welsh society in bangor , said his ancestors had brought " a very very strong feeling of the welsh identity " to the area .
" the other thing is they had a lot of people who were very community-minded and keen to keep the traditions , " he said .
" the welshness they carried here was carried in their hearts - they truly retained their identity . "
although the town 's welsh day ended in 1975 , events including st david 's day celebrations and an annual gymanfa ganu -lrb- singing festivals -rrb- are still held there .
mr reinhart said that the latest resurgence began 12 years ago , when the next generation ganged together to preserve the traditions so important to their ancestors .
as for the rest of the us , the mantle of keeping wales in the front line has passed to actors like catherine zeta jones and anthony hopkins .

by david loyn bbc news tony blair is much closer to agreement on a plan for africa at gleneagles than he is on climate change .
africa could again end up sidelined after this weeks events his ambitions for africa are underpinned by the serious , intellectual approach of the commission for africa , which engaged the energy of bob geldof and an invited group of african leaders , bankers and others during the last year .
the challenges are enormous .
if nothing changes , it would take africa 150 years to reach the poverty reduction targets agreed in the optimism of the un millennium summit five years ago .
the relationship between the british government with rock stars and lobbyists in the run-up to the g8 meeting has been unique .
ministers have not only urged people to go out on the streets and protest , but have joined the rallies .
and in one of the most successful pieces of public relations in modern times , the lobbyists around geldof and bono have succeeded in fixing a kind of brand recognition for the solutions - debt , aid , and trade .
bono 's pressure group is even called data -lrb- the last " a " for africa -rrb- .
debt relief so what will the g8 achieve ?
on debt and aid , the key agreements have already been secured .
the poorest 18 countries will have their debts completely written off by the imf and world bank as well as individual countries , while the debt relief scheme is being extended more widely .
africa 's most populous country nigeria , which had not qualified before , has convinced lenders in the last few days that it has done enough to combat corruption to earn the relief of some of its bad debts .
securing an agreement on fairer trade terms for africa will be much harder on aid , there was announcement by president bush last week that he will double aid to africa by 2010 .
this follows similar recent pledges by italy and germany and should secure the extra $ 25bn -lrb- £ 14.2bn -rrb- a year for africa sought by the africa commission .
-lrb- britain and france had already agreed to pay their share -rrb- .

securing an agreement on fairer trade terms for africa will be much harder .
the aim is to cut world farm subsidies , so that african farmers could trade on fair terms , while lowering tariffs , and improving capacity in africa to compete .
the european union has gone some way to reforming its system , cutting some subsidies and transferring others so that farmers are rewarded for preserving the environment rather than production .
but britain is pushing for far deeper cuts .
slugging match international development secretary hilary benn said in a recent speech : " europe can not lead the world on development when its trade and agriculture policies undermine developing countries ' ability to trade their way out of poverty . "
this argument has hardly begun in america and japan , which both pay large subsidies to farmers , backed up by powerful lobbies .
but there is a danger that at gleneagles they may be on the sidelines , while britain and france engage in a domestic slugging match over european subsidies .
the likely outcome in the final communiqué is a statement rich in rhetoric but low on detail .

by david loyn bbc news tony blair is much closer to agreement on a plan for africa at gleneagles than he is on climate change .
africa could again end up sidelined after this weeks events his ambitions for africa are underpinned by the serious , intellectual approach of the commission for africa , which engaged the energy of bob geldof and an invited group of african leaders , bankers and others during the last year .
the challenges are enormous .
if nothing changes , it would take africa 150 years to reach the poverty reduction targets agreed in the optimism of the un millennium summit five years ago .
the relationship between the british government with rock stars and lobbyists in the run-up to the g8 meeting has been unique .
ministers have not only urged people to go out on the streets and protest , but have joined the rallies .
and in one of the most successful pieces of public relations in modern times , the lobbyists around geldof and bono have succeeded in fixing a kind of brand recognition for the solutions - debt , aid , and trade .
bono 's pressure group is even called data -lrb- the last " a " for africa -rrb- .
debt relief so what will the g8 achieve ?
on debt and aid , the key agreements have already been secured .
the poorest 18 countries will have their debts completely written off by the imf and world bank as well as individual countries , while the debt relief scheme is being extended more widely .
africa 's most populous country nigeria , which had not qualified before , has convinced lenders in the last few days that it has done enough to combat corruption to earn the relief of some of its bad debts .
securing an agreement on fairer trade terms for africa will be much harder on aid , there was announcement by president bush last week that he will double aid to africa by 2010 .
this follows similar recent pledges by italy and germany and should secure the extra $ 25bn -lrb- £ 14.2bn -rrb- a year for africa sought by the africa commission .
-lrb- britain and france had already agreed to pay their share -rrb- .
trade reform the final communiqué from gleneagles will make robust commitments on aid for the first time .
securing an agreement on fairer trade terms for africa will be much harder .
the aim is to cut world farm subsidies , so that african farmers could trade on fair terms , while lowering tariffs , and improving capacity in africa to compete .
the european union has gone some way to reforming its system , cutting some subsidies and transferring others so that farmers are rewarded for preserving the environment rather than production .
but britain is pushing for far deeper cuts .
slugging match international development secretary hilary benn said in a recent speech : " europe can not lead the world on development when its trade and agriculture policies undermine developing countries ' ability to trade their way out of poverty . "
this argument has hardly begun in america and japan , which both pay large subsidies to farmers , backed up by powerful lobbies .
but there is a danger that at gleneagles they may be on the sidelines , while britain and france engage in a domestic slugging match over european subsidies .
the likely outcome in the final communiqué is a statement rich in rhetoric but low on detail .
this will make it easier for the developed world to avoid concessions in the next round of negotiations of the world trade organisation in hong kong in december , although this is billed as the " round for the developing world " .
